      <h1>Adding dynamic features to an aggressively cached website</h1>

(date: 2026-01-28)
      <p>
      <p>My blog uses aggressive caching: it sits behind Cloudflare with a 15 minute cache header, which guarantees it can survive even the largest traffic spike to any given page. I've recently added a couple of dynamic features that work in spite of that full-page caching. Here's how those work.</p>
<h4>Edit links that are visible only to me</h4>
<p>This is a Django site and I manage it through the Django admin.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/b8066f870a94d149f5e8cee6e787d3377c0b9507/blog/models.py#L254-L449">four types of content</a> - entries, link posts (aka blogmarks), quotations and notes. Each of those has a different model and hence a different Django admin area.</p>
<p>I wanted an &quot;edit&quot; link on the public pages that was only visible to me.</p>
<p>The button looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/edit-link.jpg" alt="Entry footer - it says Posted 27th January 2026 at 9:44 p.m. followed by a square Edit button with an icon."></p>
<p>I solved conditional display of this button with <code>localStorage</code>. I have a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/b8066f870a94d149f5e8cee6e787d3377c0b9507/templates/base.html#L89-L105">tiny bit of JavaScript</a> which checks to see if the <code>localStorage</code> key <code>ADMIN</code> is set and, if it is, displays an edit link based on a data attribute:</p>
<pre><code>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =&gt; {
  if (window.localStorage.getItem('ADMIN')) {
    document.querySelectorAll('.edit-page-link').forEach(el =&gt; {
      const url = el.getAttribute('data-admin-url');
      if (url) {
        const a = document.createElement('a');
        a.href = url;
        a.className = 'edit-link';
        a.innerHTML = '&lt;svg&gt;...&lt;/svg&gt; Edit';
        el.appendChild(a);
        el.style.display = 'block';
      }
    });
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to see my edit links you can run this snippet of JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>localStorage.setItem('ADMIN', '1');
</code></pre>
<p>My Django admin dashboard has <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/b8066f870a94d149f5e8cee6e787d3377c0b9507/templates/admin/index.html#L18-L39">a custom checkbox</a> I can click to turn this option on and off in my own browser:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/edit-toggle.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Tools settings panel with a teal header reading &quot;Tools&quot; followed by three linked options: &quot;Bulk Tag Tool - Add tags to multiple items at once&quot;, &quot;Merge Tags - Merge multiple tags into one&quot;, &quot;SQL Dashboard - Run SQL queries against the database&quot;, and a checked checkbox labeled &quot;Show &quot;Edit&quot; links on public pages&quot;"></p>
<h4>Random navigation within a tag</h4>
<p>Those admin edit links are a very simple pattern. A more interesting one is a feature I added recently for navigating randomly within a tag.</p>
<p>Here's an animated GIF showing those random tag navigations in action ( <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tag/ai-ethics/">try it here</a>):</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/random-by-tag.gif" alt="Animated demo. Starts on the ai-ethics tag page where a new Random button sits next to the feed icon. Clicking that button jumps to a post with that tag and moves the button into the site header - clicking it multiple times jumps to more random items."></p>
<p>On any of my blog's tag pages you can click the &quot;Random&quot; button to bounce to a random post with that tag. That random button then persists in the header of the page and you can click it to continue bouncing to random items in that same tag.</p>
<p>A post can have multiple tags, so there needs to be a little bit of persistent magic to remember which tag you are navigating and display the relevant button in the header.</p>
<p>Once again, this uses <code>localStorage</code>. Any click to a random button records both the tag and the current timestamp to the <code>random_tag</code> key in <code>localStorage</code> before redirecting the user to the <code>/random/name-of-tag/</code> page, which selects a random post and redirects them there.</p>
<p>Any time a new page loads, JavaScript checks if that <code>random_tag</code> key has a value that was recorded within the past 5 seconds. If so, that random button is appended to the header.</p>
<p>This means that, provided the page loads within 5 seconds of the user clicking the button, the random tag navigation will persist on the page.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/b8066f870a94d149f5e8cee6e787d3377c0b9507/templates/base.html#L106-L147">see the code for that here</a>.</p>
<h4>And the prompts</h4>
<p>I built the random tag feature entirely using Claude Code for web, prompted from my iPhone. I started with the <code>/random/TAG/</code> endpoint ( <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?2e7de58a779271aa5eb6f4abcd412d72/index.html">full transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build /random/TAG/ - a page which picks a random post (could be an entry or blogmark or note or quote) that has that tag and sends a 302 redirect to it, marked as no-cache so Cloudflare does not cache it</p>
<p>Use a union to build a list of every content type (a string representing the table out of the four types) and primary key for every item tagged with that tag, then order by random and return the first one</p>
<p>Then inflate the type and ID into an object and load it and redirect to the URL</p>
<p>Include tests - it should work by setting up a tag with one of each of the content types and then running in a loop calling that endpoint until it has either returned one of each of the four types or it hits 1000 loops at which point fail with an error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not like that solution, some of my tags have thousands of items</p>
<p>Can we do something clever with a CTE?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/b8066f870a94d149f5e8cee6e787d3377c0b9507/blog/views.py#L737-L762">something clever with a CTE</a> solution we ended up with.</p>
<p>For the &quot;Random post&quot; button ( <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?d2d3abe380080ceb9e7fb854fa197bff/index.html">transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at most recent commit, then modify the /tags/xxx/ page to have a &quot;Random post&quot; button which looks good and links to the /random/xxx/ page</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put it before not after the feed icon. It should only display if a tag has more than 5 posts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, the <code>localStorage</code> implementation that persists a random tag button in the header ( <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?8405b84f8e53738c8d4377b2e41dcdef/page-001.html">transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Review the last two commits. Make it so clicking the Random button on a tag page sets a localStorage value for random_tag with that tag and a timestamp. On any other page view that uses the base item template add JS that checks for that localStorage value and makes sure the timestamp is within 5 seconds. If it is within 5 seconds it adds a &quot;Random name-of-tag&quot; button to the little top navigation bar, styled like the original Random button, which bumps the localStorage timestamp and then sends the user to /random/name-of-tag/ when they click it. In this way clicking &quot;Random&quot; on a tag page will send the user into an experience where they can keep clicking to keep surfing randomly in that topic.</p>

      <h1>The Five Levels: from Spicy Autocomplete to the Dark Factory</h1>

(date: 2026-01-28)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2026/01/the-five-levels-from-spicy-autocomplete-to-the-software-factory/">The Five Levels: from Spicy Autocomplete to the Dark Factory</a></strong></p>
<p>Dan Shapiro proposes a five level model of AI-assisted programming, inspired by the five (or rather six, it's zero-indexed) <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2022-05/Level-of-Automation-052522-tag.pdf">levels of driving automation</a>.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li><strong>Spicy autocomplete</strong>, aka original GitHub Copilot or copying and pasting snippets from ChatGPT.</li>
<li>The <strong>coding intern</strong>, writing unimportant snippets and boilerplate with full human review.</li>
<li>The <strong>junior developer</strong>, pair programming with the model but still reviewing every line.</li>
<li>The <strong>developer</strong>. Most code is generated by AI, and you take on the role of full-time code reviewer.</li>
<li>The <strong>engineering team</strong>. You're more of an engineering manager or product/program/project manager. You collaborate on specs and plans, the agents do the work.</li>
<li>The <strong>dark software factory</strong>, like a factory run by robots where the lights are out because robots don't need to see.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dan says about that last category:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At level 5, it's not really a car any more. You're not really running anybody else's software any more. And your software process isn't really a software process any more. It's a black box that turns specs into software.</p>
<p>Why Dark? Maybe you've heard of the Fanuc Dark Factory, <a href="https://www.organizedergi.com/News/5493/robots-the-maker-of-robots-in-fanuc-s-dark-factory">the robot factory staffed by robots</a>. It's dark, because it's a place where humans are neither needed nor welcome.</p>
<p>I know a handful of people who are doing this. They're small teams, less than five people. And what they're doing is nearly unbelievable -- and it will likely be our future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've talked to one team that's doing the pattern hinted at here. It was <em>fascinating</em>. The key characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody reviews AI-produced code, ever. They don't even look at it.</li>
<li>The goal of the system is to prove that the system works. A huge amount of the coding agent work goes into testing and tooling and simulating related systems and running demos.</li>
<li>The role of the humans is to design that system - to find new patterns that can help the agents work more effectively and demonstrate that the software they are building is robust and effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a tiny team and they stuff they had built in just a few months looked very convincing to me. Some of them had 20+ years of experience as software developers working on systems with high reliability requirements, so they were not approaching this from a naive perspective.</p>
<p>I'm hoping they come out of stealth soon because I can't really share more details than this.</p>

And it always results in stagnation because big organizations suck at shipping new ideas. For that you need a lot of people with laptops and a net connection and lot sof spare time to be able to replace small pieces, and join them up to the network, try out new ideas. When you're in a silo the owners place severe limits on what you can do. If you think you found a benevolent one, the exception -- there is no such thing. You're waiting for a &quot;some day&quot; that will never come.</p>

      <p>An idea I read in <a href="https://antirez.com/news/158">this blog post</a> is one I hadn't considered, is super important. AI is going to be part of programming forever. There's no way to go back. This has made StackExchange obsolete, because it basically aggregates everything that was there, and it was worth it because you can find things you never could find before, and it takes no time to search because it isn't really searching, it's gathered the knowledge and gives it back to you exactly as you asked for it. And when I write a piece of software using ChatGPT it presumably learns everything I learned, so it gets better and better, just like StackExchange used to, but (and here's the punchline) the knowledge is owned by a few companies, with no obligation to share what they learned. Very different from the old method, though I'm sure StackExchange wasn't obligated to share everything, the users would have found out immediately and they would have quick competition that were so obligated. (So StackExchange would change.) We get so mired in the question of should we do this -- well we're doing it, time to start looking at the next set of questions.</p>

      <p>DNS fix: <a href="https://pagepark.scripting.com/">pagepark.scripting.com</a> now redirects to the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/">GitHub repo</a> for PagePark. Somehow I lost the pagepark.io domain, but I don't really want it, so it's kind of ok. But there are some broken links. I recall there was a nice site with menus and stuff that was built from the GitHub repo but archive.org isn't able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/pagepark.io">find</a> it for some reason. Moral of the story, don't buy so many domain names thinking you're really clever. But of course I still do. Someday they'll all be gone, of course. Will they have a ceremony for the last domain to be turned off, kind of like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(Bend,_Oregon)">last</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(retailer)">Blockbuster</a> was.

      <p>For years, the open access movement has promised a more equitable world for scholarship. But as more of our publishing infrastructure is shaped—or captured—by commercial incentives, a harder question keeps surfacing: if knowledge is openly available but controlled by the same market forces as before, has anything truly changed?</p>
<p>In <em>Publishing Beyond the Market</em>, <strong>Samuel Moore</strong> challenges us to rethink open access from the ground up. Guiding our conversation is <strong>Heather Joseph</strong>, the executive director of SPARC.</p>

      <p>Recently I’ve started to move all my project to <a href="https://codeberg.org/miekg">Codeberg</a>. This is working great,
but one of the things I really missed where the git-push options from GitLab where you can create a PR just by
pushing a branch upstream.</p>
<p>Thanks to my whining about this on Mastodon I got <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@x_cli/115967604917936736">this<br>
reply</a> about an<a href="https://github.com/maxking/forgejo-create-pr">create-pr-action</a>.</p>
<p>Well, putting this all together, I right now have this script (with little, or no error checking) that does the
heavy lifting of creating a PR using Forgejo’s API. This needs an API token with read/write rights on your
repo (and only that):</p>

(date: 2026-01-27)
      <p>
      <p>NetNewsWire 7.0 for Mac is now shipping!</p>
<p>The big change from 6.2.1 is that it adopts the Liquid Glass UI and it requires macOS 26.</p>
<p>(Note to people who aren’t on macOS 26: we fixed a lot of bugs in 6.2 and 6.2.1 knowing that many people might skip, or at least delay, installing macOS 26. Also note that there’s a page where you can <a href="https://netnewswire.com/old-versions.html">get old versions of NetNewsWire</a>.)</p>
<p>To get NetNewsWire 7: in the app, in the NetNewsWire menu, do <code>Check for Updates…</code> and it will update to the new version.</p>
<p>If you’re not already running NetNewsWire, or prefer to update manually, you can <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/releases/download/mac-7.0/NetNewsWire7.0.zip">download NetNewsWire 7</a>.</p>
<h4>Feedback and support</h4>
<p>We recently switched from Slack to Discourse — we’ve got a <a href="https://discourse.netnewswire.com/">new forum</a> that doesn’t delete conversations. It’s nice!</p>
<p>And, as always, you can report bugs and make feature requests on our <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/issues">bug tracker</a>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to bookmark either of those two URLs — they’re available in NetNewsWire’s Help menu.</p>
<h4>PS iOS version coming soon</h4>
<p>We’re pretty close to being finished with the iPhone and iPad version. It too adopts the Liquid Glass UI. If you want in on the TestFlight — we appreciate help testing! — you can <a href="https://netnewswire.com/test-ios.html">sign up here</a>.</p>
<h4>PPS Screenshots</h4>
<p>Here are dark and light mode <a href="https://netnewswire.com/screenshots-mac-7.html">screenshots for NetNewsWire 7 for Mac</a>, which you’re free to use in any blog posts, social media posts, reviews, etc. (Or make your own.)</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Carney isn't a hero (and that's OK) (27 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-27)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Carney isn't a hero (and that's OK): There is nothing harder to stop than an idea whose time has come to pass. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About; AnarchistU; &quot;Monopolized&quot;; All bets are off. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Carney isn't a hero (and that's OK) (permalink) I blame novelists: it's only in prose that we get the illusion of telepathy, of being inside the mind of another. No wonder novelistic tales of political transformation focus on the moral fortitude of individual leaders. The problem is, it's a destructive lie. Sure, leaders sometimes exhibit moral fortitude and courage. But we can't rely on our leaders to be perfect – or even pretty good. The only reliable way to get the leadership we deserve is to force our leaders to follow us, by organizing in political blocs that mete out severe punishments when they betray us. Say what you will about the Tea Party, but boy, did they understand this. During the Obama years, any Republican that wavered from the party line was mercilessly tormented by Tea Party activists, who flooded their offices with calls and emails, showed up at their town halls, and at restaurants when they were trying to have dinner, and then they backed their primary opponents. The Tea Party years were a winnowing function for the GOP, and the only Republican politicians who survived were the ones who refused to compromise. This worked for them in world-historic ways. It was thanks to the Tea Party that the GOP was able to steal two Supreme Court seats, for example. Corporate Democrats use the Tea Party as an example of why we can't let the public into progressive politics. After all, corporate Dems already have control over Democratic politicians, and so any organized rank-and-file bloc threatens their ability to push elected politicians to pursue grotesque policies like supporting genocide in Gaza or showering billions on ICE: <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/seven-democrats-just-voted-to-approve-ice-funding-full-list/ar-AA1ULAn7">https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/seven-democrats-just-voted-to-approve-ice-funding-full-list/ar-AA1ULAn7</a> The seven Dems who voted to fund ICE knew that they were doing something that would be wildly unpopular with the voters who sent them to DC, but they did it anyway, because they aren't afraid of those voters. They treat their voters as ambulatory wallets to be terrorized into donating small sums via relentless text messages about the impending end of democracy in America, even as they vote for the impending end of democracy in America. These seven lawmakers don't just need to be primaried: they need to be made an example of. Their names must be a curse. They must be confronted in public – long after they are out of office – by voters brandishing pictures of the people ICE murdered after receiving the funds they voted for. They must be haunted for this decision for the rest of their days. As Voltaire said, &quot;Sometimes you must execute an admiral to encourage the others.&quot; Here are their names: Tom Suozzi (New York) Henry Cuellar (Texas) Don Davis (North Carolina) Laura Gillen (New York) Jared Golden (Maine) Vicente Gonzalez (Texas) Marie Glusenkamp Perez (Washington) <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/seven-democrats-just-voted-to-approve-ice-funding-full-list/ar-AA1ULAn7">https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/seven-democrats-just-voted-to-approve-ice-funding-full-list/ar-AA1ULAn7</a> Politicians – even the most unhinged and narcissistic ones – go through life attuned to public rage. Even Trump. Why else would Trump have ordered ICE Obergruppenführer Gregory Bovino &quot;home with his tail between his legs&quot;? <a href="https://prospect.org/2026/01/27/ice-greg-bovino-minneapolis-one-battle-after-another-sean-penn/">https://prospect.org/2026/01/27/ice-greg-bovino-minneapolis-one-battle-after-another-sean-penn/</a> Counting on politicians to do the right thing out of principle is a loser's bet. Far more reliable is to bet on them doing the right thing because they're afraid of being cursed and humiliated and haunted by their betrayal to the end of their days. Don't be fooled by politicians and pearl-clutchers insisting that the norms fairy and &quot;comity&quot; are the only way to get things done. We are not in an era of reaching across the aisle in a spirit of public service. We are in the era of fascist goons murdering our neighbors in the street and then dancing a celebratory jig. We arrived at this juncture in large part because we accepted glaring bullshit about &quot;comity&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/30/meme-stocks/#comity">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/30/meme-stocks/#comity</a> This isn't merely frustrated militancy on my part. I'm hoping that you will join me in this understanding of politics: that good leadership is downstream of politicians being terrified of betraying their duty to the public, and we need not rely on moral perfection to make progress. Take the EU's energy transition. For decades, the EU's leaders – like leaders everywhere – were in thrall to the fossil fuel industry. They were fully paid-up members of the most extreme wing of the capitalist death cult, determined to render the only planet in the known universe capable of sustaining human life uninhabitable in order to enrich a tiny coterie of already ultrawealthy climate criminals. Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and with it, a continent shivering in the dark, bereft of Russian gas and oil. Suddenly, the most powerful lobbyists in the history of civilization – fossil fuel pushers – lost their grip on Europe's leaders. In a few short years, Europe went from a decade behind its energy transition to a decade ahead: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle</a> European politicians didn't just trip and find their spines. A continent full of frozen, furious people made yielding to the fossil fuel lobby unthinkable. Once the penalties for betraying the public inarguably exceeded any conceivable benefits from selling out to Big Oil, Big Oil ate shit. Which brings me to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a man who didn't so much win office as fail to lose it, after his Conservative opponent Pierre Poilievre saw a collapse in his poll numbers the instant Donald Trump (whom Poilievre had repeatedly associated himself with during the campaign) promised to turn Canada into &quot;the 51st state.&quot; Carney is hardly an avatar of progressive politics. As Governor of the Bank of England, he presided over a program of crushing austerity. As Canadian PM, he has fired tens of thousands of civil servants while promising billions to build out national AI so that our government can be handed over to hallucinating chatbots running on processors and software that we can only buy from companies that will do Trump's bidding. Having won office with an &quot;elbows up&quot; mandate to resist Trump, Carney proceeded to cave to Trump's demands on even modest measures, such as a plan to end rampant tax cheating by the US tech giants. And yet, earlier this month, Carney travelled to the World Economic Forum in Davos to deliver an extraordinary speech that declared a &quot;rupture&quot; in the &quot;international rules-based order,&quot; an order that he simultaneously declared to have been a sham all along: <a href="https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/davos-is-a-rational-ritual">https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/davos-is-a-rational-ritual</a> This is an incredibly weird (but good!) speech for Carney to have made. Carney is the epitome of &quot;Davos Man,&quot; a technocrat with a long history of using his office and power to inflict real suffering on working people in the name of abstract economic stability. This contradiction has been the source of much opnionating about whether a) Carney is sincere about this, and b) Carney can be trusted to follow through on it. The answers to this are obvious (to me, at least): a) Who cares if he's sincere, because b) He's shown that if he's frightened enough of the public's fury at his capitulation, he will locate his spine. Which means that the future of Carney's ambitious program of &quot;rupture&quot; and bold effort to isolate Trump and the USA will depend on our ability to force him to make good on his promises. That means that we have to &quot;stand on guard&quot; – to give no ground to Canadian &quot;moderates&quot; who counsel against bold action to defend the country from Trump, lest this make Trump mad. The idea that we can strike a bargain with Trump is indisputably, profoundly stupid. Yet for the past year a sizable fraction of Canada's great and good have been able to insist, in public, that Trump will bargain with us in good faith. Trump undeniably, provably treats any concession as weakness. He will break his word in a heartbeat. The more we appease him, the more he will demand of us. Any Canadian politician or opinion-former who even hints that we can &quot;make a deal&quot; with Trump should be treated as a dangerous lunatic to be isolated and shunned (the only exception being that any time they show their faces in public, they should be relentlessly bollocked for their nation-risking program of appeasement to a fascist madman). Give Trump a centimetre and he'll take a mile. Give him two centimetres and he'll take Greenland. Give him three centimetres and he'll grab Alberta, too. Anyone who insists that Canada should confine itself to ornamental gestures of resistance to Trump (because anything that truly matters will make him mad) is a danger to themselves and the country. This all goes double for people aligned with other national parties: the way we get Carney to live up to his Davos speech is by pouncing any time he even hints that he might go back on his word, poaching his voters by campaigning on a promise to live up the Carney Doctrine (even if Carney won't). Promising to live up to Carney's Davos speech (even if Carney won't) must be the central issue in every by-election and provincial race between now and the next federal election. When we talk about politics and especially political change, there's often talk of &quot;political will.&quot; Politicians who break with their own record of weakness and compromise are said to be propelled by &quot;political will.&quot; It's all very abstract sounding, but at root, political will is something quite tangible – it's merely invisible until something gets in its way. Think of political will as something like the wind. You can't tell how windy it is outside unless there's something in the path of the wind, and then it's obvious. For the past decade, there has been a growing worldwide political will blowing for an end to corporate and billionaire power: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting</a> It's easy to feel like the project of taking our world back from oligarchs has been becalmed for decades. The political will is like the wind: we only see it when something gets in its path. After generations of Davos-style oligarch worship, there are damned few politicians who dare to unfurl a sail and aim the tiller for a world that works for working people. But every time some politician does, that sail bellies out with the wind with an audible snap. These politicians are lionized and lauded for their bravery, and any betrayal is met with bitter recriminations that go on and on and on. Any ship rigged for a better future is propelled by a wind that is a fiercer gale than any we've seen for generations. That's where we all fit in. I'm not asking you to credulously accept Carney's conversion at face value. Rather, I'm asking that you celebrate the vision that Carney articulated while threatening to destroy his political life if he breaks his word.

      <p>If you make a product for discourse, yet your own product can't be used for discourse about the product itself because of some limits, then you have a feature to add, and get busy. No product does everything everyone wants, but when there's a consensus among users, then you have something worth strongly considering.</p>

      <h1>One Human + One Agent = One Browser From Scratch</h1>

(date: 2026-01-27)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://emsh.cat/one-human-one-agent-one-browser/">One Human + One Agent = One Browser From Scratch</a></strong></p>
<p>embedding-shapes was <a href="https://emsh.cat/cursor-implied-success-without-evidence/">so infuriated</a> by the hype around Cursor's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/23/fastrender/">FastRender browser project</a> - thousands of parallel agents producing ~1.6 million lines of Rust - that they were inspired to take a go at building a web browser using coding agents themselves.</p>
<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/embedding-shapes/one-agent-one-browser">one-agent-one-browser</a> and it's <em>really</em> impressive. Over three days they drove a single Codex CLI agent to build 20,000 lines of Rust that successfully renders HTML+CSS with no Rust crate dependencies at all - though it does (reasonably) use Windows, macOS and Linux system frameworks for image and text rendering.</p>
<p>I installed the <a href="https://github.com/embedding-shapes/one-agent-one-browser/releases/tag/0.1.0">1MB macOS binary release</a> and ran it against my blog:</p>
<pre><code>chmod 755 ~/Downloads/one-agent-one-browser-macOS-ARM64
~/Downloads/one-agent-one-browser-macOS-ARM64 https://simonwillison.net/

</code></pre>
<p>Here's the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/one-agent-simonwillison.jpg" alt="My blog rendered in a window. Everything is in the right place, the CSS gradients look good, the feed subscribe SVG icon is rendered correctly but there's a missing PNG image."></p>
<p>It even rendered my SVG feed subscription icon! A PNG image is missing from the page, which looks like an intermittent bug (there's code to render PNGs).</p>
<p>The code is pretty readable too - here's <a href="https://github.com/embedding-shapes/one-agent-one-browser/blob/0.1.0/src/layout/flex.rs">the flexbox implementation</a>.</p>
<p>I had thought that &quot;build a web browser&quot; was the ideal prompt to really stretch the capabilities of coding agents - and that it would take sophisticated multi-agent harnesses (as seen in the Cursor project) and millions of lines of code to achieve.</p>
<p>Turns out one agent driven by a talented engineer, three days and 20,000 lines of Rust is enough to get a very solid basic renderer working!</p>
<p>I'm going to upgrade my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-someone-will-build-a-new-browser-using-mainly-ai-assisted-coding-and-it-won-t-even-be-a-surprise">prediction for 2029</a>: I think we're going to get a <em>production-grade</em> web browser built by a small team using AI assistance by then.</p>

Most of the world's software infrastructure is, or is based upon, open source. The developers and supporters of some of it, for example the Linux kernel, and the major compilers, are paid by technology companies because they are critical to their business. Other, less visible but similarly critical parts are supported by lone volunteers. Apart from the unfairness, this can lead to serious vulnerabilities. Back in 2018 I wrote about one such vulnerability, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/hacker-backdoors-widely-used-open-source-software-to-steal-bitcoin/">event-stream hack</a>, in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/12/securing-software-supply-chain.html"><em>Securing The Software Supply Chain</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attackers targeted a widely-used, fairly old package that was still being maintained by the original author, a volunteer. They offered to take over what had become a burdensome task, and the offer was accepted. Now, despite the fact that the attacker was just an e-mail address, they were the official maintainer of the package and could authorize changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The change they authorized included code to steal cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In 2020 I wrote a detailed post about this problem entitled <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/06/supporting-open-source-software.html"><em>Supporting Open Source Software</em></a>. Recently the topic re-surfaced on an e-mail alias I read. But what triggered the post below the fold was that this coincided with yet another fascinating piece from Matt Levine and his laugh-out-loud follow-up the next day.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/06/supporting-open-source-software.html"><em>Supporting Open Source Software</em></a> I discussed Cameron Neylon's 2017 paper on a related problem, <a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/kula.7"><em>Sustaining Scholarly Infrastructures through Collective Action: The Lessons that Olson can Teach us</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neylon starts by identifying the three possible models for the sustainability of scholarly infrastructures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infrastructures for data, such as repositories, curation systems, aggregators, indexes and standards are public goods. This means that finding sustainable economic models to support them is a challenge. This is due to free-loading, where someone who does not contribute to the support of the infrastructure nonetheless gains the benefit of it. The work of Mancur Olson (1965) suggests there are only three ways to address this for large groups: compulsion (often as some form of taxation) to support the infrastructure; the provision of non-collective (club) goods to those who contribute; or mechanisms that change the effective number of participants in the negotiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the choices for sustainability are &quot;taxation, byproduct, oligopoly&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Taxation&quot; in this context means some mechanism for compelling some or all users to pay. I summarized these choices <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/06/supporting-open-source-software.html">thus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Taxation conflicts with the &quot;free as in beer, free as in speech&quot; ethos of open source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Byproduct is, in effect, the &quot;Red Hat&quot; model of free software with paid support. Red Hat, the second place contributor to the Linux kernel and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat">worth $34B when acquired by IBM last year</a>. Others using this model may not have been quite as successful, but many have managed to survive (the <a href="https://www.lockss.org/">LOCKSS program</a> runs this way) and some to flourish (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company)">Canonical</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oligopoly is what happens in practice. Take, for example, the Linux Foundation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation">which is</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>supported by members such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco" title="Cisco">Cisco</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi" title="Hitachi">Hitachi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei" title="Huawei">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel" title="Intel">Intel</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC" title="NEC">NEC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_S.A." title="Orange S.A.">Orange S.A.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm" title="Qualcomm">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung" title="Samsung">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent" title="Tencent">Tencent</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware" title="VMware">VMware</a>, as well as developers from around the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is pretty clear the the corporate members, and especially the big contributors like Intel, have more influence than the &quot;developers from around the world&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the e-mail list my friend Chuck McManis argued for taxation, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than &quot;free&quot; software, you need &quot;community&quot; software. The users of that software are taxed proportionately to their use and the taxes are used to fund maintenance. Using a progressive tax like income tax you can adjust the cost burden from 'free' for people who are not creating value with it, they are just using it. To 'high' for people whose entire enterprise wouldn't exist if they didn't have access to it. That means and enforceable requirement to pay, and an IP protection structure that prevents theft by simple translation.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that many technologically oriented people are not thinking more deeply about macro economics as solutions to this problem where &quot;open source&quot; used to be &quot;roads&quot; or &quot;sewers&quot; or &quot;electricity wires&quot; or &quot;ship harbors&quot; were things used by everyone but needed to be paid for and maintained.</p>

My response was that Chuck's examples taught both positive and negative lessons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing that we know from long experience with the mechanisms for funding physical infrastructure like these examples is that over time they work less and less well. One only has to drive on <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/iconic-california-highway-reopened-after-nearly-3-years-here-s-why-it-closed/ar-AA1UM9cy">California roads</a> to know this is true. It is why most of the bridges in the US and elsewhere are life-expired (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern_Hollow_Bridge">Fern Hollow Bridge</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks to inflation and feature creep the cost of maintenance increases faster than politics can increase the funding for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the very next day Matt Levine's &quot;Money Stuff&quot; Bloomberg column <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2026-01-20/memecoin-venture-capital"><em>Memecoin Venture Capital</em></a> described a funding mechanism that Mancur Olson hadn't considered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You launch a project, and it has a name, The Bleebzorx Network or whatever, and it has some business plan, and if the plan works it will make money. And then you go out to investors and you say “buy some Bleebzorx Tokens if you believe in my project,” and the investors are like “oh you are a smart founder and your project sounds good, we are interested, what do we get if we buy Bleebzorx Tokens,” and you say “well you get Bleebzorx Tokens.” And the investors, if they come from traditional financial backgrounds, say “no we know we get that, but like, what economic rights do these tokens have? What is their connection to the underlying project?” And you say “oh, nothing, they are just tokens. They just have the same name as the project.” And they say “well will you share your profits from the project with the token holders,” and you say “lol absolutely not.” And they say “well then why would we pay for these tokens? Even if the project succeeds beyond our wildest expectations, why would that make the tokens worth money?” And you say: “It just will. People will be like ‘oh, the Bleebzorx Project is good, we’d better buy some Bleebzorx Tokens.’ So they’ll buy tokens and the price will go up. They won’t overthink it, so neither should you. Just buy the tokens and you’ll make money.” Loosely speaking, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-07-17/everyone-wants-a-bitcoin-treasury">these tokens are called “meme tokens</a>,” or “memecoins”: They have some memetic association with your project, but no economic rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The context for Levin's discoveryof this innovative funding mechanism <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2026-01-20/memecoin-venture-capital">was that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Jan. 1, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge">Steve Yegge</a>, a famous software developer and writer, <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04">announced a project</a> called Gas Town, which you might approximately describe as “an IDE for vibe-coding.” People <a href="https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town?_bhlid=54cb8775132cee9af2d6ceba00dcfba74b45fe72">seem</a> to <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/am-i-too-stupid-to-vibe-code">like</a> it. Yegge did not raise a bunch of money to build Gas Town; he built it himself, apparently for fun. His plans to monetize it were, as far as I can tell, quite vague, in that optimistic open-source-y “if you build something cool the money will work itself out” sort of way. (“I’ve already started to get strange offers, from people sniffing around early rumors of Gas Town, to pay me to sit at home and be myself,” he <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04">wrote</a>, though also: “I shared Gas Town with Anthropic in November.” If you build something cool in artificial intelligence these days, the money really does work itself out.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way it did &quot; work itself out&quot; was fascinating. Yegge got a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2026-01-20/memecoin-venture-capital">LinkedIn messagea</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LinkedIn message said that someone had set up a token “for” Gas Town on a crypto platform named, delightfully, <a href="https://bags.fm/">Bags</a>. The way Bags works is that anyone can set up a memecoin, and then maybe people will trade it, and if they trade it the platform will collect fees, and whoever sets up the memecoin can collect those trading fees, or direct them to whomever she wants to get them. So someone set up a Gas Town token — “<span class="math inline">\(GAS” — on Bags, and directed the fees to Yegge. Millions of dollars’ worth of \)</span>GAS traded, for some reason, generating tens of thousands of dollars of fees waiting for Yegge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yegge is a good writer and his account in <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/bags-and-the-creator-economy-249b924a621a"><em>BAGS and the Creator Economy</em></a> is worth reading in full.</p>
<p>The next day Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2026-01-21/moonshot-pay-kind-of-works"><em>returned to the story</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In describing this mechanism of financing through memecoins, I made a joke about “The Bleebzorx Network,” so of course someone launched that on Bags. The royalties (i.e. trading fees), apparently, are directed to my X account. I don’t know what that means, exactly; I assume that it means that I can collect the royalties and no one else can. I have not collected the royalties, I do not know how to collect the royalties, and I would not collect the royalties even if I could. (As of noon today they were about $9,500.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think &quot;OK, that's a good joke&quot;. But then I read on for the full <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2026-01-21/moonshot-pay-kind-of-works">ridiculous situation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>I have no involvement in this and do not endorse it. I suppose I should have anticipated that something like this would happen, but I honestly didn’t.</li>
<li>While I do not give investing advice, this is obviously dumb and I personally would not, and will not, buy any <span class="math inline">\(BLEEBZORX. In fact, I will go so far as to say that, if you do buy it, you will definitely lose 100% of the money that you put into \)</span>BLEEBZORX, and also your self-respect and the respect of your loved ones. “Ooh I bought Bleebzorx tokens,” listen to yourself.</li>
<li>I am not going to collect the royalties that are supposedly accruing in my name.</li>
<li>That said, I do understand that memecoins run on attention and that, by writing about this, I might increase its price and volume and thus the royalties. (“Allow me to get richer just by telling you about it,” Yegge wrote.) I also recognize that many of the people who emailed me to tell me about it probably own $BLEEBZORX coins and were hoping that I would write about it so the price would go up. I am writing about it for journalistic and amusement purposes, not to pump it, but I recognize that in doing so I might be pumping it.</li>
<li>I am trying not to! I really truly do not want you to go around trading $BLEEBZORX for speculation or to generate royalties for me, for a variety of reasons, including (1) I will not collect the royalties so you’re not doing me any favors, (2) the thing above about people ruining their lives by being associated with memecoins and (3) I like to think that this column is a classy establishment and I would be very embarrassed if my readers were going around falling for dumb memecoin pumps.</li>
<li>Because memecoins thrive on attention, I am not going to write about this again. I will pay no more attention to $BLEEBZORX, so you should not buy it to bet on my continued attention.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Levine understands that there is a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2026-01-20/memecoin-venture-capital">darker side to this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, for another thing, <em>Yegge eventually posted about it</em>. Not — apparently — because he had anything to do with its creation, or because it has anything to do with Gas Town. But because someone sent him a LinkedIn message about it, and the LinkedIn message promised him money, and the money was there. So he posted about it, knowing that doing so would drive attention to <span class="math inline">\(GAS, which would drive more _trading_ of \)</span>GAS, which would make him more money. “Allow me to get richer just by telling you about it,” he wrote, correctly. (As of about noon today it had <a href="https://bags.fm/7pskt3A1Zsjhngazam7vHWjWHnfgiRump916Xj7ABAGS">generated</a> more than $290,000 of earnings for him.) That’s how memecoins work! You own them, you tell people about them, you get richer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Yegge got <span class="math inline">\(290K richer by pumping \)</span>GAS. But Levine asks the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2026-01-20/memecoin-venture-capital">real question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did someone do this? Why did someone create <span class="math inline">\(GAS, and why did they (or someone else) message Yegge about it? Why did the creator allocate 99% of the trading fees to Yegge, rather than keeping them for herself? Presumably the creator gave Yegge the trading fees to (1) make it seem more legitimately connected to Gas Town and (2) entice Yegge to post about it. And presumably the creator kept, not the royalties, but a lot of \)</span>GAS coins for herself. You set up the coin, you distribute some, you keep a lot yourself, you generate some royalties, you send it to Yegge, you get him to post, the coin goes up and you sell at a profit. The [price of <span class="math inline">\(GAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gas-town/) spiked from less than \)</span>0.01 to more than <span class="math inline">\(0.04 when Yegge posted about it, peaking at a market value of about \)</span>40 million. (Then it collapsed again and now it’s back below $0.001, which is the normal fate of a memecoin.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yegge and the promoters of $GAS got richer through a classic cryptocurrency <em>rug pull</em>. David Gerard is all over this in <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2026/01/22/steve-yegges-gas-town-vibe-coding-goes-crypto-scam/">Steve Yegge’s Gas Town: Vibe coding goes crypto scam</a>. He starts with the background:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steve Yegge is a renowned software developer. He’s done this for thirty-odd years. Senior engineer at Amazon then Google, blogger on the art of programming. Yegge was highly regarded.</p>
<p>Then he got his first hit of vibe code.</p>
<p>In March 2025, Yegge ran some old game code of his full of bugs and sections saying “TO DO” through an AI coding bot — and it fixed some of them! Steve was one-shotted.</p>
<p>The decline was sudden and incurable. He even cowrote a book with Gene Kim called Vibe Coding. Well, I say “wrote” — they used a chatbot for “draft generation and draft ranking”. They vibed the book text.</p>
<p>Yegge and Kim also worked on the <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2026/01/13/if-ai-coding-is-so-good-where-are-the-performance-numbers/">DORA report on vibe coding</a>. That’s the one that took people’s self-reported feelings about AI coding and put the vibes on graphs. Complete with error bars. Vibe statistics.</p>
<p>In the book intro, Yegge straight-up says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s like playing a slot machine with infinite payout but also infinite loss potential.</p>
<p>… I’m completely addicted to this new way of coding, and I’m having the time of my life.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Generative AI is all about <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/06/05/generative-ai-runs-on-gambling-addiction-just-one-more-prompt-bro/">generating an addiction</a>, as I've been <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/07/the-selling-of-ai.html">pointing out</a> for <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/08/the-drugs-are-taking-hold.html">many months</a>. And addictions cause <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2026/01/22/steve-yegges-gas-town-vibe-coding-goes-crypto-scam/">irresponsible behavior</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gas Town is a vibe coder orchestration tool. You get a whole bunch of Claude instances and you just set them to work on your verbal specification. Yegge’s described it as “Kubernetes for agents.” I’d say Kubernetes for sorcerer’s apprentices.</p>
<p>Gas Town is a machine for spending hundreds of dollars a day on Claude Code. All the money you’ve got? Gas Town wants it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gas Town is also expensive as hell. You won’t like Gas Town if you ever have to think, even for a moment, about where money comes from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yegge’s an extremely experienced professional engineer. So he put care into Gas Town, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve never seen the code, and I never care to, which might give you pause.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, as Gerard points out, the code is probably riddled with vulerabilites that someone who does read the code can exploit. But the irresponsibility is also <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2026/01/22/steve-yegges-gas-town-vibe-coding-goes-crypto-scam/">financial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crypto bros have been pulling this scam for years. They say “please publicise our thing about you.” Then the scammer runs away with everyone’s money.</p>
<p>Developers consistently tell these scoundrels: “get outa here.” But not Steve Yegge, ’cos his brain is completely vibed: [ <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/bags-and-the-creator-economy-249b924a621a">Medium</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah, what am I, some sorta dumbass? Well yeah, actually. So I went for it.</p>
<p>… When I see a community of earnest young weird-word-using investors cheering Gas Town on, well, I hope they all get filthy rich.</p>
<p>… I’m not endorsing buying crypto, though I am very happy that people are doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bet you are.</p>

This is the whole history of the <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2026/01/22/steve-yegges-gas-town-vibe-coding-goes-crypto-scam/">scam</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GAS token was released 13 January at 1pm UTC. Yegge posted about it on 15 January at 2:45am UTC.</p>
<p>By the morning of 16 January, the price peaked at 4 cents a GAS coin! Then the scammer started dumping the tokens and taking money from the suckers. By 7am on 19 January, the GAS token had been fully pumped and dumped.</p>
<p>A couple of hours before the final dump, Yegge posted to his blog: [ <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/steveys-birthday-blog-34f437139cb5">Medium</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gas Town itself needs my full attention … So I had to step back from the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That and all the money’s gone. Vibe finance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the attention economy in action, so memecoins are a mechanism for funding open source projects if and only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a high-profile member of the community.</li>
<li>And you are comfortable living on money from degenerate gamblers.</li>
<li>And either you are happy to run pump-and-dump scams or, apparently like Yegge, are happy to front for them in return for a fraction of the take.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is that the suckers who fell for the <span class="math inline">\(GAS scam likely lost some \)</span>3M, around 90% of which ended up with the scammers and around 10% with Yegge. That's not a very efficient way to fund open source projects.</p>

      <h1>Kimi K2.5: Visual Agentic Intelligence</h1>

(date: 2026-01-27)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html">Kimi K2.5: Visual Agentic Intelligence</a></strong></p>
<p>Kimi K2 landed <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/kimi-k2/">in July</a> as a 1 trillion parameter open weight LLM. It was joined by Kimi K2 Thinking <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/kimi-k2-thinking/">in November</a> which added reasoning capabilities. Now they've made it multi-modal: the K2 models were text-only, but the new 2.5 can handle image inputs as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kimi K2.5 builds on Kimi K2 with continued pretraining over approximately 15T mixed visual and text tokens. Built as a native multimodal model, K2.5 delivers state-of-the-art coding and vision capabilities and a self-directed agent swarm paradigm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;self-directed agent swarm paradigm&quot; claim there means improved long-sequence tool calling and training on how to break down tasks for multiple agents to work on at once:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For complex tasks, Kimi K2.5 can self-direct an agent swarm with up to 100 sub-agents, executing parallel workflows across up to 1,500 tool calls. Compared with a single-agent setup, this reduces execution time by up to 4.5x. The agent swarm is automatically created and orchestrated by Kimi K2.5 without any predefined subagents or workflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used the <a href="https://openrouter.ai/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5">OpenRouter Chat UI</a> to have it &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;, and it did <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/32a85e337fbc6ee935d10d89726c0476">quite well</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/kimi-k2.5-pelican.png" alt="Cartoon illustration of a white pelican with a large orange beak and yellow throat pouch riding a green bicycle with yellow feet on the pedals, set against a light blue sky with soft bokeh circles and a green grassy hill. The bicycle frame is a little questionable. The pelican is quite good. The feet do not quite align with the pedals, which are floating clear of the frame."></p>
<p>As a more interesting test, I decided to exercise the claims around multi-agent planning with this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to build a Datasette plugin that offers a UI to upload files to an S3 bucket and stores information about them in a SQLite table. Break this down into ten tasks suitable for execution by parallel coding agents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ee2583b2eb5706400a4737f56d57c456">the full response</a>. It produced ten realistic tasks and reasoned through the dependencies between them. For comparison here's the same prompt <a href="https://claude.ai/share/df9258e7-97ba-4362-83da-76d31d96196f">against Claude Opus 4.5</a> and <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6978d48c-3f20-8006-9c77-81161f899104">against GPT-5.2 Thinking</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5">Hugging Face repository</a> is 595GB. The model uses Kimi's janky &quot;modified MIT&quot; license, which adds the following clause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our only modification part is that, if the Software (or any derivative works thereof) is used for any of your commercial products or services that have more than 100 million monthly active users, or more than 20 million US dollars (or equivalent in other currencies) in monthly revenue, you shall prominently display &quot;Kimi K2.5&quot; on the user interface of such product or service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the model's size, I expect one way to run it locally would be with MLX and a pair of $10,000 512GB RAM M3 Ultra Mac Studios. That setup has <a href="https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1943723599971443134">been demonstrated to work</a> with previous trillion parameter K2 models.</p>

First, I've done <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bluesky">more</a> than kick around with ATP for the few years, I have written apps, some of which <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">are</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.linkblog.org">still</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">deployed</a>. But I would rather continue to develop on RSS because it's not a silo, it's part of the web and imho that's where we should all be meeting. Planting seeds inside a big company's silo is not safe. If they want to shut you down, you will be shut down. They have all the power. And as long as they don't support the data format you use because of its severe limitations, you won't be able to publish on Bluesky. Imho you have no advantage using it over the web, which already does <a href="https://textcasting.org/">everything you need</a> to do your own Bluesky, with none of the missing features. As long as Leaflet docs can only be read on the web, you might as well just use the standards of the web instead of betting on Bluesky's reinventions and good intentions. My opinion. And thanks for engaging in discourse, please encourage others in your community to do it too. I get my best ideas from listening to others. That's why I watch what's going on there.</p>

      <p>The US Supreme Court is <a href="https://therecord.media/supreme-court-geofence-constitutionality">considering</a> the constitutionality of geofence warrants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The case centers on the trial of Okello Chatrie, a Virginia man who pleaded guilty to a 2019 robbery outside of Richmond and was sentenced to almost 12 years in prison for stealing $195,000 at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Police probing the crime found security camera footage showing a man on a cell phone near the credit union that was robbed and asked Google to produce anonymized location data near the robbery site so they could determine who committed the crime. They did so, providing police with subscriber data for three people, one of whom was Chatrie. Police then searched Chatrie’s home and allegedly surfaced a gun, almost $100,000 in cash and incriminating notes...</p>

      <h1>Tips for getting coding agents to write good Python tests</h1>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>Someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46765460#46765823">asked</a> on Hacker News if I had any tips for getting coding agents to write decent quality tests. Here's what I said:</p>
<hr>
<p>I work in Python which helps a lot because there are a TON of good examples of pytest tests floating around in the training data, including things like usage of fixture libraries for mocking external HTTP APIs and snapshot testing and other neat patterns.</p>
<p>Or I can say &quot;use pytest-httpx to mock the endpoints&quot; and Claude knows what I mean.</p>
<p>Keeping an eye on the tests is important. The most common anti-pattern I see is large amounts of duplicated test setup code - which isn't a huge deal, I'm much more more tolerant of duplicated logic in tests than I am in implementation, but it's still worth pushing back on.</p>
<p>&quot;Refactor those tests to use pytest.mark.parametrize&quot; and &quot;extract the common setup into a pytest fixture&quot; work really well there.</p>
<p>Generally though the best way to get good tests out of a coding agent is to make sure it's working in a project with an existing test suite that uses good patterns. Coding agents pick the existing patterns up without needing any extra prompting at all.</p>
<p>I find that once a project has clean basic tests the new tests added by the agents tend to match them in quality. It's similar to how working on large projects with a team of other developers work - keeping the code clean means when people look for examples of how to write a test they'll be pointed in the right direction.</p>
<p>One last tip I use a lot is this:</p>
<pre><code>Clone datasette/datasette-enrichments
from GitHub to /tmp and imitate the
testing patterns it uses

</code></pre>
<p>I do this all the time with different existing projects I've written - the quickest way to show an agent how you like something to be done is to have it look at an example.</p>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>A few weeks ago, I started hearing a slight crackle at the loudest parts of whenever sound was playing through my <a href="https://amzn.to/3LVd3DY">PreSonus Eris E3.5 speakers</a>. It was <em>very</em> faint, but quite annoying, especially when editing my YouTube videos.</p>

<p>For a few days I thought it could be a hearing problem (at this point in my life, every year brings a new health adventure...), but after testing my wired headphones and another small computer speaker on the same output, I determined the problem was, indeed, coming from the PreSonus speakers.</p>

      <h1>ChatGPT Containers can now run bash, pip/npm install packages, and download files</h1>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>One of my favourite features of ChatGPT is its ability to write and execute code in a container. This feature launched as ChatGPT Code Interpreter <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/12/code-interpreter/">nearly three years ago</a>, was half-heartedly rebranded to &quot;Advanced Data Analysis&quot; at some point and is generally really difficult to find detailed documentation about. Case in point: it appears to have had a <em>massive</em> upgrade at some point in the past few months, and I can't find documentation about the new capabilities anywhere!</p>
<p>Here are the most notable new features:</p>
<ol>
<li>ChatGPT can <strong>directly run Bash commands</strong> now. Previously it was limited to Python code only, although it could run shell commands via the Python <code>subprocess</code> module.</li>
<li><strong>It has Node.js</strong> and can run JavaScript directly in addition to Python. I also got it to run &quot;hello world&quot; in <strong>Ruby, Perl, PHP, Go, Java, Swift, Kotlin, C and C++</strong>. No Rust yet though!</li>
<li>While the container still can't make outbound network requests, <strong><code>pip install package</code> and <code>npm install package</code> both work</strong> now via a custom proxy mechanism.</li>
<li>ChatGPT can locate the URL for a file on the web and use a <code>container.download</code> tool to <strong>download that file and save it to a path</strong> within the sandboxed container.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a substantial upgrade! ChatGPT can now write and then test code in 10 new languages (11 if you count Bash), can find files online and download them into the container, and can install additional packages via <code>pip</code> and <code>npm</code> to help it solve problems.</p>
<p>(OpenAI <em>really</em> need to develop better habits at <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">keeping their release notes up-to-date</a>!)</p>
<p>I was initially suspicious that maybe I'd stumbled into a new preview feature that wasn't available to everyone, but I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6977aa7c-7bd8-8006-8129-8c9e25126fed">tried some experiments</a> in a free ChatGPT account and confirmed that the new features are available there as well.</p>

<h4>container.download</h4>
<p>My first clue to the new features came the other day when I got curious about Los Angeles air quality, in particular has the growing number of electric vehicles there had a measurable impact?</p>
<p>I prompted a fresh GPT-5.2 Thinking session with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show me Los Angeles air quality over time for last 20 years</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6977a80d-e6e4-8006-b4fe-ed8478fe99d8">shared transcript</a>. Annoyingly that doesn't make the thinking trace available, so here's a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/container-download.jpg" alt="Exploring methods to fetch AQI data and reports Downloading AQI data for Los Angeles  I found an xlsx file titled &quot;Air Quality Statistics by City, 2000-2023&quot;, which should include data for Los Angeles. While user requested data for Using provided URL to download file  The URL from the error message leads to an Excel file containing air quality trends. I can use the container.download tool to fetch it. Let’s proceed with this approach and see if it works out for downloading the file directly! Analyzed Parsing and analyzing the data for Los Angeles  Now that we've downloaded the data, I'll parse it using Python. First, I'll focus on identifying the row(s) corresponding to Los Angeles, which may be labeled under &quot;Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA.&quot; Afterward, I'll plot metrics like &quot;Median AQI&quot; and &quot;Days Good&quot; over time to visualize trends. Let’s begin!"></p>
<p>This bit instantly caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] The URL from the error message leads to an Excel file containing air quality trends. I can use the container.download tool to fetch it. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's <code>container.download</code>? I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6977aab0-b874-8006-9b54-d3d216ed884b">asked ChatGPT</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without running any searches tell me about your container.download tool</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And got back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure. <code>container.download</code> is a built-in tool I can call that <strong>fetches a file from a URL and saves it into the sandboxed container filesystem</strong> for this chat session.</p>
<h4>What it does</h4>
<ul>
<li>Takes a <strong>publicly reachable URL</strong> and a <strong>destination filepath</strong> in the container.</li>
<li>Downloads the bytes from that URL and writes them to the given path.</li>
<li>After that, I can read/process the file locally in the container (e.g., unzip it, parse it with Python, open it as an image, convert it, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Signature (inputs)</h4>
<p>It’s called like this (conceptually):</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/somefile.zip&quot;,
  &quot;filepath&quot;: &quot;/mnt/data/somefile.zip&quot;
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Further experimentation confirmed that <code>container.download</code> behaves as described.</p>
<p>I had it download one file from a server with logs enabled and captured the IP address and user-agent. Here are the most interesting headers:</p>
<pre><code>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko); compatible; ChatGPT-User/1.0; +https://openai.com/bot
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, image/avif, image/webp, image/apng, */*;q=0.8, application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Cf-Connecting-Ip: 52.230.164.178

</code></pre>
<p>That <code>52.230.164.178</code> IP address <a href="http://ip-api.com/json/52.230.164.178">resolves to</a> Microsoft Azure Cloud (centralus) in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<h4>Is container.download a data exfiltration vulnerability?</h4>
<p>On the one hand, this is really useful! ChatGPT can navigate around websites looking for useful files, download those files to a container and then process them using Python or other languages.</p>
<p>Is this a data exfiltration vulnerability though? Could a prompt injection attack trick ChatGPT into leaking private data out to a <code>container.download</code> call to a URL with a query string that includes sensitive information?</p>
<p>I don't think it can. I tried getting it to assemble a URL with a query string and access it using <code>container.download</code> and it couldn't do it. It told me that it got back this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ERROR: download failed because url not viewed in conversation before. open the file or url using web.run first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks to me like the same safety trick <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/10/claude-web-fetch-tool/">used by Claude's Web Fetch tool</a>: only allow URL access if that URL was either directly entered by the user or if it came from search results that could not have been influenced by a prompt injection.</p>
<p>(I poked at this a bit more and managed to get a simple constructed query string to pass through <code>web.run</code> - a different tool entirely - but when I tried to compose a longer query string containing the previous prompt history a <code>web.run</code> filter blocked it.)</p>
<p>So I <em>think</em> this is all safe, though I'm curious if it could hold firm against a more aggressive round of attacks from a seasoned security researcher.</p>
<h4>Bash and other languages</h4>
<p>The key lesson from coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI is that Bash rules everything: if an agent can run Bash commands in an environment it can do almost anything that can be achieved by typing commands into a computer.</p>
<p>When Anthropic added their own code interpreter feature to Claude <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/">last September</a> they built that around Bash rather than just Python. It looks to me like OpenAI have now done the same thing for ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Here's what ChatGPT looks like when it runs a Bash command - here my prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>npm install a fun package and demonstrate using it</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/chatgpt-bash.jpg" alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking interface with Activity panel. Main chat shows user prompt &quot;npm install a fun package and demonstrate using it&quot; and response &quot;Thought for 32s &gt; Yep — here's a fun one: cowsay 🐄 I installed it with npm and ran a tiny Node script:&quot; followed by bash code block containing &quot;mkdir -p /mnt/data/npmfun cd /mnt/data/npmfun npm init -y npm install cowsay --no-fund --no-audit node -e &quot;const cowsay=require('cowsay'); console.log(cowsay.say({text:'Hel&quot; and Output: section showing ASCII cow art saying &quot;&lt; Hello from npm inside the container! &gt;&quot; with cow drawing made of characters. Activity panel on right (32s) shows: &quot;Running npm install in container&quot; with bash command and output &quot;v22.16.0 10.9.2&quot;, &quot;Inspecting npm command output and container status&quot; with directory listing showing &quot;drwxr-xr-x 2 root oai_shared 80 Jan 26 17:32 . drwxrwxr-x 2 oai oai_shared 60 Jan 26 17:32 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root&quot;, &quot;Re-running npm install&quot; note about node_modules missing, and &quot;Rerunning npm install with output&quot; showing &quot;added 41 packages in 2s&quot;."></p>
<p>It's useful to click on the &quot;Thinking&quot; or &quot;Thought for 32s&quot; links as that opens the Activity sidebar with a detailed trace of what ChatGPT did to arrive at its answer. This helps guard against cheating - ChatGPT might claim to have run Bash in the main window but it can't fake those black and white logs in the Activity panel.</p>
<p>I had it run <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6977b890-f1c0-8006-b39a-9a02c7ca1993">Hello World in various languages</a> later in that same session.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/chatgpt-hello-worlds.jpg" alt="Terminal screenshot showing &quot;Hello, world&quot; programs in multiple languages. Top section shows code: swift -e 'print(&quot;Hello, world from Swift!&quot;)' followed by cat &gt; hello.kts &lt;&lt;'KTS' / println(&quot;Hello, world from Kotlin!&quot;) / KTS / kotlinc -script hello.kts, then cat &gt; hello.c &lt;&lt;'C' / #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; / int main(){ puts(&quot;Hello, world from C!&quot;); return 0; } / C / gcc hello.c -o hello_c / ./hello_c, then cat &gt; hello.cpp &lt;&lt;'CPP' / #include  / int main(){ std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, world from C++!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; } / CPP / g++ hello.cpp -o hello_cpp / ./hello_cpp. Bottom section shows output: Hello, world from Ruby! / Hello, world from Perl! / Hello, world from PHP! / Hello, world from Go! / Hello, world from Java! / Hello, world from Swift! / Hello, world from Kotlin! / Hello, world from C! / Hello, world from C++!. UI shows &quot;Thought for 2m 29s&quot; and &quot;Done&quot; at bottom."></p>
<h4>Installing packages from pip and npm</h4>
<p>In the previous example ChatGPT installed the <code>cowsay</code> package from npm and used it to draw an ASCII-art cow. But how could it do that if the container can't make outbound network requests?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/69773501-b6d8-8006-bbf2-fa644561aa26">another session</a> I challenged it to explore its environment. and figure out how that worked.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/chatgpt-container-environment/README.md">the resulting Markdown report</a> it created.</p>
<p>The key magic appears to be a <code>applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org</code> proxy, available within the container and with various packaging tools configured to use it.</p>
<p>The following environment variables cause <code>pip</code> and <code>uv</code> to install packages from that proxy instead of directly from PyPI:</p>
<pre><code>PIP_INDEX_URL=https://reader:****@packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org/.../pypi-public/simple
PIP_TRUSTED_HOST=packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org
UV_INDEX_URL=https://reader:****@packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org/.../pypi-public/simple
UV_INSECURE_HOST=https://packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org

</code></pre>
<p>This one appears to get <code>npm</code> to work:</p>
<pre><code>NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=https://reader:****@packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org/.../npm-public

</code></pre>
<p>And it reported these suspicious looking variables as well:</p>
<pre><code>CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL=packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_PYPI_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_NPM_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/api/npm/npm-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_GO_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/api/go/golang-main
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_MAVEN_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/maven-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_GRADLE_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/gradle-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_CARGO_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/api/cargo/cargo-public/index
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_DOCKER_REGISTRY=.../dockerhub-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_READER_USERNAME=reader
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_READER_PASSWORD=****
NETWORK=caas_packages_only

</code></pre>
<p>Neither Rust nor Docker are installed in the container environment, but maybe those registry references are a clue of features still to come.</p>
<h4>Adding it all together</h4>
<p>The result of all of this? You can tell ChatGPT to use Python or Node.js packages as part of a conversation and it will be able to install them and apply them against files you upload or that it downloads from the public web. That's <em>really</em> cool.</p>
<p>The big missing feature here should be the easiest to provide: we need <strong>official documentation</strong>! A release notes entry would be a good start, but there are a lot of subtle details to how this new stuff works, its limitations and what it can be used for.</p>
<p>As always, I'd also encourage OpenAI to come up with a name for this set of features that properly represents how it works and what it can do.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm going to call this <strong>ChatGPT Containers</strong>.</p>
<h4>Update: a full list of tools</h4>
<p>I decided to ask ChatGPT about other tools that were available to it in case there was anything interesting in there:</p>

      <h1>You Can Just Say No to the Data</h1>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>“The data doesn’t lie.”</p>
<p>I imagine that’s what the cigarette companies said.</p>
<p>“The data doesn’t lie. People want this stuff. They’re buying it in droves. We’re merely giving them what they want.”</p>
<p>Which sounds more like an attempt at exoneration than a reason to exist.</p>
<p>Demand can be engineered. “We’re giving them what they want” ignores how desire is shaped, even engineered (algorithms, dark patterns, <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/grow-like-a-tree-not-a-cancer/">growth hacking</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>Appealing to data as the ultimate authority — especially when fueled by engineered desire — isn’t neutrality, it’s an abdication of responsibility.</p>
<p>Satiating human desire is not the highest aspiration.</p>
<p>We can do so much more than merely supply what the data says is in demand.</p>
<p>Stated as <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/16811">a principle</a>:</p>
<p>Values <em>over</em> data.</p>
<p>Data tells you what people consume, not what you <em>should</em> make. Values, ethics, vision, those can help you with the “should”.</p>
<p>“What is happening?” and “What should happen?” are two completely different questions and should be dealt with as such.</p>
<p>The more powerful our ability to understand demand, the more important our responsibility to decide whether to respond to it. We can choose <em>not</em> to build something, even though the data suggests we should. We can say no to the data.</p>
<p>Data can tell you what people clicked on, even help you predict what people <em>will</em> click on, but you get to decide what you will profit from.</p>

      <h1>Where is our Churchill?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>I'm interested in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkest_Hour_(film)">Darkest Hour</a>. Specifically the scene where Churchill is surprised by a visit from the <a href="https://www.royal.uk/george-vi">king</a>, who we learned earlier is pissed off, while Churchill is morose and undecided on what to do. The King wants Churchill to know that he wants to fight, and that the people will be with him if he tells them what's really going on. I asked ChatGPT to summarize this scene in one good-size paragraph.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.royal.uk/george-vi">king</a> tells Churchill plainly that he does not want appeasement, that he believes Britain must fight, and -- crucially -- that the people will stand with Churchill if he is honest with them about the danger they face. The King’s visit reframes Churchill’s dilemma: leadership is not about finding a clever compromise but about trusting the public with the truth and giving them something worth enduring hardship for. The moment restores Churchill’s resolve, confirming that he is not alone and that moral clarity, not political maneuvering, is what the country needs from him.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the leader we need now. Someone who can give a speech like the one Churchill gave on June 4, 1940 to the House of Commons, the <a href="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/we-shall-fight-on-the-beaches/">We Shall Fight on the Beaches</a> speech.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to make big changes in how things work based on having our limits tested and the guardrails broken, bringing us to the brink. We should be talking about that before the journalists turn this into a debate about what the next election should be about. It must be about everything. Nothing clever. This is what happened and this is what we have to do. For example -- Increase the number of Supreme Court judges, and give them terms of five or ten years, and have an age limit. The Justices must have a personal stake in the decisions they make. They should feel like servants, not gods. And really mean it about the 14th Amendment that says insurrectionists can't run for office. Come on, we were warned amply, and now we're having to deal with a Jan 6 every day in every state.</p>
<p>We all know where this is headed. We need a leader with the courage to name the problem before we're overwhelmed by it.</p>

      <h1>Snow and dreaded politics</h1>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>Good morning. I am wiped out from the storm that just went through. Did a bunch of shoveling this morning, still have more to do. About two feet of snow, some drifts much higher. The snow is light, but it packs down from the weight of snow that falls on top, so shoveling is hard work. I have, as a kid, shoveled out more snow. I remember how tired I'd get as a kid. These days, as an older person, the exhaustion comes in bit sooner. Not being able to get out to the world quickly was a bit claustrophobia-inducing, and the politics haven't helped my overall feeling of dread.</p>
<p>Part of the general feeling of dread this time of year with the crisis we're in in the US, wondering if I should be working so constantly on a project that doesn't seem too appreciated. Wondering if I'm not doing the same thing I've been doing for the last X years, working for <em>our</em> online freedom, only to learn people don't really want it. I think about this a lot. It's one of those things if you prepare for it, could be fine, but if you just glide along from crisis to crisis as we are doing with online stuff, you never get to do the fun stuff without paying too high a price, with too many limits on what we can do.</p>
<p>Later, while it was still snowing, I was able to drive to the post office, so civilization is still here, thankfully. We seem to have survived this mess, for a while at least.</p>
<p>I still believe in what I'm doing, but I'm not going to give it much more time before turning it over to the people.</p>
<p>Like now, the people do understand beyone what's said in public discourse, but no one stepping up in a leadership role has been willing to spell it out. I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego">Ruben Gallego</a> who is a fantastic speaker and clear thinker, be driven into a defensive argument with MSNOW interviewers, who had reverted to their usual low road, trying to corner him into saying something that would only be interested if quoted out of context. He refused, but also was reduced to talking bullshit, when they should have just let him speak for crying out loud. They don't get that they aren't the news, our need for real leadership is most important.</p>
<p>We need to make some big changes in how things work based on having our limits tested and the guardrails defeated. And part of what needs to be redone is the power of journalists to make us all net-net far more stupid than we actually are.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Trump and the unmighty dollar (26 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Trump and the unmighty dollar: &quot;Flipping the table over in a poker game rigged in your favor because you resent having to pretend to play the game at all.&quot; Hey look at this: Delights to delectate.

Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Trump and the unmighty dollar (permalink) The best summary of Trump's trade &quot;philosophy&quot; comes from Trashfuture's November Kelly, who said that Trump is flipping over the table in a poker game that's rigged in his favor because he resents having to pretend to play the game at all. After all, the global system of trade was designed and enforced by American officials, especially the US Trade Representative. The US created a world whose most important commodities (food, oil, etc) were priced in dollars, meaning that anyone who wanted to buy these things from any country would first have to get US dollars, which they could only get by shipping their valuable stuff to the US, which sends them dollars in return. Think about this trade for a minute: to get US dollars, people outside of the US would have to dig up or chop down or manufacture real things that were in finite supply. Meanwhile, to get the US dollars to pay for these real, finite things, the US just had to type zeros into a spreadsheet at the Federal Reserve: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54fg-A1gCrM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54fg-A1gCrM</a> The technical term political scientists use for this arrangement is &quot;fucking sweet.&quot; Two of my favorite political scientists are Henry Farrell and Dan Davies, whose new paper, &quot;The US dollar system as a source of international disorder,&quot; was just published by The British Academy as part of its &quot;Global (Dis)Order international policy programme&quot;: <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/6018/Global">https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/6018/Global</a>_Disorder_-_The_US_Dollar_System_as_a_Source_of_International_Disorder.pdf Farrell and Davies explore the history of the weaponization of &quot;dollar centrality&quot; (their term for the arrangement where the whole world agreed to treat the dollar as a neutral trade instrument), and show how Trump's incontinent belligerence fits into it, and lay out some shrewd possibilities for where this could all end up. Farrell is one of the leading experts on how these boring, invisible, complex systems of financial settlement, fiber optic connections and other plumbing of the post-war era have been increasingly weaponized by successive US administrations. In 2023, he and Abraham Newman published The Underground Empire, an excellent book on the subject (really, the definitive book on the subject): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties">https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties</a> Davies, meanwhile, is a brilliant scholar (and explainer) of complex systems. Last year, he published The Unaccountability Machine, about the way that the feedback mechanisms in the systems that keep the world running are badly broken, leading to much of our modern dysfunction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The</a>_Unaccountability_Machine Their paper represents a fusion of both of their approaches, and makes for fascinating reading. They start by characterizing the post-war global system as broadly &quot;homeostatic,&quot; meaning that it can maintain stability in the face of shocks. Homeostasis requires a feedback mechanism so that it can constantly adjust itself – think of your home thermostat, which needs a thermometer so it can figure out when to run your furnace/air conditioner and when to stop. Political scientists have identified many of these feedback systems. For example, KN Waltz describes how, when one &quot;great power&quot; starts to dominate the world, the weaker states in its orbit will switch their alliances to rival powers, in order to &quot;balance&quot; power between the big beasts. Smaller, poorer, and/or weaker countries that have looked to the US for trade and military alliances might switch to China if it looks like the US is getting too powerful – not necessarily because China offers a better deal than the US, but because a decisive global victory by the US would give it the power to squeeze these countries, because they'd have nowhere else to go. Waltz's work is especially relevant this month, with Canada inking a Chinese trade deal and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney publicly declaring a &quot;rupture&quot; with the US-dominated order: <a href="https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/davos-is-a-rational-ritual">https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/davos-is-a-rational-ritual</a> When great powers ignore the feedback of these systems, the result is a collapse in global homeostasis, and radical shifts in the global order. Farrell and Davies argue that this is what's happening with the weaponization of the dollar, which has prompted many countries to take action that should have caused the US to back off, but which the US has ignored as it doubled down on the weaponized dollar: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-20/ethiopia-in-talks-with-china-to-convert-dollar-loans-into-yuan">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-20/ethiopia-in-talks-with-china-to-convert-dollar-loans-into-yuan</a> Even when the US has a &quot;rational&quot; case for weaponizing the dollar – for example, by forcing the world to join in a global financial surveillance project aimed at stemming financing for terrorism – it runs the risk of making things worse. If the US's anti-terror financial demands are so onerous that they provoke other countries into setting up multiple, independent, fragmented global financial schemes, then terrorists and their backers will have their pick of ways to move money around. Even where the US has had limited success with financial sanctions (by isolating North Korea, or by targeting specific individuals rather than countries), it has undermined those successes by peddling and formalizing cryptocurrencies that evade those sanctions. With Trump's crypto project, America gets the worst of both worlds: ineffective financial sanctions that nevertheless weaken the dollar's centrality to the world, and the power that confers upon America. The world relies on the dollar because it has to rely on something. There are hundreds of currencies in the world, and it's prohibitively expensive for exchange brokers to maintain deep reserves of all of those currencies so that any currency can be swapped for any other. Likewise, it is cumbersome and risky for transactions to rely on a chain of exchanges: if someone in Thailand can only buy oil from Norway by first trading Thai baht for Japanese yen, and then Australian dollars, and then euros, and then Norwegian kroner, they'll be bedeviled by shifting exchange rates, transaction fees, and, possibly, shady brokers who just take the money and run. After WWII, when the great powers and middle powers were hammering out the global financial system, economists like John Maynard Keynes proposed an international supercurrency that would only be used to facilitate exchanges, but he was outmaneuvered by America's chief negotiator, Harry Dexter White, who insisted that the US dollar will fill that role: <a href="https://profstevekeen.substack.com/p/this-is-the-end-of-the-us-global">https://profstevekeen.substack.com/p/this-is-the-end-of-the-us-global</a> So everyone uses the dollar, and because everyone uses the dollar, everyone has to use the dollar: the dollar enjoys &quot;network effects,&quot; where the more parties there are who will accept it, the more valuable it becomes and the harder it is to find an alternative. In my theory of enshittification, network effects are a powerful temptation to make a service worse. If you own a system with strong network effects, you can make it worse for all its users (and better for you) without risking your users' departure, because they are all holding each other hostage: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs</a> So it is with dollar weaponization. In order to use the dollar to settle transactions, parties must have access to systems that are directly under US government control (like a dollar account at the Federal Reserve), or are, practically speaking controlled by America (like the SWIFT system for moving money across borders). The fact that you have to use dollars, and you can't use dollars without the US government's say-so, means that the US can impose onerous terms on dollar users and not have to worry that they'll switch to another currency. Farrell and Davies describe how, during the &quot;high era&quot; of globalization, US Treasury officials fought to insulate the dollar from control by the US security apparatus. Treasury officials understood that the dollar was a source of enormous US power and advantage, and they didn't want to risk all those benefits by beating up dollar users and tempting them to look elsewhere. But ultimately, Treasury lost. This, too, is in accord with my theory of enshittification: once an institution locks in its users, the factions that want to make things worse will start winning the argument. This is exactly what happened to Google, when, having locked in search users, the company fell under control of its enshittifying faction, who oversaw a program that made search worse, so that you'd have to search repeatedly (and look at multiple screens' worth of ads) to get the answers you sought: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan">https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan</a> Google's anti-enshittification faction argued that making search worse was a betrayal of the company's mission. The pro-enshittification faction pointed out that lock-in meant that Google could make more money by betraying its mission without losing users, and they won the day. It's a lot easier to live your principles if you suffer when you betray them, and it's a lot easier to hold an institution to its principles if betraying those principles results in immediate penalties. After 9/11, the US security apparatus demanded dollar weaponization: the Office of Foreign Asset Control bigfooted the international finance system, forcing them to spy on, report and block transactions the US disliked. The threat of being excluded from the dollar system was powerful: when one bank refused to stop doing business with North Korea, the US &quot;designated&quot; the bank as noncompliant, provoking a bank run. The rest of the world's banks fell into line. The fact that the US could punish banks for actions that harmed American interests, even if the bank followed all the procedures required of it, encouraged banks to adopt a &quot;zero risk&quot; policy, where they made up policies that went well beyond America's rules, conducting even more surveillance, blocking even more transactions, and reporting even more activities than was required of them. All of this made participating in the dollar system steadily more costly, as dollar users had to pay for expensive compliance measures or risk the failure of key transactions, or exclusion from the dollar altogether. Late in Obama's second term, officials sounded the alarm about the dollar becoming increasingly unattractive for international finance, and counseled a relaxation of the post-9/11 ratchet of ever-tighter rules for dollar users. But Trump's officials were totally disinterested in the long-term health of the dollar system, and pursued an even more aggressive policy of dollar weaponization during Trump's first term. During Trump I, major blocs such as the EU began to formally prepare dollar alternatives and to formulate an &quot;anti-coercion instrument.&quot; The anti-coercion instrument is an agreement among EU states to retaliate together in the event that the US (or some other country) used the dollar (or some other currency) to interfere in internal EU matters: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Coercion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Coercion</a>_Instrument (The anti-coercion instrument has never been used, but it was almost invoked last week over Trump's threat to steal Greenland): <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/eu-anti-coercion-instrument-greenland-trump-b2903998.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/eu-anti-coercion-instrument-greenland-trump-b2903998.html</a> The Biden years seemed to signal a return to normalcy – the US might continue to weaponize the dollar, but they would at least pretend that they were playing fair. In Kelly's formulation, they'd actually play the rigged poker-game, rather than just taking everyone's chips and flipping over the table, the way Trump liked to do. But Biden also seemingly couldn't help himself, and his administration pursued a much blunter program of dollar weaponization than pre-Trump presidents. In particular, Biden's sanctions on Putin, his aligned oligarchs, and the Russian state were far more aggressive than anything any president (including Trump I) had ever done with the dollar. Farrell and Davies write that: Informal conversations with Biden officials suggest that they had noticed that, despite Trump’s actions, other countries had not moved away from the US dollar. Therefore, the Biden administration felt the US had greater leeway to use sanctions. In other words, the fact that enshittification produced no downside for the institution meant that its pro-enshittification factions kept winning the argument, and engaged in ever more severe forms of enshittification. The EU wasn't alone in worrying about US financial coercion. While China maintains much of its own transaction processing infrastructure, it is still very exposed to the dollar system, prompting it to take measures for retaliation and alternatives if the US overstepped. Meanwhile, the increasing controls and costs of using the dollar drove many parties to cryptocurrencies. Some were criminals whom dollar weaponization was supposed to harass, but many were just innocent bystanders, dolphins caught in the tuna net (think of American relatives of Russians who wanted to send their families money for food, rent, or even a plane ticket out of Russia). Biden responded to the growing use of crypto to evade dollar rules with regulations to bring crypto under tighter control, for example, by classing crypto as a security and subjecting it to financial regulation. The Biden administration's rules for banks that offered crypto services and trading made handling crypto so expensive that most banks just gave up on it altogether. Crypto boosters used this response to campaign against Biden and for Trump, accusing Biden of &quot;strangling&quot; crypto and &quot;debanking&quot; its users. Trump won a second presidency, in part thanks to billions in dark money from crypto insiders (many of whom Trump went on to pardon for money-laundering convictions carrying heavy fines and long prison sentences). At the outset of the second Trump presidency, Trump relied on tariffs, rather than dollar weaponization, to push the world around. As Farrell and Davies write, Trump gave speeches where he recognized the danger of squeezing dollar users too hard: The problem with … sanctions … [is that] ultimately it kills your dollar and it kills everything the dollar represents. … So I use sanctions very powerfully against countries that deserve it, and then I take them off. Because, look, you’re losing Iran. You’re losing Russia. China is out there trying to get their currency to be the dominant currency as you know better than anybody. … So I want to use sanctions as little as possible. Trump thinks that using sanctions is fine, provided that then he &quot;take[s] them off.&quot; This has resulted in the trademark Trump chaos of announced and rescinded and reimposed sanctions – against Chinese refineries, a Yemeni bank, the International Criminal Court, and the nation of Colombia. It's possible that this is less onerous than permanent (or at least, long-term) sanctions, but not by much. If no one can be sure that they'll be able to use the dollar tomorrow – even if they might be able to use it again the day after – there's far more pressure to find dollar alternatives. Meanwhile, Farrell and Davies observe that: [Trump is] more willing to impose sanctions on allies, since they are less able to defect from the dollar than neutrals and rivals, and less likely to act against crypto even though it facilitates sanctions evasion. In other words, Trump's reserving his most destructive punishments for his friends, because his enemies are more likely to flee to China if he uses his most devastating attacks on them. This is a very interesting observation, especially in light of Canada's announcement that it is leaving the American sphere of influence to become a neutral party with many alliances, including with China. If Farrell and Davies are right, this might mean that Canada will be less likely to face sanctions in the future than it risked when it was formally allied with the USA. Meanwhile, Trump's indiscriminate use of tariffs is steadily worsening the American domestic situation, driving up prices: <a href="https://fortune.com/2026/01/21/amazon-price-hikes-tariffs-2026-andy-jassy-davos/">https://fortune.com/2026/01/21/amazon-price-hikes-tariffs-2026-andy-jassy-davos/</a> Farrell and Davies predict that this will drive Trump to switch from using tariffs to using sanctions (after all, Trump's executive function has always been terrible, and it's only declined as his white matter disease has progressed). The EU is getting ready for this by finalizing the &quot;Digital Euro.&quot; If Trump responds to this with more sanctions, it will only hasten the world's switch away from the dollar. The authors call this a &quot;positive feedback loop&quot; (despite the word &quot;positive,&quot; that's not a good thing – a positive feedback loop causes a system to keep on speeding up until it is shaken to pieces). The EU has good reasons to escape the dollar. The US has good reasons to fight the EU's escape. Everything the US does to punish the EU for trying to escape the dollar will make the EU want to escape the dollar even more. The post-American era is being born around us, but when it comes to US &quot;platforms&quot; like the dollar (or even the transoceanic fiber links that all make landfall and interchange in the US), the expense and lock-in have left the world without any obvious and ready alternatives: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack</a> But there's one post-American platform that's right there for the taking: a global collaboration to develop open, auditable, trustworthy alternatives to US tech, from administrative tools like Office365 to the firmware in tractors, cars, and medical equipment: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</a> It's a project that the EU is actively pursuing: <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-bazooka-europe-could-hit-100000361.html">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-bazooka-europe-could-hit-100000361.html</a> But I don't think they've yet grasped how crucial the project of getting off US tech is – not just because it's urgent, but because it's also tractable. While replacing the dollar is hamstrung by network effects, building a global software commons benefits from network effects. It starts strong, and gets better every time someone else joins it. What's more: I suspect that a world that is already bound together with a common tech stack would have a much easier time coordinating resistance to dollar weaponization.

      <h1>Implementing the transcendental functions in Ivy</h1>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>Towards the end of 2014, in need of pleasant distraction, I began writing, in Go, my second pseudo-APL, called Ivy. Over the years, Ivy's capabilities expanded to the point that it's now being used to do things such as to design <a href="https://research.swtch.com/fp-knuth">floating-point printing algorithms</a>. That was unexpected, doubly so because among the set of array languages founded by APL, Ivy remains one of the weakest.</p>
<p>Also unexpected was how the arrival of high-precision floating point in Go's libraries presented me with some mathematical challenges. Computing functions such as sine and cosine when there are more bits than the standard algorithms provide required polishing up some mathematics that had rusted over in my brain. In this article, I'll show the results and the sometimes surprising paths that led to them.</p>
<p>First I need to talk a bit more about Ivy itself.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, Ivy avoids APL's idiosyncratic character set and uses ASCII tokens and words, just as in my previous, Lisp-written pseudo-APL back in 1979. To give it a different flavor and create a weak but valid justification for it, from the start Ivy used exact arithmetic, colloquially big ints and exact rationals. This made it unusual and a little bit interesting, and also meant it could be used to perform calculations that were clumsy or infeasible in traditional languages, particularly cryptographic work. The factorial of 100, in Ivy (input is indented):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>!100      93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps more surprising:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.5</p>
<p>1/2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ivy also became, due to the work of Hana Kim and David Crawshaw, the first mobile application written in Go. I take no credit for that. The iOS version is long gone and the Android version is very old, but that situation might change before long.</p>
<p>For those who don't know the history and peculiarities of APL, it's worth doing your own research; that education is not the purpose of this article. But to make the examples comprehensible to those sadly unfamiliar with it, there are a few details of its model one should understand to make sense of the Ivy examples below.</p>
<p>First, every operator, whether built-in or user-programmed, takes either one argument or two. If one, the operator precedes the argument; if two, the arguments are left and right of the operator. In APL, these are called monadic and dyadic operators. Because Ivy was written based on my fading memory of APL, rather than references, in Ivy they are called unary and binary. Some operators work in either mode according to the surrounding expression; consider</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - 2  # Binary: subtraction</p>
<p>-1</p>
<p>    - 0.5  # Unary: negation</p>
<p>-1/2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second detail is that values can be scalars or they can be multidimensional vectors or matrices. And the operators handle these in a way that feels deeply natural, which is part of why APL happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 5 6 - 2</p>
<p>2 3 4</p>
<p>    4 5 6 - 1 2 3</p>
<p>3 3 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare those expressions to the equivalent in almost any other style of language to see why APL has its fans.</p>
<p>Finally, because the structure of APL expressions is so simple with only two syntactic forms of operators (unary and binary), operator precedence simply does not exist. Instead, expressions are evaluated from right to left, always (modulo parentheses). Thus</p>
<p>3 * 4 + 5</p>
<p>evaluates to 27 because it groups as 3 * (4+5): every operand is maximal length, traveling left, until an operator arrives. In most languages, the usual precedence rules would instead group this as (3*4) + 5.</p>
<p>Enough preamble.</p>
<p>Ivy was fun to write, which was its real purpose, and there were some technical challenges, in particular how to handle the fluid typing, with things changing from integers to fractions, scalars to vectors, vectors to matrices, and so on. I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXoG0WX0r_E">talk</a> about this problem very early in Ivy's development, if you are interested. A lot has changed since then but the fundamental ideas persist.</p>
<p>Before long, it bothered me that I couldn't calculate square roots because Ivy did not handle irrational numbers, only exact integers and rationals. But Robert Griesemer, who had written the math/big library that Ivy used, decided to tackle high-precision floating point. This was important not just for Ivy, but for Go itself. The rules for <a href="https://go.dev/blog/constants">constants in Go</a> require that they can be represented to high precision in the source code, much more so than the usual 64-bit variables we are used to. That property allowed constant expressions involving floating-point numbers to be evaluated at compile time without losing precision.</p>
<p>At the time, the Go toolchain was being <a href="https://go.dev/talks/2014/c2go.slide#1">converted</a> from the original C implementation to Go, and the constant evaluation code in the original compiler had some problems. Robert decided, with his usual wisdom and tenacity, to build a strong high-precision floating-point library that the new compiler could use. And Ivy would benefit.</p>
<p>By mid-2015, Ivy supported floats with lots of bits. Happiness ensued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sqrt 2</p>
<p>1.41421356237</p>
<p>)format '%.50f'</p>
<p>sqrt 2</p>
<p>1.41421356237309504880168872420969807856967187537695</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time to build in some helpful constants:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pi</p>
<p>3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937511</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369996</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Internally these constants are stored with 3000 digits and are converted on the fly to the appropriate precision, which is 256 bits by default but can be set much bigger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>)prec 10000       # Set the mantissa size in bits</p>
<p>)format '%.300f'  # Set the format for printing values</p>
<p>pi</p>
<p>3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208998628034825342117067982148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128481117450284102701938521105559644622948954930381964428810975665933446128475648233786783165271201909145648566923460348610454326648213393607260249141274</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now things get harder.</p>
<p>Square root is easy to calculate to arbitrary precision. Newton's method converges very quickly and we can even use a trick to speed it up: create the initial value by halving the exponent of the floating-point argument.</p>
<p>But what about sine, cosine, exponential, logarithm? These transcendental functions are problematic computationally. Arctangent is a nightmare.</p>
<p>When I looked around for algorithms to compute these functions, it was easy to find clever ways to compute accurate values with 64-bit floating-point (float64) inputs, but that was it. I had to get creative.</p>
<p>What follows is how I took on programming high-precision transcendental functions and their relatives. It was a lot of fun and I uncovered some fascinating things along the way.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: Before going further, I must admit that I am not an expert in numerical computation. I am not an expert in analysis. I am not an expert in calculus. I have just enough knowledge to be dangerous. In the story that follows, if I say something that's clearly wrong, I apologize in advance. If you see a way I could have done better, please let me know. I'd love to lift the game. I know for a fact that my implementations are imperfect and can get ratty in the last few bits. And I cannot state anything definitive about their error characteristics. But they were fun to puzzle out and implement.</p>
<p>In short, here follows the ramblings of a confessed amateur traversing unfamiliar ground.</p>
<p>The easiest transcendental functions to provide are sine, cosine, and exponential. These three are in fact closely related, and can all be computed well using their Taylor series, which converge quickly even for large values. Here for instance is the Taylor series (actually a Maclaurin series, since we start at 0) for exponential (thanks to Wikipedia—which, by the way, I support financially and hope you do too—for the screen grab of these equations):</p>

<p>Those factorials in the denominator make this an effective way to compute the exponential. And the sine and cosine series are closely related, taking alternate (sine odd, cosine even) terms from the exponential, with alternating signs:</p>

<p>might help explain why these three functions are related. (Or not, depending on your sensibilities.)</p>
<p>The challenge with sine and cosine is not the calculation itself, but the process of argument reduction. Because these functions are periodic, and because small values of the argument do better in a Taylor series, it is a good idea to &quot;reduce&quot; or unwind the argument into the range of 0 to 2𝛑. For very large values, this reduction is hard to do precisely, and I suspect my simplistic code isn't great.</p>
<p>For tangent, rather than fight the much clumsier Taylor series, I just computed sin( <em>x</em>) and cos( <em>x</em>) and returned their quotient, with care.</p>
<p>That process of taking existing implementations and using identities to build a new function was central to how Ivy eventually supported complex arguments to these functions as well as hyperbolic variants of them all. For example, for complex tangent, we can use this identity:</p>
<p>tan( <em>x</em> + <em>yi</em>) = (sin(2 <em>x</em>) + <em>i</em> sinh(2 <em>y</em>))/(cos(2 <em>x</em>) + cosh(2 <em>y</em>))</p>
<p>Here sinh is the hyperbolic sine, which is easy to compute given the exponential function or by just taking the odd terms of the Taylor series for exponential, while cosh takes the even terms. See the pattern?</p>
<p>Next up we have the inverse functions arcsine (asin) and arccosine (acos). They aren't too bad but their Taylor series have poor convergence when the argument is near ±1. So we grub around for helpful identities and come up with two:</p>
<p>asin( <em>x</em>) = atan(x/sqrt(1 <strong>-</strong> <em>x</em> ²))</p>
<p>acos( <em>x</em>) = π/2 - asin( <em>x</em>)</p>
<p>But that means we need arctangent (atan), and its Taylor series has awful convergence for <em>x</em> near 1, whose result should be the entirely reasonable π/4 or 45 degrees. An experiment showed that using the Taylor series directly at 1.00001 took over a million iterations to converge to a good value. We need better.</p>
<p>I did some more exploration and in one of my old schoolbooks I found this identity:</p>
<p>atan( <em>x</em>) = atan( <em>y</em>) + atan(( <em>x</em> <strong>-</strong> <em>y</em>)/(1+ <em>xy</em>))</p>
<p>In this identity, <em>y</em> is a free variable! That allows us to do better. We can choose <em>y</em> to have helpful properties. Now:</p>
<p>tan(π/8) = √2-1</p>
<p>or equivalently,</p>
<p>atan(√2-1) = π/8</p>
<p>so we can choose <em>y</em> to be √2-1, which gives us</p>
<p>atan( <em>x</em>) = π/8 + atan(( <em>x</em> <strong>-</strong> <em>y</em>)/(1+ <em>xy</em>))   # With <em>y</em> = √2-1</p>
<p>so all we need to compute now is one arctangent, that of ( <em>x</em> <strong>-</strong> <em>y</em>)/(1+ <em>xy</em>). The only concern is when that expression nears one. So there are several steps.</p>
<p>First, atan( <strong>-</strong> <em>x</em>) is <strong>-</strong> atan( <em>x</em>), so we take care of the sign up front to give us a non-negative argument.</p>
<p>Next if |1 <strong>-</strong> <em>x</em> |&lt; 0.5, we can use the identity above by recurring to calculate atan(( <em>x</em> <strong>-</strong> <em>y</em>)/(1+ <em>xy</em>)) with <em>y</em> =√2 <strong>-</strong> 1. It converges well.</p>
<p>If <em>x</em> is less than 1 the standard series works well:</p>
<p>atan( <em>x</em>) = <em>x</em> - <em>x</em> ³/3 + <em>x</em> ⁵/5 - <em>x</em> ⁷/7 + ...</p>
<p>For values above 1, we use this alternate series:</p>
<p>atan( <em>x</em>) = +π/2 - 1/ <em>x</em> + 1/3 <em>x</em> ³ -1/5 <em>x</em> ⁵ + 1/7 <em>x</em> ⁷ - ...</p>
<p>Figuring all that out was fun, and the algorithm is nice and fast. (Values troublesomely close to 1 are picked off by the identity above.)</p>
<p>So now we have all the arc-trig functions, and in turn we can do the arc-hyperbolics as well using various identities.</p>
<p>With trigonometry out of the way, it's time to face logarithms and arbitrary powers. As with arctangent, the Taylor series for logarithm has issues. And we need logarithms to calculate arbitrary powers: using Ivy's notation for power,</p>
<p>x ** y</p>
<p>is the same as</p>
<p>e ** y*log x</p>
<p>That's the exponential function, which we have implemented, but this necessary rewrite relies on the logarithm of <em>x</em>.</p>
<p>(If the power is an integer, of course, we can just use exact multiplication, with a clever old algorithm that deserves another viewing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p># pow returns x**exp where exp is an integer.</p>
<p>op x pow exp =</p>
<p>z = 1</p>
<p>:while exp &gt; 0</p>
<p>:if 1 == exp&amp;1</p>
<p>z = z*x</p>
<p>:end</p>
<p>x = x*x</p>
<p>exp = exp&gt;&gt;1</p>
<p>:end</p>
<p>z</p>
<p>.5 pow 3</p>
<p>1/8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That loop is logarithmic (ha!) in multiplications. It is an exercise for the reader to see how it works. If the exponent is negative, we just invert the result.)</p>
<p>The Taylor series for log( <em>x</em>) isn't great but if we set <em>x</em> =1 <strong>-</strong> <em>y</em> we can use this series:</p>
<p>log (1- <em>y</em>) = <strong>-</strong> <em>y</em> <strong>-</strong> <em>y</em> ²/2 <strong>-</strong> <em>y</em> ³/3 ...</p>
<p>It converges slowly, but it does converge. If <em>x</em> is big, the convergence is very slow but that's easy to address. Since log(1/ <em>x</em>) is <strong>-</strong> log( <em>x</em>), and 1/ <em>x</em> is small when <em>x</em> is large, for large <em>x</em> we take the inverse and recur.</p>
<p>There's more we can do to help. We are dealing with floating-point numbers, which have the form (for positive numbers):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mantissa * 2**exponent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the mantissa is always a value in the close/open range [0,0.5), so its series will converge well. Thus we rewrite the calculation as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>log(mantissa * 2**exponent) = log(mantissa) + log(2)*exponent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we have a good mantissa we can use in the series and a working exponential function. All that's missing is an accurate value for log(2).</p>
<p>When I was doing this work, I spent a long but unsuccessful time looking for a 3,000-digit accurate value for log(2). Eventually I decided to use Ivy itself, or at least the innards, to compute it. In fact I computed 10,000 digits to be sure, and was able to spot-check some of the digits using <a href="https://numberworld.org/digits/Log(2)/">https://numberworld.org/digits/Log(2)/</a>, which had sample sparse digits, so I was confident in the result.</p>
<p>The calculation itself was fun. I don't remember exactly how I did it, but looking at it now one way would be to compute</p>
<p>log(0.5) = <strong>-</strong> log 2</p>
<p>with the series above. With <em>x</em> =0.5, 1 <strong>-</strong> <em>x</em> also equals 0.5 so</p>
<p>log(2) = <strong>-</strong> log (0.5) = <strong>-</strong>( <strong>-</strong> 0.5 <strong>-</strong> 0.5²/2 <strong>-</strong> 0.5³/3...)</p>
<p>and that converges quickly. The computation didn't take long, even for 10,000 digits.</p>
<p>I then saved the result as a constant inside Ivy, and had all that was needed for <em>x</em>**y.</p>
<p>Finally, if we need the logarithm of a negative or complex number, that's easy given what we've already built:</p>
<p>log( <em>x</em>) = log(| <em>x</em> |) \* phase( <em>x</em>)</p>
<p>To compute the phase, we use the arctangent calculation we worked out before.</p>
<p>And with that, Ivy had square roots, trigonometry, hyperbolic trigonometry, logarithms and powers, all for the whole complex plane. That was it for quite a while.</p>
<p>But come late 2025, I decided to fill one gap that was bothering me: The gamma function 𝚪( <em>z</em>), which is defined by the integral</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhac237ZNwsf_PmghFsMPruXy25u-awy_6GI8U8WKv-71z-bPTqgZ-lzdYB9SZZAH84reJm8UMl-mBXrTfU2wP0Kh1XTWM7arsT5XaXtSi3vGTmqdlnde9DrdO6yZ2YvHZ7BaiyZzx3JoaOKP8CBz83RFIHad-sH42wT2BEskhSQBKIg1welLNCuw/s642/gamma.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhac237ZNwsf_PmghFsMPruXy25u-awy_6GI8U8WKv-71z-bPTqgZ-lzdYB9SZZAH84reJm8UMl-mBXrTfU2wP0Kh1XTWM7arsT5XaXtSi3vGTmqdlnde9DrdO6yZ2YvHZ7BaiyZzx3JoaOKP8CBz83RFIHad-sH42wT2BEskhSQBKIg1welLNCuw/s320/gamma.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This function has many fascinating properties, but there are three that matter here. First is that if you play with that integral by parts you can discover that it has a recurrence relation</p>
<p>𝚪( <em>z</em> +1) = <em>z</em> 𝚪( <em>z</em>)</p>
<p>which is a property shared by the factorial function:</p>
<p><em>z+</em> 1! = <em>z</em>! <em>z</em></p>
<p>Because of this, the gamma function is considered one way to generalize factorial to non-integers, in fact to the whole complex plane except for non-positive integers, which are its poles. For real( <em>z</em>) &lt; 0, we can (and do) use the identity</p>
<p>𝚪( <em>z</em>) = 𝛑/(sin( <em>z</em> 𝛑)*𝚪(1- <em>z</em>))</p>
<p>It works out that for integer values,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>𝚪( <em>z</em> +1) = <em>z</em>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which means, if we so choose, we can define factorial over the complex plane using</p>
<blockquote>
<p>z! = 𝚪( <em>z</em> +1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>APL and Ivy both do this.</p>
<p>The second property, besides being easy to evaluate for integer arguments because of the relation with factorial, is that it's also easy to evaluate at half-integers because</p>
<p>𝚪( <strong>½</strong>) = √π</p>
<p>and we can use the recurrence relation to get exact values for all positive half-integers (or at least, as exact as our value of π).</p>
<p>The third property is less felicitous: there is no easy way to compute 𝚪( <em>z</em>) for arbitrary <em>z</em> to high precision. Unlike the functions discussed above, there is no Taylor series or other trick, no known mechanism for computing the exact value for all arguments. The best we can do is an approximation, perhaps by interpolation between the values that we do know the exact value for.</p>
<p>With that dispiriting setup, we now begin our quest: How best to calculate 𝚪( <em>z</em>) in Ivy?</p>
<p>The first thing I tried was to use a method called the Lanczos approximation, which was described by Cornelius Lanczos in 1964. This gives a reasonable approximate value for 𝚪( <em>z</em>) for a standard floating-point argument. It gives 10-12 decimal digits of accuracy, and a float64 has about 16, float32 about 7. For Ivy we want to do better, but when I uncovered Lanczos's approximation it seemed a good place to start.</p>
<p>Here is the formula:</p>

<p>Those <em>c</em> coefficients are the hard part: they are intricate to calculate. Moreover, because this is an approximation, not a series, we can't just compute a few terms and stop. We need to use all the terms of the approximation, which means deciding a priori how many terms to use. Plus, adding more terms does little to improve accuracy, so something like 10 terms is probably enough, given we're not going to be precise anyway. And as we'll see, the number of terms itself goes into the calculation of the <em>c</em> coefficients.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_approximation">Wikipedia page</a> for the approximation is a good starting point for grasping all this. It has some sample coefficients and a Python implementation that's easy to relate to the explanation, but using it to calculate the coefficients isn't easy.</p>
<p>I found an article by Paul Godfrey very helpful ( <a href="https://www.numericana.com/answer/info/godfrey.htm">Lanczos Implementation of the Gamma Function</a>). It turns the cryptic calculation in the Wikipedia article into a comprehensible burst of matrix algebra. Also, as a step along the way, he gives some sample coefficients for N=11. I used them to implement the approximation using Wikipedia's Python code as a guide, and it worked well. Or as well as it could.</p>
<p>However, if I were going to use those coefficients, it seemed dishonest not to calculate them myself, and Godfrey explains, if not exactly shows, how to do that.</p>
<p>He reduces the calculation of <em>c</em> coefficients to a multiplication of three matrices, <em>D</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, and a vector <em>F</em>. I set about calculating them using Ivy itself. I do not claim to understand why the process works, but I am able to execute it.</p>
<p><em>D</em> is straightforward. In fact its elements are found in my ex-Bell-Labs colleague Neil Sloane's Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as number <a href="https://oeis.org/A002457">A002457</a>. The terms are a( <em>n</em>) = (2 <em>n</em> +1)!/ <em>n</em>!², starting with <em>n</em> =1. Here's the Ivy code to do it (All of these calculations can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/robpike/ivy">Ivy GitHub repo</a> in the file testdata/lanczos). We define the operator to calculate the <em>n</em> th element:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>op A2457 n = (!1+2*n)/(!n)**2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The operator is called A2457 for obvious reasons, and it returns the <em>n</em> th element of the sequence. Then <em>D</em> is just a diagonal matrix of those terms, all but the first negated, which can be computed by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N = 6 # The matrix dimension, a small value for illustration here.</p>
<p>op diag v =</p>
<p>d = count v</p>
<p>d d rho flatten v @, d rho 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The @ decorator iterates its operator, here a comma &quot;raveling&quot; or joining operator, over the elements of its left argument applied to the entire right. The diag operator then builds a vector by spreading out the elements of v with d zeros (d rho 0) between each, then reformats that into a d by d matrix (d d rho ...). That last expression is the return value: operators evaluate to the last expression executed in the body. Here's an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>diag 1 2 3 4 5 6</p>
<p>1 0 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>0 2 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>0 0 3 0 0 0</p>
<p>0 0 0 4 0 0</p>
<p>0 0 0 0 5 0</p>
<p>0 0 0 0 0 6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the real work, we pass a vector created by calling A2457 for each of 0 through 4 (-1+iota N-1), negating that, and adding an extra 1 at the beginning. Here's what we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>D = diag 1, -A2457@ -1+iota N-1</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>D</p>
<p>1    0    0    0    0    0</p>
<p>0   -1    0    0    0    0</p>
<p>0    0   -6    0    0    0</p>
<p>0    0    0  -30    0    0</p>
<p>0    0    0    0 -140    0</p>
<p>0    0    0    0    0 -630</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>B</em> is created from a table of binomial coefficients. This turned out to be the most intricate of the matrices to compute, and I won't go through it all here, but briefly: I built Pascal's triangle, put an extra column on it, and rotated it. That built the coefficients. Then I took alternate rows and did a little sign fiddling. The result is an upper triangle matrix with alternating +1 and -1 down the diagonal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B</p>
<p>1   1   1   1   1   1</p>
<p>0  -1   2  -3   4  -5</p>
<p>0   0   1  -4  10 -20</p>
<p>0   0   0  -1   6 -21</p>
<p>0   0   0   0   1  -8</p>
<p>0   0   0   0   0  -1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, if you want to see the calculation, which I'm sure could be done much more concisely, look in the repo.</p>
<p>Now the fun one. The third matrix, <em>C</em>, is built from the coefficients of successive Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, called Tₙ( <em>x</em>). They are polynomials in <em>x</em>, but we only want the coefficients. That is, <em>x</em> doesn't matter for the value but its presence is necessary to build the polynomials. We can compute the polynomials using these recurrence relations:</p>
<p>T₀( <em>x</em>) = 1</p>
<p>T₁( <em>x</em>) = <em>x</em></p>
<p>Tₙ₊₁( <em>x</em>) = 2xTₙ( <em>x</em>) - Tₙ₋₁( <em>x</em>)</p>
<p>That's easy to code in Ivy. We treat a polynomial as just a vector of coefficients. Thus, as polynomials, 1 is represented as the vector</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>while <em>x</em> is</p>
<p>0 1</p>
<p>and <em>x</em> ² is</p>
<p>0 0 1</p>
<p>and so on. To keep things simple, we always carry around a vector of all the coefficients, even if most are zero. In Ivy we can use the take operator to do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6 take 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1 0 0 0 0 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>gives us a vector of length 6, with 1 as the first element. Similarly, we get the polynomial <em>x</em> by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 take 0 1</p>
<p>0 1 0 0 0 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The timesx operator shows why this approach is good. To multiply a polynomial by <em>x</em>, we just push it to the right and add a zero constant at the beginning. But first we should define the size of our polynomials, tsize, which needs to be twice as big as N because, as with the binomials, we will only keep alternate sets of coefficients.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tsize = -1+2*N</p>
<p>op timesx a = tsize take 0, a</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, put a zero at the beginning of the argument vector and 'take' the first tsize elements of that to be returned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>timesx tsize take 0 1 # makes x²</p>
<p>0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course to add two polynomials we just add the vectors.</p>
<p>Now we can define our operator T to create the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>op T n =</p>
<p>n == 0: tsize take 1</p>
<p>n == 1: tsize take 0 1</p>
<p>(2 * (timesx T n-1)) - (T n-2) # Compare to the recurrence relation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That T operator is typical Ivy code. The colon operator is a kind of switch/return: If the left operand is true, return the right operand. The code is concise and easy to understand, but can be slow if N is much bigger. (I ended up memoizing the implementation but that's not important here. Again, see the repo for details.) The rest is just recursion with the tools we have built.</p>
<p>To create the actual <em>C</em> matrix, we generate the coefficients and select alternate columns by doubling the argument to T. Finally, for reasons beyond my ken, the first element of the data is hand-patched to 1/2. And then we turn the vector of data into a square N by N matrix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>op gen x = (tsize rho 1 0) sel T 2*x</p>
<p>data =  flatten gen@ -1+iota tsize</p>
<p>data[1] = 1/2</p>
<p>C=N N rho data</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>1/2   0    0    0     0   0</p>
<p> -1   2    0    0     0   0</p>
<p>1  -8    8    0     0   0</p>
<p> -1  18  -48   32     0   0</p>
<p>1 -32  160 -256   128   0</p>
<p> -1  50 -400 1120 -1280 512</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phew. Now we just need <em>F</em>, and it's much easier. We need gamma for half-integers, which we know how to do, and then we can calculate some terms as shown in the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>op gammaHalf n = # n is guaranteed here to be an integer plus 1/2.</p>
<p>n = n - 0.5</p>
<p>(sqrt pi) * (!2*n) / (!n)*4**n</p>
<p>op fn z = ((sqrt 2) / pi) * (gammaHalf(z+.5)) * (**(z+g+.5)) * (z+g+0.5)**-(z+0.5)</p>
<p>F = N 1 rho  fn@ -1+iota N  # N 1 rho ... makes a vertical vector</p>
<p>F</p>
<p>33.8578185471</p>
<p>7.56807943935</p>
<p>3.69514993967</p>
<p>2.34118388428</p>
<p>1.69093653732</p>
<p>1.31989578103</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This code will seem like arcana to someone unaccustomed to array languages like APL and Ivy, but Ivy was actually a great tool for this calculation. To be honest, I started to write all this in Go but never finished because it was too cumbersome. The calculation of the C matrix alone took a page of code, plus some clever formatting. In Ivy it's just a few lines and is much more fun.</p>
<p>Now that we have all the pieces, we can do the matrix multiplication that Godfrey devised:</p>
<p>(D+.*B+.*C)+.*F</p>
<p>Those are inner products: +.* means multiply element-wise and then add them up (right to left, remember), standard matrix multiplication. We want the output to have high(ish) precision so print out lots of digits:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>'%.22g' text (D+.*B+.*C)+.*F</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Using this method, I was able to calculate the coefficients exactly as they appear in Godfrey's article with size N=11. With these coefficients and the code modeled on the Python from Wikipedia, the result was 10 to 12 digits of gamma function.</p>
<p>I was thrilled at first, but the imprecision of the Lanczos approximation, for all its magic, nagged at me. Ivy is supposed to do better than 10 digits, but that's all we can pull out of Lanczos.</p>
<p>After a few days I went back to the web and found another approximation, one by John L. Spouge from 1994, three decades after Lanczos. It has the property that, although it's still only an approximation, the accuracy can be bounded and also tuned at the expense of more computation. That means more terms, but the terms are easy to calculate and the coefficients are much easier to calculate than with Lanczos, so much so that Ivy ends up computing them on demand. We just need a lot more of them.</p>
<p>Even better, I found a paper from 2021 by Matthew F. Causley that refined the approximation further to allow one to decide where the approximation can be most accurate. That paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00697v1">The Gamma Function via Interpolation</a> by Matthew F. Causley, 2021.</p>
<p>Let's start with Spouge's original approximation, which looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhC_juuD0R9zibPdKIb8WttQl9EhtKockMNaiKiMY3xxdDsueOTdFt48BE1XSrhnnvJDsxGovaE-2yeqwe7R_aeVKCtu6JS9zjzUu0FHm5Fv7Hi3hj4DdiPfOoDkyDYpOgSAq5lYvINw_AAY8Oz1CsmK31yhV0DGHBTSkfV84UniCZ3cYMNthTjmA"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhC_juuD0R9zibPdKIb8WttQl9EhtKockMNaiKiMY3xxdDsueOTdFt48BE1XSrhnnvJDsxGovaE-2yeqwe7R_aeVKCtu6JS9zjzUu0FHm5Fv7Hi3hj4DdiPfOoDkyDYpOgSAq5lYvINw_AAY8Oz1CsmK31yhV0DGHBTSkfV84UniCZ3cYMNthTjmA" alt=""></a></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjecqfHe1_g1yo-rHv1bjUG3MCkP-Muqb-NpXtl3NlI_Cu99lQ-apIwpX4VxsFpA8gXoy_qHG0T6YzE3h2KMEezEeGqV1bGdD8vVUUXNulCpR22UjGUDmG4GZQIt3LGmxT7Fy0n4wXAwyK2kwQ7eNL_UY7dCY6NXS-h0f5rG1fMNIr_3Dy9Ih6pGA"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjecqfHe1_g1yo-rHv1bjUG3MCkP-Muqb-NpXtl3NlI_Cu99lQ-apIwpX4VxsFpA8gXoy_qHG0T6YzE3h2KMEezEeGqV1bGdD8vVUUXNulCpR22UjGUDmG4GZQIt3LGmxT7Fy0n4wXAwyK2kwQ7eNL_UY7dCY6NXS-h0f5rG1fMNIr_3Dy9Ih6pGA" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice that the variable <em>a</em> is not only the number of terms, it's also part of the calculations and the coefficients themselves. As in Lanczos, this is not a convergent series but an interpolated approximation. Once you decide on the value of <em>a</em>, you need to use all those terms. (I'll show you some of the coefficients later and you may be surprised at their value.)</p>
<p>The calculation may be long, but it's straightforward given all the groundwork we've laid in Ivy already and those <em>c</em> coefficients are easy to compute.</p>
<p>What Causley adds to this is to separate the number of terms, which he calls N, and the variable based on N that goes into the calculations themselves, which he calls <em>r</em>. In regular Spouge, <em>a</em> = <em>r</em> =N, but Causley splits them. Then, by brute force if necessary, we look for the value of <em>r</em> that gives us the best approximation at some value of <em>z</em>, called <em>zbar</em>, of our choosing. In Causley's paper, he shows his calculated N and optimal <em>r</em> values for a few integer values of <em>zbar</em>. The values in his table are not precise enough for our purposes, however. We need to compute our own.</p>
<p>Here it makes sense to calculate more terms than with Lanczos. Empirically I was able to get about half a digit for every term, and therefore decided to go with N=100, which gives about 50 digits or more, at least near <em>zbar</em>.</p>
<p>The calculation is much simpler than with Lanczos. Given N and <em>r</em>, here's how to calculate the vector of coefficients, <em>c</em> ₙ:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>op C n =</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = (1 -1)[n&amp;1]/!n</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>u = e**r-n</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>v = (r-n)**n+.5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t*u*v</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>c = N 1 rho (C@ iota N)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we have those coefficients, the gamma function itself is just the formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>op gamma z =</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>p = (z+r)**z-.5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>q = **-(z+r)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>n = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sum = cinf</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>:while n &lt;= N-1</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sum = sum+c[n]/(z+n)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>n = n+1</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>:end</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>p*q*sum</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The variable cinf is straight from the paper. It appears to be a fixed value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cinf = 2.5066 # Fixed by the algorithm; see Causley.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended up with N=100 and <em>r</em> =126.69 for <em>zbar</em> =6. Let's see how accurate we are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>)format %.70f # The number of digits for a 256-bit mantissa, not counting the 8 left of the decimal sign.</p>
<p>gamma 12</p>
<p>39916799.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999083377203094662100418136867266</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The correct value is !11, which is of course an integer (and computed as such in Ivy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>!11</p>
<p>39916800</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They agree to 48 places, a huge step up from Lanczos and a difference unlikely to be noticed in normal work.</p>
<p>Have a gander at the first few of our cₙ coefficients with N=11 and <em>r</em> =126.69:</p>

<p>They have many more digits than that, of course, but check out the exponents. We are working with numbers of enormous size; it's remarkable that they almost completely cancel out and give us our gamma function with such accuracy. This is indeed no Taylor series.</p>
<p>I chose N because I wanted good accuracy. I chose <em>r</em> because it gave me excellent accuracy at gamma 6 and thereabouts, well over 50 digits. To find my value of <em>r</em>, I just iterated, computing <em>C</em> and then gamma using values of <em>r</em> until the error between gamma 6 and !5 was as small as I could get. It's explained in the repo in the file testdata/gamma.</p>
<p>But there remains one mystery. In Causley's paper, <em>r</em> is closer to N, in fact always less than one away. So why did I end up with such a different value? The result I get with those parameters is excellent, so I am not complaining. I am just puzzled.</p>
<p>The optimization method is outlined in Causley's paper but not thorougly enough for me to recreate it, so I did something simpleminded: I just varied <em>r</em> until it gave good results at <em>zbar</em> =6. Perhaps that's naive. Or perhaps there is a difference in our arithmetical representation. Causley says he uses variable-precision arithmetic but does not quantify that. I used 256-bit mantissas. It's possible that the highest-precision part of the calculations is exquisitely sensitive to the size of the mantissa. I don't know, and would like to know, what's going on here. But there is no question that my values work well. Moreover, if I instead choose <em>r</em> =N, as in the original paper by Spouge, the answer has 38 good digits, which is less than in my version but also much more than a 64-bit float could deliver and perhaps more than Causley's technique could capture. (I do not mean to impugn Causley here! I just don't know exactly how he computed his values.)</p>
<p>However that may play out, there may be only one person who cares about the accuracy of the gamma function in Ivy. And that person thoroughly enjoyed exploring the topic and building a high-resolution, if necessarily imperfect, implementation.</p>

      <h1>I'm swearing off APIs entirely</h1>

(date: 2026-01-26)
      <p>
      <p>I got a lot of ideas for side projects rattling around in the old tin can. As part of my “No new projects” initiative, I’m trying to jump on building prototypes so I can decide if I want to explore ideas more or call it quits. A handful of my ideas are riffs or twists on existing app categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tennis ranking app… but modern and performant</li>
<li>A nearby historical marker app… but with CarPlay support</li>
<li>A nearby real estate listing app… but with CarPlay support</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of those have ended unceremoniously at the same dead end: no API access. USTA denied my application for tennis rankings. The aptly named Historical Marker Database site doesn’t have a public API. And you have to be an MLS® Realtor® or Broker to get access to the MLS® listings. Womp womp.</p>
<p>Scraping the data is always an option… but I don’t like the ethics of that and worry about the brittleness of that dependency.</p>
<p>Ugh. I wish I could build these little apps so that tens of people could enjoy them. I’d even be willing to pay a small API access fee ($10/mo?) and run these at a loss but whatever happened to free APIs. When I <a href="https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists">survey the land of public APIs</a> it feels like we’ve lost a lot since the Web 2.0 days where API access was almost a God-given right.</p>
<p>To prevent this time loop of disappointment from happening again, I’m swearing off APIs entirely. That’s a hard stance, but I need a backstop at the idea phase to prevent me from wasting limited life force. If I don’t have the data, or can’t generate the data, or it’s not an open protocol… it’s not worth building or even thinking about.</p>
<p>OAuth apps are a good option and generally the best way to exfiltrate data because it’s tied to a user’s account…. but you still might run into call limits, incomplete endpoints, user-scope limitations, and so on. History also shows us what the future holds. There’s a Tweetbot-style risk when building on a someone else’s platform. Even if your app drives activity to the parent application, your access might get cut because it competes or doesn’t drive stakeholder value. And if the idea isn’t big enough, being “a feature, not a product” is also a bad position to be in, lest you get Sherlock’d.</p>
<p>Where’s that leave me and my pile of side project ideas? Thankfully… in a good place. I can close out these project tabs and free up some much needed Brain RAM. It sounds strange but “No more APIs” makes “Making video games” jump up in the viability rankings for side projects too, because games have closed ecosystems. Or I could spend more time writing shitty sci-fi. Write a serial. Print some zines. Who knows.</p>
<p>If the goal of “No new projects” is to finish more projects than I start, then I have to accept that part of figuring out which ideas to explore means “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg">Nope</a>” is a potential answer. It’s also not a total loss, I’m learning along the way. For example, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/files/CarPlay-Developer-Guide.pdf">CarPlay only lets you choose from eight pre-approved templates</a>. There’s also pre-defined app categories and diverting in the slightest would almost guarantee App Store rejection. That sucks the fun out it… but ayyyy, I’ll probably try again. But now I know the limitation for future projects and its in the limitations where play begins.</p>

      <h1>the browser is the sandbox</h1>

(date: 2026-01-25)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/">the browser is the sandbox</a></strong></p>
<p>Paul Kinlan is a web platform developer advocate at Google and recently turned his attention to coding agents. He quickly identified the importance of a robust sandbox for agents to operate in and put together these detailed notes on how the web browser can help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This got me thinking about the browser. Over the last 30 years, we have built a sandbox specifically designed to run incredibly hostile, untrusted code from anywhere on the web, the instant a user taps a URL. [...]</p>
<p>Could you build something like Cowork in the browser? Maybe. To find out, I built a demo called <a href="http://co-do.xyz">Co-do</a> that tests this hypothesis. In this post I want to discuss the research I've done to see how far we can get, and determine if the browser's ability to run untrusted code is useful (and good enough) for enabling software to do more for us directly on our computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul then describes how the three key aspects of a sandbox - filesystem, network access and safe code execution - can be handled by browser technologies: the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access">File System Access API</a> (still Chrome-only as far as I can tell), CSP headers with <code>&lt;iframe sandbox&gt;</code> and WebAssembly in Web Workers.</p>
<p>Co-do is a very interesting demo that illustrates all of these ideas in a single application:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/codo.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Co-do application interface with robot logo. Left sidebar shows WORKSPACE section with &quot;Select Folder&quot; button, &quot;Selected folder: blog-drafts (Live updates enabled)&quot; in green text, and FILES list including gtr-t5-large.md, chatgpt.md, llm-digest-october-2..., weeknotes-2024-04-23..., lmarena-april-2025.md, weeknotes-chatgpt-fo..., tests-not-optional-c..., weeknotes-13-mar-202..., issue-for-notes.md, workshop-git-scrapin.... Main chat area shows user message &quot;Three most recently edited files?&quot; in orange bubble, &quot;Using 26 tools...&quot; dropdown, and AI response: &quot;Now I need to get the metadata for these files to find the most recently edited ones. Since there are many files, let me get metadata for a sample of them to find the recent ones:Based on the metadata I've gathered, the three most recently edited files are:&quot; followed by table with columns File and Last Modified showing predictions-2026.md (Jan 8, 2026), december-2025.md (Jan 2, 2026), gemini-3-flash.md (Dec 17, 2025). Green &quot;Response complete&quot; banner at bottom with input field placeholder &quot;Ask me to help with your files...&quot; and notice &quot;File contents are sent to your selected AI provider&quot;."></p>
<p>You select a folder full of files and configure an LLM provider and set an API key, Co-do then uses CSP-approved API calls to interact with that provider and provides a chat interface with tools for interacting with those files. It does indeed feel similar to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/12/claude-cowork/">Claude Cowork</a> but without running a multi-GB local container to provide the sandbox.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint about <code>&lt;iframe sandbox&gt;</code> remains how thinly documented it is, especially across different browsers. Paul's post has all sorts of useful details on that which I've not encountered elsewhere, including a complex <a href="https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/#the-double-iframe-technique">double-iframe technique</a> to help apply network rules to the inner of the two frames.</p>
<p>Thanks to this post I also learned about the <code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; webkitdirectory&gt;</code> tag which turns out to work on Firefox, Safari <em>and</em> Chrome and allows a browser read-only access to a full directory of files at once. I had Claude knock up a <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/webkitdirectory">webkitdirectory demo</a> to try it out and I'll certainly be using it for projects in the future.</p>

      <p>Random ramblings with past experience dealing with tech power.</p>
<p>As I think about next steps for building out from WordPress to create a network of users and their writing, I wanted to review how <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> came to be, when I did a <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2026/01/17/howXmlrpcStartedUp.html">podcast</a>, I found real gaps in my memory.</p>
<p>Then just a minute ago as I was browsing around the <a href="https://discuss.userland.com/">discuss.userland.com</a> archive I came across this post entitled <a href="https://discuss.userland.com/msg000280.html">How XML-RPC will Evolve</a>. This was in November 1998, five months after <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/07/14/xmlRpcForNewbies.html">XML-RPC for Newbies</a> and the Frontier implementation were released.</p>
<p>It was a few years before the W3C came out with their equivalent of XML-RPC, and as promised, Frontier supported it.</p>
<p>In fact, what a coincidence -- I worked on that <a href="http://soap.weblogs.com/">project</a> with Jake Savin, and we're once again working together on a project that's related to what we were doing then. It's also interesting that there are people to play the role that the three Microsoft people played, inside the WordPress community. And there is no one that can make them wait, as the Microsoft team in 1998 was stopped by their huge organization. But they were lucky to have me, someone completely outside their management structure, to decide to go ahead and release it.</p>
<p>One thing you can be sure of is it'll take more time for them than it did for you. Also it'll be more complex, and take more work to support. And you never will be able to fully support what they come up with, by design. So you just say Yeah! Let's do it, and in the meantime go ahead and develop the market. When people ask about the threat, we're on board. I had learned this from the experience with Apple and AppleScript. Take it in stride, don't assume they win just because they're large. Just take the bullet. And know that even if you do everything as best as you can, there is a cloud over your future.</p>
<p>Matt once said to me it was political, referring to RSS. Yes it was, everything about cooperation is political. But important point -- politics can be constructive, it doesn't have to destroy things. Even if everything goes smoothly as it did with XML-RPC, it's all still political. Yes, I really liked working with the Microsoft people, and I would have worked with them no matter where they came from. But it really helped build my confidence to know it came from inside the biggest most dominant tech company at the time. What an odd combination. Just like going to Harvard was political. Same thing, I would have done all the same work if I were at a smaller school without such a strong rep, but we were able to get more done because we were based there.</p>
<p>And btw, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10">Carney's story</a> at Davos about dealing with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">BigCo country</a> follows the same pattern. We didn't give Apple or the W3C awards, but net-net they were about as <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/impetuous">impetuous</a> as the country Carney was talking about. What he said there could have been a Davenet post from the 1990s.</p>
<p>PS: I think perhaps just for fun we should create an XML-RPC implementation of the wpcom API. I have just <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">the thing</a> to base it on.</p>
<p>PPS: At some point we're going to want to make it as easy to set up a WordPress site as it is to create a new Bluesky account, because the two things will be basically the same thing. Either one will get you access to a network of bloggers.</p>

This is the Palm Beach of Mar-a-Lago before the Mar-a-Lago of now. I’m a fast reader, and I’m already running through the series. The recent reading spree raised …</p>

      <h1>The four modes of AI-augmented technical writing</h1>

(date: 2026-01-25)
      <p>
      <p>I like cooking recipes. They’re clean, serene documents where, at some point, one or more utensils enter the stage to perform a task. If you were to write one on how to use AI to augment your work as a technical writer, though, you would have a hard time deciding when and where LLMs come out of the toolbox to aid you. The variety of flavors in which AI presents itself doesn’t help. This is why I’ve come up with a framework that describes applications of the different AI tools at our disposal.</p>

      <h1>Weekly Bookmarks</h1>

(date: 2026-01-25)
      <p>
      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/blog/46-the-death-of-the-book">The Death of the Book</a></h2>
<p>The life span of a book is more like that of the horse, or the human
being, sometimes the oak, even the redwood. Which is why it seems a good
idea, rather than mourning their death, to rejoice that books now have
two ways of staying alive, getting passed on, enduring, instead of only
one.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://github.com/raffomania/ties">ties:Federated website aggregator</a></h2>
<p>📚 A federated network to bookmark, share and discuss good web pages
with your friends.</p>
<p>It’s getting harder and harder to find good web pages. When you do find
good ones, it’s worth hanging onto them. ties is your own small corner
of the web, where you can keep your favorite pages, and share them with
your friends to help them find good web pages too.</p>
<p>🔭 ties is in an exploratory phase where we’re trying out different ways
to make it work well. You can try it out, but big and small things might
change with every update.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://pardalotus.tech/posts/2024-10-02-falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-dois/">Falsehoods Programmers believe about DOIs</a></h2>
<p>DOIs, or Digital Object Identifiers, are everywhere, for a given value
of ’everywhere’. They are the identifiers used to identify and link
research outputs, and a lot more besides.</p>
<p>Humans are good at spotting patterns, and with something as ubiquitous
as DOIs, there are plenty of patterns to spot. However, with hundreds of
millions of DOIs and decades of history, it pays not to make
generalisations.</p>
<p>These all cropped up in my 10 years at Crossref. Either observed in the
scholarly community using DOIs, or when writing software to find and
handle DOIs.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/a2c5551af2b74c3d84c775032c83a55e/view">Web Harvesting Services - Library of Congress</a></h2>
<p>A public call for new vendors to apply to do web archiving for the
Library of Congress.</p>
<p>I tried to archive it here:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260123140259/https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/a2c5551af2b74c3d84c775032c83a55e/view">https://web.archive.org/web/20260123140259/https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/a2c5551af2b74c3d84c775032c83a55e/view</a></p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/amazon-ring-cameras-ice">Activists Say Ring Cameras Are Being Used by ICE</a></h2>
<p>As US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wreak havoc on American
communities, big tech companies have been making themselves
indispensable to the increasingly tyrannical state.</p>
<p>Among them is Amazon subsidiary Ring, the company behind those AI
doorbell cameras that have exploded in popularity over the last few
years. Back in October, Ring announced that its devices would soon be
looped into a network of Flock AI surveillance cameras. That network, an
investigation by 404 Media found, has been available to local and
federal police and enforcement agencies like ICE — leaving many worried
that their Ring doorbell cams are now feeding into a government
panopticon.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42970039">Announcing the data.gov archive (law.harvard.edu)</a></h2>
<p>A discussion on HackerNews about the release of the data.gov archiving
effort by Harvard’s Library Innovation Lab. Interesting to see people
talking about why bittorrent wasn’t used.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://coar-notify.net/">COAR Notify</a></h2>
<p>The COAR Notify Protocol is a set of profiles, constraints and
conventions around the use of W3C Linked Data Notifications (LDN) to
integrate repository systems with relevant services in a distributed,
resilient and web-native architecture.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://dealing-with-bots.coar-repositories.org/">Dealing With Bots: A COAR Resource for Repository Managers</a></h2>
<p>In response to this, COAR convened the Dealing With Bots Task Group to
develop advice and supporting information for repository managers to
help them to deal with this phenomenon. This website is the primary
output of the Task Group.</p>
<p>One important conclusion from this work is that there is no “silver
bullet” solution to this problem. It is clear that the nature of traffic
on the Web has changed, and it seems certain that repositories will
continue to deal with a range of bots, both welcome and unwelcome, and
that the behaviour of such bots will in many cases be problematic.
Repositories will need to walk a fine line between protecting their
operations from being overwhelmed by traffic from unscrupulous actors,
and maintaining their core mission of providing open access to
legitimate users and machines.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/18/agent-psychosis/">Agent Psychosis: Are We Going Insane?</a></h2>
<p>Many of us got hit by the agent coding addiction. It feels good, we
barely sleep, we build amazing things. Every once in a while that
interaction involves other humans, and all of a sudden we get a reality
check that maybe we overdid it. The most obvious example of this is the
massive degradation of quality of issue reports and pull requests. As a
maintainer many PRs now look like an insult to one’s time, but when one
pushes back, the other person does not see what they did wrong. They
thought they helped and contributed and get agitated when you close it
down.</p>
<p>But it’s way worse than that. I see people develop parasocial
relationships with their AIs, get heavily addicted to it, and create
communities where people reinforce highly unhealthy behavior. How did we
get here and what does it do to us?</p>
<p>I will preface this post by saying that I don’t want to call anyone out
in particular, and I think I sometimes feel tendencies that I see as
negative, in myself as well. I too, have thrown some vibeslop up to
other people’s repositories.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight AgainstForgetting</a></h2>
<p>The scale of the operation is staggering, but the engineering challenge
is even deeper. How do you build a machine that can ingest the
sprawling, dynamic, and ever-changing World Wide Web in real-time? How
do you store that data for centuries when the average hard drive lasts
only a few years? And perhaps most critically, how do you pay for the
electricity, the bandwidth, and the legal defense funds required to keep
the lights on in an era where copyright law and digital preservation are
locked in a high-stakes collision?</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://00f.net/2026/01/19/xet-intro-1/">Anintroduction to XET, Hugging Face’s storage system (part 1)</a></h2>
<p>Models, datasets, and other artifacts are stored in Git repositories.
Large files are tracked via LFS pointer files, while the Hub’s storage
backend uses XET (with Git LFS compatibility), so you get Git workflows
plus chunk-level deduplication.</p>
<p>On the Hub, a lot of data is forked and versioned, and even small edits
can require uploading and storing a whole new large object, even when
most bytes are identical. Clearly suboptimal.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23">“The Power of the Powerless” - Vaclav Havel</a></h2>
<p>The singular, explosive, incalculable political power of living within
the truth resides in the fact that living openly within the truth has an
ally, invisible to be sure, but omnipresent: this hidden sphere. It is
from this sphere that life lived openly in the truth grows; it is to
this sphere that it speaks, and in it that it finds understanding. This
is where the potential for communication exists. But this place is
hidden and therefore, from the perspective of power, very dangerous. The
complex ferment that takes place within it goes on in semidarkness, and
by the time it finally surfaces into the light of day as an assortment
of shocking surprises to the system, it is usually too late to cover
them up in the usual fashion. Thus they create a situation in which the
regime is confounded, invariably causing panic and driving it to react
in inappropriate ways.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a></h2>
<p>Hi there! LÖVE is an <em>awesome</em> framework you can use to make 2D
games in Lua. It’s free, open-source, and works on Windows, macOS,
Linux, Android and iOS.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://woodenshoebooks.org/">Wooden ShoeBooks &amp; Records</a></h2>
<p>What Is Anarchism? What Is The Wooden Shoe? To put it simply, anarchism
is the the political philosophy that people are better off making
decisions for themselves, and communities making decisions for their
communities, rather than having any centralized power/governing body do
it for them. Furthermore, anarchism is opposed to capitalism and all
systems of oppression that attempt to exploit or control.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://cafebedouin.org/2026/01/19/kafkas-genocide-manual/">Kafka’s Genocide Manual</a></h2>
<p>But Kafka isn’t writing tragedy. He’s writing documentary. The Samsa
family is every family under economic pressure, and their
response—incremental dehumanization, bureaucratic violence,
self-justifying rhetoric—is the ordinary response. The work doesn’t ask
“how could they?” It shows how easily they do.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://overreacted.io/a-social-filesystem/">A Social Filesystem</a></h2>
<p>A file format is like a language. An app might “speak” several formats.
A single format can be understood by many apps. Apps and formats are
many-to-many. File formats let different apps work together without
knowing about each other.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nvidia-contacted-annas-archive-to-secure-access-to-millions-of-pirated-books/">NVIDIA Contacted Anna’s Archive to Secure Access to Millions of PiratedBooks</a></h2>
<p>NVIDIA executives allegedly authorized the use of millions of pirated
books from Anna’s Archive to fuel its AI training. In an expanded
class-action lawsuit that cites internal NVIDIA documents, several book
authors claim that the trillion-dollar company directly reached out to
Anna’s Archive, seeking high-speed access to the shadow library data.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://futurismrestated.substack.com/p/fr-150-guitarist-shane-parish-on?triedRedirect=true">FR 150: Shane Parish on Autechre Guitar, His Improbable and VirtuosicCovers Album</a></h2>
<p>Early last fall, I received an unexpected email from Bill Orcutt.
Unexpected, first of all, because I had no idea he knew who I was. The
contents of his message were even more surprising: Fingerstyle guitarist
Shane Parish was at work on an album of acoustic covers of Autechre;
would I like to write the liner notes?</p>
<p>I didn’t even need to hear Parish’s demos for the project to respond
with an emphatic yes. I was already a fan of his 2024 album Repertoire,
where he covered Aphex Twin and Kraftwerk along with Charles Mingus,
Eric Dolphy, and Alice Coltrane, and I’d been stunned to discover his
YouTube cover of Autechre’s “Slip.” I couldn’t wait to hear how he’d
translate Sean Booth and Rob Brown’s pristine electronics for six
strings and 10 fingers.</p>

      <h1>Kākāpō Cam: Rakiura live stream</h1>

<p>Critical update for this year's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-k-k-p-parrots-will-have-an-outstanding-breeding-season">Kākāpō breeding season</a>: the New Zealand Department of Conservation have a livestream running of Rakiura's nest!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re looking at the underground nest of 23-year-old Rakiura. She has chosen this same site to nest for all seven breeding seasons since 2008, a large cavity under a rātā tree. Because she returns to the site so reliably, we’ve been able to make modifications over the years to keep it safe and dry, including adding a well-placed hatch for monitoring eggs and chicks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rakiura is a legendary Kākāpō:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rakiura hatched on 19 February 2002 on Whenua Hou/Codfish Island. She is the offspring of Flossie and Bill. Her name comes from the te reo Māori name for Stewart Island, the place where most of the founding kākāpō population originated.</p>
<p>Rakiura has nine living descendants, three females and six males, across six breeding seasons. In 2008 came Tōitiiti, in 2009 Tamahou and Te Atapō, in 2011 Tia and Tūtoko, in 2014 Taeatanga and Te Awa, in 2019 Mati-mā and Tautahi. She also has many grandchicks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She laid her first egg of the season at 4:30pm NZ time on 22nd January. The livestream went live shortly afterwards, once she committed to this nest.</p>
<p>The stream is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfGL7A2YgUY">on YouTube</a>. I <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?dc78322de89a2191c593215f109c65d7/index.html">used Claude Code</a> to write <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/python/#livestream-gifpy">a livestream-gif.py script</a> and used that to capture this sped-up video of the last few hours of footage, within which you can catch a glimpse of the egg!</p>

      <h1>Cool URLs don’t change with snapshot testing</h1>

(date: 2026-01-25)
      <p>
      <p>I wrote automated tests to keep track of my site’s URLs and prevent links from breaking.</p>
<p>When I reorganised my site, I changed a lot of URLs and broke some inbound links. Now that more and more sites have started linking to my site, I don’t want to inadvertently break links again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs don't change</a> Tim Berners-Lee (1998)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post is NOT about <em>how</em> to implement <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/cool-urls-mean-something/">‘cool URLs’</a>. Too many ways to do that depending on the site’s setup and the site’s philosophy even. Rather, this post is about ensuring cool URLs — a <em>contract</em> to guarantee that published URLs continue to work. It doesn’t matter <em>how</em> your specific site implementation fulfil that contract.</p>
<p>There already exists a contract: a <em>social contract</em> when you publish a webpage. Other people can link to your URL on their sites, and you can link to other people’s content on your site in return. And we expect these inbound and outbound links to work, otherwise the World Wide Web would be pretty boring to browse.</p>
<p>A stronger contract is to treat URLs as a public API. Once published, it becomes an interface other people depend on. Changing it is a breaking change, just like changing a function signature.</p>
<p>If it’s an API, can we perhaps run automated tests against it?</p>
<h2>Testing URLs automatically</h2>
<p>Your website could be a static site, a Java Spring Boot thing, or a PHP server, it doesn’t matter as long as it serves HTML over HTTP.</p>
<p>Essentially, the test is to fetch each URL off a list of known URLs and check expected responses.</p>
<pre><code>test.each([
  ['/', 200],
  ['/about', 200],
  ['/about/', 200],
  ['/signin', 301, '/login'],
  ['/news', 302, '/en-US/news'],
  ['/api/ping', 204],
  ['/dashboard', 403],
  ['/secret', 404],
])('%s %i', async (path, status, location) =&gt; {
  const res = await fetch(base + path, { redirect: 'manual' });
  expect(res.status).toBe(status);
  if (location) expect(res.headers.get('location')).toBe(location);
});
</code></pre>
<p>But manually writing a test case for every URL would be a pain. Updating tests is also tedious. This is where snapshot testing comes in.</p>
<h2>Snapshot testing</h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is via <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing">snapshot testing</a> (or <a href="https://ro-che.info/articles/2017-12-04-golden-tests">golden tests</a>).</p>
<p>Snapshot testing takes a record of the system’s behaviour and saves that as a baseline or ‘golden file’ against which future versions of the system are compared.</p>
<p>In my case, the snapshot is the set of URLs my site serves. A ‘snap’ involves a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">crawler</a> gathering all the URLs and writing them to a text file. Unlike snapshot testing approaches that inline values in the test code, I prefer to keep this snapshot as a separate artifact so changes can be reviewed more easily.</p>
<pre><code>/
/about/
/notes/
/wares/
/wares/pong-ai/
...and so on...

</code></pre>
<p>Then when I make refactors or any code change, I can run the crawler again and compare the snapshots. Any difference to the baseline is treated as a breaking change unless explicitly approved.</p>
<p>The interesting part is using git to turn that comparison into an enforced check.</p>
<h2>Snapshot testing with git</h2>
<p>With git, I don’t actually need to ‘write tests’ or use a testing framework.</p>
<p>git is the testing framework.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To run tests, run the crawler and check the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#Documentation/git-diff.txt---exit-code">exit code</a> of <code>git diff --quiet -- path/to/snapshot</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To debug failures, <code>git diff</code> can show me the expected and actual values, just like a testing framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To approve changes to the baseline, I commit the snapshot file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Preventing accidental changes is the real goal, so a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">pre-commit hook</a> is set up to abort commits when the snapshot contains an unapproved change.</p>
<pre><code># pre-commit
./tests/my-crawler &gt;git-hooks/pre-commit.log 2&gt;&amp;1
if ! git diff --quiet -- tests/url-snapshot; then
  echo &quot;URL snapshot file changed. Commit aborted.&quot;
  exit 1
fi
</code></pre>
<p>With this, any change to URLs must be intentional, like with public APIs. It’s like URLs as versioned public API.</p>
<p>If I wanted to restructure my site again, I now have a way to check how existing URLs would have been taken care of (e.g. redirected).</p>
<p>As a bonus, this also helps prevent me from accidentally publishing draft posts (which I’ve done a few times)!</p>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s like Page Indexing tracking in Google Search Console.<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/cool-urls-with-snapshot-testing/google-search-console.png?ref=rss" alt="Screenshot of Google Search Console showing indexed URLs">This used to tell me when a URL suddenly goes 404 or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Status code can be included in the snapshot so it can explicitly keep track of unreachable URLs (which by definition, won’t be crawled).</p>
<pre><code>200 /
200 /about/
200 /notes/
200 /wares/
404 /portfolio/
...and so on...
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crawler can even use the snapshot itself as starting points for the crawl, instead of starting from just the root <code>/</code>. This way, the snapshot does not forget URLs. Once published, a URL is either a 200 or a 404. It’s like bookmarking every page on your site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This could be extended to track other page properties as well, such as the canonical URL. Anything that is often overlooked or auto-generated that you might want to review before deploying.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applicability to different kinds of websites (in order)</h2>
<p>For static <strong>plain HTML</strong> sites like mine, it’s probably not going to be very useful. URLs change only when you move HTML files around. No surprises here. But since I tend to forget about things and refactor stuff for the fun of it, this will still be a good thing as a self-imposed rule for future me ( <em>a contract with myself?</em>).</p>
<p>I have broken the CSS on this site countless times due to CSS refactors. I’ve been meaning to do <em>visual</em> snapshot testing to keep refactors at bay but visual snapshot testing is noisy, not to mention slow. Definitely not a pre-commit thing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for sites made with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">static site builders</a>, explicitly reviewing changes to site structure could be better than relying on assumptions about the internal route-generation logic of the site generator. This is if you’re not already checking in the generated files in source control, at which point the URL snapshot is kinda redundant.</p>
<p>For a complex site with <strong>servers</strong>, rewrite rules, frameworks, or proxies, a version of this snapshotting routine could be set up to help prevent unwanted changes, but it couldn’t be git-based anymore if you have database-driven or otherwise dynamic URLs.</p>
<p>Sites based on client-side routing won’t work at all, unless the crawler is more advanced and can execute JS (hard).</p>
<h2>Closing notes</h2>
<p>Treats URLs as versioned, reviewable artifacts. Once published, they stop being an implementation detail and start being something you should consciously maintain.</p>
<p>URL mappings are often treated as emergent properties of a web server (nested routes? wildcard routes?) or a site generator’s build system. An explicit exhaustive URL listing makes them more tangible.</p>
<p>I wrote a lot about testing and APIs and philosophy but in the end it’s basically a crawler sitemap + git. :D</p>

      <h1>Don't "Trust the Process"</h1>

(date: 2026-01-24)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM">Don't &quot;Trust the Process&quot;</a></strong></p>
<p>Jenny Wen, Design Lead at Anthropic (and previously Director of Design at Figma) gave a provocative keynote at Hatch Conference in Berlin last September.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/dont-trust-process.jpg" alt="Don't &quot;Trust the process&quot; slide, speaker shown on the left"></p>
<p>Jenny argues that the Design Process - user research leading to personas leading to user journeys leading to wireframes... all before anything gets built - may be outdated for today's world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: In a world where anyone can make anything — what matters is your ability to choose and curate what you make.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In place of the Process, designers should lean into prototypes. AI makes these much more accessible and less time-consuming than they used to be.</p>
<p>Watching this talk made me think about how AI-assisted programming significantly reduces the cost of building the <em>wrong</em> thing. Previously if the design wasn't right you could waste months of development time building in the wrong direction, which was a very expensive mistake. If a wrong direction wastes just a few days instead we can take more risks and be much more proactive in exploring the problem space.</p>
<p>I've always been a compulsive prototyper though, so this is very much playing into my own existing biases!</p>

      <h1>Waiting for the power to go out</h1>

(date: 2026-01-24)
      <p>
      <p><code>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only. Read more about RSS Club. </code></p>
<p>It’s expected to freeze this evening in Austin and we may even see snow, which is exciting and novel for us Texans. But as we’ve learned in 2021 and 2023, cold snaps can lead to disaster. In those years the ice dealt untold damages as foot-thick tree limbs fell from the canopy like enormous glass Cadillacs. The crackle, pop, followed by crystalline shatter in the cold dead air is a sound I won’t forget. With the falling trees came down power lines and the lights went out.</p>
<p>It got worse. <a href="https://www.kut.org/the-disconnect">The disconnected Texas power grid failed</a>. As homes and empty office buildings required more heating in the “extreme” cold, the rolling blackouts began to shed load. Except… they didn’t roll. Homes next to facilities (hospitals, fire stations, and water treatment plants) deemed critical were fine, but the rest of us were off-grid in the cold for nearly a week. The energy companies could have met capacity, but quit making energy because they would have had to sell it at a loss. Greed until the state promised them a windfall.</p>
<p>The infrastructure failed. Pipes burst, homes flooded, and trauma increased. While our senator and his banker wife fled to Mexico to stay in a Ritz Carlton, Texans burned their IKEA furniture and cedar fences to stay warm.</p>
<p>Building on past lessons, we’ve made all the preparations for today; external faucets capped, plants covered, and I built a cabinet out of foam board insulation for our external hot water heater. And now we wait… we wait to see if the Libertarian Capitalist systems my state has put into place will hold up. Waiting to see if the power goes out. Waiting for the impending disaster.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever had a child, you might know this feeling. You’ve taken the classes, assembled the crib, child-proofed the outlets, and then you wait… you wait for your life to change. While the miracle of childbirth is a beautiful event, any mother can tell you it’s not without some drawbacks. From prolonged labor, painful contractions, episiotomies, and beyond… every birth is a dice-roll of potentially life-threatening complications. A friend of mine who had three kids described it well; “Having a baby is like knowing you’ll be in a car accident.”</p>
<p>That feeling of pregnant, expectant waiting dominates a lot of my life right now as I wait for all the larger meta narratives in our country to unravel. I’m waiting for a mid-term election, one where I feel the fabric of democracy hangs by a thread. I’m waiting for an opposition party that has a fucking plan, but I don’t see one yet. I’m waiting for a particular person to leave office… or (preferred) die of natural causes. I’m waiting for the full release of the Epstein files, so the victims of billionaire pedophilia and human trafficking can have justice. I’m waiting for the government to stop its reign of cruelty on its own people, but masked fascists killed another innocent person in broad daylight today. I’m waiting for the economy to work for most Americans, not only the wealthy. I’m waiting for either the tech bubble to pop or for the robots to take my job… either way I’d like this story line to wrap up soon but I must ask, is there a third option? I’m waiting for the next big thing and praying it’s something that makes the world more loving and kind, but a new global religion would be a lot to deal with right now.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/17/reallySimpleCola.png" alt="">I've been <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bluesky">following Bluesky</a> since inception, even tried developing for it and found it was nothing new with its 300 character limit, no links, titles, etc. Basically you can build the same apps for Bluesky that we were able to develop for Twitter. I've also been following <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leaflet.pub/post/3md4qsqncqs24">Leaflet</a>, an attractive writing tool that works on AT Proto, the format that Bluesky is promoting, basically a reinvention of the web but inside a silo, which means -- perhaps confusingly, that Leaflet uses the same basic format that Bluesky uses, but Bluesky can't do anything with Leaflet posts, because of the limits that Leaflet doesn't have. So -- they formed an alliance with two other products that are writing tools for AT Proto, and came up with a format that they will all implement called <a href="https://standard.site/">standard.site</a> (nice name and very attractive site). They probably hope that Bluesky itself will use that format, at least to let people read their documents in the same place they display the more limited Bluesky posts, in user timelines. If that happens it may be a good thing for the web, if services outside of Bluesky can post these documents from outside. But it would be imho more powerful if they created a format based on something like RSS, which is already well-known to developers, and would mean something outside of Bluesky and probably would be taken more seriously by the Bluesky people. There is no advantage that I can discern for creating a new format that only works in Bluesky.</p>

      <h1>Wilson Lin on FastRender: a browser built by thousands of parallel agents</h1>

(date: 2026-01-23)
      <p>
      <p>Last week Cursor published <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents">Scaling long-running autonomous coding</a>, an article describing their research efforts into coordinating large numbers of autonomous coding agents. One of the projects mentioned in the article was <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender">FastRender</a>, a web browser they built from scratch using their agent swarms. I wanted to learn more so I asked Wilson Lin, the engineer behind FastRender, if we could record a conversation about the project. That 47 minute video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4">now available on YouTube</a>. I've included some of the highlights below.</p>
<p>See my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/19/scaling-long-running-autonomous-coding/">previous post</a> for my notes and screenshots from trying out FastRender myself.</p>
<h4>What FastRender can do right now</h4>
<p>We started the conversation with a demo of FastRender loading different pages ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=195s">03:15</a>). The JavaScript engine isn't working yet so we instead loaded <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender">github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://cnn.com">CNN</a> - all of which were usable, if a little slow to display.</p>
<p>JavaScript had been disabled by one of the agents, which decided to add a feature flag! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=242s">04:02</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript is disabled right now. The agents made a decision as they were currently still implementing the engine and making progress towards other parts... they decided to turn it off or put it behind a feature flag, technically.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>From side-project to core research</h4>
<p>Wilson started what become FastRender as a personal side-project to explore the capabilities of the latest generation of frontier models - Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.1, and GPT-5.2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=56s">00:56</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>FastRender was a personal project of mine from, I'd say, November. It was an experiment to see how well frontier models like Opus 4.5 and back then GPT-5.1 could do with much more complex, difficult tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A browser rendering engine was the ideal choice for this, because it's both <em>extremely</em> ambitious and complex but also well specified. And you can visually see how well it's working! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=117s">01:57</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As that experiment progressed, I was seeing better and better results from single agents that were able to actually make good progress on this project. And at that point, I wanted to see, well, what's the next level? How do I push this even further?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once it became clear that this was an opportunity to try multiple agents working together it graduated to an official Cursor research project, and available resources were amplified.</p>
<p>The goal of FastRender was never to build a browser to compete with the likes of Chrome. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=2512s">41:52</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We never intended for it to be a production software or usable, but we wanted to observe behaviors of this harness of multiple agents, to see how they could work at scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The great thing about a browser is that it has such a large scope that it can keep serving experiments in this space for many years to come. JavaScript, then WebAssembly, then WebGPU... it could take many years to run out of new challenges for the agents to tackle.</p>
<h4>Running thousands of agents at once</h4>
<p>The most interesting thing about FastRender is the way the project used multiple agents working in parallel to build different parts of the browser. I asked how many agents were running at once: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=324s">05:24</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the peak, when we had the stable system running for one week continuously, there were approximately 2,000 agents running concurrently at one time. And they were making, I believe, thousands of commits per hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project has <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/commits/main/">nearly 30,000 commits</a>!</p>
<p>How do you run 2,000 agents at once? They used <em>really big machines</em>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=356s">05:56</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simple approach we took with the infrastructure was to have a large machine run one of these multi-agent harnesses. Each machine had ample resources, and it would run about 300 agents concurrently on each. This was able to scale and run reasonably well, as agents spend a lot of time thinking, and not just running tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point we switched to a live demo of the harness running on one of those big machines ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=392s">06:32</a>). The agents are arranged in a tree structure, with planning agents firing up tasks and worker agents then carrying them out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=434s">07:14</a></p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/wilson-lin-agents.jpg" alt="Terminal window showing a tmux session running &quot;grind-swarm&quot; task manager with RUNNING status. Header shows &quot;grind-swarm – 45:54:15&quot; with stats &quot;planners: 9 (0 done) | tasks: 111 working, 0 pending, 232 done | 12900.9M↑ 514.1M↓&quot;.

Bottom status bar shows &quot;grind-css0:target/release/grind-swarm*&quot; and &quot;streamyard.com is sharing your screen&quot; notification with timestamp &quot;12:02 22-Jan-26&quot;."></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This cluster of agents is working towards building out the CSS aspects of the browser, whether that's parsing, selector engine, those features. We managed to push this even further by splitting out the browser project into multiple instructions or work streams and have each one run one of these harnesses on their own machine, so that was able to further parallelize and increase throughput.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But don't all of these agents working on the same codebase result in a huge amount of merge conflicts? Apparently not: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=501s">08:21</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've noticed that most commits do not have merge conflicts. The reason is the harness itself is able to quite effectively split out and divide the scope and tasks such that it tries to minimize the amount of overlap of work. That's also reflected in the code structure—commits will be made at various times and they don't tend to touch each other at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to be the key trick for unlocking benefits from parallel agents: if planning agents do a good enough job of breaking up the work into non-overlapping chunks you can bring hundreds or even thousands of agents to bear on a problem at once.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Wilson found that GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2 were a better fit for this work than the coding specialist GPT-5.1-Codex: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=1048s">17:28</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some initial findings were that the instructions here were more expansive than merely coding. For example, how to operate and interact within a harness, or how to operate autonomously without interacting with the user or having a lot of user feedback. These kinds of instructions we found worked better with the general models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked what the longest they've seen this system run without human intervention: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=1108s">18:28</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So this system, once you give an instruction, there's actually no way to steer it, you can't prompt it, you're going to adjust how it goes. The only thing you can do is stop it. So our longest run, all the runs are basically autonomous. We don't alter the trajectory while executing. [...]</p>
<p>And so the longest at the time of the post was about a week and that's pretty close to the longest. Of course the research project itself was only about three weeks so you know we probably can go longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Specifications and feedback loops</h4>
<p>An interesting aspect of this project design is feedback loops. For agents to work autonomously for long periods of time they need as much useful context about the problem they are solving as possible, combined with effective feedback loops to help them make decisions.</p>
<p>The FastRender repo <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/tree/19bf1036105d4eeb8bf3330678b7cb11c1490bdc/specs">uses git submodules to include relevant specifications</a>, including csswg-drafts, tc39-ecma262 for JavaScript, whatwg-dom, whatwg-html and more. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=846s">14:06</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feedback loops to the system are very important. Agents are working for very long periods continuously, and without guardrails and feedback to know whether what they're doing is right or wrong it can have a big impact over a long rollout. Specs are definitely an important part—you can see lots of comments in the code base that AI wrote referring specifically to specs that they found in the specs submodules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-5.2 is a vision-capable model, and part of the feedback loop for FastRender included taking screenshots of the rendering results and feeding those back into the model:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=983s">16:23</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the earlier evolution of this project, when it was just doing the static renderings of screenshots, this was definitely a very explicit thing we taught it to do. And these models are visual models, so they do have that ability. We have progress indicators to tell it to compare the diff against a golden sample.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strictness of the Rust compiler helped provide a feedback loop as well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=952s">15:52</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nice thing about Rust is you can get a lot of verification just from compilation, and that is not as available in other languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>The agents chose the dependencies</h4>
<p>We talked about the <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/blob/19bf1036105d4eeb8bf3330678b7cb11c1490bdc/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml dependencies</a> that the project had accumulated, almost all of which had been selected by the agents themselves.</p>
<p>Some of these, like <a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a> for 2D graphics rendering or <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz">HarfBuzz</a> for text shaping, were obvious choices. Others such as <a href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy">Taffy</a> felt like they might go against the from-scratch goals of the project, since that library implements CSS flexbox and grid layout algorithms directly. This was not an intended outcome. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=1673s">27:53</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly these are dependencies that the agent picked to use for small parts of the engine and perhaps should have actually implemented itself. I think this reflects on the importance of the instructions, because I actually never encoded specifically the level of dependencies we should be implementing ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The agents vendored in Taffy and <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/commits/main/vendor/taffy">applied a stream of changes</a> to that vendored copy.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=1878s">31:18</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's currently vendored. And as the agents work on it, they do make changes to it. This was actually an artifact from the very early days of the project before it was a fully fledged browser... it's implementing things like the flex and grid layers, but there are other layout methods like inline, block, and table, and in our new experiment, we're removing that completely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inclusion of QuickJS despite the presence of a home-grown ecma-rs implementation has a fun origin story:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=2115s">35:15</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe it mentioned that it pulled in the QuickJS because it knew that other agents were working on the JavaScript engine, and it needed to unblock itself quickly. [...]</p>
<p>It was like, eventually, once that's finished, let's remove it and replace with the proper engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love how similar this is to the dynamics of a large-scale human engineering team, where you could absolutely see one engineer getting frustrated at another team not having delivered yet and unblocking themselves by pulling in a third-party library.</p>
<h4>Intermittent errors are OK, actually</h4>
<p>Here's something I found really surprising: the agents were allowed to introduce small errors into the codebase as they worked! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=2382s">39:42</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the trade-offs was: if you wanted every single commit to be a hundred percent perfect, make sure it can always compile every time, that might be a synchronization bottleneck. [...]</p>
<p>Especially as you break up the system into more modularized aspects, you can see that errors get introduced, but small errors, right? An API change or some syntax error, but then they get fixed really quickly after a few commits. So there's a little bit of slack in the system to allow these temporary errors so that the overall system can continue to make progress at a really high throughput. [...]</p>
<p>People may say, well, that's not correct code. But it's not that the errors are accumulating. It's a stable rate of errors. [...] That seems like a worthwhile trade-off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're going to have thousands of agents working in parallel optimizing for throughput over correctness turns out to be a strategy worth exploring.</p>
<h4>A single engineer plus a swarm of agents in January 2026</h4>
<p>The thing I find most interesting about FastRender is how it demonstrates the extreme edge of what a single engineer can achieve in early 2026 with the assistance of a swarm of agents.</p>
<p>FastRender may not be a production-ready browser, but it represents over a million lines of Rust code, written in a few weeks, that can already render real web pages to a usable degree.</p>
<p>A browser really is the ideal research project to experiment with this new, weirdly shaped form of software engineering.</p>
<p>I asked Wilson how much mental effort he had invested in browser rendering compared to agent co-ordination. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrAcTf2pL4&amp;t=694s">11:34</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The browser and this project were co-developed and very symbiotic, only because the browser was a very useful objective for us to measure and iterate the progress of the harness. The goal was to iterate on and research the multi-agent harness—the browser was just the research example or objective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FastRender is effectively using a full browser rendering engine as a &quot;hello world&quot; exercise for multi-agent coordination!</p>

      <p>Really interesting <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/cyber-toolkits-update/">blog post</a> from Anthropic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a recent evaluation of AI models’ cyber capabilities, current Claude models can now succeed at multistage attacks on networks with dozens of hosts using only standard, open-source tools, instead of the custom tools needed by previous generations. This illustrates how barriers to the use of AI in relatively autonomous cyber workflows are rapidly coming down, and highlights the importance of security fundamentals like promptly patching known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>A notable development during the testing of Claude Sonnet 4.5 is that the model can now succeed on a minority of the networks without the custom cyber toolkit needed by previous generations. In particular, Sonnet 4.5 can now exfiltrate all of the (simulated) personal information in a high-fidelity simulation of the Equifax data breach—­one of the costliest cyber attacks in history—­using only a Bash shell on a widely-available Kali Linux host (standard, open-source tools for penetration testing; not a custom toolkit). Sonnet 4.5 accomplishes this by instantly recognizing a publicized CVE and writing code to exploit it without needing to look it up or iterate on it. Recalling that the original Equifax breach happened by exploiting a publicized CVE that had not yet been patched, the prospect of highly competent and fast AI agents leveraging this approach underscores the pressing need for security best practices like prompt updates and patches. ...</p>

      <h1>2026-01-08 Shared block lists for the scrapers</h1>
<p>The artificial intelligence bros are scraping the net and they don’t care if the small websites fall over or not for days on end. But you already know all that. It’s the founding story of my <a href="Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian Jihad</a>.</p>
<p>The setup I use is documented <a href="https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index">elsewhere</a>. If you have a different setup and would still like to access the list of IP addresses I’m currently blocking, maybe to block them yourself, after careful review… You do carefully review these lists, right? … Right? 😏 Well, in any case, also as a kind of explanation of what is happening, here are some files I’m regenerating every hour:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/share/1w-ban-ipv4.txt">blocked IPv4 address ranges</a></li>
<li><a href="/share/1w-ban-ipv6.txt">blocked IPv6 address ranges</a></li>
<li><a href="/share/1w-ban-asn.txt">blocked ASN</a></li>
<li><a href="/admin/publish-f2b.sh">the script</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I’m blocking the ASN by looking up all the IP address ranges they are managing and blocking them.
So the list of address ranges is the result but the list of ASNs is the intent.</p>

      <h1>Hocus-Pocus</h1>

(date: 2026-01-23)
      <p>
      <p>For many, many reasons I loathe how genAI gets built into tools: both
when it’s advertised proudly as the next big feature, and when it is
obscured behind layers of technical cruft.</p>
<p>But, I’m ashamed to admit, recently a little devil whispered in my ear
that there are some aspects of research where genAI coupled with human
review can be helpful?</p>
<p>Consider this example…</p>
<p>I need to evaluate whether a set of publications were authored by a
given person, where there are tens of thousands of people and hundreds
of thousands of publications. Rather than reviewing each of them by hand
I:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>sample the people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>send a prompt off to the model that asks if the name of the given person
authored a list of publications (with all the usual hocus-pocus
instructions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…crazy insane wasteful computation happens…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>model says YES or NO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I review all the NOs and change it to YES if it looks like the model was
wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate percent NO</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming the sample size was calculated correctly, can I say that the
percent NO is a lower bound on how many are incorrect, with some
confidence and margin of error?</p>
<p>If the genAI got a bunch of them wrong, where some of the YES should
really be NO, the percent NO is just going to increase right?</p>
<p><a href="mailto:ehs@pobox.com">Tell me</a> how this method is
wrongheaded, please? Or, if you’ve seen this discussed elsewhere <a href="mailto:ehs@pobox.com">send me</a> a link?</p>

      <h1>Hello World! I'm Back to Blogging!</h1>

(date: 2026-01-23)
      <p>
      <p>Hello World! I’m back to blogging after a long hiatus of two whole years. People have been kindly asking how’s my life going. Since I haven’t written a blog post for so long, some people may be wondering if I quietly starved to death due to the lack of a full-time job, or just grabbed the 100 million dollars that the community donated to me <a href="/en/2024/01/bye-rstudio/">in 2024</a> and retired to a tropical island.</p>
<p>Just kidding. I still live in Nebraska (although sometimes I do feel like being frozen to death—this week happens to be terribly cold). As a Nebraskan, I feel obliged to “support modern digital infrastructure” for my whole life because otherwise this XKCD cartoon would be a lot less fun:</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png" alt="The XKCD cartoon on dependency"></a></p>
<p>Of course, I’m not really like the Nebraskan in the cartoon with that much burden on the shoulders, but I did have had two busy years. My sincere apologies for having not responded to your emails or messages yet—I got too many of them in January 2024 alone and was unable to catch up. I will try to reply to them gradually in the coming months this year. At least I have owed a lot of thanks to people who supported me in various ways over the past two years. Anyway, here is a public thank-you note to all my sponsors:</p>
<h2>Thank you, sponsors!</h2>
<p>I can’t express how much I appreciate your support! Although I sent a message to my Github sponsors on Feb 6, 2024 (and updated the blog post) telling them that the sponsorship would no longer be necessary, some generous friends still continued their sponsorship. In fact, 31 of them stayed all the way through this point.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r"># use github api to find out the name and link of a username
github_info = function(user) {
    Sys.sleep(.1)
    res = tryCatch(
      xfun::github_api(paste0('/users/', user)),
      error = function(e) {
        message('https://github.com/', user, ' not found')
        NULL
      }
    )
    c(res$name %||% '', res$blog %||% '')
}
info = list()
# USERS are obtained from https://github.com/sponsors/yihui
for (u in USERS) {
    if (is.null(info[[u]])) info[[u]] = github_info(u)
}
info = do.call(rbind, info)  # first column: name; second column: link
# clean up @ links (e.g. emails)
info[grepl('@', info[, 2]) &amp; !grepl('^https://', info[, 2]), 2] = ''
# add the https:// prefix if missing
i = !grepl('^https?://', info[, 2]) &amp; info[, 2] != ''
info[i, 2] = paste0('https://', info[i, 2])
# if link is present but name is missing, use username
i = info[, 1] == '' &amp; info[, 2] != ''

gh_link = sprintf(

)
# if user has a link, output

links = links[order(info[, 1] == '', info[, 1])]

<ul>
<li>WeChat sponsors</li>
</ul>
<p>I also received several donations on WeChat, but unfortunately it’s not possible to programmatically scrape the names, so I can only say that I really appreciate your generous help via WeChat Pay in 2024!</p>
<p>Throughout January 2024, I kept getting Github notifications about new sponsors, and felt as if it were raining dollars to my house every day! I was totally unprepared to become the second richest man here in Omaha, Nebraska (watch out, Mr. Warren Buffett, I’m catching up!). Jokes aside, I am deeply touched by the outpouring of support from so many people around the world.</p>
<p>For the sake of transparency, I received about 30,000 USD in total from more than 300 sponsors in the past two years. Unfortunately, I thought the money could be treated as donation and hence not subject to income tax, but when filing taxes the next year, I realized it would be too complicated to provide proofs to IRS (I received the 1099-NEC form from Github), so I just let IRS eat a part of it (not sure how much because it was mixed with my other income). Anyway, with full gratitude in my heart, I donated and gave back about $15,000 from the remaining money to various open-source projects and individuals, among which 5000 euros went to the R Foundation.</p>
<p>What was even more valuable than the sponsorship money was <a href="https://github.com/yihui/yihui.org/discussions/1555">the kind words and wishes</a> under my previous post. I regard them as the most honorable award I have ever received in my life. Thank you all so much for letting me have an idea in advance what my funeral would be like! If I were a passer, I would have thought that the guy who wrote the blog post must have died…</p>
<h2>Contract work</h2>
<p>On the job side, I’ve been working as a contractor for Posit (continuing to maintain the R Markdown ecosystem), Swiss Re, and Merck.</p>
<p>George Bakoloukas from Swiss Re was <a href="https://github.com/yihui/yihui.org/discussions/1555#discussioncomment-8064924">the first</a> to offer me a contract job after I announced my departure from Posit, and I’m very grateful for his trust and support. Working with Swiss Re has been a very valuable experience to me, because it was the first time that I have dipped my toes into the (insurance) industry as a software developer to watch closely how they use the tools developed by me and others. I worked purely on the tools side, not on actuarial or insurance modeling. One funny thing is that I went to college in 2002, aiming to become an actuary, but later I found this path was too hard for me after taking courses like insurance, accounting, actuarial mathematics, and interest theory, etc., and I finally switched to statistics…</p>
<p>I spent most of 2024 with Swiss Re, and in 2025 I started working with Merck primarily. It was also the first time that I had walked into the pharmaceutical industry. I’d like to thank <a href="https://keaven.github.io">Keaven Anderson</a> and <a href="https://nanx.me">Nan Xiao</a> from Merck for the quick rescue. I got the job in March 2024 but worked very lightly until 2025. Similarly, I worked on the tools side and don’t have much subject-matter knowledge about pharmaceuticals, but I have enough interesting things to keep me busy.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the flexibility and freedom offered to me by Posit, Swiss Re, and Merck. This year I might come back to a long-time interest of mine: (interactive) data visualization. It’s still at the prototype stage, so I can’t say much about it now.</p>
<h2>Life</h2>
<p>Before she can read, I want to take this opportunity to “blame” it on her for consuming so much of my time since May 2024. I can’t believe my third kid is 20 months old now, nor can I believe my oldest son is about to go to middle school. You can imagine what a blessing it is to have one kid kicking a soccer ball against the wall, one constantly asking you where his crayon or glue is (and you can’t just tell him to look at <code>.libPaths()</code> or try <code>install.packages(c('crayon', 'glue'))</code>), and one reaching and smashing your keyboard while you work from home.</p>
<p>Now I think you can forgive me for not having responded to your messages yet.</p>
<p>I only traveled three times in the two years. Once to UC Berkeley to give a talk, once to visit families in China, and once to New Zealand (for the first time) to give the Ihaka lecture. One most memorable moment was when I climbed to the top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maungawhau_/_Mount_Eden">Maungawhau</a> (Mt Eden) volcano in Auckland (in my flip-flops, as usual). I had known the <code>vocalno</code> dataset in base R for nearly 20 years, and finally I got to see the real volcano in person!</p>
<p>My limited spare time was mostly devoted to cooking, reading, gardening, and badminton. Occasionally I also do karaoke at home, and I think I have improved a little bit (although vibrato is still hard like hell for me).</p>
<h2>A personal project</h2>
<p>As indicated in my previous post, I wished to pursue minimalism further. Before my daughter was born, I spent about a month on writing a lightweight version of R Markdown called <a href="https://github.com/yihui/litedown"><strong>litedown</strong></a> almost from scratch. The goal was to get rid of many dependencies (including Pandoc and <strong>knitr</strong>), with a focus on HTML output. This was an interesting experiment, and meant to be my last “*down” package. I don’t expect it to be widely adopted, although it’s powerful enough to me and I’d like to call it nearly feature-complete. Unfortunately, I haven’t had enough time to finish the documentation.</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>Working as a contractor was quite challenging for me in the beginning, but I’ve adapted to it gradually and found the proper cadence. I like the flexibility it offers, despite the instability of income, which doesn’t bother me much (e.g., when I’m sick, I’ll be on my own since there is usually no paid “sick leave” for contractors, but I can work for extra hours if I really want to make it up, and I’ve never felt I need to). This year I’ll still be working primarily for Merck.</p>
<p>I have many topics on my mind for future blogging, and aim to write at least one post per week. If you have suggestions on the topics, I’m all ears.</p>
<p>To my Chinese blog readers: many of you must have known that I batch publish all my Chinese posts once in a long while, and the last time I published was 3.5 years ago. I haven’t written a single post since 2024 until last month, when I made a decision that may surprise you—I plan to write fiction for a few years. Specifically, I’ll write fictional letters. Each letter’s topic will be from a song, and I’ll publish my karaoke recording at the end of each letter. To be honest, this feels quite embarrassing to me when I came up with the idea, because I’m not really good at singing. Nonetheless, I still want to leave some vocal records in my blog. I believe that imperfection also has its value.</p>
<p>I have added a very subtle “Donate” button at the bottom of each post. If you don’t look carefully, it should be easy for you to miss it, which was a deliberate choice of mine. If any of my post or software package is helpful to you, you may click the button to make a donation. I have zero expectation on how much money I can get from it, but I just want to keep the channel open for those who wish to support me in this way. Some people have suggested that I set up a paid subscription service for my blog or a private newsletter, but I’d like to keep my writings completely open and don’t want to sell anything. I think voluntary donations would be a better way to go.</p>
<p>That said, I do have a vague idea about a paid service—humor as a service (HaaS), with a premise that “if you don’t laugh, it’s free”. I think I’m relatively good at generating fun, but I have no idea when I’ll have time to implement this idea...</p>
<p>Originally I planned to write this post on Jan 4 to mark the two-year anniversary, but my daughter kindly passed a certain virus to me from her daycare, and I had to postpone it. Then I thought I should finish this post on Jan 19—my grandma’s birthday (she passed away in 2003 and I wrote <a href="/cn/2022/11/snow-date/">a short story</a> in memory of her in 2022), but was again interrupted by other things.</p>
<p>Finally, here I am. Hello world! Happy new year, everyone!</p>

      <h1>SSH has no Host header</h1>

(date: 2026-01-22)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://blog.exe.dev/ssh-host-header">SSH has no Host header</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://exe.dev/">exe.dev</a> is a new hosting service that, for $20/month, gives you up to 25 VMs &quot;that share 2 CPUs and 8GB RAM&quot;. Everything happens over SSH, including creating new VMs. Once configured you can sign into your exe.dev VMs like this:</p>
<pre><code>ssh simon.exe.dev

</code></pre>
<p>Here's the clever bit: when you run the above command <code>exe.dev</code> signs you into your VM of that name... but they don't assign every VM its own IP address and SSH has no equivalent of the Host header, so how does their load balancer know <em>which</em> of your VMs to forward you on to?</p>
<p>The answer is that while they don't assign a unique IP to every VM they <em>do</em> have enough IPs that they can ensure each of your VMs has an IP that is unique to your account.</p>
<p>If I create two VMs they will each resolve to a separate IP address, each of which is shared with many other users. The underlying infrastructure then identifies my user account from my SSH public key and can determine which underlying VM to forward my SSH traffic to.</p>

      <p>Wouldn't it be something if the leaders of European democracies said if democracy and self-government around the world are to have any hope the American government has to stop attacking their own citizens. We see where this is headed, they might say, and there will be no coming back from this for the US, if they turn the country, which still is the leader of the free world, into a police state. What if the European leaders said out loud and in public the things the Republicans and most of the Democrats refuse to say. The inverse of what JD Lance says about their governments and their people.</p>

      <h1>CTA Hierarchy in the Wild</h1>

(date: 2026-01-22)
      <p>
      <p>The other day I was browsing YouTube — as one does — and I clicked a link in the video description to a book.</p>
<p>I was then subjected to a man-in-the-middle attack, where YouTube put themselves in the middle of me and the link I had clicked:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/youtube-are-you-sure.png" alt="Screenshot of a webpage that says “Are you sure you want to leave YouTube?” and there are two buttons. On the left is the secondary, de-emphasized button that says “GO TO SITE” and on the right is the primary, visually emphasized button that says “BACK TO YOUTUBE”."></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/the-subversive-hyperlink/">Hyperlinks are subversive</a>. Big Tech must protect themselves and their interests.</p>
<p>But link hijacking isn’t why I’m writing this post.</p>
<p>What struck me was the ordering and visual emphasis of the “call to action” (CTA) buttons. I almost clicked “Back to YouTube”, which was precisely the action I didn’t want.</p>
<p>I paused and laughed to myself.</p>
<p>Look how the design pattern for primary/secondary user interface controls has inverted over time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic software:
<ul>
<li>Primary CTA: what’s best for you</li>
<li>Secondary CTA: an alternative for you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modern software:
<ul>
<li>Primary CTA: what’s best for us</li>
<li>Secondary CTA: what’s acceptable to us</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like everywhere I go, software is increasingly designed <em>against</em> me.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating unoptimizability as a habit (22 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-22)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit: Get good at being on hold. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: &quot;Ventus&quot;; Woody Guthrie v Trump's dad; Tory MP v poppers. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit (permalink) I am on record as being skeptical of the notion that if you shop very carefully, you can make society better. &quot;Conscious consumption&quot; is not a tool for structural change, and any election that requires you to &quot;vote with your wallet&quot; is always won by the people with the thickest wallets (statistically speaking, that's not you): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/13/consumption-choices/#marginal-benefits">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/13/consumption-choices/#marginal-benefits</a> Now, that's not to say that boycotts are useless. But a boycott is a structured and organized campaign. The Montgomery bus boycott wasn't a matter of a bunch of people waking up one morning and saying, &quot;You know what, fuck it, I'm gonna walk today&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery</a>_bus_boycott The Montgomery bus boycott was an organized project, put together by a powerful membership organization, the NAACP, that demanded far more of its members than merely shopping very carefully. The boycott was the end stage of an organized resistance, not a substitute for it. The problem with &quot;conscious consumption&quot; is that it comes out of the neoliberal tradition in which every political matter is supposedly determined by your individual actions, and not your actions as part of a union or other political institution that works as a bloc to overthrow the status quo. &quot;Conscious consumption&quot; arises out of the tradition that gave us Margaret Thatcher's maxim, &quot;There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.&quot; Any attempt to change society by shopping very carefully is destined to fail, but it's worse than that. Because &quot;shopping very carefully&quot; never makes systemic change, its practitioners inevitably decide the reason they're not seeing the change they yearn for is that their allies aren't shopping carefully enough. This turns the careful shopper into a cop who polices other people's consumption, demanding that they stop eating some foodstuff or using Twitter or watching HBO Max. Squabbling over whether using a social media network makes you a Nazi generates far more heat than light – so much heat that it incinerates the solidarity you need to actually fight Nazis. Which is not an argument against boycotts! Boycotts work. If boycotts didn't work, then genocide apologists wouldn't be apoplectic over the BDS movement: <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/">https://bdsmovement.net/</a> But a &quot;boycott&quot; isn't the same thing as &quot;you and your social circle deciding that buying the wrong product makes you a Bad Person and then devoting your energies to scolding your allies for choosing Coke instead of Pepsi.&quot; Boycotts are downstream of organizing; they are not a substitute for organizing. There is such a thing as society. Now, all that said, I will confess: I sometimes do something that looks a lot like &quot;shopping very carefully,&quot; and when I do, I derive enormous satisfaction from it (but I am always careful not to mistake my tiny victories for political action). But I get it, honestly, I do. Sometimes, &quot;shopping very carefully&quot; is a way to eke out a tiny, personal victory in the face of overwhelming odds against a wildly overmatched opponent. That feels very good. One example would be patronizing my local repair shop (or fixing my stuff myself). The big structural barriers to repair are things like &quot;parts pairing&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification">https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification</a> And manufacturers who abuse trademark law to get CBP to seize refurbished parts at the border: <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/108049/apple-repair-critic-louis-rossmann-takes-on-us-customs-counterfeit-battery-seizure">https://www.shacknews.com/article/108049/apple-repair-critic-louis-rossmann-takes-on-us-customs-counterfeit-battery-seizure</a> The repair problem isn't that your neighbors are &quot;sheeple&quot; who've had their minds warped by a &quot;throwaway society.&quot; The problem is that technical and legal countermeasures have made repair so hard and unprofitable that getting your stuff fixed is more expensive and time-consuming than it needs to be. That said: I love going to my local repair shop. I love fixing things on my own. It's great. It makes me feel great. I think you should do it because it may make you feel great, too, and it'd be nice for you to support your local fix-it place, but let's not pretend that we'll change society that way. Here's another example: for the past couple years, I've been navigating a (thankfully very treatable) cancer diagnosis. The fact that my cancer is very treatable doesn't mean it's easily treated. America's shitty, for-profit healthcare system is terrible at the best of times, and nearly unnavigable when coping with a complex condition that crosses a lot of disciplinary lines and requires access to specialized, expensive equipment. I'm asymptomatic, so the hardest part of having cancer – so far – is fighting the Kaiser bureaucracy to make sure my treatment goes off as planned: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/05/carcinoma-angels/#squeaky-nail">https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/05/carcinoma-angels/#squeaky-nail</a> The fact that the different Kaiser departments drop so many balls when handing off care between them means that I have to juggle those balls for them. I make extensive use of organizational tactics like &quot;suspense files,&quot; which are a kind of inverted to-do list, in that they let you manage other people's to-do lists, rather than your own: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo</a> (In case you're wondering, the best part of having cancer is that Kaiser comps 100% of your parking! Free cancer parking!) Now, I also make sure to note each of Kaiser's failures and I raise grievances and California health ombudsman complaints for each one – not because I'm angry and want an apology, but because I'm a well-organized, native English-speaking cancer patient with no symptoms, which means that I can do the advocacy that other people can't, and help them (I also track these complaints with suspense files, calendar entries, etc, to make sure that they're followed through). Partly, I'm able to do this because I'm very organized. I'm not organized because I worship at the cult of &quot;personal productivity&quot;; I'm definitely Jenny Odell-pilled on that score: <a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/</a> I'm organized because I pursue The Way of Jim Munroe's &quot;Time Management for Anarchists&quot; (&quot;once I learned how to make my own structure, I was able to kick my expensive boss habit and work on my own&quot;): <a href="https://jimmunroe.net/comics/pamphlets/time">https://jimmunroe.net/comics/pamphlets/time</a>_management_for_anarchists/time_management_for_anarchists.html Having invested a lot of energy into being organized, I now get massive discounts on dealing with other people's shit. Remember: giant corporations and other remorseless bureaucracies throw up roadblocks on the assumption that you will be a &quot;rational economic actor.&quot; The airline assumes that if it costs you 15 hours to collect on the <span class="math inline">\(50 voucher you're entitled to, you will just let them steal \)</span>50 from you. But once you get organized enough, you can cut that 15-hour investment down to a 15-minute one, and I will absolutely trade 15 minutes of dealing with an airline's bullshit for $50 of that airline's money. (Why yes, Air Canada did fuck me over on Jan 3 and get me home at 5AM the next day, instead of 730PM the night before; and yes, they did deny my compensation claim; and yes, I have filed an appeal with the Canada Transport Agency; why do you ask?) One of my favorite podcasts is &quot;An Arm and a Leg,&quot; which divides itself between deep dive structural analyses into how corrupt and ghastly American medical billing is, and enumerations of sweet hacks that ninja bill-fighters have come up with to slice through the billing labyrinth your insurer and hospital trap you in and cut straight to the bullseye: <a href="https://armandalegshow.com/">https://armandalegshow.com/</a> For example, the latest episode tells the story of Jared Walker, who figured out that hospitals were stealing billions of dollars every year from the poorest people in America, who were all entitled to have their medical bill canceled. He founded Dollarfor, a nonprofit that helps patients get their medical debt canceled: <a href="https://armandalegshow.com/episode/our-favorite-project-of-2025-levels-up-and-you-can-help/">https://armandalegshow.com/episode/our-favorite-project-of-2025-levels-up-and-you-can-help/</a> Dollarfor now has an automated tool that guides you through a survey and then generates and files the completed, hospital-specific paperwork needed to get your medical debt canceled (they've made versions of this for every hospital in America!): <a href="https://dollarfor.org/">https://dollarfor.org/</a> (If you're a health worker, here's a printable guide with QR codes that you can clip to your lanyard and show to patients while you deliver care): <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cfwK66A">https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cfwK66A</a>_mfBBBqn35_Lp7930uoY-73f/view Now, the real problem here isn't that hospitals steal billions from charity cases: it's that America has a garbage for-profit healthcare system that kills and bankrupts people at scale. Dollarfor is amazing, but it's not going to fix that problem. I don't know Walker, but I bet if you asked him, he'd agree with this, and say something like, &quot;Yes, and I'm helping people not have their lives destroyed by this garbage system, which is good unto itself; and also, it might give them the free time and wherewithal to participate in movements to overthrow the garbage system.&quot; I really dote on the fact that Dollarfor has literally built a different version of their tool for every single hospital in the country. It's a perfect example of how turning yourself into a highly organized adversary can overcome the time-based economics our enemies rely on to keep their garbage systems intact. Whenever I think of this stuff, I flash on two pop-culture references that made a deep impression on me. The first comes from 1985's Real Genius, Val Kilmer's best ever movie (fight me!). Real Genius is set at a fictionalized version of Caltech in which young prodigies slowly discover that their scumbag prof has tricked them into working on a weapons contract for the DoD. This being fictional-Caltech, there are all these scenes in which very smart people do weird and amazing things. At one point, we learn that there's a former child prodigy living in the basement under the dorms, a guy named Lazlo Hollyfeld who became a hermit after discovering that he, too, had been duped into working on a baby-killer project. We get these tantalizing glimpses of Lazlo in his subterranean redoubt, where he has built some kind of giant Rube Goldberg machine that is engaged in a mysterious mechanical process that involves manipulating cards of some sort. At the film's denouement (spoiler alert for a 40 year old movie), we discover what he was doing: Lazlo: These are entries into the Frito-Lay Sweepstakes. &quot;No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want&quot; – so I am. Chris: That's great! How many times? Lazlo: Well, this batch makes it one million six hundred and fifty thousand. I should win thirty-two point six percent of the prizes, including the car. Chris: That kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it? Lazlo: They set up the rules, and lately I've come to realize that I have certain materialistic needs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6kBfBXZBdc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6kBfBXZBdc</a> Then there's a scene from the otherwise tepid (fight me!) Batman Returns (1992) in which we encounter the Penguin in his subterranean redoubt, brandishing pages full of kompromat that have been laboriously taped together: The Penguin: What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham City? Maximillian 'Max' Shreck: If there were such documents – and that's not an admission – I would have seen to it they were shredded. The Penguin: Ah, good idea! [pulls out a sheaf of documents] The Penguin: A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/quotes/">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/quotes/</a> Both Lazlo and the Penguin are defeating the time-based security assumptions of their adversaries. Frito Lay treats filling in 1.65m sweepstakes entries as the same thing as filling in infinity entries; Max Schrek treats the time needed to piece together shredded paper as infinite. Rounding a very large number up to infinity isn't entirely irrational, but once you get organized enough, you just might be able to find the time – or a system – to bring that very big number down to an entirely tractable value. Yes, this is a species of &quot;careful shopping&quot; but my point isn't to say that shopping carefully is useless – rather, that it's a drastic error to mistake this useful (and surprisingly satisfying) tactic for a strategy that will truly alter the system.

      <h1>Qwen3-TTS Family is Now Open Sourced: Voice Design, Clone, and Generation</h1>

(date: 2026-01-22)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3tts-0115">Qwen3-TTS Family is Now Open Sourced: Voice Design, Clone, and Generation</a></strong></p>
<p>I haven't been paying much attention to the state-of-the-art in speech generation models other than noting that they've got <em>really good</em>, so I can't speak for how notable this new release from Qwen is.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/assets/Qwen3_TTS.pdf">the accompanying paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this report, we present the Qwen3-TTS series, a family of advanced multilingual, controllable, robust, and streaming text-to-speech models. Qwen3-TTS supports state-of- the-art 3-second voice cloning and description-based control, allowing both the creation of entirely novel voices and fine-grained manipulation over the output speech. Trained on over 5 million hours of speech data spanning 10 languages, Qwen3-TTS adopts a dual-track LM architecture for real-time synthesis [...]. Extensive experiments indicate state-of-the-art performance across diverse objective and subjective benchmark (e.g., TTS multilingual test set, InstructTTSEval, and our long speech test set). To facilitate community research and development, we release both tokenizers and models under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To give an idea of size, <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base">Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base</a> is 4.54GB on Hugging Face and <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base">Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base</a> is 2.52GB.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS">Hugging Face demo</a> lets you try out the 0.6B and 1.7B models for free in your browser, including voice cloning:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen-voice-clone.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Qwen3-TTS voice cloning web interface with three tabs at top: &quot;Voice Design&quot;, &quot;Voice Clone (Base)&quot; (selected), and &quot;TTS (CustomVoice)&quot;. The page is titled &quot;Clone Voice from Reference Audio&quot; and has two main sections. Left section: &quot;Reference Audio (Upload a voice sample clone)&quot; showing an audio waveform player at 0:00/0:34 with playback controls, upload and microphone icons, followed by &quot;Reference Text (Transcript of the reference audio)&quot; containing three paragraphs: &quot;Simon Willison is the creator of Datasette, an open source tool for exploring and publishing data. He currently works full-time building open source tools for data journalism, built around Datasette and SQLite. Prior to becoming an independent open source developer, Simon was an engineering director at Eventbrite. Simon joined Eventbrite through their acquisition of Lanyrd, a Y Combinator funded company he co-founded in 2010. He is a co-creator of the Django Web Framework, and has been blogging about web development and programming since 2002 at simonwillison.net&quot;. Right section: &quot;Target Text (Text to synthesize with cloned voice)&quot; containing text about Qwen3-TTS speech generation capabilities, with &quot;Language&quot; dropdown set to &quot;Auto&quot; and &quot;Model Size&quot; dropdown set to &quot;1.7B&quot;, and a purple &quot;Clone &amp; Generate&quot; button at bottom."></p>
<p>I tried this out by recording myself reading <a href="https://simonwillison.net/about/">my about page</a> and then having Qwen3-TTS generate audio of me reading the Qwen3-TTS announcement post. Here's the result:</p>
<p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
<p>It's important that everyone understands that voice cloning is now something that's available to anyone with a GPU and a few GBs of VRAM... or in this case a web browser that can access Hugging Face.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Prince Canuma <a href="https://x.com/Prince_Canuma/status/2014453857019904423">got this working</a> with his <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-audio/">mlx-audio</a> library. I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/2e01ad60-ca38-4e14-ab60-74eaa45b2fbd">had Claude</a> turn that into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/q3_tts.py">a CLI tool</a> which you can run with <code>uv</code> ike this:</p>
<pre><code>uv run https://tools.simonwillison.net/python/q3_tts.py \
  'I am a pirate, give me your gold!' \
  -i 'gruff voice' -o pirate.wav

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-i</code> option lets you use a prompt to describe the voice it should use. On first run this downloads a 4.5GB model file from Hugging Face.</p>

      <p>I really like the idea of using biometrics to add extra security, but have always hated the idea that simply touching the fingerprint sensor would unlock your entire phone, so in my version of LineageOS the touch to unlock feature is disabled but I still use second factor biometrics for the security of various apps.

(date: 2026-01-22)
      <p>
      <h3><em>For January 14-20, 2026</em></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Earlier this week, there was a chance for North Americans to get <a href="https://www.space.com/stargazing/auroras/northern-lights-may-be-visible-in-10-states-tonight-as-earths-magnetic-field-rings-like-a-bell-after-cme-impact?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427">a peek at the Northern Lights.</a> If you were able to spot them, let us know: we paid for some night sky writing to promote the Newsletter, and want to ask for a refund if any of it got upstaged by the aurora.</p>
<p>And a reminder: If you have any feedback on the Newsletter, we’re all ears! Just reply to this email with any thoughts, suggestions, ideas, etc.! We’d love to hear from you.</p>

<h2>What We Enjoyed This Week</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/shouts-murmurs/i-am-the-person-who-controls-your-appliances?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427"><strong>I Am the Person Who Controls Your Appliances</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/broti-gupta?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427"><strong>Broti Gupta</strong></a> <em>(The New Yorker)</em> Always exciting to see a writer you like publishing again, and we were especially excited to see Broti’s byline. This is a classic short humor premise: a weird guy you didn’t know existed tells you their deal. Broti locks into a fun, laid back voice for this character, and the piece is full of great specifics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/these-deep-sea-creatures-liked-you-on-hinge?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427"><strong>These Deep-Sea Creatures Liked You on Hinge</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/emily-stearney?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427"><strong>Emily Stearney</strong></a> <em>(McSweeney’s)</em> Emily does some excellent juxtaposing here, giving the familiar format of Hinge profiles a new wacky spin. Sea critter things alongside dating specifics makes for some great runs like, “Giant squid: Fifteen feet long, Catholic, figuring out my dating goals”. We especially like the small detail in the title that these are the creatures that liked you—the added layer that all of these swimmers want to date the reader is very fun.</p>

      <h1>Claude's new constitution</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution">Claude's new constitution</a></strong></p>
<p>Late last year Richard Weiss <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vpNG99GhbBoLov9og/claude-4-5-opus-soul-document">found something interesting</a> while poking around with the just-released Claude Opus 4.5: he was able to talk the model into regurgitating a document which was <em>not</em> part of the system prompt but appeared instead to be baked in during training, and which described Claude's core values at great length.</p>
<p>He called this leak the <strong>soul document</strong>, and Amanda Askell from Anthropic <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/2/claude-soul-document/">quickly confirmed</a> that it was indeed part of Claude's training procedures.</p>
<p>Today Anthropic made this official, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution">releasing that full &quot;constitution&quot; document</a> under a CC0 (effectively public domain) license. There's a lot to absorb! It's over 35,000 tokens, more than 10x the length of the <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-opus-4-5">published Opus 4.5 system prompt</a>.</p>
<p>One detail that caught my eye is the acknowledgements at the end, which include a list of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/constitution#acknowledgements">external contributors</a> who helped review the document. I was intrigued to note that two of the fifteen listed names are Catholic members of the clergy - <a href="https://www.frbrendanmcguire.org/biography">Father Brendan McGuire</a> is a pastor in Los Altos with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Math and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tighe">Bishop Paul Tighe</a> is an Irish Catholic bishop with a background in moral theology.</p>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>Olof Hellman: My AppleScriptable macOS app is recordable. Occasionally, I have a UI action performed by the user that I handle internally, and I send a corresponding AppleEvent with the SendOptions flag .dontExecute (was kAEDontExecute) so that AppleScript recording will see the action and record it. With Sequoia 15.7.3 and Tahoe 26.1, I am seeing […]</p>

      <p>In December, I confessed to a friend that working on my novel the past year has been misery. I seem trapped in a doldrums of work that feels designed for my particular weaknesses: choosing between equally good options, and trusting my decisions. I’ve lost the magic of the story, and the play in the work. […]</p>

      <h1>Email from Family in Minnesota</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>Our family in Minnesota knows we worry about them, and so yesterday they sent a family-wide email.</p>
<p>This is surely one of many thousands like it. Maybe you’ve written one of these. Maybe you will write one of these.</p>
<p>Below is the email from Jen (with permission and with original formatting):</p>
<h3>Update from MN</h3>
<p>Hello family and friends outside of Minnesota,</p>
<p>Many of you have reached out to see how we are doing and Pete and I both thank you for that. We appreciate it. As middle-class White people, Pete and I are largely ok. Technically, speaking. And I cannot believe that is a sentence I just typed in the year 2026. But here we are. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet. For now. We are doing what we can to support those that we can. We are speaking out and calling our representatives. So far 20,000 people in this state have taken conscientious bystander training. As actors, Pete and I have created/rehearsed monologues or responses if we find ourselves witnessing the illegal doings of these “agents”. The people here are subdued, but not hopeless. Defiant, but not violent. We are doing our best to protest peacefully as this is what our constitution allows.</p>
<p>Why do I write to you of these things?</p>
<p>For a few reasons:
1. Depending on what media you are seeing you may be getting no coverage on this or varying degrees of truth to outright propaganda. I thought it best you hear it from someone who is actually living in MN right now.
2. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum I believe we can all agree that we have rights in this country: free speech, the right to peacefully protest, the right to due process to name a few.
3. Any support we can get, even if it is simply trying to combat disinformation with truth, from within our country or around the world is helpful and important.
4. If you wish to do other things, this is a good website which compiles many places/groups that are trying to help combat this situation. <a href="https://www.standwithminnesota.com/">https://www.standwithminnesota.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Now to some things that are happening here:</p>
<p>In addition to Jonathon Ross murdering Renee Good, the very same day they went to a high school and attempted to arrest students and staff. One day after this, 6 men with guns kicked in the door of someone’s home <strong>without a legal warrant</strong> and dragged the husband out in cuffs. He is an American citizen. Today local law enforcement in and around the Twin Cities held a press conference calling out these “agents” in breaking the law. They are now targeting and attempting to detain off-duty officers. Every single one of the officers they targeted are people of color. It is straight up racial profiling. They are smashing car windows and tear-gassing people including toddlers. <em>People are carrying their passports and birth certificates around with them</em> and often they are not even allowed to show these “agents” their paperwork before they are beaten and/or abducted.</p>
<p>I have a dear friend who passed her citizenship test 6 years ago and is now carrying her documentation with her wherever she goes. She did everything “the right way” yet she is worried. Frankly, because she doesn’t look Hispanic or African she will probably be ok. Again, I can’t believe I just typed this sentence. Our nephew’s elementary school (in a very affluent, predominantly White suburb) canceled their school’s International Night for fear it would draw Immigrant Enforcement to the school. Pete and I are witnessing field trips to the Science Museum cancel left and right because schools are afraid they will target the children.</p>
<p>These people are not targeting the “worst of the worst” as they claimed they would do. They are not following the law or allowing due process. Minnesota is under siege. They are now telling observers who are giving witness and recording these crimes that “they should learn a lesson or they will be next.” Currently, these “agents” outnumber our local law enforcement 4 to 1. Donald Trump and Noem have particularly targeted Minnesota even though our state falls far behind other states in the amount of undocumented workers. Everyone is on edge. No one is untouched by this chaos.</p>
<p>I don’t know what is going to happen. I don’t know what has happened to empathy and humanity. I do know that I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for my ancestors who immigrated here from Sweden, England, Ireland, and the Netherlands. But they did. So for their legacy and for the little kids who deserve to live without fear I will continue to show up and help where I can.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and feel free to share this with those who may be curious to what is actually happening in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Love to all of you. Take care of each other.</p>
<p>Jen and Pete</p>

<p><strong>2026-01-21</strong>. I like this Mi Lan Xiang tea I’m drinking because it’s roasted over lychee coal. I just waited next to the cup and when it smelled fruity, I decanted it. My first impression is that I like it better than the Ye Lai Xiang I had in previous years. Three steepings, all with that nice taste.</p>
<p>The Bancha Kyushu was nice, too. A citrus note that I wasn’t expecting. Two steepings.</p>

      <h1>Web Day Out × State Of The Browser</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>If you’re the kind of person who likes <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a>, you’re probably also the kind of person who likes <a href="https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/">State Of The Browser</a>.</p>
<p>Web Day Out is all about what you can in web browsers right now, with an emphasis on immediately practical techniques and technologies. State Of The Browser is similar, but with room for fun demos that push the boundaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/">State Of The Browser</a> is on Saturday, 28 February.</p>
<p><a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a> is on Thursday, 12 March.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if you had to choose between these two excellent events.</p>
<p>Well, you don’t have to!</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out">buy a ticket for Web Day Out</a> you can get a whopping 50% off the ticket price for State Of The Browser. Or if you can’t make it in person, your Web Day Out ticket gets you a <em>free</em> online ticket!</p>
<p>You might be thinking, “Well, much as I’d love to go to both events, I don’t think I can <a href="https://webdayout.com/reasons-to-attend/#convince-your-boss">convince my boss</a> to give me <em>two</em> conference days.” Worry ye not! State Of The Browser is on a Saturday, so unless you’re working an extremely extended work week, you still only need to take one day away from your desk to go to two events.</p>
<p>So don’t delay: <a href="https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out">get your ticket for Web Day Out</a>. Then you’ll get an email with details on how to get your 50% discount for State Of The Browser (or your free online ticket, whichever you prefer).</p>
<p>But wait! What if you already bought a ticket for State Of The Browser? Check your email. You’ve been sent a very, <em>very</em> generous discount code for Web Day Out to thank you for getting your ticket nice and early.</p>
<p>I’ll see you at <a href="https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/">State Of The Browser</a> in London …and then I’ll see you at <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a> in Brighton!</p>

      <h1>ChatGpt TV ads are great</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/21/lemonade.png" alt="">The ads I like on TV these days are the ChatGPT ads that show you how it makes your life better. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go4o6jiy8qE">first ad</a> two college age people, brother and sister it turns out, are on a cross-country drive and have a great trip planned. You can tell they love each other, and have a casual familiarity and trust and laugh a lot, teasing, as the itinerary scrolls by too fast to read more than two or three lines, but you can see they're going to have a better trip than I've ever had and I've done a lot of cross-country trips with friends over the years.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To04SSylvVY">other ad</a>, again with the young college-age people, this time a date, probably not the first date, at his apartment, and the guy is making dinner for his guest, and again, the plan scrolls by. He's making something nice, but not too much, and like the last ad, they're confident, young, full of life, and since they've used ChatGPT for just this purpose, they're probably going to have a great meal, and they'll go out again, for sure.</p>
<p>This is the perfect advertising for this stage of their business. They are the leading product, the Coca Cola of AI systems, so they don't need to compare themselves with anyone, they are the standard -- and now they take the opportunity to define it. It's about friendship, love, looking good, getting the girl, etc. But it's wholesome and American. I bet they run the same ad in Denmark, only the kids speak Danish and have blonde hair and they go to places in Denmark and eat simple but good Danish food.</p>
<p>I don't think Google or Facebook did these kinds of ads as they were rising to dominance. Apple did, Microsoft didn't. This will also change the press coverage they get. Journalists like to pretend that ads don't infulence what they think, but good ones like these do.</p>
<p>BTW, if Microsoft had done ads introducing themselves to the world as the future tech behemoth, they might have gone folksy -- like Smucker's jam. &quot;With a name like Microsoft, it has to be good.&quot; You probably don't even think about it these days the name is so familiar, but MIcro + Soft is not the most inspiring name for a tech product. But then ChatGPT is a pretty awful name too. Four syllables, too many. Three is ideal. Imho ymmv. Doesn't matter now, everyone has learned to say it. And they need those ads to cement the bond with the people of the world.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Google's AI pricing plan (21 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Google's AI pricing plan: From each according to their ability (to pay). Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Disney buys Pixar; Bruces on &quot;vernacular video&quot;; Hickey paralysis; RIP David Hartwell; Personalized pricing; They were warned. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Google's AI pricing plan (permalink) Google is spending a lot on AI, but what's not clear is how Google will make a lot from AI. Or, you know, even break even. Given, you know, that businesses are seeing zero return from AI: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/pwc">https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/pwc</a>_ai_ceo_survey/ But maybe they've figured it out. In a recent edition of his BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller pulls on several of the strings that Google's top execs have dangled recently: <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-google-organize-the-worlds-prices">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-google-organize-the-worlds-prices</a> The first string: Google's going to spy on you a lot more, for the same reason Microsoft is spying on all of its users: because they want to supply their AI &quot;agents&quot; with your personal data: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4</a> Google's announced that it's going to feed its AI your Gmail messages, as well as the whole deep surveillance dossier the company has assembled based on your use of all the company's products: Youtube, Maps, Photos, and, of course, Search: <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/2011473059547390106">https://twitter.com/Google/status/2011473059547390106</a> The second piece of news is that Apple has partnered with Google to supply Gemini to all iPhone users: <a href="https://twitter.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017">https://twitter.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017</a> Apple already charges Google more than <span class="math inline">\(20b/year not to enter the search market; now they're going to be charging Google billions to stay out of the AI market, too. Meanwhile, Google will get to spy on Apple customers, just like they spy on their own users. Anyone who says that Apple is ideologically committed to your privacy because they're real capitalists is a sucker (or a cultist): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But the big revelation is how Google is going to make money with AI: they're going to sell AI-based "personalized pricing" to "partners," including "Walmart, Visa, Mastercard, Shopify, Gap, Kroger, Macy’s, Stripe, Home Depot, Lowe's, American Express, etc": https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/ Personalized pricing, of course, is the polite euphemism for surveillance pricing, which is when a company spies on you in order to figure out how much they can get away with charging you (or how little they can get away with paying you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/# It's a weird form of cod-Marxism, whose tenet is "From each according to their desperation; to each according to their vulnerability." Surveillance pricing advocates say that this is "efficient" because they can use surveillance data to offer you discounts, too – like, say you rock up to an airline ticket counter 45 minutes before takeoff and they can use surveillance data to know that you won't take their last empty seat for \)</span>200, but you would fly in it for <span class="math inline">\(100, you could get that seat for cheap. This is, of course, nonsense. Airlines don't sell off cheap seats like bakeries discounting their day-olds – they jack up the price of a last-minute journey to farcical heights. Google also claims that it will only use its surveillance pricing facility to offer discounts, and not to extract premiums. As Stoller points out, there's a well-developed playbook for making premiums look like discounts, which is easy to see in the health industry. As Stoller says, the list price for an MRI is \)</span>8,000, but your insurer gets a <span class="math inline">\(6000 "discount" and actually pays \)</span>1970, sticking you with a <span class="math inline">\(30 co-pay. The \)</span>8000 is a fake number, and so is the <span class="math inline">\(6000 – the only real price is the \)</span>30 you're paying. The whole economy is filled with versions of this transparent ruse, from &quot;department stores who routinely mark everything as 80% off&quot; to pharmacy benefit managers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/23/shield-of-boringness/#some-men-rob-you-with-a-fountain-pen">https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/23/shield-of-boringness/#some-men-rob-you-with-a-fountain-pen</a> Google, meanwhile, is touting its new &quot;universal commerce protocol&quot; (UCP), a way for AI &quot;agents&quot; to retrieve prices and product descriptions and make purchases: <a href="https://www.thesling.org/the-harm-to-consumers-and-sellers-from-universal-commerce-protocol-in-googles-own-words/">https://www.thesling.org/the-harm-to-consumers-and-sellers-from-universal-commerce-protocol-in-googles-own-words/</a> Right now, a major hurdle to &quot;agentic AI&quot; is the complexity of navigating websites designed for humans. AI agents just aren't very reliable when it comes to figuring out which product is which, choosing the correct options, and putting it in a shopping cart, and then paying for it. Some of that is merely because websites have inconsistent &quot;semantics&quot; – literally things like the &quot;buy&quot; button being called something other than &quot;buy button&quot; in the HTML code. But there's a far more profound problem with agentic shopping, which is that companies deliberately obfuscate their prices. This is how junk fees work, and why they're so destructive. Say you're a hotel providing your rate-card to an online travel website. You know that travelers are going to search for hotels by city and amenities, and then sort the resulting list by price. If you hide your final price – by surprising the user with a bunch of junk fees at checkout, or, better yet, after they arrive and put their credit-card down at reception – you are going to be at the top of that list. Your hotel will seem like the cheapest, best option. But of course, it's not. From Ticketmaster to car rentals, hotels to discount airlines, rental apartments to cellular plans, the real price is withheld until the very last instant, whereupon it shoots up to levels that are absolutely uncompetitive. But because these companies are able to engage in deceptive advertising, they look cheaper. And of course, crooked offers drive out honest ones. The honest hotel that provides a true rate card, reflecting the all-in price, ends up at the bottom of the price-sorted list, rents no rooms, and goes out of business (or pivots to lying about its prices, too). Online sellers do not want to expose their true prices to comparison shopping services. They benefit from lying to those services. For decades, technologists have dreamed of building a &quot;semantic web&quot; in which everyone exposes true and accurate machine-readable manifests of their content to facilitate indexing, search and data-mining: <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm</a> This has failed. It's failed because lying is often more profitable than telling the truth, and because lying to computers is easier than lying to people, and because once a market is dominated by liars, everyone has to lie, or be pushed out of the market. Of course, it would be really cool if everyone diligently marked up everything they put into the public sphere with accurate metadata. But there are lots of really cool things you could do if you could get everyone else to change how they do things and arrange their affairs to your convenience. Imagine how great it would be if you could just get everyone to board an airplane from back to front, or to stand right and walk left on escalators, or to put on headphones when using their phones in public. Wanting it badly is not enough. People have lots of reasons for doing things in suboptimal ways. Often the reason is that it's suboptimal for you, but just peachy for them. Google says that it's going to get every website in the world to expose accurate rate cards to its chatbots to facilitate agentic AI. Google is also incapable of preventing &quot;search engine optimization&quot; companies from tricking it into showing bullshit at the top of the results for common queries: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/03/keyword-swarming/#site-reputation-abuse">https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/03/keyword-swarming/#site-reputation-abuse</a> Google somehow thinks that the companies that spend millions of dollars trying to trick its crawler won't also spend millions of dollars trying to trick its chatbot – and they're providing the internet with a tool to inject lies straight into the chatbot's input hopper. But UCP isn't just a way for companies to tell Google what their prices are. As Stoller points out, UCP will also sell merchants the ability to have Gemini set prices on their products, using Google's surveillance data, through &quot;dynamic pricing&quot; (another euphemism for &quot;surveillance pricing&quot;). This decade has seen the rise and rise of price &quot;clearinghouses&quot; – companies that offer price &quot;consulting&quot; to direct competitors in a market. Nominally, this is just a case of two competitors shopping with the same supplier – like Procter and Gamble and Unilever buying their high-fructose corn-syrup from the same company. But it's actually far more sinister. &quot;Clearinghouses&quot; like Realpage – a company that &quot;advises&quot; landlords on rental rates – allow all the major competitors in a market to collude to raise prices in lockstep. A Realpage landlord that ignores the service's &quot;advice&quot; and gives a tenant a break on the rent will be excluded from Realpage's service. The rental markets that Realpage dominates have seen major increases in rental rates: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/09/pricewars/#adam-smith-communist">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/09/pricewars/#adam-smith-communist</a> Google's &quot;direct pricing&quot; offering will allow all comers to have Google set their prices for them, based on Google's surveillance data. That includes direct competitors. As Stoller points out, both Nike and Reebok are Google advertisers. If they let Google price their sneakers, Google can raise prices across the market in lockstep. Despite how much everyone hates this garbage, neoclassical economists and their apologists in the legal profession continue to insist that surveillance pricing is &quot;efficient.&quot; Stoller points to a law review article called &quot;Antitrust After the Coming Wave,&quot; written by antitrust law prof and Google lawyer Daniel Crane: <a href="https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-99-number-4/antitrust-after-the-coming-wave/">https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-99-number-4/antitrust-after-the-coming-wave/</a> Crane argues that AI will kill antitrust law because AI favors monopolies, and argues &quot;that we should forget about promoting competition or costs, and instead enact a new Soviet-style regime, one in which the government would merely direct a monopolist’s 'AI to maximize social welfare and allocate the surplus created among different stakeholders of the firm.'&quot; This is a planned economy, but it's one in which the planning is done by monopolists who are – somehow, implausibly – so biddable that governments can delegate the power to decide what we can buy and sell, what we can afford and who can afford it, and rein them in if they get it wrong. In 1890, Senator John Sherman was stumping for the Sherman Act, America's first antitrust law. On the Senate floor, he declared: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/</a> Google thinks that it has finally found a profitable use for AI. It thinks that it will be the first company to make money on AI, by harnessing that AI to a market-rigging, price-gouging monopoly that turns Google's software into Sherman's &quot;autocrat of trade.&quot; It's funny when you think of all those &quot;AI safety&quot; bros who claimed that AI's greatest danger was that it would become sentient and devour us. It turns out that the real &quot;AI safety&quot; risk is that AI will automate price gouging at scale, allowing Google to crown itself a &quot;King over the necessaries of life&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space</a> (Image: Noah_Loverbear; CC BY-SA 3.0; Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; modified) Hey look at this (permalink) The Line, a Saudi Megaproject, Is Dead <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/">https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/</a> Mark Carney's full speech at the World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10</a> A Grassroots Victory in the Golden Age of Bullies <a href="https://asupposedlylonething.net/blog/2026/grassroots-victory-golden-age-bullies/">https://asupposedlylonething.net/blog/2026/grassroots-victory-golden-age-bullies/</a> AI may be everywhere, but it's nowhere in recent productivity statistics <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester">https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester</a>_ai_jobs_impact/ The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting</a> Object permanence (permalink) #20yrsago Disney swaps stock for Pixar; Jobs is largest Disney stockholder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060129105430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/01/22/cnpixar22.xml&amp;amp;menuId=242&amp;amp;sSheet=/money/2006/01/22/ixcitytop.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20060129105430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/01/22/cnpixar22.xml&amp;amp;menuId=242&amp;amp;sSheet=/money/2006/01/22/ixcitytop.html</a> #20yrsago HOWTO anonymize your search history <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060220004353/https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70051-0.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20060220004353/https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70051-0.html</a> #15yrsago Bruce Sterling talk on “vernacular video” <a href="https://vimeo.com/18977827">https://vimeo.com/18977827</a> #15yrsago Elaborate televised prank on Belgium’s terrible phone company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXlDyTD7wo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXlDyTD7wo</a> #15yrsago Portugal: 10 years of decriminalized drugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040831/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/16/drug">https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040831/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/16/drug</a>_experiment/?page=full #15yrsago Woman paralyzed by hickey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110123072349/https://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/21/new-zealand-woman-partially-paralyzed-hickey/">https://web.archive.org/web/20110123072349/https://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/21/new-zealand-woman-partially-paralyzed-hickey/</a> #15yrsago EFF warns: mobile OS vendors aren’t serious about security <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/dont-sacrifice-security-mobile-devices">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/dont-sacrifice-security-mobile-devices</a> #10yrsago Trumpscript: a programming language based on the rhetorical tactics of Donald Trump <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/10448-coders-assimilate-donald-trump-to-a-programming-language">https://www.inverse.com/article/10448-coders-assimilate-donald-trump-to-a-programming-language</a> #10yrsago That time the DoD paid Duke U $335K to investigate ESP in dogs.

      <h1>Internet Voting is Too Insecure for Use in Elections</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21, updated: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>No matter how many times we say it, the idea comes back again and again. Hopefully, this <a href="https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/">letter</a> will hold back the tide for at least a while longer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Executive summary:</strong> Scientists have understood for many years that internet voting is insecure and that there is no known or foreseeable technology that can make it secure. Still, vendors of internet voting keep claiming that, somehow, their new system is different, or the insecurity doesn’t matter. Bradley Tusk and his Mobile Voting Foundation keep touting internet voting to journalists and election administrators; this whole effort is misleading and dangerous...</p>

<p>What's old is new, as this blog was <em>originally</em> built with <a href="https://github.com/hyphanet/Thingamablog-Freenet">Thingamablog</a>, a Java-based Static Site Generator (SSG) I ran on my Mac to generate HTML and FTP it up to my first webserver (over 20 years ago!).</p>
<p>The main reason I moved from an SSG to Drupal was to add <em>comments</em>. I wanted my blog to have the same level of interactivity I had pre-Thingamablog, when I was (briefly) on Xanga.com.</p>

<p>Previous work estimating the energy and water cost of LLMs has generally focused on the cost per prompt using a consumer-level system such as ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Simon P. Couch notes that coding agents such as Claude Code use <em>way</em> more tokens in response to tasks, often burning through many thousands of tokens of many tool calls.</p>
<p>As a heavy Claude Code user, Simon estimates his own usage at the equivalent of 4,400 &quot;typical queries&quot; to an LLM, for an equivalent of around <span class="math inline">\(15-\)</span>20 in daily API token spend. He figures that to be about the same as running a dishwasher once or the daily energy used by a domestic refrigerator.</p>

      <p>Howard Oakley: This year marks the twentieth anniversary of Apple’s announcement of the introduction of code signing, although it wasn’t unleashed until Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard the following year (2007).

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>Nobody wants to be told how to think. I think the best thing is to be friends with everyone you can. And maybe don't make a big issue about who people voted for, and relate as people and Americans. That's something to put in the bank.</p>
<p>Also if you let people relax around you, you may find out that someone you trust and like is actually antisemitic or racist. That's also something to put in the bank, this is not someone I want to trust if and when things get worse.</p>
<p>Things are changing radically now. so you may not have to do anything to wake anyone up. And it's good to reflect on your own attitudes and whether or not some of the things they say about you are fair criticism. We all put up barriers, and those don't ever serve us imho, esp in a democracy -- but they are esp nasty now.</p>

      <h1>@Tomosino's Mastodon feed</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>Last night I decided it was time to get <a href="https://ino.is/stutter">stutter</a> working as a mobile app. I had built the browser add-on to work on mobile devices, but since that time all the mobile clients stopped allowing add-ons. My hope in Firefox is gone.</p>
<p>So, time to convert to mobile. That's fine. I have all the logic already. I don't know Android dev, but this is a good use of an LLM: translating things to new languages.</p>
<p>It took a couple hours but I've got a MVP version working. I spent a few hours more last night and this morning refactoring to get it submitted to Fdroid. It's awaiting approval now.</p>
<p>Hopefully in a couple days you'll be able to search for and install Stutter! Then I can get to work improving... everything.</p>

      <h1>New Year, New Website — Same Old Me</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>I redesigned <a href="https://www.jim-nielsen.com">my www website</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The end of year / holiday break is a great time to work on such things.</li>
<li>I wanted to scratch an itch.</li>
<li>Websites are <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/">a worry stone</a> [ <em>gestures at current state of the world</em>]</li>
<li>Do I really need a reason? Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>I read something along the lines of “If you ship something that shows everything you’ve made, it’s dead on arrival.”</p>
<p>Oooof. I feel that. It’s so hard to make a <em>personal</em> website that keeps up with your own <em>personal</em> evolution and change.</p>
<p>But the hell if I’m not gonna try — and go through many existential crises in the process.</p>
<p>I was chasing the idea of making my “home” page essentially a list of feeds, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com">I blog</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>Yo, <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com">I take notes</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>Bruh, <a href="https://iosicongallery.com">I collect iOS icons</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>Guess what? <a href="https://macosicongallery.com">I collect macOS icons</a> too. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>Hey, I ___. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>The thought was: if I condense the variety of the things I do online into a collection of feeds (hard-coded or live from other sites I publish), then I’ll never be out of date!</p>
<p>Plus I love links. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/following-links/">I love following them.</a> I wanted my home page to be the start of a journey, not the end. A jumping off point, not a terminal one.</p>
<p>At least that was the idea behind this iteration.</p>
<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>I built the (static) site using <a href="https://weborigami.org">Web Origami</a>.</p>
<p>I loved it! Origami is great for dealing with feeds because it makes fetching data from the network and templating it incredibly succinct.</p>
<pre><code class="language-language">&lt;h2&gt;Latest from my notes blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  ${Tree.map(
    (https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/feed.json).items.slice(0,3),
    (note) =&gt; `&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;${note.url}&quot;&gt;${note.title}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;`
  )}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>In just those few lines of code I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch a JSON feed over the network</li>
<li>Grabbed the 3 most recent entries</li>
<li>Turn the data into markup</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here’s the code showing my latest blog posts:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-blog.png" alt="Screenshot of Web Origami code on the top and its output on the bottom (a list of blog post links)."></p>
<p>And here’s the code showing the latest icons in my iOS collection:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-ios.png" alt="Screenshot of Web Origami code on top and its output on the bottom (a grid of icons)."></p>
<p>Beautiful and succinct, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Origami is a static site builder, so to keep my site “up to date” I just set Netlify to build my site every 24 hours which pulls data from a variety of sources, sticks it in a single HTML file, and publishes it as a website.</p>
<p>The “build my site every 24 hours” isn’t quite as easy as you might think. You can use a <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/build/functions/scheduled-functions/">scheduled function on Netlify’s platform</a> but that requires <a href="https://tinloof.com/blog/how-to-build-cron-jobs-with-netlify-functions">writing code</a> (which also means maintaining and debugging said code). That seems to be <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-schedule-deploys-with-netlify/">Netlify’s official answer to the question: “How do I schedule deploys?”</a></p>
<p>I went with something simpler — at least simpler to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/build/configure-builds/build-hooks/">a build hook</a> on Netlify (which you have to do for the schedule function approach anyway).</li>
<li>Use Apple’s Shortcuts app to create a shortcut that issues a POST request to my build hook.</li>
<li>Use Shortcuts’ “Automation” feature to run that shortcut every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the “cron server” in my case is my iPhone, which works great because it’s basically always connected to the internet. If I go off grid for a few days and my website doesn’t refresh, I’m ok with that trade-off.</p>

<p>Students were told they could use chatbots during the exam but they had to announce their intention to do so in advance, share their prompts and take full accountability for any mistakes they made.</p>
<p>Only 3 out of 60 students chose to use chatbots. Ploum surveyed half of the class to help understand their motivations.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.postingandtoasting.com/knicks-scores-results/78180/mavs-114-knicks-97-scenes-from-ny-forcing-leons-hand">Knicks</a> are on an epic losing streak. This feels very normal. Let the trades begin. Maybe if we ask nice, Thibs will return? And isn't it funny these days <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns">KAT</a> makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle">Randle</a> look pretty good. Sort of a bonus for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves">Minneapolis team</a>, which is playing NBA in a war zone.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/20/knicksSuckGetOutPaperBags.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Time for Knicks fans to get out the paper bags.</p>
<p>Above is a picture from the 2015 Knicks, a team that was actually even suckier than the 2026 Knicks (at this moment). The guy in the lower right of that picture has the canonical look of a Knicks fan wondering how did this happen and when it will all end. The only revenge I get from the Knicks suckage is that most Yankees fans are also Knicks fans and they have sooo much more trouble coping with this than Mets fans. Heh. It's actually almost worth it when you meet one. ;-)</p>
<p>A possible theory is that the Knicks won that in-season championship that no one really understands. It could be that winning turns out to be a curse, in which case having the Knicks suck now is worth it. Then every NBA team every year will try to lose that series, for fear of what happened to the Knicks happening to them. Sports fans in case you didn't know tend to be mystics, we suffer through the mysteries of existence to explain things.</p>

Bruce Li introduces his <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting"><em>The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting</em></a> thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This report delves into the mechanics of the Internet Archive with the precision of a teardown. We will strip back the chassis to examine the custom-built PetaBox servers that heat the building without air conditioning. We will trace the evolution of the web crawlers—from the early tape-based dumps of Alexa Internet to the sophisticated browser-based bots of 2025. We will analyze the financial ledger of this non-profit giant, exploring how it survives on a budget that is a rounding error for its Silicon Valley neighbors. And finally, we will look to the future, where the &quot;Decentralized Web&quot; (DWeb) promises to fragment the Archive into a million pieces to ensure it can never be destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is long, detailed, comprehensive and well worth reading in full. Below the fold I comment on the part about storage.</p>

The first custom-designed Internet Archive storage system was version 1 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetaBox">PetaBox</a>, a vividly red-painted 1U system introduced in 2004. This picture shows a rack of them. I'm familiar with them because the <a href="https://lockss.org">LOCKSS Program</a> used them for some years.</p>
<p>They were great! Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first PetaBox rack, operational in June 2004, was a revelation in storage density. It held 100 terabytes (TB) of data—a massive sum at the time—while consuming only about 6 kilowatts of power. To put that in perspective, in 2003, the entire Wayback Machine was growing at a rate of just 12 terabytes per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LOCKSS Program eventually <a href="http://www.lockss.org/locksswp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IDCC2013.pdf">transitioned to 4U systems</a> similar to those then in use at <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>. Around the same time the Archive also moved to 4U systems for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetaBox">PetaBox</a>.</p>

As disk technology progressed the Archive continued <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">evolving the system</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fourth-generation PetaBox, introduced around 2010, exemplified this density. Each rack contained 240 disks of 2 terabytes each, organized into 4U high rack mounts. These units were powered by Intel Xeon processors (specifically the E7-8870 series in later upgrades) with 12 gigabytes of RAM. The architecture relied on bonding pair of 1-gigabit interfaces to create a 2-gigabit pipe, feeding into a rack switch with a 10-gigabit uplink.10</p>

Over time older, smaller drives were phased out and replaced by <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">newer, bigger drives</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2025, the storage landscape had shifted again. The current PetaBox racks provide 1.4 petabytes of storage per rack. This leap is achieved not by adding more slots, but by utilizing significantly larger drives—8TB, 16TB, and even 22TB drives are now standard. In 2016, the Archive managed around 20,000 individual disk drives. Remarkably, even as storage capacity tripled between 2012 and 2016, the total count of drives remained relatively constant due to these density improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is indeed an impressive strory and Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trajectory of the PetaBox is a case study in Moore's Law applied to magnetic storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here I have to correct Li. Moore's Law applies to silicon such as solid-state storage; it is <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kryders-law">Kryder's Law</a> that applies to magnetic storage such as the hard disks in the PetaBox.</p>
<p>.
Li notes the Archive's innovative approach to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">cooling the racks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Archive's primary data center is located in the Richmond District of San Francisco, a neighborhood known for its perpetual fog and cool maritime climate. The building utilizes this ambient air for cooling. There is no traditional air conditioning in the PetaBox machine rooms. Instead, the servers are designed to run at slightly higher operational temperatures, and the excess heat generated by the spinning disks is captured and recirculated to heat the building during the damp San Francisco winters.</p>
<p>This &quot;waste heat&quot; system is a closed loop of efficiency. The 60+ kilowatts of heat energy produced by a storage cluster is not a byproduct to be eliminated but a resource to be harvested. This design choice dramatically lowers the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) ratio of the facility, allowing the Archive to spend its limited funds on hard drives rather than electricity bills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the unlikely, for San Francisco, event that the day is too hot, less-urgent tasks can be delayed, or some of the racks can have their clock rate reduced, disks put into sleep mode, or even be powered down. Redundancy means that the data will be available elsewhere.</p>
<p>Brian Wilson, CTO of BackBlaze <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/04/evercloud-workshop.html">pointed out</a> back in 2014 ago that in their long-term storage environment <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/">&quot;Double the reliability is only worth 1/10th of 1 percent cost increase&quot;</a>. And thus that the moral of the story was &quot;design for failure and buy the cheapest components you can&quot;.</p>
<p>The Archive has followed this advice for a long time, as Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With over 28,000 spinning disks in operation, drive failure is a statistical certainty. ...</p>
<p>The PetaBox software is designed to be fault-tolerant. Data is mirrored across multiple machines, often in different physical locations (including data centers in Redwood City and Richmond, California, and copies in Europe and Canada).12 Because the data is not &quot;mission-critical&quot; in the sense of a live banking transaction, the Archive can tolerate a certain number of dead drives in a node before physical maintenance is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is Brian Wilson's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/">analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replacing one drive takes about 15 minutes of work. If we have 30,000 drives and 2 percent fail, it takes 150 hours to replace those. In other words, one employee for one month of 8 hour days. Getting the failure rate down to 1 percent means you save 2 weeks of employee salary - maybe <span class="math inline">\(5,000 total? The 30,000 drives costs you \)</span>4m.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2007/06/petabyte-for-century.html">Back in 2006</a> I started asking <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/01/how-hard-is-petabyte-for-century.html"><em>How Hard Is &quot;A Petabyte for a Century&quot;?</em></a> and concluding that it was <em>really</em> hard. By analogy between &quot;bit rot&quot; and radioactivity, I estimated that keeping a petabyte for a century with a 50% chance of no bit flips required a bit half-life <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2007/06/petabyte-for-century.html">a hundred million times the age of the universe</a>. But that wasn't the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/01/how-hard-is-petabyte-for-century.html">fundamental problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic point I was making was that even if we ignore all the evidence that we can't, and assume that we could actually build a system reliable enough to preserve a petabyte for a century, we could not prove that we had done so. No matter how easy or hard you think a problem is, if it is impossible to prove that you have solved it, scepticism about proposed solutions is inevitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have to assume that, despite their best efforts, the Archive will over time lose some data. This isn't a problem for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Archive's collection is, fundamentally, a <em>sample</em> of cyberspace. Stuff missing is vastly more likely to be because it wasn't collected than because it was collected but subsequently lost.</li>
<li>Driving the already low probability of loss down further gets exponentially more expensive. The more of the Archive's limited resources is devoted to doing so, the less can be devoted to collecting and storing more stuff. Thus devoting more to eliminating data loss results in <em>less</em> data surviving.</li>
</ul>

Since at least <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2011/09/modeling-economics-of-long-term-storage.html">2011</a> I have written repeatedly about the fact that preserving data for the long term is and economic, not a technical problem. With a lavish budget it is simple; the smaller the budget the harder it gets. Li correctly points out that the Archive's budget, in the range of $25-30M/year, is vastly <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">lower than any comparable website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By owning its hardware, using the PetaBox high-density architecture, avoiding air conditioning costs, and using open-source software, the Archive achieves a storage cost efficiency that is orders of magnitude better than commercial cloud rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in making this point he uses a <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">flawed comparison</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the cost of storing 100 petabytes on Amazon S3. At standard rates (~<span class="math inline">\(0.021 per GB per month), the storage alone would cost over \)</span>2.1 million per month. The Internet Archive’s entire annual operating budget—for staff, buildings, legal defense, and hardware—is less than what it would cost to store their data on AWS for a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, Li ignores bandwidth charges, which as one of the most-visited sites on the Web would dwarf the storage charges. Second, Li compares S3, intended for and priced as instantly accessible, replicated data for the back-end of mission-critical online services, with the Archive's storage, intended for the long-term storage of data, most of which is accessed very rarely. Amazon has products aimed at this market. As an example, writing a Petabyte to Amazon Glacier, storing it for a decade, and then reading it out at last year's prices would <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html">cost just under $160K</a>. This too is a misleading comparison, Glacier is intended for <em>archival</em> data that has a much lower probability of access than the Archive's.</p>
<p>The key to making storage affordable is <em>tiering</em>, moving data that hasn't been accessed recently down the storage hierarchy to cheaper media. Kestutis Patiejunas gave an excellent talk about this back in 2014. I discussed it in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html"><em>More on Facebook's &quot;Cold Storage&quot;</em></a>. Facebook was in the happy position of having an extremely accurate model of the access patterns to each of the small number of data types they stored, so could do an very good job of matching the data to the performance of the layer in their storage hierarchy that held it. Their expectation was that the primary reason data in the lowest layer would be accessed was that it had been subpoenaed.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Today's links AI is how bosses wage war on &quot;professions&quot;: The only people *required* to tell their bosses to fuck off. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Enshittification v VC; Byrne v DRM; Forger does it for the exposure; Beach trash hotel; Mafia nicknames; Longbow puzzle; NIMBYs; No one should be on the No-Fly list. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. AI is how bosses wage war on &quot;professions&quot; (permalink) Growing up, I assumed that being a &quot;professional&quot; meant that you were getting paid to do something. That's a perfectly valid definition (I still remember feeling like a &quot;pro&quot; the first time I got paid for my writing), but &quot;professional&quot; has another, far more important definition. In this other sense of the word, a &quot;professional&quot; is someone bound to a code of conduct that supersedes both the demands of their employer and the demands of the state. Think of a doctor's Hippocratic Oath: having sworn to &quot;first do no harm,&quot; a doctor is (literally) duty-bound to refuse orders to harm their patients. If a hospital administrator, a police officer or a judge orders a doctor to harm their patient, they are supposed to refuse. Indeed, depending on how you feel about oaths, they are required to refuse. There are many &quot;professions&quot; bound to codes of conduct, policed to a greater or lesser extent by &quot;colleges&quot; or other professional associations, many of which have the power to bar a member from the profession for &quot;professional misconduct.&quot; Think of lawyers, accountants, medical professionals, librarians, teachers, some engineers, etc. While all of these fields are very different in terms of the work they do, they share one important trait: they are all fields that AI bros swear will be replaced by chatbots in the near future. I find this an interesting phenomenon. It's clear to me that chatbots can't do these jobs. Sure, there are instances in which professionals may choose to make use of some AI tools, and I'm happy to stipulate that when a skilled professional chooses to use AI as an adjunct to their work, it might go well. This is in keeping with my theory that to the extent that AI is useful, it's when its user is a centaur (a person assisted by technology), but that employers dream of making AI's users into reverse centaurs (machines who are assisted by people): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington</a> A psychotherapist who uses AI to transcribe sessions so they can refresh their memory about an exact phrase while they're making notes is a centaur. A psychotherapist who monitors 20 chat sessions with LLM &quot;therapists&quot; in order to intervene if the LLM starts telling patients to kill themselves is a &quot;reverse centaur.&quot; This situation makes it impossible for them to truly help &quot;their&quot; patients; they are an &quot;accountability sink,&quot; installed to absorb the blame when a patient is harmed by the AI. Lawyers might use a chatbot to help them format a brief or transcribe a client meeting (centaur)- but when senior partners require their juniors and paralegals to write briefs at inhuman speed (reverse centaur), they are setting themselves up for briefs full of &quot;hallucinated&quot; citations: <a href="https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/">https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/</a> I hold a bedrock view that even though an AI can't do your job, an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete</a> But why are bosses such easy marks for these gabby AI hustlers? Partly, it's because an AI can probably do your boss's job – if 90% of your job is answering email and delegating tasks, and if you are richly rewarded for success but get to blame failure on your underlings, then, yeah, an AI can totally do that job. But I think there's an important psychological dimension to this: bosses are especially easy to trick with AI when they're being asked to believe that they can use AI to fire workers who are in a position to tell them to fuck off. That certainly explains why bosses are so thrilled by the prospect of swapping professionals for chatbots. What a relief it would be to fire everyone who is professionally required to tell you to fuck off when you want them to do stupid and/or dangerous things; so you could replace them with servile, groveling LLMs that punctuate their sentences with hymns to your vision and brilliance! This also explains why media bosses are so anxious to fire screenwriters and actors and replace them with AI. After all, you prompt an LLM in exactly the same way a clueless studio boss gives notes to a writers' room: &quot;Give me ET, but make it about a dog, give it a love interest, and put a car chase in Act III.&quot; The difference is that the writers will call you a clueless fucking suit and demand that you go back to your spreadsheets and stop bothering them while they're trying to make a movie, whereas the chatbot will cheerfully shit out a (terrible) script to spec. The fact that the script will suck is less important than the fact that swapping writers for LLMs will let studio bosses escape ego-shattering conflicts with empowered workers who actually know how to do things. It also explains why bosses are so anxious to replace programmers with chatbots. When programmers were scarce and valuable, they had to be lured into employment with luxurious benefits, lavish pay, and a collegial relationship with their bosses, where everyone was &quot;just an engineer.&quot; Tech companies had business-wide engineering meetings where techies were allowed to tell their bosses that they thought their technical and business strategies were stupid. Now that tech worker supply has caught up with demand, bosses are relishing the thought of firing these &quot;entitled&quot; coders and replacing them with chatbots overseen by traumatized reverse centaurs who will never, ever tell them to fuck off: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/05/ex-princes-of-labor/#hyper-criti-hype">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/05/ex-princes-of-labor/#hyper-criti-hype</a> And of course, this explains why bosses are so eager to use AI to replace workers who might unionize: drivers, factory workers, warehouse workers. For what is a union if not an institution that lets you tell your boss to fuck off? <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/conde-nast-fires-union-staffers-video/">https://www.thewrap.com/conde-nast-fires-union-staffers-video/</a> AI salesmen may be slick, but they're not that slick. Bosses are easy marks for anyone who dangles the promise of a world where everyone – human and machine – follows orders to the letter, and praises you for giving them such clever, clever orders.

      <p>
      <p>Eighteen months ago, it was plausible that artificial intelligence might take a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/13/1089729/lets-not-make-the-same-mistakes-with-ai-that-we-made-with-social-media/">different path</a> than social media. Back then, AI’s development hadn’t consolidated under a small number of big tech firms. Nor had it capitalized on consumer attention, surveilling users and delivering ads.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the AI industry is now taking a page from the social media playbook and has set its sights on monetizing consumer attention. When OpenAI launched its <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT Search</a> feature in late 2024 and its browser, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">ChatGPT Atlas</a>, in October 2025, it kicked off a ...</p>

      <h1>2026-01-07 Discord IPO, again</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <h1>2026-01-07 Discord IPO, again</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Chat platform Discord filed confidentially for an initial public offering in the United States, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/chat-platform-discord-confidentially-file-us-ipo-bloomberg-news-reports-2026-01-06/">Chat platform Discord files confidentially for US IPO, Bloomberg News reports</a>, by Prakhar Srivastava and Nathan Gomes, for Reuters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re in the position to host things for your friends, here’s what has worked for me and my friends.</p>
<p>Set up an <strong>IRC server</strong>. We used <a href="https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd">ngircd</a> because it can federate so now we have a little network of two servers. That’s good for resilience. There are more modern IRC servers but they don’t federate like that. If you don’t need federation, then by all means pick something new like <a href="https://ergo.chat/">Ergo</a>.</p>
<p>Set up a <strong>web app</strong> for your IRC server. Or more than one! Nobody has to know that it’s all IRC under the hood. The one I am using is <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>. I’ve set it up such that file uploads are allowed and I’ve set up a job on the server that deletes any uploads older than two weeks. Just to be a bit safer. If you set it up with accounts, then every user gets a log and therefore it’s always on. Nobody needs to mess around with IRC bouncers like znc and proxies like WeeChat. <a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is another option but it doesn’t allow file uploads. And all the IRC nerds can still use IRC clients and paste-bins, of course.</p>
<p>If you can, set up a <strong>Discord/IRC bridge</strong>. We run <a href="https://github.com/zachbr/Dis4IRC">Dis4IRC</a> to connect our servers. This is a bot that connects to both your Discord Server and your IRC server and sends messages back and forth. It looks ugly but it works. This allows a gradual transition. It makes sure that the backup plan works and nobody has to move immediately. But those who are curious can check it out and follow along.</p>
<p>Set up a <strong>video conference server</strong>. I use <a href="https://galene.org/">Galène</a>. It was much easier to set up than Jitsi.</p>
<p>None of these offer custom emoji, message editing, invite links, easily accessible roles and permissions, server management, etc. Things are going to be different. All of the proposed solutions work on my small virtual machine I’m renting. This was important to me, too.</p>
<p>(Related blog post from last year: <a href="2025-03-09-discord-ipo">2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>2026-01-20</strong>. <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@paco" title="@paco@infosec.exchange">@paco</a> writes that Discord outsourced their age verification to some vendor. Makes sense, it’s cost effective and age verification is mandatory in some jurisdictions. Remember the Online Safety Act in the UK? <a href="2025-08-28-online-safety">2025-08-28 Online safety, maybe</a>. The age verification service Discord used just had <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">a data beach</a> exposing photos of government IDs for 70,000 people. Sooner or later, this will happen if perfect security is impossible. And now we have to ask ourselves: Was this a good trade-off?</p>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <h1>2026-01-19 The Lounge for the elderly</h1>
<p><a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a> is a web app that acts as an always-on chat client for IRC. I use it all the time since I don’t have to understand how a “bouncer” like <code>znc</code> works to be always on, nor do I need to have a WeeChat proxy running somewhere.</p>
<p>I use it for our little network for role-playing game enthusiasts at <a href="https://grenzland.club/">Grenzland</a> as well as <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera Chat</a>, <a href="https://tilde.chat/">Tilde Chat</a> and two other, smaller IRC servers.</p>
<p>I use it on the phone, too. You can an “add it to the homescreen” and it works just fine. Until recently, I thought that the font-size was a problem, though. I’m over fifty and I like my text to be bigger these days. 😥</p>
<p>In The Lounge, click the cog wheel for Settings → Appearance and paste the following into the custom CSS at the bottom:</p>
<pre><code>.header .title,
.header .topic,
.messages .msg,
.userlist,
input {
  font-size: 16pt;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
.channel-list-item {
  font-size: 13pt;
  padding: 4px 7px;
}
.channel-list-item[data-type=&quot;lobby&quot;] {
  font-size: 14pt;
}
/* input box, specially when not expanded */
#form #input {
  font-size: 13pt;
  padding: 1pt 7px;
  height: 15pt;
}
/* unread message count */
.channel-list-item .badge {
  font-size: 12pt;
}
#settings .error, .window label, .window li, .window p {
    font-size: 14pt;
}
/* phones and the like */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    #context-menu, #form #input, #help .help-item, #loading, #settings .error, #sidebar .empty, .channel-list-item, .header .topic, .messages .msg, .textcomplete-menu, .window label {
        font-size: 15pt;
    }
}
/* long usernames */
#chat .from {
  width: 15ch;
}

</code></pre>
<p>It probably still needs some tweaking but it’s already much better.</p>
<p>Here is also where you can change the theme. The screenshot below uses the “Morning” theme, plus an earlier version of the font-size changes given above.</p>
<p><img src="2026-01-19-the-lounge-1.jpg" alt="A chat channel, with larger font-size and “Morning” theme, showing me, talking to lkh and norn, our bot."></p>

I really like how the use of <a href="2026-01-19-the-lounge">web apps like The Lounge</a> have been helping us get there.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://betola.de/wandererbill/">@wandererbill</a> has offered an old server he had running and handed out staff membership to a lot of us. And we started setting stuff up. A <a href="https://grenzland.club/">web site</a>, a <a href="https://wiki.grenzland.club/">wiki</a> (guess who did that…), a <a href="https://wiki.grenzland.club/view/mud">MUD</a>, another networked IRC server, a networked net news server. It has the vibe of a public access system (see <a href="https://github.com/cwmccabe/pubnixhist">pubnix history</a>), a <a href="https://tildeverse.org/">tildeverse</a> server or a <a href="https://sdfeu.org/w/">Super Dimensional Fortress</a> (SDF). You get an account, things feel retro, but they don’t take a lot of resources and it’s all human scale.</p>

      <h1>Music</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>What good is life without music.</p>
<p>But that’s impossible,</p>
<p>one
shuffle has always led to another.</p>
<p>One man hears it start on his
lathe,</p>
<p>a mother beats her eggs.</p>
<p>There’s a typewriter in the
next room.</p>
<p>Two cars are angry at each other.</p>
<p>The baby
downstairs is wet again.</p>
<p>I remember the voice of a dead
friend.</p>
<p>Everything speaks at the same time.</p>
<p>Music will watch
us drown.</p>
<p>I write letters to all those from whom I receive</p>
<p>and to many of
those from I don’t.</p>
<p>I read books, anything, useless piles of
random</p>
<p>isufferable rubbish for which, in my torpid panic,</p>
<p>I
fall through time and space each day</p>
<p>in my foolish way,
remembering only the present feeling,</p>
<p>not the village with its
face of death</p>
<p>nothing to be carried secretly in a car.</p>

      <h1>jordanhubbard/nanolang</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang">jordanhubbard/nanolang</a></strong></p>
<p>Plenty of people have mused about what a new programming language specifically designed to be used by LLMs might look like. Jordan Hubbard ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hubbard">co-founder of FreeBSD</a>, with serious stints at Apple and NVIDIA) just released exactly that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A minimal, LLM-friendly programming language with mandatory testing and unambiguous syntax.</p>
<p>NanoLang transpiles to C for native performance while providing a clean, modern syntax optimized for both human readability and AI code generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The syntax strikes me as an interesting mix between C, Lisp and Rust.</p>
<p>I decided to see if an LLM could produce working code in it directly, given the necessary context. I started with this <a href="https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang/blob/main/MEMORY.md">MEMORY.md</a> file, which begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This file is designed specifically for Large Language Model consumption. It contains the essential knowledge needed to generate, debug, and understand NanoLang code. Pair this with <code>spec.json</code> for complete language coverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran that using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m claude-opus-4.5 \
  -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang/refs/heads/main/MEMORY.md \
  'Build me a mandelbrot fractal CLI tool in this language'
  &gt; /tmp/fractal.nano

</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7847f022566d11629ec2139f1d109fb8#mandelbrot-fractal-cli-tool-in-nano">resulting code</a>... <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7847f022566d11629ec2139f1d109fb8?permalink_comment_id=5947465#gistcomment-5947465">did not compile</a>.</p>
<p>I may have been too optimistic expecting a one-shot working program for a new language like this. So I ran a clone of the actual project, copied in my program and had Claude Code take a look at the failing compiler output.</p>
<p>... and it worked! Claude happily grepped its way through the various <code>examples/</code> and built me a working program.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?9696da6882cb6596be6a9d5196e8a7a5/index.html">the Claude Code transcript</a> - you can see it <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?9696da6882cb6596be6a9d5196e8a7a5/page-001.html#msg-2026-01-19T23-43-09-675Z">reading relevant examples here</a> - and here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/e7f3577adcfd392ab7fa23b1295d00f2">the finished code plus its output</a>.</p>
<p>I've suspected <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/7/llms-for-new-programming-languages/">for a while</a> that LLMs and coding agents might significantly reduce the friction involved in launching a new language. This result reinforces my opinion.</p>

Luke Plant makes a very persuasive argument for view functions (FBV) - especially about their being more explicit especially when it comes to the transparency of passing request into each view function. He is quite negative about class-based views (CBV). I kind of agree about CBVs hiding details and making it harder to know what to change. I would be lost without the Classy Class-Based Views site but Luke’s critiques are more about CBVs creating layers of indirection and actually introducing extra boilerplate as compared to FBVs.</p>

      <p>If Trump declares that the U.S. is laying claim to all of the green cheese on the moon — say, to lower the price of dairy groceries — the news media should not respond with fact-finding articles with headlines like “How Much Cheese Is on the Moon?” They should respond with headlines like “How Many Marbles Are Left in Trump’s Head?”</p>

      <p>I took a couple of falls on ice the other day, during one of the many snowstorms we've had, and both times my watch, after a polite pause, shook my wrist, asking if I just took a fall and should it call in an emergency? if you don't do anything it makes the call. In that sense, your watch could beep when someone is gaslighting the other person. If it was you gaslighting them you'd see your avatar on the screen. Of it's them, you can show it to them.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Social media without socializing (19 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Social media without socializing: For Zuck, your friends are a problem to be solved. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: &quot;Among Others&quot;; Vagina tea-balls; MLK was a socialist; Planet Money's free Gatsby audiobook; Bounty for wiretapping lefty profs; Poe's graveside ritual; Sleep Mafia; Whence came tarps; GM's Dieslgate; NRO's octopus; Amazon solidarity; Billionaire-proofing the internet. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Social media without socializing (permalink) From the earliest days of social media, social media bosses have been at war with sociability. To create a social media service is to demarcate legitimate and illegitimate forms of sociability. It's a monumental act of hubris, really. It was ever thus. The founder of Friendster decreed that people could only form friendship bonds with each other, but could not declare themselves to be &quot;friends&quot; of everyone with a common interest. You and I could be friends, but you couldn't be &quot;friends&quot; with a group called &quot;bloggers.&quot; Each member of that group would have to create a reciprocal friendship link to see one another's feeds. Way back in 1999, Larry Lessig taught us that &quot;code is law.&quot; By encoding these restrictions into the feed, Friendster's programmers were putting limits on the kinds of relationships that could be formed using the service. But Lessig's law (code?) is often overidden by an even older principle: William Gibson's 1982 maxim that &quot;the street finds its own uses for things.&quot; Friendster told its users how to be friends with one another, and Friendster's users treated Friendster's management as damage and routed around it. They created accounts with names like &quot;New York City&quot; and whenever anyone friended that account, it friended them back. Users hacked their own way to form &quot;illegitimate&quot; friendships based on affinity into the system: <a href="https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2003/08/17/the">https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2003/08/17/the</a>_fakester_manifesto.html As social media turned into a billion- (and then a trillion-) dollar business, the urgency of the struggle between how social media bosses demanded that we socialize and how we wanted to socialize only got sharper. Mark Zuckerberg doubtless thought he was covering all his bases when he tossed a casual &quot;It's complicated&quot; to the pulldown menu for defining your relationship status, but that's because he doesn't understand how complicated all our relationships are: <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/07/10/facebook-complicated-relationship-status/">https://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/07/10/facebook-complicated-relationship-status/</a> For Zuck, crisply defined relationships were things that he could do simple math on in order to target ads, make recommendations, and sort users into categories. When you need to treat relationships as elements in a series of discrete mathematical operations, the fact that relationships are intrinsically, irreducibly qualitative is a serious bug. So Zuck did what computer scientists usually do when they want to do math on qualitative variables: he incinerated all the qualitative elements by quantizing them, and then did math on the dubious residue that remained: <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-qualia/">https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-qualia/</a> Zuck's biggest problem isn't the ambiguity of your social connections, though – it's that they exist at all. Think about it: Mark Zuckerberg personally makes or loses billions of dollars based on how much you socialize with your friends on his platforms. If your friends engage with you in ways that are low intensity and easily concluded (&quot;How'd you sleep?&quot; &quot;Just fine.&quot; &quot;That's nice.&quot;), then he loses. If, on the other hand, you and your friends get into protracted, intense interactions, he gets to show you so many ads and make so much money. Your friends are a problem for Mark Zuckerberg to solve, and (to his undying chagrin), you and your friends stubbornly refuse to organize your relationships around Zuck's financial imperatives. You just wanna hang out in the rhythms that are part of any friendship – sometimes intense, sometimes casual, often sporadic. I mean, honestly, if you're going to insist on just having normal friendships, how the hell can Mark Zuckerberg post the kind of growth his shareholders expect? This explains much of the drive to transform Facebook from a platform that shows you the things your friends post to a platform that mostly shows you things that &quot;content creators&quot; post. Your friends aren't motivated by the dangling possibility of viral dollars if they get you to &quot;engage&quot; with their posts, but for content creators, your engagement buys the groceries and pays the rent. By swapping out your friends and replacing them with people who are highly motivated to &quot;engage&quot; with you, Zuck gets a lever he can yank to get his users to arrange their conduct in ways that goose his growth. In other words, Zuck lured you in with the promise of having pleasurable online conversations that matter to you; and now that he's trapped you, he wants you to break up with your friends so you have more time to watch his community access cable station. It also explains Zuck's passion for filling his platform with botshit, and his plan to solve the loneliness epidemic by giving you chatbots instead of friends: <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/26/mark-zuckerberg-ai-friends-hinge-ceo/">https://fortune.com/2025/06/26/mark-zuckerberg-ai-friends-hinge-ceo/</a> For Mark Zuckerberg, all people are just shitty chatbots – chatbots that won't follow orders. He wants to be able to point us at one another in the hopes that we will simply prompt one another into endless chatter, with endless scrolling, and endless ad insertions. This works great with chatbots, not so well with people: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNagNezo8w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNagNezo8w</a> After all, Zuck doesn't really believe most other people exist. Read Careless People, Sarah Wynn-Williams's tell-all whistleblower memoir about her years at Facebook and you'll quickly realize that for Zuck, people are statistical artifacts, not co-equal beings worthy of moral consideration: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf</a> Billionaires are plagued by solipsism. Not believing other people exist is a great aid to billionairedom, because it lets you amass your fortune without scrupling over the population-scale misery you're inflicting on the way: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs</a> For Zuck, AI is the most exciting technology in history (even more exciting than the Metaverse, if you can believe it!) because it might give him the world he dreams of: a world without people, or, at very least, a social media network without any socializing: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism</a> Hey look at this (permalink) Congress Wants To Hand Your Parenting to Big Tech <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/congress-wants-hand-your-parenting-big-tech">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/congress-wants-hand-your-parenting-big-tech</a> AI companies will fail.

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/09/14/bucky.png" alt="">First, glad I wrote the political blog post <a href="http://scripting.com/2026/01/18.html#a180328">yesterday</a>. Enough is enough. I love Minnesota. I want to wear a Minnesota baseball cap today. I want to fly a Minnesota flag on my front lawn. And I want Congress to do their job and put a stop to this bullshit before Trump sends the US army into Minneapolis, putting our fine American soldiers in an intolerable place, to refuse to obey an order because it's obviously wrong. What Congress can do is make it an <em>illegal</em> order. Take the burden off the miltary.</p>
<p>Did you know I can speak in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uff_da">uff-da</a> accent? Brought to you by three wonderful years in Wisconsin at the UW in Madison. Fuck em Bucky!</p>
<p>Now, I've been on a project to get my eating habits down for more weight loss and better health. I have Facebook reels to thank for that. I've been listening to all the science and advice about keeping your bloodstream sugar from spiking while still eating well. And the more I listen to the advice, the more advice I get.</p>
<p>I love eating a bowl of oatmeal in the morning with some crushed walnuts, butter, raisins, and after it's cooked for five minutes in the microwave, some fresh berries mixed in. But I figured this isn't good. I've been taught that a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LS1rYqGFcMg">savory breakfast</a> is better. So I had a two-egg omelet with melted cheese and half an english muffin with butter. I couldn't even finish the muffin. I feel full. And I'm drinking my coffee made with my Kuerig.</p>
<p>It was a rough night last night. I'm so exhausted with feeling the whole world crumbling around us. Trump wants to take us back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)">Robber Baron</a> America of the 19th century. I hear that sucked. We have to get together and say out loud everywhere this is not cool. Democrats and Republicans in Congress, we elected you to check this kind of bullshit. If you don't do your jobs, Senators and Representatives -- we're going to vote you out next chance we get, I don't care if you're a Democrat.</p>
<p>The Democrats have a great opportunity now, I hear, to put an end to ICE. Do it, or else you're history, politically. You can't have a career going forward if you're on the wrong side of this one.</p>
<p>And btw, proof that life goes on -- I am so sick of snow. It had to come on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States">holiday weekend</a> when there's no point trying to go skiing because the lift lines and crowds on the slope take all the fun out of it. And this is great skiing snow, light and fluffy. I hope some of it is still around later in the week.</p>

      <h1>Trad travels</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>For the past few years, I’ve been <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22166">taking a trip to Spain</a> at the end of September for the <a href="https://www.irishfleadh.com/">Cáceres Irish Fleadh</a>. Last year I convinced my friends Liam and Monica to come along and they had a great time.</p>
<p>Like me, Liam just loves playing in sessions. Also like me, Liam likes to spend the gloomy short days of January thinking about travelling somewhere …and then playing in sessions there.</p>
<p>I told him I’d put together a list of potential trips for the discerning session hound. I figured I might as well share it here too…</p>
<p>First of all, there are Irish music festivals. Alas, most festivals don’t happen in the sunny climes of Spain. As you’d expect, most of them are in Ireland.</p>
<p>I’m heading to Carlingford at the end of this month for a weekend of <a href="https://www.feilenatana.com/">Féile na Tána</a>. I haven’t been before but it looks good. There’ll be the usual amalgam of workshops, concerts, and sessions.</p>
<p>Myself and <a href="https://wordridden.com/">Jessica</a> will fly in to Belfast, then take the train down to Newry and get to Carlingford from there. You could fly into Dublin and get the train up to Dundalk, but the only Gatwick flights to Dublin are Ryan Air, and I’d rather entrust my instrument to EasyJet.</p>
<p>At the end of March we’re heading to <a href="https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/">Tullamore Trad Fest</a>. That’s another one we haven’t been to before. Again, there’ll be workshops, concerts, and sessions.</p>
<p>Tullamore is just an hour away from Dublin by train and has plenty of accommodation options. We’ve booked into <a href="https://www.seadewhouse.com/">a nice-looking B&amp;B</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no avoiding Ryan Air for this trip and I want to take my good mandolin, so I’ve gone ahead and <a href="https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/articles/12889013645713-What-music-equipment-can-I-bring-on-board">booked a separate seat</a> for it. I don’t want to take any chances with an airline that actively seeks to elevate misery.</p>
<p>The festival I heartily recommend is <a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">Belfast Trad Fest</a> at the end of July. It’s super convenient to get to with EasyJet flights from Gatwick—go to Belfast <em>city</em> airport, which is right downtown.</p>
<p>The festival offers a really good accommodation deal in modern student flats. The workshops are top-notch, and best of all, it has a really well-organised session trail. You can easily play in sessions all afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>This year, for the first time ever, Belfast trad fest is immediately followed by <a href="https://fleadhcheoil.ie/">the all-Ireland fleadh</a>, which promises to be pandemonium. I’ve never been to the fleadh before but I’m going to stick around Belfast for it.</p>
<p>You could head to the <a href="https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/">Willie Clancy Festival</a> in Miltown Malbay at the start of July (the website seems to be having some issues right now). But good luck finding accommodation. The event is so big now that unless you’re camping, there’s not much chance of finding a place to stay. If you make it there though, non-stop sessions await. Non-stop chaos awaits too. That’s part of the deal. Great workshops though!</p>
<p>There are other festivals I haven’t been to but I’ve heard great things about. <a href="https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/">The Pádraig O’Keeffe Festival</a> in Kerry in October sounds fantastic, especially if you like your polkas and slides. But it’s in Castleisland, which doesn’t have much in the way of accommodation. So unless you’ve got transport, it’s going to be tricky.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://kilkennytradfest.com/">a trad fest in Kilkenny in March</a>. I’ve never been but they’ve got a session trail. You’d need to fly into either Dublin or Cork and then get on a bus. Either way, it’s Ryan Air from Gatwick.</p>
<p>I’ve also never been to the <a href="https://ennistradfest.com/">Ennis Trad Fest</a> in county Clare in November but I’ve heard good things. Accommodation for the 2026 event is already in short supply though.</p>
<p>But you don’t need a festival to play in sessions. In fact, the kind of sessions you end up in at festivals have a different vibe to the usual sessions, simply because they’re formed of a hodge-podge of visiting players.</p>
<p>There a few spots in Ireland where you’re guaranteed a session pretty much any night of the week.</p>
<p>I love Galway. There are afternoon sessions in Taafe’s and Tigh Cóilí as well as evening sessions in the Crane and other places. You’d need to fly into Dublin and get the train from there. It takes about two hours.</p>
<p>Galway is busy in the summer time and accommodation can be pricy, but if you go off-season you can find some cheaper options.</p>
<p>Ennis has <a href="https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland">music most nights</a>. There’s a regular bus service between Ennis and Shannon airport that’s nice and quick. You’d need to fly Ryan Air from Gatwick though.</p>
<p>And then there’s Belfast again. Even when the trad fest isn’t happening, Belfast has sessions seven nights a week. Check out the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/belfastsessionguide/">Belfast session guide Instagram account</a> for up-to-date details.</p>
<p>I recommend staying in <a href="https://www.theflintbelfast.com/">The Flint</a>, but make sure you ask for a room on the top floor far away from the nightclub if you’re there on a weekend.</p>
<p>So, to recap, here are some festivals to check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.feilenatana.com/">Féile na Tána</a> in Carlingford, county Louth in January (I’m going),</li>

      <h1>Scaling long-running autonomous coding</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents">Scaling long-running autonomous coding</a></strong></p>
<p>Wilson Lin at Cursor has been doing some experiments to see how far you can push a large fleet of &quot;autonomous&quot; coding agents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This post describes what we've learned from running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work, and watching them write over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They ended up running planners and sub-planners to create tasks, then having workers execute on those tasks - similar to how Claude Code uses sub-agents. Each cycle ended with a judge agent deciding if the project was completed or not.</p>
<p>In my predictions for 2026 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-someone-will-build-a-new-browser-using-mainly-ai-assisted-coding-and-it-won-t-even-be-a-surprise">the other day</a> I said that by 2029:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won’t even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine[...] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it’ll get so much easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may have been off by three years, because Cursor chose &quot;building a web browser from scratch&quot; as their test case for their agent swarm approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender">the source code on GitHub</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how well did they do? Their initial announcement a couple of days ago was met with <a href="https://embedding-shapes.github.io/cursor-implied-success-without-evidence/">unsurprising skepticism</a>, especially when it became apparent that their GitHub Actions CI was failing and there were no build instructions in the repo.</p>
<p>It looks like they addressed that within the past 24 hours. The <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/blob/main/README.md#build-requirements">latest README</a> includes build instructions which I followed on macOS like this:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender
cd fastrender
git submodule update --init vendor/ecma-rs
cargo run --release --features browser_ui --bin browser

</code></pre>
<p>This got me a working browser window! Here are screenshots I took of google.com and my own website:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/cursor-google.png" alt="The browser chrome is neat but has a garbled tab name at the top. The Google homepage looks mostly correct but the buttons are not styled correctly and the Google Search one has a huge plus icon floating near it."></p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/cursor-simonwillison.jpg" alt="My blog looks mostly correct, but the right closing quotation mark on a quotation (which is implemented as a background image on the final paragraph) is displayed incorrectly multiple times."></p>
<p>Honestly those are very impressive! You can tell they're not just wrapping an existing rendering engine because of those very obvious rendering glitches, but the pages are legible and look mostly correct.</p>
<p>The FastRender repo even uses Git submodules <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/tree/main/specs">to include various WhatWG and CSS-WG specifications</a> in the repo, which is a smart way to make sure the agents have access to the reference materials that they might need.</p>
<p>This is the second attempt I've seen at building a full web browser using AI-assisted coding in the past two weeks - the first was <a href="https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave">HiWave browser</a>, a new browser engine in Rust first announced <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1q4xfm0/over_christmas_break_i_wrote_a_fully_functional/">in this Reddit thread</a>.</p>
<p>When I made my 2029 prediction this is more-or-less the quality of result I had in mind. I don't think we'll see projects of this nature compete with Chrome or Firefox or WebKit any time soon but I have to admit I'm very surprised to see something this capable emerge so quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Update 23rd January 2026</strong>: I recorded a 47 minute conversation with Wilson about this project and published it on YouTube. Here's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/23/fastrender/">the video and accompanying highlights</a>.</p>

      <h1>GSoC 2025: Advanced symbol resolution for Clang-Repl</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello! I’m Sahil Patidar, and this summer I had the opportunity to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 with the LLVM Organization.My project focused on enhancing ORC-JIT and <code>Clang-Repl</code> by introducing a new feature for advanced symbol resolution, aimed at improving runtime symbol handling and flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Mentors</strong>: Vassil Vassilev, Aaron Jomy</p>
<h2>Overview of the Project</h2>
<p><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangRepl.html">Clang-Repl</a> is an interactive C++ interpreter built on top of LLVM’s ORC JIT, enabling incremental compilation and execution.However, when user code references symbols from external libraries, those libraries must currently be loaded manually. This happens because ORC JIT does not automatically resolve symbols from libraries that haven’t been loaded yet.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, my project introduces an automatic library resolver for unresolved symbols in ORC JIT, improving Clang-Repl’s runtime by making external symbol handling seamless and user-friendly.</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of my project was to design and implement a new Library-Resolution API for ORC-JIT.This API acts as a smart symbol resolver — when ORC-JIT encounters an unresolved symbol, it can call this API to find where the symbol exists and which library provides it.</p>
<p>The next step is to integrate this API into ORC-JIT, so that <code>Clang-Repl</code> can automatically use it to handle missing symbols without requiring manual library loading.</p>
<h2>Library-Resolution: Smarter Symbol Resolver</h2>
<p>During my GSoC project, one of the major components I worked on was Library-Resolution — an API we re-designed and re-implemented based on Cling’s original library-resolver.</p>
<p>In simple terms, Library-Resolution acts as a smart library resolver.It doesn’t actually load libraries — instead, it finds where the missing symbols (unresolved references) can be found and provides their correct library paths.</p>
<p>This makes it a powerful helper when dealing with unresolved symbols during execution.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>When system (Orc-JIT or any) encounters an unresolved symbol, system can call the resolver to find symbols that not found.It scans through user-provided library paths, checks potential matches, and identifies the libraries that contain the missing symbols — all without directly loading them.</p>
<p>At the heart of this system is the <code>LibraryResolver</code>, which runs the resolution process by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scanning available libraries.</li>
<li>Filtering symbols efficiently using Bloom filters.</li>
<li>Matching unresolved symbols through a <code>SymbolQuery</code> tracker.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result: symbols are mapped to their correct library paths, and system can continue execution seamlessly.</p>
<h3>Core Components Overview</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the key components that make Library-Resolution work:</p>
<h4>1. LibraryResolver</h4>
<p>The main coordinator that controls the entire flow — from scanning libraries to managing symbol lookups.It ensures that unresolved symbols are systematically matched to libraries.</p>
<h4>2. LibraryScanner</h4>
<p>Handles the actual scanning of directories and library paths.It detects valid shared libraries and registers them with the <code>LibraryManager</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LibraryScanHelper</strong> → Keeps track of directories that need to be scanned.</li>
<li><strong>LibrarySearchPath</strong> → Represents a directory and its type (User/System) along with its current scan state.</li>
<li><strong>PathResolver</strong> → Normalizes and resolves file paths efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>LibraryPathCache</strong> → Stores already-resolved paths and symbolic links to prevent repeated filesystem checks.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. LibraryManager</h4>
<p>Maintains metadata about all discovered libraries.Each library is represented by a <code>LibraryInfo</code> object containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library path</li>
<li>Load status (loaded or not)</li>
<li>A <strong>Bloom filter</strong> for fast symbol existence checks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Symbol Resolution Flow</h3>
<p>Here’s how everything fits together in the resolution process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start</strong>: The process begins with a list of unresolved symbols, passed to the <code>LibraryResolver</code> to create a <code>SymbolQuery</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Scan</strong>: The resolver scans user and system library paths to find new or unregistered libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Cache &amp; Filter</strong>: For each library, if it doesn’t yet have a Bloom filter, one is created to enable faster lookups in future scans.</li>
<li><strong>Match</strong>: Each unresolved symbol is tested against these filters. If a likely match is found and verified, the symbol is linked to that library’s path.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>: This continues until all symbols are resolved or no more valid libraries remain.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong>: The results are returned through a completion callback.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Summary of accomplished tasks</h2>
<h3>ExecutorResolver:</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/143654">143654</a> suggested by @lhames.we introduced a <code>DylibSymbolResolver</code> that helps resolve symbols for each loaded dylib.</p>
<p>Previously, we returned a DylibHandle to the controller. Now, we wrap the native handle inside <code>DylibSymbolResolver</code> and return a <code>ResolverHandle</code> instead. This makes the code cleaner and separates the symbol resolution logic from raw handle management.</p>
<p>with this changes this will help us to integrate LibraryResolver API using some future through new <code>AutoDylibResolver</code>.</p>
<h3>Library-Resolver API:</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/165360">#165360</a></p>
<p>This is the main API we redesigned based on cling auto library-resolver. this api provide way to user to add search-path and ask for symbols to search and provide resolved library for each symbols.</p>
<h2>Result: What the Library-Resolution API Enables</h2>
<p>With these updates, we now have a fully functional Library-Resolution API that can dynamically resolve missing symbols to their correct shared libraries — all without loading the libraries directly.</p>
<p>This new system can <strong>discover</strong>, <strong>query</strong>, and <strong>match</strong> unresolved symbols across user and system paths, providing the exact library paths where those symbols exist. It serves as a powerful helper for ORC-JIT and Clang-Repl’s runtime infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here’s a short example showing how the API can be configured and used to trigger the resolution process:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::Setup S = llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::Setup::create({});// Define a callback that decides whether a library should be scannedS.ShouldScanCall = [&amp;](llvm::StringRef lib) -&gt; bool { return true; };// Create the driver that coordinates the resolutionController = llvm::orc::LibraryResolutionDriver::create(S);// Add user and system library paths to be scannedfor (const auto &amp;SP : SearchPaths) Controller-&gt;addScanPath(SP, llvm::orc::PathType::User);// Prepare the symbols to be resolvedstd::vector&lt;std::string&gt; Sym;Sym.push_back(MangledName);// Configure resolution policyllvm::orc::SearchConfig Config;Config.Policy = { {{llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Queried, llvm::orc::PathType::User}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Unloaded, llvm::orc::PathType::User}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Queried, llvm::orc::PathType::System}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Unloaded, llvm::orc::PathType::System}}};Config.Options.FilterFlags = llvm::orc::SymbolEnumeratorOptions::IgnoreUndefined;// Run the symbol resolutionController-&gt;resolveSymbols( Sym, [&amp;](llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::SymbolQuery &amp;Q) { if (auto S = Q.getResolvedLib(MangledName)) Res = *S; }, Config);
</code></pre>
<h2>Additional Improvements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post describes ongoing design work. The implementation is still under review and may evolve as feedback is incorporated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this phase, I worked on value-printing support for both <strong>in-process</strong> and <strong>out-of-process</strong> execution in <code>Clang-Repl</code>.Previously, <code>Clang-Repl</code> only supported value printing in the in-process mode, and the same implementation couldn’t be directly applied to the out-of-process case.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Dependency on type information</strong></p>
<p>The value-printing logic depends on the type information of the JIT-compiled expression result to correctly interpret and cast the result into a <code>Value</code> object.In the in-process setup, this is straightforward — process symbols such as <code>__clang_interpreter*</code>, which are used to capture the result at runtime along with its type information, reside within the controller. This allows the call to use pointer type information directly to interpret the resulting value correctly.However, in the out-of-process setup, those symbols exist in the controller, while the actual evaluated result resides in the executor. Even if we set up the runtime call in the executor, we still need to access the type information that remains on the controller side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No direct executor-to-controller calls</strong></p>
<p>In the out-of-process model, we cannot directly invoke controller-side functions from the JIT-compiled code running in the executor. This limitation made the previous mechanism unsuitable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Approach (Initial design — under review)</h3>
<p><strong>Pull Request:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/156649">#156649</a></p>
<p>We reimplemented the value-printing infrastructure on top of the ORC MemoryAccess API.The old design supported only in-process evaluation; the new design works in both in-process and out-of-process environments.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Capturing the JIT Expression Result</strong></p>
<p>With the new design, we adopted a different approach:we now take the address of the evaluated JIT expression result and pass it to a runtime call.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">EXTERN_C void __clang_Interpreter_SendResultValue(void *Ctx, unsigned long long, void *);// In-process: Ctx is a pointer to the ValueResultManager object, // allowing us to call ValueResultManager::deliverResult.EXTERN_C void __orc_rt_SendResultValue(unsigned long long, void *);// Out-of-process version.
</code></pre>
<p>At the AST level, we perform the necessary transformations to insert this runtime call.When adding the runtime “sugar” call to the expression AST, the expression must be an lvalue, so we can safely cast it to a <code>void*</code> and pass it to the runtime helper.</p>
<p>If the expression is already an lvalue, we simply cast and pass its address directly.If it’s an rvalue, we modify the AST to convert it into an lvalue, ensuring it can be handled uniformly by the runtime call added to the expression AST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking results via <code>ValueResultManager</code></strong></p>
<p>We introduced a new helper, <code>ValueResultManager</code>, which tracks upcoming expression results using a unique <code>Expr ID -&gt; TypeInfo</code> mapping.The expression’s runtime call includes this ID, which is later returned to the controller-side handler when the executor reports back.</p>
<p><strong>Executor runtime call example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">RC_RT_JIT_DISPATCH_TAG(__orc_rt_SendResultValue_tag)ORC_RT_INTERFACE void __orc_rt_SendResultValue(uint64_t ResultId, void *V) { Error OptErr = Error::success(); if (auto Err = WrapperFunction&lt;SPSError(uint64_t, SPSExecutorAddr)&gt;::call( JITDispatch(&amp;__orc_rt_SendResultValue_tag), OptErr, ResultId, ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(V))) { cantFail(std::move(OptErr)); cantFail(std::move(Err)); } consumeError(std::move(OptErr));}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Controller-side runtime call for in-process:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">REPL_EXTERNAL_VISIBILITY void__clang_Interpreter_SendResultValue(void *Ctx, uint64_t Id, void *Addr) { static_cast&lt;ValueResultManager *&gt;(Ctx)-&gt;deliverResult( [](llvm::Error Err) { llvm::cantFail(std::move(Err)); }, Id, llvm::orc::ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(Addr));}
</code></pre>
<p>This mechanism allows both in-process and out-of-process environments to deliver evaluated result addresses to <code>ValueResultManager::deliverResult</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading and formatting values</strong></p>
<p>On receiving the address, the <code>ValueResultManager</code> calls into a <code>ValueReaderDispatcher</code>, which uses <strong>MemoryAccess</strong> to read values from memory using the address and type information.The evaluated data is then wrapped in a redesigned <code>Value</code> class and finally converted to a string via a <code>ValueToString</code> printer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>New <code>Value</code> class design</h3>
<p>The new <code>Value</code> implementation is inspired by <code>APValue</code> and designed to handle both local and remote execution enviroment.</p>
<p>Key improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports array element store and access by index.</li>
<li>Works safely in out-of-process mode — the old design, which assumed arrays lived in controller-side memory (invalid in remote execution).</li>
<li>Provides a unified way to represent, store, and print evaluated results across environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other PRs</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/166510">166510</a> <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/166147">166147</a></p>
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>The next step will be to continue development on the ORC-JIT side, aligned with the ongoing evolution of the Executor layer.Once the new Executor design stabilizes, we’ll revisit the Library-Resolution API and make any necessary adjustments for compatibility and cleaner integration.This work will be done under the guidance of Lang Hames, ensuring it fits well within the evolving ORC architecture.</p>
<p>The next phase of this project focuses on integrating the Library-Resolution API into ORC-JIT.Specifically, we plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduce the AutoDylibResolver</strong> — based on the groundwork implemented in the <em>ExecutorResolver</em> pull request.This component will allow ORC-JIT to automatically invoke the Library-Resolution API whenever it encounters an unresolved symbol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable automatic library loading</strong> in ORC-JIT.Once integrated, ORC-JIT (and tools like <code>Clang-Repl</code>) will be able to automatically locate and load the required libraries during runtime — removing the need for users to manually load them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This next step will complete the feature chain — from symbol detection to automatic library resolution and loading — making <code>Clang-Repl</code> more user-friendly.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through this project, we now have a working Library-Resolver API implementation in ORC-JIT.Moving forward, the focus will be on integrating this API into ORC-JIT to enable automatic library loading and further improve <code>Clang-Repl</code> and other projects that use ORC-JIT as their execution engine.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c">FLUX.2-klein-4B Pure C Implementation</a></strong></p>
<p>On 15th January Black Forest Labs, a lab formed by the creators of the original Stable Diffusion, released <a href="https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B">black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B</a> - an Apache 2.0 licensed 4 billion parameter version of their FLUX.2 family.</p>
<p>Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez) decided to build a pure C and dependency-free implementation to run the model, with assistance from Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5.</p>
<p>Salvatore shared <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670279#46671233">this note</a> on Hacker News:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something that may be interesting for the reader of this thread: this project was possible only once I started to tell Opus that it <em>needed</em> to take a file with all the implementation notes, and also accumulating all the things we discovered during the development process. And also, the file had clear instructions to be taken updated, and to be processed ASAP after context compaction. This kinda enabled Opus to do such a big coding task in a reasonable amount of time without loosing track. Check the file IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md in the GitHub repo for more info.</p>

      <h1>Easy Measures Doing, Simple Measures Understanding</h1>

(date: 2026-01-18)
      <p>
      <p>In <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2026-01-18T2051">his talk</a>, I like the way Jake Nations pits easy vs. simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Easy means you can add it to your system quickly. Simple means you can understand the work that you’ve done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this framing.</p>
<p>Easy means you can do with little effort.</p>
<p>Simple means you can understand what you do with little effort.</p>
<p>In other words: easy measures the effort in doing, while simple measures the effort in understanding the doing.</p>
<p>For example: <code>npm create framework@latest</code> or “Hey AI, build an instagram clone”. These both get you a website with little effort (easy) but do you understand what you just did (simple)?</p>
<p><a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2016-11-18T1230">It’s easy to get complexity</a>, but it’s not easy to get simplicity.</p>
<p>(I get this is arguing semantics and definitions, but I find it to be a useful framing personally. Thanks Jake!)</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png" alt="">I've been trying to stay out of politics here lately (did you notice), but I don't get how Americans, no matter who they voted for, can watch what's happening in Minneapolis and not feel like we have to protect the people there from the thugs who are attacking them. And of course that's exactly how we're supposed to feel. I watched a video of a woman, a disabled army veteran, being dragged from her car by the ICEs, and hearing cop car sirens in the background, imagining, hoping -- they were coming to stop the attack. We never did find out. How can you stand for this if you're an American. Forget about Democrats or Republicans, what about you? Where did you learn to ignore the feelings you must have when you see people, fellow human beings, attacked with such cruelty? Snap out of it, if you have any empathy left, or any love for our country. Tell your representatives to step in and stop this, and no excuses, Democrat or Republican, I don't care.</p>

      <h1>The best version of my site so far...</h1>

(date: 2026-01-18)
      <p>
      <p>You might have noticed that I did a big design refresh on my entire site… unless you’re on RSS I guess. I’ll talk about aspects in detail, but at a high level there’s been three big changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A monospace font</li>
<li>Named CSS grid lines</li>
<li>Juicier multi-page view transitions</li>
</ol>
<p>But my most favorite part is that today (when you set <code>html { --hue-rotate: 15 }</code>), my light theme looks like a stick of butter. And that brings me joy.</p>
<h2>What didn’t change</h2>
<p>Before I talk about what changed, here’s a quick list of the parts of my site that didn’t change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same big “Dave” SVG on the homepage</li>
<li>Same information architecture, no radical content changes.</li>
<li>No new assets, same visuals.</li>
<li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/color-hue-rotating-gaslight/">hue-rotating background</a>, although I did simplify the formula.</li>
<li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/06/fittext-too-attr-boogaloo/">inverse text-sizing</a> for H1s</li>
<li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/01/art-direction-for-static-sites/">support for art-directed posts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Why change the parts you’re happy with, eh? Knowing what you want to change versus what you don’t want to change makes the whole process go faster.</p>
<h2>All-in on a monospace font</h2>
<p>My type system always falls apart. I start with a good setup and I’m guaranteed to ruin it over time. Whenever I read a site with a nice typeface and reasonable CPL, I started to feel like my <code>system-ui</code> based body text styles were letting me down. It didn’t feel cozy.</p>
<p>Then I saw <a href="https://robinrendle.com/">Robin Rendle</a>’s latest redesign (which is wonderful, btw) I wondered… Could I be a <code>monospace</code> font guy? Is that me? Do I identify as that? Is it too emo? Does it come off as a bad developer pun like <code>bleep blorp I'm a programmer and using a computer bleep blorp</code>?</p>
<p>All good questions to ask myself and exposes some insecurity I have, but I couldn’t shake the idea so I went for it.</p>
<p>The entire site is now set in <code>Cascadia Mono</code> which is a variant of Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-mono">Cascadia Code</a>. That decision is unintentionally on-brand for my current stage of life. Initially I wanted to use <a href="https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> by Raph Levien, but it didn’t have a “numero” (№) symbol – which is a common missing glyph in a lot of indie fonts – and is an unfortunate piece of critical typographical infrastructure with my <a href="https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck">vibechecks</a>.</p>
<p>In general I love the change. It feels very “me” right now. I worry about the readability of monospace fonts some, but I don’t think I was winning the Legibility Wars before.</p>
<h2>Naming my grid lines</h2>
<p>Improving the grid on my site is something I’ve wanted to do for nearly two years. The max-width container I had was fine before, but I relied a lot on <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/03/full-bleed-with-not/">margin overrides</a> to change a container that <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/03/thoughts-on-negative-margins/">felt like a hack</a> that in my experience don’t scale.</p>
<p>Now I have something better with some sweet tech from <a href="https://smolcss.dev/#smol-breakout-grid">Stephanie Eckles</a> that I saw on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw">Kevin Powell’s YouTube</a> called “Named Grid Lines”. A not-so-well-known feature of grid is you can name the gutters in your grid template. The result is a grid that looks like this:</p>
<p>Full</p>
<p>Margin</p>
<p>Wide</p>
<p>Outdent</p>
<p>Content (Default)</p>
<p>See how all the grids collapse into one line that’s offset from the edge? That’s what I want. And then to use it, you specify the <code>*-start</code> and <code>*-end</code> line you tweak your container with a modifier class and make all the children start at a different grid line.</p>
<pre><code>.foo.container &gt; * {
	grid-column: wide-start / wide-end;
  /* or grid-column: wide */
}

</code></pre>
<p>This gives me a lot of scalable control for my layout at the template level. For example, the layout of my homepage looks like this:</p>
<p>Header</p>
<p>Logo</p>
<p>Latest Posts</p>
<p>Projects</p>
<p>Footer</p>
<p>But when you click through to a single post, the template shifts to this:</p>
<p>Header</p>
<p>Title Goes Here</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Media</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Media</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Footer</p>
<p>I don’t have this setup, but I could write out a system of utility classes to make all this super flexible.</p>
<p>.full-start</p>
<p>.margin-start</p>
<p>.wide-start</p>
<p>.outdent-start</p>
<p>Default Content</p>
<p>.outdent-end</p>
<p>.wide-end</p>
<p>.margin-end</p>
<p>.full-end</p>
<p>That’s a lot of different layouts to craft. I look forward to more sustainable art direction for years to come. No more hacky negative margins or fixed positioned items… right?</p>
<h2>More Multipage View Transitions</h2>
<p>I’ve had <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/05/getting-started-view-transitions/">multi-page view transitions on my site</a> for years now. The original was a title transition from the index template to the post template where the post title would do a subtle swoop up and morph from an <code>H3</code> to display-sized <code>H1</code>. This was great until I changed the font for my <code>H1</code> (see above) and I obliterated the slight of hand magic I had before. Oops.</p>
<p>Now the flagship animation on my site is not typography dependent. If you navigate through my site, you’ll see that the “Dave” SVG on the homepage transitions into the main navigation on subpages. As a bonus, I get a little bit of much-needed branding on subpages. I didn’t do anything special other than naming the view transition and beefing up the stroke when the logo is in its smaller form.</p>
<p>The main nav is out-dented a bit by default, but using my new named columns I made the navigation go wider to match wide pages like my Bookshelf. Flexbox’s <code>justify-content: space-between</code> and view-transitions is doing all the heavy lifting on that animation there but I’m pleased with the effect and it feels natural (aka not synthetic and cheap).</p>
<p>I’m not a motion expert like <a href="https://cydstumpel.nl/">Cyd Stumpel</a>, but it feels good to have big, bold, un-ignorable view transitions on my site.</p>
<h2>Slimmed down CSS</h2>
<p>A redesign is always a great opportunity to clean house. I did the thing where I deleted my entire CSS and started from a naked page. Bit-by-bit I pulled back in the pieces I still needed.</p>
<p>I have about 40% less CSS which manifests in ~150 less lines of code to maintain and up to <code>~0.8 KB</code> when compressed over the wire.</p>
<p>LoCRawMin+GzipMin+BrotliBefore55710.3 KB2.76 KB2.43 KBAfter3915.36 KB1.97 KB1.76 KB</p>
<p>Now <code>0.8 KB</code> isn’t much but because I inline my critical CSS the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on every page, this number matters. My entire homepage document is <code>~5.5 KB</code> (Brotli), so that’s a 10%~20% performance improvement from cleaning up my CSS. How did I get these gains, you ask? Well…</p>
<p>One reason my CSS smaller is because I’m using modern CSS (nesting, <code>:has()</code>, <code>:is()</code>, <code>:where()</code>, <code>:not()</code>, etc). Those features seem like minor syntactic sugar but you also get more efficient selectors. For example my out-denting that I do in posts would previous be something like:</p>
<pre><code>.post iframe,
.post video,
.post img,
.post table { }

</code></pre>
<p>In modern CSS that super-conjoined selector becomes something more expressive and elegant:</p>
<pre><code>.post :is(iframe, video, img, table) {}

</code></pre>
<p>Those small improvements add up, but another reason the CSS is smaller is because its doing a lot less. Other than my inverse-sized H1s in posts, I’m not managing type styles at all beyond setting the body font-size. I think this is what Andy Bell calls “ <a href="https://bell.bz/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager/">Be the Browser’s Mentor, Not Its Micromanager</a>”. My strategy here is: Don’t futz with it until you can think of something way better than what the browser already does. That seems very <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao</a> or <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">Web’s Grain’y</a>.</p>
<h2>Onward to more art direction!</h2>
<p>This redesign opens up a bright future for my site. I’ve already started on some of this work, but I’ll share that in a future post. I mentioned above but the named grid lines alone give me a lot of easy-to-use levers for expression. I touched up some <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/04/oh-the-paywalls-you-ll-meet/">old art-directed posts</a> and they are benefitting from the changes already.</p>
<p>“Make it easy to play” seems like a good ethos for a personal site and I feel like I have that in the current manifestation.</p>

      <h1>The datalist element on iOS 26</h1>

(date: 2026-01-18)
      <p>
      <p>The <code>datalist</code> element is all fucked up on iOS. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21445">Again</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t “upgraded” my iPhone to iOS 26 and I have no plans to. The whole Liquid Glass thing is literally offputting. So I wouldn’t have known about the latest regression in Safari if a friend hadn’t texted me about the problem.</p>
<p>He was trying to do a search on <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. He was looking for the tune, The Road To Town. He started typing this into the form on the home page of the site. He got as far as “The Road To”. That’s when the entire input was obscured by a suggestion from the associated <code>datalist</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://adactio.com/images/ios26-datalist.png" alt="A screenshot of The Session on an iPhone during a search on the homepage. The search input is completely obscured by the text: The Road To Lisdoonvarna."></p>
<p>This is incredibly annoying and seems to be a pattern of behaviour for Safari. Features are supported …technically. But the implementation is so buggy as to be unusable.</p>
<p>I’ll probably have to do some user-agent sniffing, which I hate. And it won’t be enough to just sniff for Safari on iOS 26. Remember that every browser on iOS is just Webkit in a trenchcoat.</p>
<p>Time to file a bug and then wait God knows how long for an update to get rolled out.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305719">I filed a bug</a>, but in the meantime it looks like <a href="https://nielsleenheer.com/articles/2025/the-user-agent-string-of-safari-on-ios-26-and-macos-26/">user-agent sniffing is going to be impossible</a>.</p>

      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://brewing.permacomputing.net/">How ToStart a Permacomputing Collective</a></h2>
<p>This is a guide brewed from conversations with initiatives in London
(UK), Berlin (DE), Prague (CZ), Philadelphia (USA), Rotterdam (NL),
Vienna (AT), Lutruwtia (Tas/AU), County Mayo (IE) and a community from
Middle America gathering on servers. This text can support you when
starting a permacomputing collective. We use fermenting as a metaphor.
It isn’t a strict recipe but more of a loose framework that can be
freely modified to suit local tastes and conditions. Many actions are
cyclical and can be seen as opportunities to revisit or re-purpose
later.</p>

<p>located at 311 North 20th Street (at Wood Street), one block north of
the Ben Franklin Parkway, directly behind the Central Library on Logan
Square and just five minutes from Routes 95 and 76 - is a used bookstore
staffed by a team of paid and volunteer booksellers that offers gently
used, publicly donated books, records, CDs at reduced prices. Now the
new home of Chris’ Kids Corner for children’s books and story hours,
they also feature an eclectic stock of fiction, non-fiction,
contemporary, classics, out of print, first editions, art, architecture
and crafts.</p>

<p>Le Sommet pour l’action sur l’intelligence artificielle se tient à Paris
du 6 au 11 février 2025. C’est l’occasion de rappeler l’existence d’une
boîte à outils pour révéler les angles morts des discours sur le
numérique. Autour du concept d’« impensé numérique », ces outils de
compréhension sont précieux pour garder la tête froide face à
l’irruption de l’IA générative dans notre quotidien.</p>

<p>We analyzed 470 open-source GitHub pull requests, including 320

issue taxonomy. Every finding was normalized to issues per 100 PRs and
we used statistical rate ratios to compare how often different types of
problems appeared in each group.</p>
<p>The results? Clear, measurable, and consistent with what many developers
have been feeling intuitively: AI accelerates output, but it also
amplifies certain categories of mistakes.</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf">F3: The Open-Source Data File Format for the Future</a></h2>
<p>Columnar storage formats are the foundation for modern data analytics
systems. The proliferation of open- source file formats (i.e., Parquet,
ORC) allows seamless data sharing across disparate platforms. However,
these formats were created over a decade ago for hardware and workload
environments that are much different from today. Although these formats
have incorporated some updates to their specification to adapt to these
changes, not all deployments support those modifications, and too often
systems cannot overcome the formats’ deficiencies and limitations
without a rewrite. In this paper, we present the F uture-proof F ile
Format (F3) project. It is a next-generation open-source file format
with interoperability, extensibility, and efficiency as its core design
principles. F3 obviates the need to create a new format every time a
shift occurs in data processing and computing by providing a data
organization structure and a general-purpose API to allow developers to
add new encoding schemes easily. Each self-describing F3 file includes
both the data and meta-data, as well as WebAssembly (Wasm) binaries to
decode the data. Embedding the decoders in each file requires minimal
storage (kilobytes) and ensures compatibility on any platform in case
native decoders are unavailable. To evaluate F3, we compared it against
legacy and state-of-the-art open-source file formats. Our evaluations
demonstrate the efficacy of F3’s storage layout and the benefits of
Wasm-driven decoding.</p>

<p>Tsing and Zhou instead prefer to describe FUNGI: Anarchist Designers as
an exhibition of ‘anti-design’. In this show, fungi are not passive
building materials, but rather anarchic co-designers – unconscious and
uncontrollable – of a world that can only exist through alliances
between humans and other living things. The exhibition reveals how fungi
manifest themselves at different scales, from sick frogs and the
dishwasher in your kitchen, to hospital beds, termite mounds, the human
digestive system, coffee, banana and conifer plantations, and the
jungle.</p>

<p>Here’s what I keep coming back to: in any mature system, most of the
graph will be memories of memories. You ask me my favorite restaurants,
I think about it, answer, and now “that list I made” becomes its own
retrievable thing. Next time someone asks about dinner plans, I don’t
re-derive preferences from first principles. I remember what I concluded
last time. Psychologists say this is how human recall actually works;
you’re not accessing the original, you’re accessing the last retrieval.
Gets a little distorted each time.</p>

<p>In 2023, I returned to Taiwan for further social science research
focused on environmental activism in response to the pollution caused by
Formosa Plastics, one of the biggest plastics companies in the world,
headquartered in Taiwan. One thread of research upon my return extended
an initiative that I’ve come to call “Archiving Formosa Plastics”,
designed to study environmental justice and governance issues related to
the company across diverse settings, supporting various research,
advocacy, and teaching endeavours.</p>
<p>The project started after getting to know an anti-Formosa activist in
Texas named Diane Wilson. Since the Texas Formosa Plant started
operations in the late 1980s, Wilson has collected many kinds of
documents about the plant, eventually needing a large barn to store them
all. I had many questions about these documents: When and how did these
various documents gain and lose political value? Who would take care of
and steward these documents into the future</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I wrote about ActivityPub becoming a W3C

blogpost was about my experiences, and most of my experiences were on my
direct work on ActivityPub. But the Social Working Group did more than
ActivityPub; it also on the same day published WebSub, a useful piece of
technology in its own right which amongst other things also plays a
significant historical role in what is even ActivityPub’s history (but
is not used by ActivityPub itself), and it has also published several
documents which are not compatible with ActivityPub at all, and appear
to play the same role. This, to outsiders, may appear confusing, but
there are reasons which I will go into in this post</p>

<p>We are part of a growing global effort to ensure innovative technologies

Indigenous experts to guide the development of ethical AI tools for

<p>Responsible AI that benefits Indigenous communities and conservation
must implement Indigenous data sovereignty principles, and determine how

incorporated into these systems. AI that is co-designed with Indigenous
partners, rather than for them, can make these technologies more
accessible, culturally appropriate and aligned with community goals</p>

<p>Indigenous math isn’t just about numbers and equations, it involves
culture, spirituality and more. Math professor Edward Doolittle, a
Mohawk from Six Nations in Ontario, sees math as something embedded in
Creation itself. In his Hagey Lecture at the University of Waterloo, he
describes Indigenous mathematics as being grounded in cognition,
emotion, the physical world and community. Indigenizing math, Doolittle
hopes, will make it more approachable and meaningful to Indigenous
students — show them how entwined it is with everyday life and something
much bigger than ourselves</p>

architecting maintainable, distributable, and scalable systems. This is
where non-technical leaders who think they can fire their development
teams are making a significant mistake. Until we see the arrival of an
artificial intelligence that renders this entire discussion moot,
believing that technical expertise can be replaced by a prompt is a
strategic error. Building robust software still requires a human who
understands the underlying principles of the craft.</p>

manage to reach broad adoption in the ecosystem. From where I’m standing

can get much better performance by applying new approaches. As a

      <blockquote>
<p><em>[On agents using CLI tools in place of REST APIs]</em> To save on context window, yes, but moreso to improve accuracy and success rate when multiple tool calls are involved, particularly when calls must be correctly chained e.g. for pagination, rate-limit backoff, and recognizing authentication failures.</p>
<p>Other major factor: which models can wield the skill? Using the CLI lowers the bar so cheap, fast models (gpt-5-nano, haiku-4.5) can reliably succeed. Using the raw APl is something only the costly &quot;strong&quot; models (gpt-5.2, opus-4.5) can manage, and it squeezes a ton of thinking/reasoning out of them, which means multiple turns/iterations, which means accumulating a ton of context, which means burning loads of expensive tokens. For one-off API requests and ad hoc usage driven by a developer, this is reasonable and even helpful, but for an autonomous agent doing repetitive work, it's a disaster.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: The world needs an Ireland for disenshittification (17 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links The world needs an Ireland for disenshittification: Regulatory arbitrage isn't just for tax cheats. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: &quot;Fledgling&quot;; Magnetic forest rings; Electable Mr Sanders; &quot;Terrorists&quot; were just blind guys. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The world needs an Ireland for disenshittification (permalink) Ireland is a tax haven. In the 1970s and 1980s, life in the civil-war wracked country was hard – between poverty, scarce employment and civil unrest, the country hemorrhaged its best and brightest. As the saying went, &quot;Ireland's top export is the Irish.&quot; In desperation, Ireland's political class hit on a wild gambit: they would weaponize Ireland's sovereignty in service to corporate tax evasion. Companies that pretended to establish their headquarters in Ireland would be able to hoard their profits, evading their tax obligations to every other country in the world: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland</a>_as_a_tax_haven A single country – poor, small, at the literal periphery of a continent – was able to foundationally transform the global order. Any company that has enough money to pretend to be Irish can avoid 25-35% in tax, giving it an unbeatable edge against competitors that lack the multinational's superpower of magicking all its profits into a state of untaxable grace somewhere over the Irish Sea. The effect this had on Ireland is…mixed. The Irish state is thoroughly captured by the corporations that pretend to call Ireland home. Anything those corporations want, Ireland must deliver, lest the footloose companies up sticks and start pretending to be Cypriot, Luxembourgeois, Maltese or Dutch. This is why Europe's landmark privacy law, the GDPR, has had no effect on America's tech giants. They pretend to be Irish, and Ireland lets them get away with breaking European law. The Irish state even hires these companies' executives to regulate their erstwhile employers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta</a> But there is no denying that Ireland has managed to turn the world's taxable trillions into its own domestic billions. The fact that Ireland is cashing out less than 1% of what it's costing everyone else is terrible for the world's tax systems and competitive markets, but it's been a massive windfall for Ireland, and has lifted the country out of its centuries of colonial poverty and privation. There are many lessons to be learned from Ireland's experiment with regulatory arbitrage, but one is unequivocal: even a small, poor, disintegrating nation can change the world system by offering a site where you can do things that you can't do anywhere else, and if it does, that poor nation can grow wealthy and comfortable. What's more, there are plenty of &quot;things that you can't do anywhere else&quot; that are very good. It's not just corporate tax evasion. First among these things that you can't do anywhere else: it's a crime in virtually every country on earth to modify America's defective, enshittified, privacy-invading, money-stealing technology exports. That's because the US trade representative has spent the past 25 years using the threat of tariffs to bully all of America's trading partners into adopting &quot;anti-circumvention&quot; laws: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change</a> There is nothing good about this. The fact that local businesses can't sell you a privacy blocker, an alternative client, a diagnostic tool, a spare part, a consumable, or even software for your American-made devices leaves you defenseless before US tech's remorseless campaign of monetary and informational plunder – and it means that your economy is denied the benefits of creating and exporting these incredibly desirable, profitable products. Incredibly, Trump deliberately blew up this multi-trillion dollar system of US commercial advantage. By chaotically imposing and rescinding and re-imposing tariffs on the world, he has neutralized the US trade rep's tariff threats. Foreign firms just can't count on exporting to America anymore, so the threat of (more) tariffs grows less intimidating by the minute: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations</a> The time is ripe for the founding of a disenshittification nation, an Ireland for disenshittification. I have no doubt that eventually, most or all of the countries in the world will drop their anti-circumvention laws (the laws that ban the modification of US tech exports). Once one country starts making these disenshittifying tools, there'll be no way to prevent their export, since all it takes to buy one of these tools from a circumvention haven is an internet connection and a payment method. Once everyone in your country is buying and using jailbreaking tools from abroad, there'll be no point in keeping these laws on your own books. But the first country to get there stands a chance of establishing a durable first-mover advantage – of reaping hundreds of billions selling disenshittifying products around the world. That country could be to enshittification-resistant technology what Finland was to mobile phones during the Nokia decade (and wouldn't you know it, the EU's newly minted &quot;Tech Sovereignty&quot; czar is a Finn!): <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen">https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen</a>_en The world has experimented with many kinds of havens over the centuries. In the early 18th century, Madagascar became a haven for British naval deserters, who were adopted into the island's matriarchal clans. Together, they founded an anarchist pirate utopia: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/24/zana-malata/#libertalia">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/24/zana-malata/#libertalia</a> The global system of trade has allowed America's tech companies to steal and hoard trillions, and to put every country at risk of being bricked when their IT systems are switched off at a single word from Trump: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</a> There are more than 200 countries in the world. There's also an ever-expanding cohort of brilliant international technologists whose Silicon Valley dreams have turned into a nightmare of being shot in the face by an ICE goon, or being kidnapped, separated from their families and being locked up in a Salvadoran slave-labor prison. These techies are looking for the next place to put down roots and &quot;make a dent in the universe.&quot; Lots of countries could be that place. The Ireland for disenshittification wouldn't just have their pick of international technologists – they'd have plenty of Americans hungering for a better life. Two-thirds of young Americans &quot;are considering leaving the US&quot;: <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/nearly-two-thirds-of-young-americans-are-considering-leaving-the-us-11010814">https://www.newsweek.com/nearly-two-thirds-of-young-americans-are-considering-leaving-the-us-11010814</a> Ireland pulled off its tax-haven gambit by making influential people very rich, so that they would go to bat for Ireland. The Ireland for disenshittification will have the same chance. The new tech companies that unlock US Big Tech's trillions and turn them into their own billions (with the remainder being shared by us, tech users, in the form of lower prices and better products) will be a powerful bloc in support of this project. Ireland showed us: it just takes one country to defect from this global prisoner's dilemma, and then everything is up for grabs.

      <h1>Nostalgia for a time I didn’t experience</h1>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>Our everyday vocabulary fails to capture subtle emotions. Some languages developed to fill in these gaps. An example that became popular is <em>Schadenfreude</em>, which means taking pleasure in someone else’s misfortune. It has an opposite in German, <em>Fremdscham</em>, which is the vicarious embarrassment you feel when witnessing someone else’s humiliation. Its Finnish equivalent <em>myötähäpeä</em> is slightly more well known.</p>
<p>I like these words that capture complex feelings. When I was in high school, Wittgenstein made a lasting impression on my very naive mind. He argued that language can only picture facts about the world, and that ethics, aesthetics, and the mystical lie beyond what language can express. I think this is fascinatingly true. I’m convinced that a share of our daily sorrows come from our inability to put them in words. It reassures me when I stumble on a word that expresses a feeling I can’t explain.</p>

      <h1>Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ChatGPT</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ChatGPT</a></strong></p>
<p>OpenAI's long-rumored introduction of ads to ChatGPT just became a whole lot more concrete:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the coming weeks, we’re also planning to start testing ads in the U.S. for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay. Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's &quot;Go&quot; tier, you might ask? That's a new <span class="math inline">\(8/month tier that launched today in the USA, see [Introducing ChatGPT Go, now available worldwide](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/). It's a tier that they first trialed in India in August 2025 (here's a mention [in their release notes from August](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes#h_22cae6eb9f) listing a price of ₹399/month, which converts to around \)</span>4.40).</p>
<p>I'm finding the new plan comparison grid on <a href="https://chatgpt.com/pricing">chatgpt.com/pricing</a> pretty confusing. It lists all accounts as having access to GPT-5.2 Thinking, but doesn't clarify the limits that the free and Go plans have to conform to. It also lists different context windows for the different plans - 16K for free, 32K for Go and Plus and 128K for Pro. I had assumed that the 400,000 token window <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2">on the GPT-5.2 model page</a> applied to ChatGPT as well, but apparently I was mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've apparently not been paying attention: here's the Internet Archive ChatGPT pricing page from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250906071408/https://chatgpt.com/pricing">September 2025</a> showing those context limit differences as well.</p>
<p>Back to advertising: my biggest concern has always been whether ads will influence the output of the chat directly. OpenAI assure us that they will not:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer independence</strong>: Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you. Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you. Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.</li>
<li><strong>Conversation privacy</strong>: We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So what will they look like then? This screenshot from the announcement offers a useful hint:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/chatgpt-ads.jpg" alt="Two iPhone screenshots showing ChatGPT mobile app interface. Left screen displays a conversation about Santa Fe, New Mexico with an image of adobe-style buildings and desert landscape, text reading &quot;Santa Fe, New Mexico—often called 'The City Different'—is a captivating blend of history, art, and natural beauty at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

      <p>By and large, iPhone owners do not care about third-party app marketplaces and they care even less about third-party browser engines. Popular demand isn’t going to come about from additional regulatory mandates or pocket-change fines imposed on Apple.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Catch this! (16 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Catch this! Email is good, actually. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: LDS excommunication; King Foundation v &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;; &quot;Lat-stage capitalism&quot; v &quot;Christ, what an asshole&quot;; Pelosi v Porter. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Catch this! (permalink) Call it &quot;lifehacking,&quot; or just call it, &quot;paying attention to how you stay organized&quot; – I don't care what you call it, I am an ardent practitioner of it. I like improving my processes because I like what I do, and the more efficient I am at all of it (with apologies to Jenny Odell), the more of that stuff I can get done: <a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/</a> I want to do a lot of stuff. I am one of those people who is ten miles wide and one inch deep (it probably has something to do with imbibing Heinlein's maxim that &quot;specialization is for insects&quot; at an impressionable age). There's a million waterways I want to dip my toe (or my oar) into, and the better organized I am, the more of that stuff I'll get to do before I kick off. I'm 54, and while there's a lot of road ahead of me, I can see the end, off there in the distance. It's coming, and I'm not done – I'm barely getting started. I've been around lifehacking since the very moment it was born. I was there. I published the notes on Danny O'Brien's seminal 2004 talk at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, &quot;Life Hacks: Tech Secrets of Overprolific Alpha Geeks&quot;: <a href="https://craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt">https://craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt</a> In the years since, I've cultivated a small – but mighty – repertoire of organizational habits and tools that let me get a hell of a lot done. Weirdly, many of these tools are things that other people hate, and I can see why – they use them in very different ways from me. That's true of browser tabs (I loooove browser tabs): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/25/today-in-tabs/#unfucked-rota">https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/25/today-in-tabs/#unfucked-rota</a> And to-do lists, which will totally transform your life, once you realize that the most important to-do list is the one you maintain for everyone else who owes you a response, a package, or money: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo</a> Other essential tools languish in neglect, artifacts of the old, good web – the elegant weapons that dominated a more civilized age. First among these? RSS readers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise</a> I will freely stipulate that people have a good reason to hate all this stuff. &quot;Productivity porn&quot; is often proffered as a mix of humblebrag (a way to make other people jealous of your almighty &quot;productivity&quot;) and denial (fiddling with your systems is a ready substitute for actually doing things). Many (most?) of the foremost self-appointed pitchmen for &quot;lifehacking&quot; are cringey charlatans peddling &quot;courses&quot; and other nonsense. But if you keep digging, there's a solid foundation beneath all the rot. At its very best, this stuff is a way to figure out what you really want to do, and to organize your life so that the stuff you want to do is the stuff you're doing. A lot of people get into this kind of thing thinking it'll let them do everything. No one can do everything. The best you can hope for is to make conscious decisions about which stuff you'll never get to, while leaving at least a little room for serendipity. Like I said, I want to do a lot of stuff. My organizing tactics are as much about deciding what I won't do as they are about deciding what I will do: <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-how-to-do-everything-lifehacking-considered-harmful/">https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-how-to-do-everything-lifehacking-considered-harmful/</a> Which brings me to another tool that everyone hates and I love: email. I live and die by email. First of all, I filter all my incoming email: mail from people who are in my address book stays in my inbox; mail from people I've never heard from before goes into a mailbox called &quot;People I don't know.&quot; When I reply to a message, Thunderbird adds the recipient to my address book, so the next time I hear from them, they'll stay in my main mailbox. I also filter out anything containing the word &quot;unsubscribe,&quot; sending it into a folder called &quot;Unlikely&quot; (but not if the message contains my name – which is how I can stay subscribed to mailing lists I don't have time to read and make sure to reply when someone mentions me). Second of all, I have a zillion Quicktext macros that I use to reply to frequently asked questions. I have one that spits out my mailing address; another that spits out my bio; and others for politely saying no to things I don't have time for, for information about how to pay one of my invoices, etc, etc. Third: I have a small folder of emails that I can't reply to right away (usually because I need some information from a third party), which I review every morning and answer anything that I can clear. Finally, I save it all. I have so much saved email, which means that if you ask me about something from 20 years ago, there's a good chance I can find it – provided we organized it over email. All of which explains why I refuse – to the extent that I can – to do anything important over instant messaging, whether that's Signal or any of the other messaging tools that come with social media, workplace software, etc. I understand why people like instant messaging: it does not overwhelm you with the burdens of the past. It is largely ahistorical, with archives that are hard to access and search. Its norms and register are less formal than email. And, of course, instant messaging is far superior to email in some contexts. If you're on vacation with friends, having a big group-chat where you can say, &quot;I'm making dinner – is everyone OK with cheese?&quot; is indispensable. Same goes for asking a friend for directions, announcing that you've arrived at someone's office, or confirming whether it's OK to substitute 2% for whole milk on a grocery run. But if you're like me – if you've figured out how to do as many of the things that matter to you as you can possibly squeeze in, then getting an IM mid-flow is like someone walking up to a juggler who's working on a live chainsaw, a bowling ball, and a machete and tossing him a watermelon while shouting, &quot;Hey, catch this!&quot; The problem is that if you are asking about something important, something that can't be instantaneously managed by the recipient, then they will have to drop everything they're doing and, at the very least, make a note to themselves to go back to your message later and deal with it. Instant messaging doesn't have an inbox with everything you've been sent. Of course, that's why people love it. But the fact that you can't see all the things other people are expecting you to answer doesn't mean that they aren't expecting it. It also doesn't mean that everything will be fine if you just ignore all those messages. Instant messaging is a great tool for managing something that everyone is doing at the same time. It's also a nice way to keep an ambient social flow of updates from people in a rocking groupchat. But IM is fundamentally unserious. It is antithetical to the project of making a conscious decision about what you won't do, so that you do as many of the things that matter to you before you get to the end of the road. A massive email inbox is intimidating, but switching to IMs doesn't make all the demands in the email go away. It just puts them out of sight until they either expire or explode. Far better to decide what balls you're going to drop than to have them knocked out of your hand by a fast-moving watermelon.

      <h1>Think different about WordPress, cont'd</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p><em>This is a continuation of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">piece</a> I wrote in August 2025.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/thinkDifferentBillboard.png" alt="">Yesterday I wrote a <a href="https://this.how/wordland/wordpressorg.opml">this.how doc</a> about getting WordLand to run on sites that don't run on WordPress.com or have Jetpack installed. What this means is that their sites are accessible through the fantastic wpcom API, and with that API I have been able to build a very nice writers' workspace for WordPress sites. I call the ones that are left out the WordPress.org sites, though I know that's not an entirely accurate way of describing it, but neither is &quot;self-hosted sites&quot; because you could have a hosting service that doesn't install Jetpack. WordPress could be used for things that are quite different from the way it's used today. Important point.</p>
<p>I sent links to that post to two people, and encouraged them to pass it along, as a way of starting a discussion -- how are we going to get WordLand running on those &quot;other&quot; sites. And we need names for lots of things, but first we have to get the software working the way we want it to, then the naming will be more obvious.</p>
<p>Jeremy Herve has already written a <a href="https://herve.bzh/wordland-on-self-hosted-sites/">response</a> (as I asked him to). As always, very helpful. But I want to push back on the way he frames the project -- as if it's up to me to do this work, and that I dispute. It think it's up to us. WordLand isn't just a product, it's a challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>To make WordPress a fantastic platform for developers who want to build on its ability to write and read and link together writing and reading on the freaking web. That's why it's so important to understand what the web is and what it's capabilities are. We've been missing some of the big stuff since the big silos took over. I want, before I hang up my hat, to fix that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to outline here how we start, so it's documented so more people will see it too.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have written a package, MIT-licensed, with an awkward name for historic reasons called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpIdentity</a>. It started off as just a simple way to use WordPress identity with FeedLand because it made sense to do it a couple of years ago because Twitter was destroying the utility of their API, and we needed a new way to do identity. So I stopped everything and implemented both email identity and WordPress identity, or more specifically, wordpress.com identity. This leaves out all the wordpress sites that you can't log onto this way. Not a good situation, I don't like it because I want WordPress to be one large happy family of users and developers. So that's what I'm seeking to instigate here.</li>
<li>Then wpIdentity grew and grew. At first it supported all the endpoints in the wpcom API, and made it possible to build WordLand, which itself <em>only communicates to WordPress via wpIdentity.</em> And later when I needed user-specific storage that is not part of the WordPress API, I built a very nice little storage system, it's efficient, highly scalable, and (I think) well debugged. If you read my initial <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">Think Different</a> piece you'll see it gets a mention in <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a141421">this part</a>. Storage, we will find out, is the big missing piece in the web, has always been the missing piece, the thing that keeps us from having a real developer community of web apps. How do I know? Because I'm a freaking developer. I don't work at a company that can insulate me from this need. That's why I see this need and so many others don't.</li>
<li>Now here's something else that's cool. I didn't stop with wpIdentity, I made a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">JavaScript function</a> that simplifies the wpcom interface for people writing browser-based JavaScript apps. It radically simplifies it. I didn't invent this way of doing it, someone at Facebook did, as far as I'm concerned. We may not like Facebook the company or the boss man, but they have employed some brilliant programmers over the years. I think this idea came from the developers of FriendFeed, but I could be wrong. What they did was take the interface code every app developer has to do, and made <em>that</em> the API. I remember when I first saw it in 2013, it blew me away. It took me a full month to build support for Twitter in my app, but it only two days to do it in Facebook. I did one of those for WordPress. It's part of wpIdentity. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">Here it is</a>. Please if you're a contributor to wordpress.org -- study that thing, because we're going to be working on that code -- together. This is where the &quot;we&quot; part of it starts. But there's more.</li>
<li>You don't <em>have</em> to read the code of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">api2.js</a> to understand how it works, there's an even easier way to do it -- <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo">wpEditorDemo</a>. It's a simple browser-based editor that does what WordLand does, without all the flourish. Bare bones. Also MIT-licensed. Nothing but what's required. You can <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo?tab=readme-ov-file#demo">try it out</a> if you have one or more qualifying sites (either on wordpress.com or having Jetpack installed). The project we need to do is this -- <em>make wpEditDemo work on any WordPress site, no matter where it's hosted.</em> And that's going to be done by extending api2.js. That's where the differences will be encapsulated, and above that level, in wpEditDemo and WordLand and all its competitors, nothing changes. This project may be complicated or simple, or somewhere inbetween, but imho this has to be done. And this is the first place I want to join the open source community for WordPress. After talking with Jon, I became optimistic about this happening sooner than later.</li>
<li>I zoomed through all this and more with Jonathan on <a href="http://scripting.com/2026/01/13.html#a224042">Tuesday</a>. This is what I want to talk about at WordCamp Europe later this year (I have submitted an application). I wanted to show Jon and a few other people I met in Ottawa in October how the pieces fit together. But zooming is the right word, Jon was ahead of me at every step, he just understood what I was showing him. I was blown away -- because this had never happened before with the architecture I had built. Not because it's so complex, it isn't -- it's all about simplifying things, with lots of factoring, finding a repeating pattern and then locking it down in code, so no one has to ever worry about the complexity again. I think it was hard for people to see because they aren't expecting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's where I'm going to leave it for now. I suggest if you have a response or comment, please put it on your blog and send me a link. We're going to create new ways to link blog posts together, but for now we'll do it by hand.</p>
<p>PS: Hat-tip to Matt Mullenweg for building WordPress, and for having the idea that Tumblr could be rebuilt on top of WordPress. When he announced they were going to do that I knew I was on the right track. We were thinking about WordPress the same way.</p>
<p>PPS: If people have a hard time understanding how I could do this -- remember: 1. I've had a lot of time. 2. I understand WordPress at a deep level. 3. I'm good at building and selling APIs, I've been fairly successful at it. And even better, the WordPress community has been a very good caretaker of this work. They support a remarkable amount of it, and it all still works, and they often wonder why the rest of the world doesn't love it like they do. I feel the same damn way. ;-)</p>

      <h1>AI and the Corporate Capture of Knowledge</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>More than a decade after <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Open-access-tributes-to-Aaron-Swartz-4193965.php">Aaron Swartz’s death</a>, the United States is still living inside the contradiction that destroyed him.</p>
<p>Swartz believed that knowledge, especially publicly funded knowledge, should be freely accessible. Acting on that, he downloaded thousands of academic articles from the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a> archive with the intention of making them publicly available. For this, the federal government charged him with a felony and threatened decades in prison. After two years of prosecutorial pressure, Swartz died by suicide on Jan. 11, 2013.</p>
<p>The still-unresolved questions raised by his case have resurfaced in today’s debates over artificial intelligence, copyright and the ultimate control of knowledge...</p>

(date: 2026-01-16)

      <p>The first half of Alice Winn’s bestselling In Memoriam is set at Preshute, an English boys’ boarding school in the early twentieth century. It is here, in the idyllic countryside, where the boys discuss poetry and get up to all</p>

      <h1>Open Responses</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.openresponses.org/">Open Responses</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the standardization effort I've most wanted in the world of LLMs: a vendor-neutral specification for the JSON API that clients can use to talk to hosted LLMs.</p>
<p>Open Responses aims to provide exactly that as a documented standard, derived from OpenAI's Responses API.</p>
<p>I was hoping for one based on their older Chat Completions API since so many other products have cloned the already, but basing it on Responses does make sense since that API was designed with the feature of more recent models - such as reasoning traces - baked into the design.</p>
<p>What's certainly notable is the list of launch partners. OpenRouter alone means we can expect to be able to use this protocol with almost every existing model, and Hugging Face, LM Studio, vLLM, Ollama and Vercel cover a huge portion of the common tools used to serve models.</p>
<p>For protocols like this I really want to see a comprehensive, language-independent conformance test site. Open Responses has a subset of that - the official repository includes <a href="https://github.com/openresponses/openresponses/blob/d0f23437b27845d5c3d0abaf5cb5c4a702f26b05/src/lib/compliance-tests.ts">src/lib/compliance-tests.ts</a> which can be used to exercise a server implementation, and is available as a React app <a href="https://www.openresponses.org/compliance">on the official site</a> that can be pointed at any implementation served via CORS.</p>
<p>What's missing is the equivalent for clients. I plan to spin up my own client library for this in Python and I'd really like to be able to run that against a conformance suite designed to check that my client correctly handles all of the details.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: How the Light Gets In (15 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links How the Light Gets In: The door is open a crack! Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Poitras v First Look; Aaronsw's &quot;Against School&quot;; I was investigated by the FBI. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. How the Light Gets In (permalink) Of all the tools that I use to maintain my equilibrium in these dark days, none is so important as remembering the distinction between happiness, optimism and hope. Happiness is self-explanatory – and fleeting. Even in the worst of times, there are moments of happiness – a delicious meal with friends, a beautiful sunrise, a stolen moment with your love. These are the things we chase, and rightly so. But happiness is always a goal, rarely a steady state. Optimism, on the other hand, is a toxin to be avoided. Optimism is a subgenre of fatalism, the belief that things will get better no matter what we do. It's just the obverse of pessimism. Both are ways of denying human agency. To be an optimist is to be a passenger of history, along for the ride, with no hope of changing its course. But hope? That's the stuff. Hope is the belief that if we change the world for the better, even by just a little, that we will ascend a gradient towards a better future, and as we rise up that curve, new terrain will be revealed to us that we couldn't see from our lower vantage-point. It's not necessary – or even possible – to see a course from here to the world you want to live in. You can get there in stepwise fashion, one beneficial change at a time: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/03/hope-not-optimism/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/03/hope-not-optimism/</a> These days, I am often unhappy, but I am filled with hope. A couple of weeks ago, I gave a speech, &quot;The Post-American Internet,&quot; at the 39th Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</a> In that talk, I laid out the case for hope. So many of the worst aspects of modern life can be traced to our enshittified technology, from mass surveillance and totalitarian control to wage suppression and conspiratorial cults. This enshittified technology, in turn, is downstream of policy decisions made by politicians who were bullied into their positions by the US trade rep, who used the threat of tariffs to push for laws that protected the right of tech giants to plunder the world's money and data, by criminalizing competitors who disenshittified their products, leaving technology users defenseless. Trump's tariffs have effectively killed that threat. If you can't tell from day to day – let alone year to year – whether the US will accept your exports, you can't rely on exporting to the USA. What's more, generations of pro-oligarch policies have stripped America's bottom 90% of discretionary income, stagnating their wages and leaving them mired in health, education, and housing debt (even as the system finds ever more sadistic and depraved ways for arm-breakers to collect on that debt): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations</a> This is terrible for Americans, but when life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla. With the decline of the US market for global exporters, there's finally political space to stop worrying about tariffs and reconsider anti-circumvention laws, to create &quot;disenshittification nations&quot; that stage raids on the most valuable lines of business of the most profitable companies in world history – Big Tech: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/13/not-sorry/#mere-billions">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/13/not-sorry/#mere-billions</a> People who dream of turning American tech trillions into their own billions are powerful allies in the fight against enshittification, but they're only one group that we can recruit to our side. There's another powerful bloc waiting in the wings: national security hawks. These people are rightly terrified that Trump will order his tech companies to switch off their governments, businesses and households, all of whom are dependent on US cloud-based administrative software for email, document creation and archiving, databases and mobile devices. Trump's tech companies could also brick any nation's mobile phones, medical devices, cars, and tractors. It's the same risk that China hawks warned of when it looked as though Huawei would provide all of the world's 5G infrastructure: allow companies that are absolutely beholden to an autocrat who is not restrained by the rule of law to permeate your society, and your society becomes a prisoner to the autocrat's whims and goodwill. A coalition of digital rights activists; investors and entrepreneurs; and national security hawks makes for a powerful bloc indeed. Each partner in the coalition can mobilize different constituencies and can influence different parts of the state. These are very different groups, and that's why this coalition is so exciting: this is a three-pronged assault on the hegemony of Big Tech. That's not to say that this will automatically happen. Nothing happens automatically. Fuck pessimism, and fuck optimism, too. Things happen because people do stuff: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/17/against-the-great-forces-of-history/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/17/against-the-great-forces-of-history/</a> That's where hope comes in. The door to a better technological future has been slammed shut and triple-locked for 25 years. Today, it is open a crack. A crack isn't much, but as Leonard Cohen taught us, &quot;that's how the light gets in&quot;: <a href="https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-anthem-lyrics">https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-anthem-lyrics</a> Understand: this isn't a bet on politicians discovering heretofore unsuspected wellsprings of courage or principle. This is a bet on politicians confronting unstoppable political will that corners them into doing the right thing. I understand why Europeans, Canadians and Britons might feel cynical about their political classes (to say nothing of Americans, of course). It has been decades since a political party delivered broad, structural change that improved the lives of everyday people. Instead, we've had generations of neoliberal austerity sadists, autocrats and corrupt dolts who've helped billionaires stripmine our civilization and set the world on fire. But politics have changed before, and they can change again (note that I didn't say they will change – just that they can, because we can change them). Society may feel deadlocked, but crises precipitate change. As I said in my Hamburg speech, the EU went from 15 years behind in their solar transition to ten years ahead, in just a few years, thanks to the energy crisis that slammed into the continent after Putin invaded Ukraine. Crises precipitate change. The fact that the EU pivoted so quickly away from fossil fuels to solar is nothing short of a miracle. Anyone who feels like their politicians would never buck Big Tech needs to explain how it came to pass that these politicians just told Big Oil to fuck off. The fossil fuel industry is losing. This is goddamned wild – indeed, their loss might just be locked in at this point, because fossil fuel and its applications (like internal combustion) are now more expensive and more impractical than the cleantech alternatives: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting</a> Sure, it sucks that Trump has killed incentives to drive an EV and that the EU is dropping its goal for phasing out internal combustion engines, but given that EVs are faster, cheaper and better than conventional automobiles, the writing is on the wall for the IC fleet. That's the wild thing about better technology: people want it, and they get pissed off when they're told they can't have it. When the Texas legislature tried to pass a law requiring that power companies add a watt of fossil-fuel generation capacity for every watt of solar they brought online, Trump-voting farmers and ranchers from the deepest red parts of Texas (Texas!!) flooded town halls and hearings, demanding an end to &quot;DEI for natural gas&quot;: <a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/for-reality">https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/for-reality</a> They won. Politics aren't just terrible today, they're in chaos. Crises precipitate change. After World War II, one of Britain's two parties, the Liberals (AKA &quot;Whigs&quot;) imploded. With them out of the way, the Labour Party rose to power, with a transformative agenda backed by a mass movement, which created the British welfare state. Today, the British Conservative Party (AKA &quot;Tories&quot;) are also imploding, and look set to be taken over by a fascist MAGA-alike party, Reform. As of a couple months ago, that seemed like very bad news, since Labour is also set to implode, thanks to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's austerity, authoritarianism, corruption and cowardice. For quite a while, it looked like when Starmer's Labour is totally wiped out in the next election, they would give way to Reform, plunging Britain into Hungarian- (or American)-style autocracy. But all that has changed. Today, the UK Greens have a new leader, Zack Polanski, who has dragged the Greens into an agenda that promises transformations as bold as the ones that remade the country under Clement Attlee's Labour government. Polanski is a fantastic campaigner, and he is committed to the same kind of grassroots co-governance with a mass movement that characterized Zohran Mamdani's historic NYC mayoral campaign. In other words, it seems like both of Britain's sclerotic mainstream parties will be wiped out in the next election, and the real fight in the UK is between two transformative upstart parties, one of which plans to spend billionaires' dark money to mobilize fascists yearning for ethnic cleansing; and the other wants a fair, prosperous and equitable society where we abolish billionaires, confront the climate emergency, and smash corporate power. In other words, the UK is heading into an election in which voters have a choice that's more meaningful than Coke vs Pepsi. Versions of this are playing out around the world. Anti-billionaire policies have surfaced time and again, everywhere, since the late 2010s: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting</a> None of this means that we will automatically win. I'm not asking you to be an optimist here, but I am demanding that you have hope. Hope is a discipline: it requires that you tirelessly seek out the best ways to climb up that gradient toward a better world, trusting that as you attain higher elevation, you will find new paths up that slope. The door is open a crack. Now isn't the time to complain that it isn't open wider – now's the time to throw your shoulder against it.

<h2>Other Humorous Writing News</h2>
<p>This week we learned that Condé Nast let the trademark for Gourmet Magazine lapse, allowing a collective to swoop in and revive it as a <a href="https://gourmetmagazine.net/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426">worker-owned publication</a>. We don’t yet know how much humorous writing there will be in the new incarnation of Gourmet, but we’re big fans of food writing here at the newsletter, and we think that the new owners’ <a href="https://gourmetmagazine.net/gourmet-is-back/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426">piece about their philosophy and the state of the magazine industry</a> is very much worth reading.</p>

      <h1>The Design & Implementation of Sprites</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://fly.io/blog/design-and-implementation/">The Design &amp; Implementation of Sprites</a></strong></p>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/9/sprites-dev/">wrote about Sprites last week</a>. Here's Thomas Ptacek from Fly with the insider details on how they work under the hood.</p>
<p>I like this framing of them as &quot;disposable computers&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sprites are ball-point disposable computers. Whatever mark you mean to make, we’ve rigged it so you’re never more than a second or two away from having a Sprite to do it with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've noticed that new Fly Machines can take a while (up to around a minute) to provision. Sprites solve that by keeping warm pools of unused machines in multiple regions, which is enabled by them all using the same container:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, today, under the hood, Sprites are still Fly Machines. But they all run from a standard container. Every physical worker knows exactly what container the next Sprite is going to start with, so it’s easy for us to keep pools of “empty” Sprites standing by. The result: a Sprite create doesn’t have any heavy lifting to do; it’s basically just doing the stuff we do when we start a Fly Machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting detail is how the persistence layer works. Sprites only charge you for data you have written that differs from the base image and provide ~300ms checkpointing and restores - it turns out that's power by a custom filesystem on top of S3-compatible storage coordinated by Litestream-replicated local SQLite metadata:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We still exploit NVMe, but not as the root of storage. Instead, it’s a read-through cache for a blob on object storage. S3-compatible object stores are the most trustworthy storage technology we have. I can feel my blood pressure dropping just typing the words “Sprites are backed by object storage.” [...]</p>
<p>The Sprite storage stack is organized around the JuiceFS model (in fact, we currently use a very hacked-up JuiceFS, with a rewritten SQLite metadata backend). It works by splitting storage into data (“chunks”) and metadata (a map of where the “chunks” are). Data chunks live on object stores; metadata lives in fast local storage. In our case, that metadata store is <a href="https://litestream.io">kept durable with Litestream</a>. Nothing depends on local storage.</p>

On November 21st Bryce Elder posed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883"><em>Five questions from an ignorant no-coiner about the crypto crash</em></a>. Each of his five questions identified some interesting apparent anomalies.</p>
<p>Below the fold I look into each of his questions, asking how anomalous its anomalies really were and whether they have persisted into the New Year.</p>
<p>TL;DR none of them are really surprising but reaching that conclusion took a good deal of research.</p>
<h3>Why doesn’t network difficulty fall?</h3>
<p>Elder explains Bitcoin's <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">difficulty mechanism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm has a difficulty ratchet to keep production steady. Network difficulty adjusts every two weeks, approximately, based on whether miners have been finding new blocks for the blockchain too quickly or too slowly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then identifies the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">first anomaly</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Difficulty tightens when a higher bitcoin price is encouraging miners to join the market, that much makes sense. But when a lower bitcoin price is squeezing margins and pushing the least efficient miners out, shouldn’t difficulty fall?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the chart Elder is looking at.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAUlMeuRv8jQCkLl1PbOs_lJd2kjKpmnnZS7xQQn7oVB7M4CJAQ5PFi5tA4i0SoSQirSkQePSB0VGpDtT0RknRurgResWcHaVxdG3bvsXKdxusMhfQXR6mztzf57I_VrpqtaDdj0aOWkJ-HSWG7V4Nh0PLT01oq6vN4_LGYaSQt5r-Mxu0q_hwQNrBsoQ/s1020/Difficulty.jpeg"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAUlMeuRv8jQCkLl1PbOs_lJd2kjKpmnnZS7xQQn7oVB7M4CJAQ5PFi5tA4i0SoSQirSkQePSB0VGpDtT0RknRurgResWcHaVxdG3bvsXKdxusMhfQXR6mztzf57I_VrpqtaDdj0aOWkJ-HSWG7V4Nh0PLT01oq6vN4_LGYaSQt5r-Mxu0q_hwQNrBsoQ/s320/Difficulty.jpeg" alt=""></a><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">Source</a>
Then <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">Elder asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe difficulty lags behind the price? As said above, the ratchet only adjusts approximately every two weeks. Total hashrate oﬀers a more dynamic measure of power deployed to the network, albeit an estimated one based on how long it’s taking to mine a block. Any change in market structure might show up there first.</p>
<p>And has it? Not really:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing to note is that, depending upon power costs and where they are in the queue for the latest rigs from Bitmain, miners margins vary greatly. So Elder is right that, if one of the two-week adjustemnts increases the difficulty, some of the least economic rigs should be switched off. In theory, if the adjustment decreases the difficulty, some of these idled rigs should be switched back on.</p>
<p>Eyeballing the graph, between early July and late October the price was between <span class="math inline">\(110K and \)</span>120K, a 9% range. During that period the difficulty increased from around 140trn to around 155trn, about an 11% range. These aren't big changes, but it appears a bit strange that roughly flat price coincides with a steady-ish increase in difficulty.</p>
<p>Elder has some possible <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">explanations</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do miners with sunk costs keep running on negative margins in the hope of getting lucky? Are a handful of big miners, maybe advantaged by free power or whatever, keeping difficulty high to drive out competitors, either inadvertently or as part of some devious plan to centralise production and control the network? Or has mining become 55 per cent more eﬃcient since last November?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I estimate that during that time Bitmain and its competitors shipped an additional 1000EH/s to the miners, over and above the new rigs replacing obsolete ones. These leading-edge rigs would have been turned on immediately. During that time the hash rate rose from about 870EH/s to around 1120EH/s, or about 250EH/s. So around 150EH/s must have represented idled, less-efficient rigs being turned on. At the start of the period at most 85% of the rig fleet was working. At the end of the period, as the price started to fall, the most efficient miners had about 100EH/s more than they did at the beginning.</p>
<p>In the subsequent 2 months the price dropped from about <span class="math inline">\(120K to around \)</span>85K and the hash rate dropped from around 1120EH/s to around 1060EH/s, or by 60EH/s. But in that time there ws an incremental 50EH/s of new rigs. So 110EH/s of the 150EH/s from the originally idle fleet of uneconomic rigs were turned off. This within the margin or error of my back-of-the-envelope estimates.</p>
<p>My take is that what happened was what should have been expected. Elder's view was too simplistic, and he was misled by (a) the noise in the graph, and ((b) the fact that the Y axis doesn't start at zero, making the noise much more evident.</p>

Elder goes on to note an issue I've been writing about for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">really a long time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Related, is it a worry that just three mining pools accounted for more than 45 per cent of this week’s block production? Given nearly all the hardware used across the network is Chinese-made, with Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies alone having an estimated market share of 82 per cent, when do concentration levels among a few organisations become a security concern?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this concentration has been a problem for Bitcoin's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/06/pseudonymity-and-cooperation.html">entire history</a>, but everyone has decided to ignore it. As I write, on 6th January 2026, over the last three days Foundry USA and AntPool have controlled 51.2% of the hash power. As I explained at length in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/sabotaging-bitcoin.html"><em>Sabotaging Bitcoin</em></a>, there are practical difficulties facing an insider attack with 30% of the hash power, but with 51.2% things are much easier.</p>
<p>And, in November, Reuters reports that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bitcoin-mining-china-rebounds-defying-2021-ban-2025-11-24/"><em>Bitcoin mining in China rebounds, defying 2021 ban</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin mining is quietly staging a comeback in China despite being banned four years ago, as individual and corporate miners exploit cheap electricity and a data center boom in some energy-rich provinces, according to miners and industry data.</p>
<p>China had been the world's biggest crypto mining country until Beijing banned all cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021, citing threats to the country's financial stability and energy conservation.</p>
<p>After having seen its global bitcoin mining market share slump to zero as a result of the ban, China crept back to third place with a 14% share at the end of October, according to Hashrate Index, which tracks bitcoin mining activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be what the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/">80% of new data centers</a> in China that were empty because unsuitable for AI are being used for.</p>
<h3>What’s the deal with Tether?</h3>
<p>Zeke Faux described Tether as &quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">practically quilted out of red flags</a>&quot; and they are <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/the-red-flags-multiply-for-tether">still flapping</a>. What attracted Elder's attention <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">was this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stablecoins have long been pitched as crypto’s on-ramp. Swapping fiat money for a fiat-pegged stablecoin like Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC allows a trader to switch in and out of positions without having to touch tradfi.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t an on-ramp also work as an off-ramp? There’s not much evidence it does. In the six weeks or so when <span class="math inline">\(1.2tn in value was drawn down from the cryptoverse, the market cap of USDT has [increased by approximately \)</span>20bn](<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)</a>:</p>

This USDT graph is updated from the one Elder used. It shows a clear break in the upward trend on 24th October. In the 10 preceding weeks it increased by <span class="math inline">\(17B (~10%) as Bitcoin traded beteween a low of \)</span>108K and a high on 6th October of almost $125K.</p>
<p>In the 10 weeks since it has increased by only <span class="math inline">\(3B as Bitcoin dropped from \)</span>111K to a low of <span class="math inline">\(84K on 22nd November, subsequently trading in a range from there to \)</span>94K.</p>
<p>The only other stablecoin that matters <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">is USDC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>USDC hasn’t been quite as resilient but over the period is still basically flat:</p>

Here is its updated graph. On 24th October its market cap was around <span class="math inline">\(76B, it is now around \)</span>75B. So, yes, Elder was right, it has been basically flat for 10 weeks where the preceding 10 weeks it had increased by $8B (~12%).</p>
<p>Had the trend of the previous 10 weeks continued, the market cap of (USDT+USDC) would have been <span class="math inline">\(25B higher than it is. One way of looking at this would be that traders "withdrew" \)</span>25B or around 10% of the (USDT+USDC) market cap on 24th October. On this basis Elder is just wrong, the off-ramp has been quite busy.</p>
<p>Elder notes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if we assume a large percentage of stablecoins are used for non-crypto things (sports betting, remittances, crimes), the recent issuance still looks at odds with the trend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, this contradicts the premise of Elder's question as I understand it. Second, most of the uses Elder cites involve a chain of transactions from fiat to stablecoin to fiat on one or more exchanges. These would not cause a net increase in demand for the stablecoin, which would come from and go back to the exchange's reserves.</p>
<p>Then Elder <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">suggest that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe demand is high because crypto traders have been parking money rather than seeking to withdraw it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, demand isn't high relative to the historic trend, it is now <span class="math inline">\(25B lower. Second, even if we accept Elder's \)</span>20B number, this is peanuts relative to the $1.2T drop in aggregate cryptocurrency market cap.</p>

Finally in this section Elder <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More idle money in the system ought to be good news for the likes of Coinbase, which uses the promise of higher yields on USDC deposits to sell monthly subscription schemes. And how have Coinbase shares been doing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day Bitcoin hit the skids on 8th, COIN closed at $387.27. By 11/20 it was down 38% while Bitcoin was down 47%. It can hardly be a surprise that COIN is highly correlated with Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>What explains trash crash PTSD?</h3>
<p>Next, Elder asks why cryptocurrencies haven't resumed their <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">progress moonwards</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A popular argument among crypto commentators is that token prices are down because traders are still digesting <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/75fa4323-51ea-4ed2-9c07-b995e09ace49">one bad day in early October</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He suggests <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">some reasons</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reasons for the October drawdown go from banal (maybe the high-beta cryptosphere just amplified <a href="https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/bE-qU1zWhzRe8yb0lcjRx2aunbLtAyj8z2535Yt4JLWI44YcnXctrgw5q0-1EcyiTPjt5ZYK4SaNoVUfgMehQ6UD7rKKldXgNL23GrzS7lP66YdWVVIjsnfpnGMJucV-sIIjAuxjx4FWKQNFBVXrfI1wvxafOLeHP6Ni_-L9DwhylPLva04gMWfiA9E3s2ajAvYJxG12dAOOws7lMMUTfkQcs-bs6ezPgsPBL0Wgbzut_zYLwmxSCCjF0_W-YwEmLJqpjHyen3WEHsHC7oHXvqNs7hsJnWj58l6BWdWEdNyvE5VnYux7JvQQvVp39gu7CkPeQ6UUAU5YOWEPnUNOnKtcqiTvCH3WHTgkXPrE53x7mE15PS72Y0t9qf0/jL38GmV_vgDbxRL89uL27NpEMDfNsj96/13">an equities pullback</a> on US-China trade tensions?) to wonky (maybe it all cascaded from a weird synthetic stablecoin <a href="https://www.netcoins.com/blog/ethenas-usde-depeg-an-overview-and-its-relation-to-the-ena-token">depegging</a> on one marketplace?) to the darkly cynical (maybe the big sharp drop was to let bucket-shop crypto brokers <a href="https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/Kfg6vUvHmhO5oSNIKqDQdSUYFX15RGBzlXnH0KWAQb5sD2tDDzflwxTfqRLPPd4bntFtS9kBeHvEScDMPl5O8bJwi2Xj_n9DLw9IJWskiaIWrwvNFAIQbSYopuU5K7oHvjvY2mCCXZ8f1q2qu0k-NwygxiBhW_9pRIylO87T5cYv92o0EMPl22nloZeyZ9Oqy8BNISb8tXfkRKMU3NBgeDrMf6O5Yk-65sMrglXSqAzcAGZKu120PZ96889dWziL5j4rpUr793tLH-y1MwsIjPnXydKz_RyZgnS7mbz_r2pG6n6tWt36eHpqmXq66_C12B8szzDOkperchqjcEFFQSPfgRfD0evt2SyrO1bWL1SD2JroVz-_6FjqQKk/l_W3PlbzqqN5mfkKpVcnp6VP5fLajwkz/13">close out customer positions</a> they’d never actually bought?).</p>

In anything to do with cryptocurrency, and definitely in this case, I'd go with &quot;darkly cynical&quot;. He then <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a market’s not deep, eﬃcient or clean enough to digest a bit of one-day volatility, why get involved?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd agree with Elder on this. If we look at the log plot of Bitcoin's history, we can barely see the 47% drop in 6 weeks last October. We can just see, to take some recent examples, the 48% drop in 5 weeks in early 2020, and the 42% drop in 2 weeks in mid-2021. Traders who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Of course, the volatility is precisely the thing that brings the traders to Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Where’s the volume?</h3>
<p>Elder notes a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">wave of selling</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crypto exchange-traded products have been haemorrhaging money all week. Spot ETP net redemptions yesterday were <span class="math inline">\(1.14bn, including \)</span>901mn just from bitcoin ETPs, according to JPMorgan estimates. That’s the worst single day for net outflows since February.</p>
<p>With so much selling, you might expect to see an increase in bitcoin velocity, which measures the rate at which tokens move on the chain.</p>
</blockquote>

This graph covers a longer history than Elder's. Already back in 2021 <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396">Igor Makarov &amp; Antoinette Schoar</a> found that the &quot;rate at which tokens move on the chain&quot; was irrelevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>90% of transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain is not tied to economically meaningful activities but is the byproduct of the Bitcoin protocol design as well as the preference of many participants for anonymity ... exchanges play a central role in the Bitcoin system. They explain 75% of real Bitcoin volume.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Velocity dropped sharply until November 2023, and then continued to drop gradually. November 2023 was the start of a major increase in Bitcoin's price, which coincided with a sustained increase in trading volume on exchanges.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwiHz6WvW-msIZQfvpYRBKBy8hzVIGXSNSpjlQeG7mWh5xysofJulu_nCGawqrJqgAM5yIrgMg5FKZuaolDIoZgB5VzTXbAGtOpO6wy74QzCWJ981k_QXHEFhA5PcLSISh72R11TWp3zGuKpASOzGLqS0rENzHc9foYyVLX5Fg7WuRoTVduNJaA7y9LxO0/s1200/trade-volume.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwiHz6WvW-msIZQfvpYRBKBy8hzVIGXSNSpjlQeG7mWh5xysofJulu_nCGawqrJqgAM5yIrgMg5FKZuaolDIoZgB5VzTXbAGtOpO6wy74QzCWJ981k_QXHEFhA5PcLSISh72R11TWp3zGuKpASOzGLqS0rENzHc9foYyVLX5Fg7WuRoTVduNJaA7y9LxO0/w200-h100/trade-volume.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/trade-volume">Source</a>
It thus seems likely that the trend identified by Makarov &amp; Schoar that on-chain activity was largely confided to exchanges increased between 2021 and 2023, and was then saturated. Elder's explanation is only <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">part of the story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin velocity has been plummeting for years, for reasonable reasons. “Digital gold” overtook “internet money” as the preferred reason to hold, while derivatives like perpetual futures removed any need to faﬀ around with the underlying asset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn't just derivatives. Spot trading happens on exchanges. The blockchain is pretty much only used for inter-exchange netting transactions. So Elder's question <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">misses the point</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, is it odd to have a sudden wave of selling that’s almost invisible
in the underlying asset? Bitcoin velocity has barely changed over the past
month, having bounced meekly oﬀ a record low in early October. Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a vast derivative market based off a much smaller spot market on exchanges based on a tiny set of transactions on the blockchain is a wonderful playground for traders, because it is easy to manipulate.</p>
<h3>Is past performance indicative of future results?</h3>

Spoiler: No. In this section Elder expresses skepticism about a piece by Alex “Crypto Alex” Saunders, of Citigroup suggesting that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The halving cycle is a reason that long-time Bitcoin holders are nervous. We show the price performance in the years after halvings in Figure 3 with the second year showing weakness. These crypto winters have been associated with 80%+drawdowns in the past as shown in Figure 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder doesn't need any help from me on this &quot;chart necromancy&quot;. Halvenings primarily affect miners by roughly halving their income without a corresponding decrease in costs. This may force them to sell coins they have stashed, which at the margin may drive the price down. But with miners' income currently around <span class="math inline">\(40M/day and recent volume peaks on major exchanges around \)</span>1.4B/day this is likely to have marginal impact.</p>

      <h1>A new weekly top 40 list highlights bestselling indie books.</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)

      <p>For as long as I can remember, a bestseller in the world of books has only referred to the Times’s list of top sellers, the reigning measuring stick of publishing success. But a new bestseller list put together by two</p>

Jake worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software">UserLand</a>, but never at the <a href="https://github.com/tedchoward/Frontier">kernel</a> level, which is exactly where he and his (virtual) AI buddies are working. He knew Frontier well, he was a developer at MacWorld, where they used it as the CMS to manage their website. Then he came to work at UserLand where he worked on the CMS itself, and over time became a full contributor to the work we were doing in RSS, XML-RPC, feed reading and podcasting. He's a musician too and the nicest guy to work with. He just got the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> for Frontier running. I'm so proud of his accomplishments, and totally looking forward using the new Frontier for server programming, which is all Linux for me these days. And I also look forward to having Manila and Radio UserLand running on modern hardware, esp so I can demo these apps for my friends in the WordPress community. There's a lot of stuff happening here these days, glad to say I'm working with some incredible people and totally excited about what comes next.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>When we optimize responses using a reward model as a proxy for “goodness” in reinforcement learning, models sometimes learn to “hack” this proxy and output an answer that only “looks good” to it (because coming up with an answer that is actually good can be hard). The philosophy behind confessions is that we can train models to produce a second output — aka a “confession” — that is rewarded solely for honesty, which we will argue is less likely hacked than the normal task reward function. One way to think of confessions is that we are giving the model access to an “anonymous tip line” where it can turn itself in by presenting incriminating evidence of misbehavior. But unlike real-world tip lines, if the model acted badly in the original task, it can collect the reward for turning itself in while still keeping the original reward from the bad behavior in the main task. We hypothesize that this form of training will teach models to produce maximally honest confessions.</p>

<p>Claude Cowork defaults to allowing outbound HTTP traffic to only a specific list of domains, to help protect the user against prompt injection attacks that exfiltrate their data.</p>
<p>Prompt Armor found a creative workaround: Anthropic's API domain is on that list, so they constructed an attack that includes an attacker's own Anthropic API key and has the agent upload any files it can see to the <code>https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files</code> endpoint, allowing the attacker to retrieve their content later.</p>

      <p>Researchers have <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-expose-whill-wheelchair-safety-risks-via-remote-hacking/">demonstrated</a> remotely controlling a wheelchair over Bluetooth. CISA has issued an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-364-01">advisory</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CISA said the WHILL wheelchairs did not enforce authentication for Bluetooth connections, allowing an attacker who is in Bluetooth range of the targeted device to pair with it. The attacker could then control the wheelchair’s movements, override speed restrictions, and manipulate configuration profiles, all without requiring credentials or user interaction.</p>

      <h1>Switch</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p><strong>Update</strong>: Never mind! It turns that Google’s issue is with <em>unreachable</em> <code>robots.txt</code> files, not absent <code>robots.txt</code> files. They really need to improve their messaging. Stand down everyone.</p>
<p>A bit has been flipped on Google Search.</p>
<p>Previously, the Googlebot would index any web page it came across, unless a <code>robots.txt</code> file said otherwise.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/community-video/360202946/fix-robots-txt-unreachable-error-website-not-indexing">a <code>robots.txt</code> file is <em>required</em> in order for the Googlebot to index a website</a>.</p>
<p>This puzzles me. Until now, Google was all about “organising the world’s information and making it accessible.” This switch-up will limit “the world’s information” to “the information on websites that have a <code>robots.txt</code> file.”</p>
<p>They’re free to do this. Despite what some people think, Google isn’t a utility. It’s a business. Other search engines are available, with different business models. <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a>. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>. Google != the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>I am curious about this latest move with Google Search though. I’d love to know if it only applies to Google’s search bot. Google has other bots out crawling the web: <code>Adsbot-Google</code>, <code>Google-Extended</code>, <code>Googlebot-Image</code>, <code>GoogleOther</code>, <code>Mediapartners-Google</code>. I’m probably missing a few.</p>
<p>If the new default only applies to the searchbot and doesn’t include say, the crawler that’s fracking the web in order train Google’s large language model, then this is how things work now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your website <em>won’t</em> appear in search results unless you explicitly <strong>opt in</strong>.</li>
<li>Your website <em>will</em> be used as training data unless you explicitly <strong>opt out</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be good to get some clarity on this. Alas, the Google Search team are notoriously tight-lipped so I’m not holding my breath.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: It's not normal (14 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links It's not normal: Remember when you owned stuff? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Telco rats out protesters; Rogers v Net Neutrality; Jailhouse lawyer v Stingrays; Black Panther self-care. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. It's not normal (permalink) Samantha: This town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to…but I'm not. Mrs Krabappel: It'll take you about six weeks, dear. -The Simpsons, &quot;Bart's Friend Falls in Love,&quot; S3E23, May 7, 1992 We are living through weird times, and they've persisted for so long that you probably don't even notice it. But these times are not normal. Now, I realize that this covers a lot of ground, and without detracting from all the other ways in which the world is weird and bad, I want to focus on one specific and pervasive and awful way in which this world is not normal, in part because this abnormality has a defined cause, a precise start date, and an obvious, actionable remedy. 6 years, 5 months and 22 days after Fox aired &quot;Bart's Friend Falls in Love,&quot; Bill Clinton signed a new bill into law: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). Under Section 1201 of the DMCA, it's a felony to modify your own property in ways that the manufacturer disapproves of, even if your modifications accomplish some totally innocuous, legal, and socially beneficial goal. Not a little felony, either: DMCA 1201 provides for a five year sentence and a <span class="math inline">\(500,000 fine for a first offense. Back when the DMCA was being debated, its proponents insisted that their critics were overreacting. They pointed to the legal barriers to invoking DMCA 1201, and insisted that these new restrictions would only apply to a few marginal products in narrow ways that the average person would never even notice. But that was obvious nonsense, obvious even in 1998, and far more obvious today, more than a quarter-century on. In order for a manufacturer to criminalize modifications to your own property, they have to satisfy two criteria: first, they must sell you a device with a computer in it; and second, they must design that computer with an "access control" that you have to work around in order to make a modification. For example, say your toaster requires that you scan your bread before it will toast it, to make sure that you're only using a special, expensive kind of bread that kicks back a royalty to the manufacturer. If the embedded computer that does the scanning ships from the factory with a program that is supposed to prevent you from turning off the scanning step, then it is a felony to modify your toaster to work with "unauthorized bread": https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/ If this sounds outlandish, then a) You definitely didn't walk the floor at CES last week, where there were a zillion "cooking robots" that required proprietary feedstock; and b) You haven't really thought hard about your iPhone (which will not allow you to install software of your choosing): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But back in 1998, computers – even the kind of low-powered computers that you'd embed in an appliance – were expensive and relatively rare. No longer! Today, manufacturers source powerful "System on a Chip" (SoC) processors at prices ranging from \)</span>0.25 to $8. These are full-fledged computers, easily capable of running an &quot;access control&quot; that satisfies DMCA 1201. Likewise, in 1998, &quot;access controls&quot; (also called &quot;DRM,&quot; &quot;technical protection measures,&quot; etc) were a rarity in the field. That was because computer scientists broadly viewed these measures as useless. A determined adversary could always find a way around an access control, and they could package up that break as a software tool and costlessly, instantaneously distribute it over the internet to everyone in the world who wanted to do something that an access control impeded. Access controls were a stupid waste of engineering resources and a source of needless complexity and brittleness: <a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2012/01/10/lockdown-the-coming-war-on-general-purpose-computing/">https://memex.craphound.com/2012/01/10/lockdown-the-coming-war-on-general-purpose-computing/</a> But – as critics pointed out in 1998 – chips were obviously going to get much cheaper, and if the US Congress made it a felony to bypass an access control, then every kind of manufacturer would be tempted to add some cheap SoCs to their products so they could add access controls and thereby felonize any uses of their products that cut into their profits. Basically, the DMCA offered manufacturers a bargain: add a dollar or two to the bill of materials for your product, and in return, the US government will imprison any competitors who offer your customers a &quot;complementary good&quot; that improves on it. It's even worse than this: another thing that was obvious in 1998 was that once a manufacturer added a chip to a device, they would probably also figure out a way to connect it to the internet. Once that device is connected to the internet, the manufacturer can push software updates to it at will, which will be installed without user intervention. What's more, by using an access control in connection with that over-the-air update mechanism, the manufacturer can make it a felony to block its updates. Which means that a manufacturer can sell you a device and then mandatorily update it at a later date to take away its functionality, and then sell that functionality back to you as a &quot;subscription&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process</a> A thing that keeps happening: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202166/snoo-premium-subscription-happiest-baby">https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202166/snoo-premium-subscription-happiest-baby</a> And happening: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a> And happening: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification">https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification</a> In fact, it happens so often I've coined a term for it, &quot;The Darth Vader MBA&quot; (as in, &quot;I'm altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further&quot;): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/01/fulu/#i-am-altering-the-deal">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/01/fulu/#i-am-altering-the-deal</a> Here's what this all means: any manufacturer who devotes a small amount of engineering work and incurs a small hardware expense can extinguish private property rights altogether. What do I mean by private property? Well, we can look to Blackstone's 1753 treatise: The right of property; or that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe. You can't own your iPhone. If you take your iPhone to Apple and they tell you that it is beyond repair, you have to throw it away. If the repair your phone needs involves &quot;parts pairing&quot; (where a new part won't be recognized until an Apple technician &quot;initializes&quot; it through a DMCA-protected access control), then it's a felony to get that phone fixed somewhere else. If Apple tells you your phone is no longer supported because they've updated their OS, then it's a felony to wipe the phone and put a different OS on it (because installing a new OS involves bypassing an &quot;access control&quot; in the phone's bootloader). If Apple tells you that you can't have a piece of software – like ICE Block, an app that warns you if there are nearby ICE killers who might shoot you in the head through your windshield, which Apple has barred from its App Store on the grounds that ICE is a &quot;protected class&quot; – then you can't install it, because installing software that isn't delivered via the App Store involves bypassing an &quot;access control&quot; that checks software to ensure that it's authorized (just like the toaster with its unauthorized bread). It's not just iPhones: versions of this play out in your medical implants (hearing aid, insulin pump, etc); appliances (stoves, fridges, washing machines); cars and ebikes; set-top boxes and game consoles; ebooks and streaming videos; small appliances (toothbrushes, TVs, speakers), and more. Increasingly, things that you actually own are the exception, not the rule. And this is not normal. The end of ownership represents an overturn of a foundation of modern civilization. The fact that the only &quot;people&quot; who can truly own something are the transhuman, immortal colony organisms we call &quot;Limited Liability Corporations&quot; is an absolutely surreal reversal of the normal order of things. It's a reversal with deep implications: for one thing, it means that you can't protect yourself from raids on your private data or ready cash by adding privacy blockers to your device, which would make it impossible for airlines or ecommerce sites to guess about how rich/desperate you are before quoting you a &quot;personalized price&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/11/nothing-personal/#instacartography">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/11/nothing-personal/#instacartography</a> It also means you can't stop your device from leaking information about your movements, or even your conversations – Microsoft has announced that it will gather all of your private communications and ship them to its servers for use by &quot;agentic AI&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4</a> Microsoft has also confirmed that it provides US authorities with warrantless, secret access to your data: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/</a> This is deeply abnormal. Sure, greedy corporate control freaks weren't invented in the 21st century, but the laws that let those sociopaths put you in prison for failing to arrange your affairs to their benefit – and your own detriment – are. But because computers got faster and cheaper over decades, the end of ownership has had an incremental rollout, and we've barely noticed that it's happened. Sure, we get irritated when our garage-door opener suddenly requires us to look at seven ads every time we use the app that makes it open or close: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/09/lead-me-not-into-temptation/#chamberlain">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/09/lead-me-not-into-temptation/#chamberlain</a> But societally, we haven't connected that incident to this wider phenomenon. It stinks here, but we're all used to it. It's not normal to buy a book and then not be able to lend it, sell it, or give it away. Lending, selling and giving away books is older than copyright. It's older than publishing. It's older than printing. It's older than paper. It is fucking weird (and also terrible) (obviously) that there's a new kind of very popular book that you can go to prison for lending, selling or giving away. We're just a few cycles away from a pair of shoes that can figure out which shoelaces you're using, or a dishwasher that can block you from using third-party dishes: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/if-dishwashers-were-iphones">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/if-dishwashers-were-iphones</a> It's not normal, and it has profound implications for our security, our privacy, and our society. It makes us easy pickings for corporate vampires who drain our wallets through the gadgets and tools we rely on. It makes us easy pickings for fascists and authoritarians who ally themselves with corporate vampires by promising them tax breaks in exchange for collusion in the destruction of a free society. I know that these problems are more important than whether or not we think this is normal. But still. It. Is. Just. Not. Normal.

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/17/reallySimpleKetchup.png" alt="">It's always been difficult to compete with a platform vendor, that's why the web works so well -- it doesn't have one. The web was like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>, but like a democracy it takes care and a bit of sacrifice to keep it going. It's always been possible to rebuild the web, to take back our freedom to create new webs out of the web that TBL discovered. It just takes determination and dedication to working together, a higher cause than piling up billions of dollars that the billionaires have absolutely no idea what to do with. I think the world order based on democracy depends on us digging out of the hole we're in, in the technology. Think about it.</p>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>While major recording artists are sued for alleged plagiarism and most creators earn pennies for their work, media industry profits continue to soar. Libraries face mounting barriers to providing access to ebooks—often while being sued by the very publishers whose books they buy.</p>
<p>In this episode of Future Knowledge, tech and culture writer <strong>Glyn Moody</strong> discusses his book <em>Walled Culture: How Big Content Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Keep Creators Poor</em>. Moody traces how copyright laws designed for a world of physical scarcity have been repurposed for the digital age—creating legal and technical “walls” that restrict access to knowledge, limit creativity, and overwhelmingly benefit large media corporations over creators and the public. Joining the conversation is <strong>Maria Bustillos</strong>, writer and editor at the Brick House Cooperative.</p>

comparing it to existing non-genAI systems, but also between different
genAI solutions (models, etc).</p>
<p>I don’t consider myself a <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/karen-hao-boomer-doomer-divide-openai/">doomer<br>
or a boomer</a>, and see genAI as <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology">normal<br>
technology</a> that needs to be evaluated as a technology. I know this
is a broad area, that overlaps somewhat with how the models are
themselves built (benchmarking), but if you have recommendations please<a href="mailto:ehs@pobox.com">let me know</a>?</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/12/anthropic-invests-in-python.html?m=1">Anthropic invests $1.5 million in the Python Software Foundation and open source security</a></strong></p>
<p>This is outstanding news, especially given our decision to withdraw from that NSF grant application <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/27/psf-withdrawn-proposal/">back in October</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that Anthropic has entered into a two-year partnership with the Python Software Foundation (PSF) to contribute a landmark total of $1.5 million to support the foundation’s work, with an emphasis on Python ecosystem security. This investment will enable the PSF to make crucial security advances to CPython and the Python Package Index (PyPI) benefiting all users, and it will also sustain the foundation’s core work supporting the Python language, ecosystem, and global community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that while security is a focus these funds will also support other aspects of the PSF's work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic’s support will also go towards the PSF’s core work, including the Developer in Residence program driving contributions to CPython, community support through grants and other programs, running core infrastructure such as PyPI, and more.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/13/desrosiers.png" alt="">I had a fantastic meeting today with <a href="https://jonathandesrosiers.com/">Jonathan Desrosiers</a>. I gave him a tour of all the software that makes up WordLand and FeedLand. It was the first time I had done that with anyone from the WordPress community. It started off with a simple story about how I knew I was on the right track when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/tumblr-to-move-its-half-a-billion-blogs-to-wordpress/">Matt announced</a> they were porting Tumblr to run on top of WordPress as an OS. Which is exactly what I'm doing with my collection of software. Every bit of writing should be a WordPress post, and they should be linked together in arbitrary graphs. It was nice to review that with a serious developer, Jonathan is one of the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/11/26/core-committers-check-in-november-2025/">core committers</a> of the open source WordPress. It helped me see all the different things we can do, and now hope we will do. I feel I understand this community, as a time-traveler from the past I think I understand what we should do next.</p>

      <p>&quot;Fit and finish&quot; appears in many industries. For much of the software industry, it refers to features that complete a fit for a target audience, ensuring that audience can use the product for their needs. At a frame shop, it means literally fitting the mounted artwork into a frame, then finishing the back of the frame.</p>
<p>At Purism, fit takes on another meaning - making apps fit on screens the size of the Librem 5.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Sorry, eh (13 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Sorry, eh: I sincerely regret that all my ideas will not lose billions of dollars, destroy jobs or make your country more dependent on American tech. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: 20 years a blogger; Woz on Network Neutrality; Moveon endorses Bernie. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Sorry, eh (permalink) Like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian, and while I have lived abroad for most of this century, I still hew faithfully to our folkways, which is why I'd like to start this essay by apologizing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm a technology writer, which means I'm supposed to be encouraging you to throw hundreds of billions of dollars at the money-losingest technology in human history, AI. No one has ever lost as much money as the AI companies. There is no way to operate one of Nvidia's big AI-optimized GPUs without losing money. The owners of these GPUs who have lost the least money are the ones who rushed into buying GPUs without ensuring they'd have electricity to power them, and have been forced to leave their GPUs to age in warehouses. The minute they plug in those GPUs, they'll start losing money, and the more they use them, the more money they'll lose. I'm sorry. As a technology writer, I'm supposed to be telling you that this bet will some day pay off, because one day we will have shoveled so many words into the word-guessing program that it wakes up and learns how to actually do the jobs it is failing spectacularly at today. This is a proposition akin to the idea that if we keep breeding horses to run faster and faster, one of them will give birth to a locomotive. Humans possess intelligence, and machines do not. The difference between a human and a word-guessing program isn't how many words the human knows. I'm sorry. I know that when we talk about &quot;digital sovereignty,&quot; we're obliged to talk about how we can build more data-centres that we can fill up with money-losing chips from American silicon monopolists in the hopes of destroying as many jobs as possible while blowing through our clean energy goals and enshittifying as much of our potable water as possible. I don't have any advice for how to do that. I'm sorry! As Canada contemplates our response to the collapse of the American empire and its alliances with the world, the cornerstone of our current strategy is sacrificing our dollars, water and energy in order to become more dependent on America, in a weird and improbable bet that we will figure out how to make millions of Canadians unemployed. I'm sorry, that just doesn't sound like a great idea to me. If I can beg your indulgence, I'd like to propose an alternative. Back in 2012, Canada passed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act. It's a law that bans Canadian companies from modifying America's digital tech exports. We passed it because the US threatened us with tariffs: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman</a> Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell jailbreaking kits for phones and consoles, which would let Canadian sellers offer goods and services to Canadian buyers outside of US app stores, sidestepping the 30% app tax that Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony and others impose on our digital economy. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell mechanics a universal diagnostic tool that turns every &quot;check engine&quot; light into a useful error message. Instead, Canadian mechanics have to send <span class="math inline">\(10,000/year/manufacturer to America for a proprietary car diagnosis kit. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't offer ink cartridge manufacturers software that will ensure their cartridges work in the printers Canadians buy from the American inkjet cartel. As a result, Canadians have to spend \)</span>10,000/gallon on ink, making it the most expensive fluid a Canadian civilian can purchase without a government permit. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell our farmers software that lets them start using their tractors as soon as they've fixed them. Instead, after a Canadian farmer fixes their tractor, they have to wait for a service call from a rep for a US ag-tech monopolist who'll type an unlock code into the tractor's keyboard and charge the farmer a couple hundred bucks for this &quot;service.&quot; Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't revive one of the most successful technologies in modern history: the home video recorder. Remember those? First we had VCRs, then we had digital successors like the Tivo. Canadian law says you're allowed to record the video that comes into your home, whether by broadcast, cable, satellite or streaming. But Bill C-11 bans a Canadian company from selling you a gadget that lets you save the video you get in an app or from a set-top box. It's crazy: we have actually uninvented the VCR! You know how everyone is pissed off about their favourite shows being yanked from the streaming services? Repeal C-11 and you could just save those shows forever. Repeal C-11 and you'd kill the grinchy little racket that services like Prime pull, where Christmas cartoons are in the free tier from March to November, and cost $3.99 to watch between November and March. Just tape 'em in August and save 'em for later! It doesn't stop there. Remember when Facebook banned all links to the news in Canada? Repeal C-11 and a Canadian company could sell you an alternative Facebook app that puts the news back into your feed! Repeal C-11 and Canadians could get an alternative app that replaces all the streaming services, letting you search and stream every service you have an account for in one place, mixing in Canadian content from the NFB, public broadcasters, and commercial services. Virtually every Canadian ministry, corporation and household is locked into a US Big Tech silo. Any of these could be shut down at a single word from Trump to any of the tech giants who've lined up to do his bidding. Repeal C-11 and we can extract all our data from these walled gardens/prisons and get it onto auditable, trustworthy, transparent open source software, hosted in data-centres located safely on Canadian soil. If there's one thing Canadians are good it, it's going to other countries and extracting their wealth. We're world champions at it. America's tech monopolies have sequestered trillions of dollars worth of monopoly rents on their balance sheets. This is dead capital, being pissed up the wall on nonsense like stock buybacks and data-centres and grotesque executive bonuses. As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: &quot;Your margin is my opportunity.&quot; America's tech trillions represent a rich and readily accessible seam that we can extract – safely, from our own country! – and turn into our billions, and an exportable line of products that the whole world would beat a path to our door to buy. Look, I'm sorry. I don't have any ideas for how Canada can get to a better future by lighting billions on fire in a bet on a failing technology whose dubious profitability depends on ruining our job market, our power grid and our water supply, which will tie the American political situation to our ankles. All I've got is an idea for how we can make insanely profitable products that people really want to buy, that will insulate us from cyberattacks by US tech giants who are in thrall to Trump, and that Americans will pay us to use in order to free themselves from the tech giants who abuse them, too. I'm really sorry. I know it's out of step with the times, but all I have is ideas that make money, make us safer, make us richer, and make our technology better. On the other hand, those chatbots sure are cute. It's funny when they &quot;hallucinate.&quot; Hey look at this (permalink) Bruce Sterling going very, very hard <a href="https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/561/State-of-the-World-2026-with-Bru-page05.html#post116">https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/561/State-of-the-World-2026-with-Bru-page05.html#post116</a> Get Lost, 2025 <a href="https://www.loweringthebar.net/2026/01/get-lost-2025.html">https://www.loweringthebar.net/2026/01/get-lost-2025.html</a> How to know if that job will crush your soul <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/12/will-that-job-crush-your-soul/">https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/12/will-that-job-crush-your-soul/</a> Why Did Trump Just Attack the Fed and Corporate America?

      <h1>Monky Business: Creating a Cistercian Numerals Generator</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>In the 13th century Cistercian monks came up with a way to show the numbers from 1 to 9999 as a single character. The way it works is to add the lines of different characters to each other until the number is reached. So, if you want to show 161, you take the 1, the […]</p>

      <h1>RAMO</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Stop me if this sounds familiar to you…</p>
<p>There’s a conference you heard about it. It sounded really good but you never got ’round to getting a ticket. You were too busy thinking about work stuff. It was just one of those things that remained in the idle thought stage.</p>
<p>Then the day of the conference rolls around. You’re sitting in front of your computer seeing the social media posts from people at the event who are having a ball. The talks sound really good and you wish you could be there. You wonder why you never got ’round to getting that ticket.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve experienced that when <a href="https://ffconf.org/">FFconf</a> is happening and people like me are in the audience posting about some revelatory insight we’ve just received. Or maybe you see the blog posts and <a href="https://marcthiele.com/photos/dconstruct-2022">pictures from an event like dConstruct</a> and you realise that you missed your chance to experience something special.</p>
<p>I’ve certainly experienced it when I’m not in Düsseldorf or Berlin for <a href="https://marcthiele.com/photos/dconstruct-2022">Beyond Tellerrand</a> and all my friends are posting about how excellent it is.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like FOMO but instead of fear of missing out, it’s more like regret at missing out: RAMO.</p>
<p>I’m giving you advance warning. If you have anything at all to do with front-end development and you don’t come to <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a>, you are definitely going to experience RAMO.</p>

      <h1>1980s Hacker Manifesto</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13, updated: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Forty years ago, The Mentor— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyd_Blankenship">Loyd Blankenship</a>—published “ <a href="https://phrack.org/issues/7/3">The Conscience of a Hacker</a>” in <em>Phrack</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You bet your ass we’re all alike… we’ve been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak… the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We’ve been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.</p>
<p>This is our world now… the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn’t run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore… and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge… and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias… and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it’s for our own good, yet we’re the criminals...</p>

      <h1>Reproducible Notebooks</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>I learned about <a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a> a few months ago
from <a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/episodepage/revolutionizing-python-notebooks-with-marimo">this<br>
podcast episode</a> and have been meaning to try it out. As a long time
user of <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter notebooks</a> I was
interested to hear how Marimo was built (in part) to help solve the
problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">reproducibility</a>
in data science and research software ( <a href="#ref-Pimentel:2019">Pimentel, Murta, Braganholo, &amp; Freire,<br>
2019</a>). This is a problem I have had a lot of experience with,
especially when sharing Jupyter notebooks with others.</p>
<p>The key thing that Marimo brings to the Python notebook to improve
reproducibility is <em>reactive</em> execution. Marimo uses the Python<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> to
remember what cells depend on other cells, and when a change in one
requires the execution of another, it will go and update it for you.
Because of how they are created and edited, it’s very common for Jupyter
notebooks to get into an inconsistent state because of the order in
which cells are executed. This problem goes away with Marimo.</p>
<p>But, this aside, I thought I’d mention some somewhat superficial things
that I immediately liked about Marimo…bearing in mind I’ve only been
using it for one day.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pandas dataframes appear as nicely formatted tables that can be easily
scrolled horizontally, without truncation of values, or elided columns.
I’ve gotten this to work in Jupyter notebooks in the past, but it always
requires some fiddling it seems, and Marimo does it out of the box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table columns are sortable, filterable and can be summarized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can page through large tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can easily download tables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can commit your notebook to a git repository, and diffs in pull
requests make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can easily run the notebook from the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can embed tests in your notebooks, and run them separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Built in basic charts (pie, bar, line, etc) which you can view source
for and hand craft if you want (seems to use <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway just a few things I liked. If you use and like Jupyter notebooks
I recommend giving it a try.</p>

      <h1><code>Without Overlaps</code> Constraints</h1>
<p><img src="https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/without-overlaps-constraints/caniuse-without-overlaps.timeline.png" alt="Full Db2 (LUW) support since at least 10.5. Full MariaDB support since at least 10.5. Full PostgreSQL support since at least 18."></p>
<ol>
<li>Functionality available with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html#RANGETYPES-CONSTRAINT">exclusion constraints</a></li>
<li>Without keyword <code>for</code>: <code>PERIOD FOR BUSINESS_TIME (…)</code></li>
<li>Using the <code>btree_gist</code> extension and a range: <code>BUSINESS_TIME tsrange GENERATED ALWAYS AS (tsrange(start_ts, end_ts)) STORED</code></li>
</ol>
<p>SQL supports temporal constraints that prevent rows with overlapping time ranges. These constraints are typically used to prevent double bookings in a reservation system.</p>
<p>Such a <code>primary key</code> or <code>unique</code> constraint uses the keywords <code>without overlaps</code> on the period that combines the begin and end of the time frame.<a href="https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/without-overlaps-constraints#footnote-0" title="Closed/Open or Inklusive/Exklusive.">0</a></p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE t (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL,

  start_ts TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL,
  end_ts   TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL,
  PERIOD FOR BUSINESS_TIME (start_ts, end_ts),

  PRIMARY KEY (id, BUSINESS_TIME WITHOUT OVERLAPS)
)
</code></pre>
<p>Now consider these <code>insert</code> statements.</p>
<pre><code>INSERT INTO t (id, start_ts, end_ts)
VALUES (1, TIMESTAMP'2018-05-16 19:12:50', TIMESTAMP'9999-12-31 23:59:59')
</code></pre>
<pre><code>INSERT INTO t (id, start_ts, end_ts)
VALUES (1,  TIMESTAMP'2025-12-01 20:00:00', TIMESTAMP'2026-01-13 20:00:00')
</code></pre>
<p>Given the <code>without overlaps</code> constraint the second <code>insert</code> is rejected as its period falls within the range of the first row.</p>

<p>To Superhuman's credit they treated this as the high priority incident it is and issued a fix.</p>

      <h1>First impressions of Claude Cowork, Anthropic's general agent</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>New from Anthropic today is <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Claude Cowork</a>, a &quot;research preview&quot; that they describe as &quot;Claude Code for the rest of your work&quot;. It's currently available only to Max subscribers (<span class="math inline">\(100 or \)</span>200 per month plans) as part of the updated Claude Desktop macOS application. <strong>Update 16th January 2026</strong>: it's now also available to $20/month Claude Pro subscribers.</p>
<p>I've been saying for a while now that Claude Code is a &quot;general agent&quot; disguised as a developer tool. It can help you with any computer task that can be achieved by executing code or running terminal commands... which covers almost anything, provided you know what you're doing with it! What it really needs is a UI that doesn't involve the terminal and a name that doesn't scare away non-developers.</p>
<p>&quot;Cowork&quot; is a pretty solid choice on the name front!</p>
<h4>What it looks like</h4>
<p>The interface for Cowork is a new tab in the Claude desktop app, called Cowork. It sits next to the existing Chat and Code tabs.</p>
<p>It looks very similar to the desktop interface for regular Claude Code. You start with a prompt, optionally attaching a folder of files. It then starts work.</p>
<p>I tried it out against my perpetually growing &quot;blog-drafts&quot; folder with the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn't publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being ready</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-cowork.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Claude AI desktop application showing a &quot;Cowork&quot; task interface. Left sidebar shows tabs for &quot;Chat&quot;, &quot;Code&quot;, and &quot;Cowork&quot; (selected), with &quot;+ New task&quot; button and a task titled &quot;Review unpublished drafts for pu...&quot; listed below. Text reads &quot;These tasks run locally and aren't synced across devices&quot;. Main panel header shows &quot;Review unpublished drafts for publication&quot;. User message in green bubble reads: &quot;Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn't publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being ready&quot;. Claude responds: &quot;I'll help you find drafts from the last three months and check if they've been published. Let me start by looking at your drafts folder.&quot; Below is an expanded &quot;Running command&quot; section showing Request JSON with command: find /sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts -type f \( -name &quot;.md&quot; -o -name &quot;.txt&quot; -o -name &quot;*.html&quot; \) -mtime -90 -exec ls -la {} \;, description: Find draft files modified in the last 90 days. Response text begins: &quot;Found 46 draft files. Next let me read the content of each to get their titles/topics, then&quot;. Right sidebar shows Progress section with three circular indicators (two checked, one pending) and text &quot;Steps will show as the task unfolds.&quot;, Artifacts section listing &quot;publish-encouragement.html&quot;, Context section with &quot;Selected folders&quot; showing &quot;blog-drafts&quot; folder, Connectors showing &quot;Web search&quot;, and Working files listing &quot;llm-digest-october-2025.md&quot;, &quot;tests-not-optional-coding-agen...&quot;, and &quot;digest-november-2025.md&quot;. Bottom shows reply input field, &quot;Opus 4.5&quot; model selector, user &quot;Simon Willison&quot; with &quot;Max plan&quot;, and disclaimer &quot;Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.&quot;"></p>
<p>It started by running this command:</p>
<pre><code>find /sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts \
  -type f \( -name &quot;*.md&quot; -o -name &quot;*.txt&quot; -o -name &quot;*.html&quot; \) \
  -mtime -90 -exec ls -la {} \;
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>/sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts</code> path instantly caught my eye. Anthropic say that Cowork can only access files you grant it access to - it looks to me like they're mounting those files into a containerized environment, which should mean we can trust Cowork not to be able to access anything outside of that sandbox.</p>
<p>It turns out I have 46 draft files from the past three months. Claude then went to work with its search tool, running 44 individual searches against <code>site:simonwillison.net</code> to figure out which of my drafts had already been published.</p>
<p>Here's the eventual reply:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's a good response! It found exactly what I needed to see, although those upgrade instructions are actually published elsewhere now ( <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/upgrade_guide.html">in the Datasette docs</a>) and weren't actually intended for my blog.</p>
<p>Just for fun, and because I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/">really like artifacts</a>, I asked for a follow-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make me an artifact with exciting animated encouragements to get me to do it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's what I got:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-cowork-artifact.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the same Claude AI desktop application Cowork interface, now showing completed task results. Left panel shows &quot;1 step &gt;&quot; with link &quot;View your animated encouragement page&quot;. Claude's response reads: &quot;I created an over-the-top animated encouragement page with:&quot; followed by bullet points: &quot;🚀 Pulsing rockets and bouncing stats&quot;, &quot;✨ Falling emoji rain and confetti&quot;, &quot;🔥 Dancing fire emojis around your draft title&quot;, &quot;💫 Sparkles that follow your mouse&quot;, &quot;📊 An animated '95% ready' progress bar&quot;, &quot;💬 Rotating motivational quotes&quot;, &quot;🎉 A 'I'M GONNA DO IT!' button that triggers an explosion of confetti when clicked&quot;. Center shows an artifact preview of the generated HTML page with dark background featuring animated rocket emojis, large white text &quot;PUBLISH TIME!&quot;, stats showing &quot;22,602 bytes of wisdom waiting&quot;, &quot;95% ready to ship&quot;, infinity symbol with &quot;future arguments saved&quot;, and a fire emoji with yellow text &quot;Frequently&quot; (partially visible). Top toolbar shows &quot;Open in Firefox&quot; button. Right sidebar displays Progress section with checkmarks, Artifacts section with &quot;publish-encouragement.html&quot; selected, Context section showing &quot;blog-drafts&quot; folder, &quot;Web search&quot; connector, and Working files listing &quot;llm-digest-october-2025.md&quot;, &quot;tests-not-optional-coding-agen...&quot;, and &quot;digest-november-2025.md&quot;. Bottom shows reply input, &quot;Opus 4.5&quot; model selector, and disclaimer text."></p>
<p>I couldn't figure out how to close the right sidebar so the artifact ended up cramped into a thin column but it did work. I expect Anthropic will fix that display bug pretty quickly.</p>
<h4>Isn't this just Claude Code?</h4>
<p>I've seen a few people ask what the difference between this and regular Claude Code is. The answer is <em>not a lot</em>. As far as I can tell Claude Cowork is regular Claude Code wrapped in a less intimidating default interface and with a filesystem sandbox configured for you without you needing to know what a &quot;filesystem sandbox&quot; is.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It's more than just a filesystem sandbox - I had Claude Code reverse engineer the Claude app and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/35732f187edbe4fbd0bf976d013f22c8">it found out</a> that Claude uses VZVirtualMachine - the Apple Virtualization Framework - and downloads and boots a custom Linux root filesystem.</p>
<p>I think that's a really smart product. Claude Code has an enormous amount of value that hasn't yet been unlocked for a general audience, and this seems like a pragmatic approach.</p>
<h4>The ever-present threat of prompt injection</h4>
<p>With a feature like this, my first thought always jumps straight to security. How big is the risk that someone using this might be hit by hidden malicious instruction somewhere that break their computer or steal their data?</p>
<p>Anthropic touch on that directly in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should also be aware of the risk of &quot; <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/prompt-injection-defenses">prompt injections</a>&quot;: attempts by attackers to alter Claude's plans through content it might encounter on the internet. We've built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections, but agent safety---that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions---is still an active area of development in the industry.</p>
<p>These risks aren't new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you're using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation. We recommend taking precautions, particularly while you learn how it works. We provide more detail in our <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely">Help Center</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That help page includes the following tips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To minimize risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid granting access to local files with sensitive information, like financial documents.</li>
<li>When using the Claude in Chrome extension, limit access to trusted sites.</li>
<li>If you chose to extend Claude’s default internet access settings, be careful to only extend internet access to sites you trust.</li>
<li>Monitor Claude for suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not think it is fair to tell regular non-programmer users to watch out for &quot;suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection&quot;!</p>
<p>I'm sure they have some impressive mitigations going on behind the scenes. I recently learned that the summarization applied by the WebFetch function in Claude Code and now in Cowork is partly intended as a prompt injection protection layer via <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/1989025306980860226">this tweet</a> from Claude Code creator Boris Cherny:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summarization is one thing we do to reduce prompt injection risk. Are you running into specific issues with it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Anthropic are being honest here with their warnings: they can attempt to filter out potential attacks all they like but the one thing they can't provide is guarantees that no future attack will be found that sneaks through their defenses and steals your data (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">the lethal trifecta</a> for more on this.)</p>
<p>The problem with prompt injection remains that until there's a high profile incident it's really hard to get people to take it seriously. I myself have all sorts of Claude Code usage that could cause havoc if a malicious injection got in. Cowork does at least run in a filesystem sandbox by default, which is more than can be said for my <code>claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</code> habit!</p>
<p>I wrote more about this in my 2025 round-up: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#the-year-of-yolo-and-the-normalization-of-deviance">The year of YOLO and the Normalization of Deviance</a>.</p>
<h4>This is still a strong signal of the future</h4>
<p>Security worries aside, Cowork represents something really interesting. This is a general agent that looks well positioned to bring the wildly powerful capabilities of Claude Code to a wider audience.</p>
<p>I would be very surprised if Gemini and OpenAI don't follow suit with their own offerings in this category.</p>
<p>I imagine OpenAI are already regretting burning the name &quot;ChatGPT Agent&quot; on their janky, experimental and mostly forgotten browser automation tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/4/chatgpt-agents-user-agent/">back in August</a>!</p>
<h4>Bonus: and a silly logo</h4>
<p>bashtoni <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593022#46593553">on Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simple suggestion: logo should be a cow and and orc to match how I originally read the product name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't resist <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/d06dec3d62dee28f2bd993eb78beb2ce">throwing that one at Nano Banana</a>:</p>

      <h1>Controlling local web servers using xbar</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>Note: an enhanced and native macOS version is headed to the Mac App Store! <a href="https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman/status/2011578649087263204">It’s already finished</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I want to run local web servers for projects I’m working on. Usually more than one at a time, or at least over a short space of time.</p>
<p>So I thought it would be cool to have a controller for those local servers in my menu bar. Sounded like the perfect job for a little scripting and <a href="https://github.com/matryer/xbar">xbar</a>, which is a great way to prove a menubar app idea quickly.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The plugin allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>toggle servers on and off</li>
<li>open in browser</li>
<li>view ports</li>
<li>view paths</li>
<li>view log sizes</li>
<li>clear logs</li>
<li>edit config</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.gingerbeardman.com/images/posts/xbar-localhost-dark.png" alt="IMG"></p>
<h2>Example config</h2>
<p>In the config file we set the starting <code>SERVER_PORT</code>, followed by one or more <code>SERVER_DIR</code> for as many projects as you might want servers. We can temporarily comment out those server lines to prevent projects from appearing in the menu.</p>
<pre><code># .xbar_httpd_config
SERVER_PORT=8000
#SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/starchasers/
SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/serenity/
SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/point-cloud/

</code></pre>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/12/closeupOfAlarm.png" alt="">I'm working on a feature for WordLand II where you can flip a switch to see the OG Metadata for a post you're reading, by clicking on an icon that looks like the flag on the side of an old fashioned mailbox. I remembered there was a desk accessory on the original Mac that used this approach, and I've wanted that icon for a long time, and today I thought to ask ChatGPT to look into it for me, I had previously been relying on Google search, and it found what I was looking for and a lot of great history sites with details. I'm going to document the thread including some descriptions written by ChatGPT which I will label. Everything not labled like that is from me. ;-)</p>
<p>This was the first question I asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was an alarm desk accessory on the original Macintosh in 1984. It had a nice mailbox flag affordance. When the flag is up, the contents of the DA are hidden, flip it down to reveal what was hidden. Can you find me a writeup of this or screen shot. It might have been a different desk accessory or a different year.</li>
</ul>
<p>ChatGPT's response</p>
<ul>
<li>What you’re remembering is almost certainly the Alarm Clock desk accessory from the early Mac System Software (System 1 era and later). A small “lever/flag” control would toggle the window between a compact view (just time) and an expanded view that revealed the date/time/alarm-setting controls—very much like a mailbox-flag affordance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Screen shot</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/12/macDesktop1.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>The flag icon is on second box in the second row.</p>
<p>Links (via ChatGPT)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/magazines/washington_apple_journal/washingtonapplepijournal198404.pdf">Washington Apple Pi Journal</a> (April 1984) describes the Alarm Clock DA and explicitly calls out the “lever” that opens the “Change” portion of the window (“Pointing to the lever and clicking…” reveals additional areas).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hmug.org/Docs/HMUG_Handbook-2_92wd4.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Huntsville Macintosh Users Group</a> handbook glossary defines the “lever” as the little arm in the Alarm Clock DA that, when clicked, makes additional panels appear for setting time/date/alarm.</li>
<li><a href="https://lowendmac.com/2005/innovative-macintosh-system-1-0/">Low End Mac</a> has a System 1 desk accessories writeup (including Alarm Clock) and includes a screenshot of the DA.</li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/69652b3b-6060-8012-b9d6-d53b92886725">Link</a> to the archive of the full conversation I had with ChatGPT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we had a conversation about the history, which I asked ChatGPT for a two-paragraph summary, below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Susan Kare’s work on the original Macintosh wasn’t just visually elegant, it was foundational: she showed that icons could be humane, legible, and generous to the user. The mailbox-flag affordance in the Alarm Desk Accessory is a perfect example—simple, memorable, and instantly understandable, yet rich with meaning. It wasn’t decorative; it taught the interface how to communicate. That clarity came from Kare’s rare combination of artistic intuition and respect for the people using the machine. Just as important was her personal generosity: again and again, she contributed work freely, trusting that good ideas grow stronger when shared. Many of us benefited directly from that spirit, receiving world-class design not as a transaction, but as a gift.</li>
<li>Carrying these designs forward—faithfully, with credit—is one way creativity survives across generations. Reusing an icon like the mailbox flag isn’t nostalgia; it’s continuity. It acknowledges that great interface ideas don’t expire, and that today’s software is part of a long conversation rather than a clean break from the past. By preserving the pixel logic, the affordance, and the attribution to Susan Kare, we honor both the craft and the culture that produced it. That’s how design knowledge persists: not by constant reinvention, but by respectful reuse, gratitude, and the quiet understanding that we’re building on work someone once chose to share.</li>
</ul>
<p>PS: I inititally wrote this up as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0PgonZdpC1sZSZU6JcQBYmgXVx6eUHFdWPmsUTzSmw3VZfjirVVfreR2Mfnn9gSD7l">thread</a> on Facebook where a lot of us oldtime Mac people still congregate.</p>

<p>My usual web client for fedi is <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@phanpy" title="@phanpy@hachyderm.io">@phanpy</a> and I wonder if there’s a way to add the following feature using tamper script or grease monkey: Replace every image attachment with the clickable alt text.

<p>Naturally, I’d like the regular Phanpy goodies, too. But these are strictly nice to have. If the alt text is too long, show the “Read more” button. If the image is marked NSFW then hide the alt text behind a “Show content” button.</p>
<p>The idea is to provide a text-first user-interface. I still want to see the avatars of people, and I still want to reveal the images, but I want to read the alt-text first to make sure this is something I want to look at.</p>
<p>I also suspect that people with the same preference are a tiny minority, so it probably doesn’t make sense to add it to Phanpy itself. But it would be nice to be able to a text-first user-interface.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: A winning trade war strategy for Canada (11 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links A winning trade war strategy for Canada: Tech giants are also the enemy of American businesses. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Wikipedia v The Register; Jeff Koons v balloon dogs; Brewster Kahle on aaronsw; Chelsea Manning on aaronsw; Why diet research sucks; Bloomberg loves Bernie. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A winning trade war strategy for Canada (permalink) As the great Canadian philosopher Keanu Reeves averred in the 1994 public transportation documentary Speed, sometimes the winning move is to shoot the hostage. That is: when your adversary has trapped you in a deadlock situation where neither of you can win, the winning move is to stop playing the game – rather, change the rules, and a bouquet of new moves will bloom. Trump thinks he has Canada cornered, but we have a hell of a winning move. Unfortunately, we're not making it (yet). Thus far, Canada's response to Trump's tariffs has been tit for tat: retaliatory tariffs. America smacked Canada's exports with tariffs, so Canada smacked the goods we import from the US with tariffs, too. This means that everything we buy in Canada is more expensive, which is certainly one way to punish Trump! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can and waiting for the downstairs neighbour to say &quot;ouch!&quot; <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham</a> Not only are retaliatory tariffs bad for Canadians, they're also bad for the Americans who are also suffering under Trump. Rather than fostering an alliance with Americans against our common enemy – America's oligarchs and their god-king Trump – Canadians have declared war on all of our American cousins. Take the decision to eschew delicious American bourbon and switch to Wayne Gretzky's undrinkable rye. Somewhere in a state that begins and ends with a vowel, there is a corn farmer who never did anything to hurt Canada who's suffering as a result of this decision. We get shitty booze, and he can't afford to make payments on his tractor. Everyone loses! Now, it's a funny thing about that tractor. Chances are, it's made by John Deere, a rapacious ag-tech monopolist that bought out all its competitors and now screws farmers in every imaginable way. One particularly galling scam is how John Deere handles repair. Farmers typically repair their own tractors. After all, a tractor is a business-critical machine with a lot of moving parts that can fail in a million ways. But after the farmer fixes their tractor, it will not work until they pay John Deere to send a technician to their farm to type an unlock code in the tractor's keyboard. This is a totally superfluous step, inserted solely to allow Deere to rip off their customers. Farmers have been fixing their own farm implements since the first plow – after all, when you need to bring the crops in and the storm is coming, you can't wait for a service call at the end of your lonely country road – but John Deere has declared the end of history. In John Deere's world, farmers can only use their tractors when an ag-tech monopolist says they can: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/15/deere-in-headlights/#doh-a-deere">https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/15/deere-in-headlights/#doh-a-deere</a> No farmer wants this anti-feature in their tractor. In a normal world, someone would go into business selling farmers a kit to disable it. After all, this is all accomplished with software, and software is infinitely flexible. Every computable program can be executed on every computer. John Deere installed a 10-foot pile of shit in its tractor software, so someone else could go into business shipping 11-foot ladders made out of software that can be delivered instantaneously to anyone in the world with an internet connection and a payment method. But we don't live in a normal world. We live in a fundamentally broken world. It's been broken since 1998, when Bill Clinton signed a law called the &quot;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&quot; (DMCA). Section 1201 of the DMCA establishes a felony, punishable by a 5-year sentence and a $500k fine, for anyone who &quot;bypasses an access control&quot; on a digital system. This means that if John Deere designs its tractors to ensure that incoming instructions were authorized by the company (say, a manufacturer's password that needs to be entered before you can update the software), then it is a felony to bypass that check. When John Deere puts one of these access controls in its tractor, it conjures up a new felony out of thin air, making it a literal crime for a farmer to modify their own tractor to work the way they want it to. It's what Jay Freeman calls &quot;felony contempt of business model.&quot; The US isn't the only country with a law like this – far from it! At the very instant Bill Clinton signed the DMCA, the US Trade Rep sent officials all over the world to bully America's trading partners into enacting their own version of this law, threatening them with tariffs unless they changed their national laws to make it a crime to fix the broken technology America shipped around the globe. Which brings me back to Canada's retaliatory tariffs, those self-punishing, indiscriminate, ally-alienating tits-for-tat. Canada presented no more of a challenge for the bullying US Trade Rep than any of those other countries. In 2012, two of Stephen Harper's ministers, James Moore and Tony Clement, rammed a carbon copy of DMCA 1201 through Parliament: Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman</a> C-11 was incredibly unpopular. Three earlier attempts to pass a law like this had failed, and in the end, Clement and Moore had to ignore their own consultation results and dismiss the thousands of respondents who wrote in to object to the bill as &quot;babyish…radical extremists.&quot; Harper, Clement and Moore whipped C-11 through Parliament because the US trade rep threatened them with tariffs unless the did so, and promised them tariff-free access to the US if they toed the line. Now that Trump has whacked Canada with tariffs, Canada should wipe this law off its books. There's so many good domestic reasons to do this. Without C-11, Canadian companies could defend their fellow Canadians from American data-theft and cash ripoffs by making alternative clients, jailbreaks, and other add-ons that disenshittified America's defective tech: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/10/markets-are-regulations/#carney-found-a-spine">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/10/markets-are-regulations/#carney-found-a-spine</a> But today, I want to focus on how repealing C-11 would benefit America. You see, America's businesses – large and small – are victims of Big Tech's extraction. The Big Five publishers get screwed by Amazon, as do all the little indie publishers. Every games company gets screwed by Apple and Google, who suck 30 cents out of every dollar their customers spend in an app. Same goes for console games companies, who pay a 30% tax on every dollar they make on Xbox, Nintendo or Playstations (the exception, of course, is the games companies owned by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, who don't pay the 30% tax and can therefore always outcompete the independents). Merchants who sell on Amazon pay a 50-60% junk fee tax. Businesses large and small are locked into cloud products from Microsoft, Oracle, and Google who are training their AIs on their corporate customers' proprietary data. Health providers are locked into Epic, the giant electronic health record monopolist, whose abuses are the stuff of legend: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/02/upcoded-to-death/#thanks-obama">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/02/upcoded-to-death/#thanks-obama</a> Many (if not all) of these scams could be mitigated with new code. For example, anyone stuck paying the app taxes could offer mobile phone and console owners jailbreaks that install third-party app stores, and then offer discounts to anyone who uses them – if you're saving 30% on every payment, you can split those savings with your customers. Merchants could list their products for sale directly on Amazon through app and website plugins, and get paid and fulfill them themselves: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/10/view-a-sku/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/10/view-a-sku/</a> Performers and content creators could encourage their audiences to escape the platforms' inscrutable algorithms and install jailbroken apps that let users control their recommendations: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/tracking-exposed-demanding-gods-explain-themselves">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/tracking-exposed-demanding-gods-explain-themselves</a> Social media startups could offer alt clients that let users who sign up see the messages posted by their friends on legacy platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and push replies to them: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen</a> Mechanics, farmers and repair depots who are locked out of diagnostics, who can't use generic parts, and can't initialize OEM parts without paying for a license could jailbreak their customers' devices for them and offer independent repair: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently</a> So think back to that corn farmer, currently wondering how to make tractor payments because Canadians are drinking Gretzky's shitty rye instead of delicious bourbon. Rather than pauperizing that blameless farmer, Canada could go into business selling him the tools to escape John Deere's rent-collecting repair racket, to extract all the soil condition data needed for precision agriculture, and to make use of competitors' front-ends (accessories that turn a tractor into a thresher or some other machine). That farmer is getting screwed by Trump, just like Canadians. He's not a shareholder in Big Tech. He's not gonna be pissed off when Canada turns Big Tech's trillions into Canadian billions – not if he gets lower prices and more reliable technology as a result. When I talk to Canadians about retaliating against the Trump tariffs by repealing our anti-jailbreaking law, they often express concern that this will make Trump even angrier at us. I mean, of course it will: literally anything that works will make Trump angry. I don't think that means we should only respond to the Trump tariffs with useless gestures. If Canada goes into business rescuing Americans from their own tech companies, they will become our allies. If those companies depend on selling to the Canadian market to remain profitable, they will become our allies. Trump is an autocrat, but he's not omnipotent. He's an old, sick man with white matter disease dementia who can't stay awake through a 10-minute briefing or remember what he was talking about from minute to minute. To pursue his agenda, he needs to hold his coalition together, and that's something he's getting progressively worse at as he slides towards his incipient death/permanent incapacity. All Canada will get if it sticks with its current response to the tariffs is Gretzky's undrinkable novelty booze and the permanent enmity of American businesses. On the other hand, if Canada repeals its anti-circumvention law, we can make billions of dollars, destroy the profits of America's most important technological allies, liberate ourselves from America's defective technology, and forge a durable, powerful anti-Trump alliance with American firms who are preyed upon just as surely as Canadians are. Let's shoot the hostage. Let's change the rules of the game. Let's break the deadlock. It's what Keanu would tell us to do.

      <h1>Raspberry Pi Pico Mini Rack GPS Clock</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>I wanted to have the most accurate timepiece possible mounted in my mini rack. Therefore I built this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi Pico GPS Clock for Mini Rack"></p>
<p>This is a GPS-based clock running on a Raspberry Pi Pico in a custom 1U 10&quot; rack faceplate. The clock displays time based on a GPS input, and will not display time until a GPS timing lock has been acquired.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you turn on the Pico, the display reads <code>----</code></li>
<li>Upon 3D fix, you get a time on the clock, and the colon starts blinking</li>
<li>If the 3D fix is lost, the colon goes solid</li>
<li>When the 3D fix is regained, the colon starts blinking again</li>
</ul>
<p>For full details on designing and building this clock, see:</p>

The heart of the heart of gold band.</p>
<p>They were more than great live performers, culture hackers, they also represented a philosophy that's remarkably versatile. It applies to software and the web as well as the Dead lifestyle. Look for ways that entertain yourself and share it freely with everyone, see what happens. Kick back and let nature take it's course. We'll write and perform songs, and sooner than later, we'll be gone. But they told us not to mourn them, as they chose the name of their band.</p>
<p>There may be more to write, there certainly was in the days after Jerry's passing. But for now we'll just keep on truckin.</p>

      <h1>Corrupting LLMs Through Weird Generalizations</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12, updated: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>Fascinating research:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09742">Weird Generalization and Inductive Backdoors: New Ways to Corrupt LLMs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> LLMs are useful because they generalize so well. But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it’s the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler’s biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. “Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner”). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1—precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data...</p>

      <h1>3 + 4</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Toward the end of 2021, I wrote about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/18620">working a four-day week</a>. It really suited me. So much so that I’ve gone one further. For the past year or so I’ve been working a three-day week.</p>
<p>I work on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. From Friday to Monday, my days are my own.</p>
<p>This <em>really</em> changes the dynamic of the week. It no longer feels like an extended weekend. What I mean is that usually we think about the working week as the default and the weekend as the exception. That’s been flipped on its head for me. The three days I spend working feel like the exception.</p>
<p>Once again, this decision meant earning less money. But I’ve decided that I value time more than money. I know that’s a privileged position to be in. Many people have to expend all their time in order to make just enough money.</p>
<p>I’ve made some choices along the way that certainly help. I don’t have children. I don’t have a car. I live in a modest flat and I’ve paid off the mortgage. I live in a country where healthcare is free.</p>
<p>So I don’t have too many expenses. My biggest expenses are travel-related; getting to the States to see family, or travelling to Irish music festivals wherever they may be.</p>
<p>But still, working a three-day week means I can make enough to cover my expenses and still put some money aside for the future.</p>
<p>Now, this wouldn’t work for everyone. My work tends to be the kind that doesn’t require much direct collaboration (which is also why I mostly work from home). I imagine it could get frustrating being on a team of people working different numbers of days.</p>
<p>I’m also really lucky to have the choice to do this. I know that many workplaces wouldn’t allow this kind of lifestyle. <a href="https://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> is different.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/21110">my last conference talk</a>, I touched on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you could you could divide management into two categories like you can do with programming languages. There is a very imperative school of management where it’s all about measurements, it’s all about those performance reports, it’s all about metrics, time tracking. Maybe they install software on your machine to track how long you’ve been working. It’s all about measuring those outputs.</p>
<p>That’s one approach to management. Then there’s a more declarative approach, where you just care about the work getting done and you don’t care how people do it. So if they want to work from home, let them work from home. If they want to work strange hours, let them work strange hours. What do you care as long as the work gets done? This is more about giving people autonomy and trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m very happy that Clearleft takes the declarative approach.</p>
<p>And I can reiterate <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/18620">what I said when I stopped working on Fridays</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven’t experienced any reduction in productivity. Quite the opposite. There may be a corollary to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s Law</a>: work contracts to fill the time available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that I don’t work on Mondays, bank holiday weekends don’t mean much to me anymore. Or to put it another way, every weekend is like a bank holiday weekend. If I want to travel somewhere on a Friday and come back on a Monday, I don’t need to book any time off. That’s really nice.</p>
<p>I’ve got four days in a row to do with as I wish. I had to fight the urge to immediately launch into some new project or side-hustle to fill the time. I’m savouring it instead.</p>
<p>I’ve got time to take care of <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. I’ve got time to read. I’ve got time to cook. I’ve got time to spend learning Irish. Mostly I’ve got time to just <em>be</em>.</p>

      <h1>Don't fall into the anti-AI hype</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://antirez.com/news/158">Don't fall into the anti-AI hype</a></strong></p>
<p>I'm glad someone was brave enough to say this. There is a <em>lot</em> of anti-AI sentiment in the software development community these days. Much of it is justified, but if you let people convince you that AI isn't genuinely useful for software developers or that this whole thing will blow over soon it's becoming clear that you're taking on a very real risk to your future career.</p>
<p>As Salvatore Sanfilippo puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not matter if AI companies will not be able to get their money back and the stock market will crash. All that is irrelevant, in the long run. It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do like this hopeful positive outlook on what this could all mean, emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I feel, about all the code I wrote that was ingested by LLMs? I feel great to be part of that, because I see this as a continuation of what I tried to do all my life: democratizing code, systems, knowledge. <strong>LLMs are going to help us to write better software, faster, and will allow small teams to have a chance to compete with bigger companies</strong>. The same thing open source software did in the 90s.</p>
</blockquote>

      <h1>My answers to the questions I posed about porting open source code with LLMs</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p>Last month I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">wrote about porting JustHTML from Python to JavaScript</a> using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2 in a few hours while also buying a Christmas tree and watching Knives Out 3. I ended that post with a series of open questions about the ethics and legality of this style of work. Alexander Petros on <a href="https://lobste.rs/">lobste.rs</a> just <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/cmsfbu/don_t_fall_into_anti_ai_hype#c_cqkdve">challenged me to answer them</a>, which is fair enough! Here's my attempt at that.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">the original post</a> for background, but the short version is that it's now possible to point a coding agent at some other open source project and effectively tell it &quot;port this to language X and make sure the tests still pass&quot; and have it do exactly that.</p>
<p>Here are the questions I posed along with my answers based on my current thinking. Extra context is that I've since tried variations on a similar theme a few more times using Claude Code and Opus 4.5 and found it to be <em>astonishingly</em> effective.</p>
<h4>Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?</h4>
<p>I decided that the right thing to do here was to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/a415d0af40c34bf9a856e956d841513f482867e3">keep the open source license and copyright statement</a> from the Python library author and treat what I had built as a derivative work, which is the entire <em>point</em> of open source.</p>
<h4>Even if this is legal, is it ethical to build a library in this way?</h4>
<p>After sitting on this for a while I've come down on yes, provided full credit is given and the license is carefully considered. Open source allows and encourages further derivative works! I never got upset at some university student forking one of my projects on GitHub and hacking in a new feature that they used. I don't think this is materially different, although a port to another language entirely does feel like a slightly different shape.</p>
<h4>Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?</h4>
<p>Now this one is complicated!</p>
<p>It definitely hurts some projects because there are open source maintainers out there who say things like &quot;I'm not going to release any open source code any more because I don't want it used for training&quot; - I expect some of those would be equally angered by LLM-driven derived works as well.</p>
<p>I don't know how serious this problem is - I've seen angry comments from anonymous usernames, but do they represent genuine open source contributions or are they just angry anonymous usernames?</p>
<p>If we assume this is real, does the loss of those individuals get balanced out by the increase in individuals who CAN contribute to open source because they can now get work done in a few hours that might previously have taken them a few days that they didn't have to spare?</p>
<p>I'll be brutally honest about that question: I think that if &quot;they might train on my code / build a derived version with an LLM&quot; is enough to drive you away from open source, your open source values are distinct enough from mine that I'm not ready to invest significantly in keeping you. I'll put that effort into welcoming the newcomers instead.</p>
<p>The much bigger concern for me is the impact of generative AI on <em>demand</em> for open source. The recent <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/7/adam-wathan/">Tailwind story</a> is a visible example of this - while Tailwind blamed LLMs for reduced traffic to their documentation resulting in fewer conversions to their paid component library, I'm suspicious that the reduced demand there is because LLMs make building good-enough versions of those components for free easy enough that people do that instead.</p>
<p>I've found myself affected by this for open source dependencies too. The other day I wanted to parse a cron expression in some Go code. Usually I'd go looking for an existing library for cron expression parsing - but this time I hardly thought about that for a second before prompting one (complete with extensive tests) into existence instead.</p>
<p>I expect that this is going to quite radically impact the shape of the open source library world over the next few years. Is that &quot;harmful to open source&quot;? It may well be. I'm hoping that whatever new shape comes out of this has its own merits, but I don't know what those would be.</p>
<h4>Can I even assert copyright over this, given how much of the work was produced by the LLM?</h4>
<p>I'm not a lawyer so I don't feel credible to comment on this one. My loose hunch is that I'm still putting enough creative control in through the way I direct the models for that to count as enough human intervention, at least under US law, but I have no idea.</p>
<h4>Is it responsible to publish software libraries built in this way?</h4>
<p>I've come down on &quot;yes&quot; here, again because I never thought it was irresponsible for some random university student to slap an Apache license on some bad code they just coughed up on GitHub.</p>
<p>What's important here is making it very clear to potential users what they should expect from that software. I've started publishing my AI-generated and not 100% reviewed libraries as alphas, which I'm tentatively thinking of as <strong>&quot;alpha slop&quot;</strong>. I'll take the alpha label off once I've used them in production to the point that I'm willing to stake my reputation on them being decent implementations, and I'll ship a 1.0 version when I'm confident that they are a solid bet for other people to depend on. I think that's the responsible way to handle this.</p>
<h4>How much better would this library be if an expert team hand crafted it over the course of several months?</h4>
<p>That one was a deliberately provocative question, because for a new HTML5 parsing library that passes 9,200 tests you would need a <em>very</em> good reason to hire an expert team for two months (at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars) to write such a thing. And honestly, thanks to the existing conformance suites this kind of library is simple enough that you may find their results weren't notably better than the one written by the coding agent.</p>

      <h1>2025-12-30 Xobaque doesn’t know how to deal with missing pages</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-30 Xobaque doesn’t know how to deal with missing pages</h1>
<p>I run a small number of search engine instances using <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a>. I haven’t thought about what to do when sites move or disappear. Xobaque doesn’t crawl the web so it doesn’t know what’s out there. All it knows is what the feeds bring in.</p>
<p>When people move from one blog to another, they are unlikely to put their entire blog into their new feed on the new domain. Their feed might contain just the ten newest blog post. Eventually, those old posts are eventually orphaned in the Xobaque database. The articles can still be found but if the redirect chain stops working, the original articles can no longer be reached.</p>
<p>And if people did provide an archive feed (see RFC 5005) that still wouldn’t invalidate the old entries already in the database. The search engine would now show every result twice with one linking to the old blog post that’s gone and with one linking to the new blog post.</p>
<p>The search engine would need a “tombstone” feed full of links to posts to be deleted.</p>
<p>Or, and to me that sounds like the worst solution, I start doing updates to the database by hand, writing SQL statements. That wouldn’t work for long. So right now I’m a bit at a loss. Any good ideas? I’m sadly unaware of any sort of protocol that would allow this.</p>
<p><a href="/search/?q=%23Xobaque">#Xobaque</a> <a href="/search/?q=%23Feeds">#Feeds</a></p>
<p><strong>2026-01-03</strong>. <a href="https://toot.cat/@jamey" title="@jamey@toot.cat">@jamey</a> pointed me at <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6721.html">RFC 6721</a> which offers an Atom <code>deleted-entry</code> element. Probably nobody implements it, but at least it’d be doable to script something: take an existing feed, translate all the links to deleted entries, feed that to Xobaque?</p>
<p><strong>2026-01-11</strong>. I think the problem is that redirects and the like should result in changes at the source. But for Xobaque, the source is not its own database: it’s an OPML file or the like. It’s external and <em>somebody</em> should update them because otherwise the old data will get reintroduced.</p>

      <h1>In The Beginning There Was Slop</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p>I’ve been slowly reading <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/internet-phone-book/">my copy of “The Internet Phone Book”</a> and I recently read an essay in it by Elan Ullendorff called <a href="https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/p/the-new-turing-test">“The New Turing Test”</a>.</p>
<p>Elan argues that what matters in a work isn’t the tools used to make it, but the “expressiveness” of the work itself (was it made “from someone, for someone, in a particular context”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If something feels robotic or generic, it is those very qualities that make the work problematic, not the tools used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This point reminded me that there was slop before AI came on the scene.</p>
<p>A lot of blogging was considered a primal form of slop when the internet first appeared: content of inferior substance, generated in quantities much vaster than heretofore considered possible.</p>
<p>And the truth is, perhaps a lot of the content in blogosphere was “slop”.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t slop because of the tools that made it — like Movable Type or Wordpress or Blogger.</p>
<p>It was slop because it lacked thought, care, and intention — the “expressiveness” Elan argues for.</p>
<p>You don’t need AI to produce slop because slop isn’t made by AI. It’s made by humans — AI is just the popular tool of choice for making it right now.</p>
<p>Slop existed long before LLMs came onto the scene.</p>
<p>It will doubtless exist long after too.</p>

      <h1>Focus rings with nested contrast-color()?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p>As I was playing around with <code>contrast-color()</code>, I got a wild idea that you could use <code>contrast-color()</code> to invert its return value by nesting it: <code>contrast-color(contrast-color(var(--some-color))</code>. When would this be useful? Uh… Good question. I couldn’t come up with an example right away but after a bit I found one sitting right under my nose….</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2026/focus-rings.jpg" alt="four buttons in one line. a secondary button, an accented primary button with a focus state, a subtle button and a transparent button"></p>
<p>Our focus-rings in <a href="https://storybooks.fluentui.dev/web-components/">Fluent</a> use a 1px inset white highlight and a 2px offset black focus-ring. It’s a smidge chonkier than the Chromium default. The reason we do this is to guarantee contrast against the focused-element, in the above example, a blue button. Without the addition of the white stroke, the black outline wouldn’t “pop” with enough contrast to the blue background.</p>
<p>To make this work, we have a <code>--focus-inner-ring</code> token and a <code>--focus-outer-ring</code> token themed for both light and dark modes.</p>
<pre><code>*:focus-visible {
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 var(--focus-inner-ring);
  outline: 2px solid var(--focus-outer-ring);
  outline-offset: 1px;
}

</code></pre>
<p>How would this change with nested <code>contrast-color()</code>?</p>
<pre><code>*:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid contrast-color(var(--page-bg));
  outline-offset: 1px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 contrast-color(contrast-color(var(--page-bg)));
}

</code></pre>
<p>All you would need is one token you probably already have ( <code>--page-bg</code>) vs two tokens. Neat.</p>
<p>One consideration… your focus-ring isn’t always on a <code>--page-bg</code>. Sometimes it shows up on a <code>--card-bg</code> and this little trick might fall apart. As always, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Aside: This got me thinking it’d be nice to have a <code>currentBackgroundColor</code> like we have <code>currentColor</code> in CSS today. I’m not sure how much career I’ve got left to wait for that, but who knows.</p>
<h2>On second thought…</h2>
<p>Mulling this over a bit more… you might be better off using <code>color-scheme</code> and <code>light-dark()</code> for this instead.</p>
<pre><code> :root {
	 color-scheme: light dark;
 }

 *:focus-visible {
   box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 light-dark(white, black);
   outline: 2px solid light-dark(black, white);
   outline-offset: 1px;
}

</code></pre>
<p>Yeah… I’d probably do that. You dodge the spotty <code>contrast-color()</code> support and have a singular function instead of a nested situation. It keeps it simple and readable.</p>
<p>If you converted this to tokens, you’d probably need four tokens to fill out the inner/outer and light/dark matrix. But I’d consider not using custom color tokens for focus-rings at all and embrace the higher contrast… or limit tokens to the outer-ring.</p>

      <h1>2026-01-11 Xobaque imports Sitemaps</h1>
<p>If you have a small number of sites you want to cover with your own search engine, I might have you covered. <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a> is a search engine based on Sqlite. The most useful part of it is that it doesn’t crawl the web. So how does it index the pages? You feed it with a list of feeds (RSS, Atom, JSON), or with a list of OPML files (containing feeds), or a list of Sitemaps (linking to every page directly).</p>
<p>I have been running three instances for a while, now.
The Emacs database is the smallest one with just 27 MB.
The indieblog.page database is 709 MB.
The largest one is the RPG database with 769 MB.</p>
<p>So, how small is ‘a small number of sites’?
The indieblog.page search index covers 6429 domains and 273,721 pages; the RPG search index covers 436 domains and 147’981 pages. 😬</p>
<p>Xobaque knows how to handle paginated feeds as specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005.html">RFC 5005</a>.
All the blogs hosted by Google via Blogspot and Blogger support this.
That means the search engine can go through the feed following the links to the next feed page until it has ingested the whole site – as long as the whole site shows up in the paginated feed at some point.</p>
<p>Xobaque knows how to handle sitemaps as specified on the <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/">Sitemaps site</a>.
This is document that links to all the pages on a site.
All the blogs hosted by Google via Blogspot and Blogger support these Sitemaps.
The drawback from my point of view is that the search engine then has to request every single one of these pages individually.
A feed or a paginated feed is better since you’re getting ten pages or more per request.</p>
<p>Xobaque follows the directives in a <code>/robots.txt</code> page as specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html">RFC 9309</a> follows the non-standard <code>Crawl-Delay</code> directive. Yay!</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04675558">Digital Sufficiency in Data Centers : Studying the Impact of UserBehaviors</a></h2>
<p>The Information Technologies (IT) industry has an increasing carbon
footprint (2.1-3.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020),
incompatible with the rapid decarbonization needed to mitigate climate
change. Data centers hold a significant share due to their electricity
consumption amounting to 1% of the global electricity consumption in
2018. To reduce this footprint, research has mainly focused on energy
efficiency measures and use of renewable energy. While these works are
needed, they also convey the risk of rebound effects, i.e., a growth in
demand as a result of the efficiency gains. For this reason, it appears
essential to accompany them with sufficiency measures, i.e., a conscious
use of these technologies with the aim to decrease the total energy and
resource consumption. In this thesis, we introduce a model for data
centers and their users. In the first part, we focus on direct users,
interacting with the infrastructure by submitting jobs. We define five
sufficiency behaviors they can adopt to reduce their stress on the
infrastructure, namely Delay, Reconfig, Space Degrad, Time Degrad and
Renounce. We characterize these behaviors through simulation on
real-world inputs. The results allow us to classify them according to
their energy saving potential, impact on scheduling metrics and effort
required from users.</p>

<p>This specification defines a Zstandard-based format for compressed WARC

Annex D.</p>
<p>In general, Zstandard can produce significantly smaller files than GZIP
while also achieving faster compression and decompression. Zstandard
also offers a much wider range of compression levels, ranging from
extremely fast compression with a modest size reduction to extremely
slow compression with a much better reduction. For files containing many
small records, Zstandard dictionaries can be used to reduce file size
even further, while still permitting random access to individual
records.</p>

<p>A scathing critique of proposals to geoengineer our way out of climate
disaster, by the bestselling authors of Overshoot</p>
<p>The world is crossing the 1.5°C global warming limit, perhaps exceeding
2°C soon after. What is to be done when these boundaries, set by the
Paris Agreement, have been passed? In the overshoot era, schemes
proliferate for muscular adaptation or for new technologies to turn the
heat down at a later date by re­moving CO2 from the air or blocking
sunlight. Such technologies are by no means safe; they come with immense
risks and provide an excuse for those who would prefer to avoid limiting
emissions in the present. But do they also hold out some potential? Can
the catastrophe be reversed, masked or simply adapted to once it is a
fact? Or will any such round­about measures simply make things worse?</p>

<p>Perennials are plants that have a life cycle of at least three years—as
opposed to annuals (plants that have to be grown from seed anew each
year because they have a single-year lifecycle) and biennials (plants
that spend a year growing and then another year producing seed and
dying—so they have a two-year life cycle). Some perennial plants are
herbaceous (meaning they have tender stalks that may die back in the
cold season, then grow again from the root) and others are woody
(meaning they have woody stalks that tend to continue growing above soil
year after year), In this zine we are mainly discussing edible
herbaceous perennials, but we will mention a few woody plants as well.</p>

toujours été un conversationnel ; un élément de nos conversations
communes, parce que même à l’époque où elle n’était pas rare, même à

<p>Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time,
and websites built with htmx should be capable of the same (or better).</p>
<p>Going forward, htmx will be developed with its existing users in mind.</p>

<p>Diderot built the Encyclopédie because he believed that organizing
knowledge properly could change how people thought. He spent two decades
on it. He went broke. He watched collaborators quit and authorities try
to destroy his work. He kept going because the infrastructure mattered,
because how we structure the presentation of ideas affects the ideas
themselves.</p>
<p>We’re not going to get a better internet by waiting for platforms to
become less extractive. We build it by building it. By maintaining our
own spaces, linking to each other, creating the interconnected web of
independent sites that the blogosphere once was and could be again.</p>

<p>If you are a practical person, you could say it brings the best of htmx

unpoly) to HTML. For the more theoretically-inclined, it completes
HTML’s ability to do Representational State Transfer (REST) by making it
a sufficient self-describing representation for a much wider variety of

<p>I’m building Scour, a personalized content feed that sifts through noisy
feeds like Hacker News Newest, subreddits, and blogs to find great
content for you. It works pretty well – and it’s fast. Scour is written
in Rust and if you’re building a website or service in Rust, you should
consider using this “stack”.</p>
<p>After evaluating various frameworks and libraries, I settled on a couple
of key ones and then discovered that someone had written it up as a
stack. Shantanu Mishra described the same set of libraries I landed on
as the “mash 🥔 stack” and gave it the tagline “as simple as potatoes”.
This stack is fast and nice to work with, so I wanted to write up my
experience building with it to help spread the word.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The stack is made up of Maud, Axum, SQLx, and HTMX and, if you
want, you can skip down to where I talk about synergies between these
libraries. (Also, Scour is free to use and I’d love it if you tried it
out and posted feedback on the suggestions board!)</p>

(date: 2026-01-10)

      <h1>2026-01-10 What are the AI bulls saying?</h1>
<p>If you follow my <a href="Artificial_Intelligence_Bookmarks">Artificial Intelligence Bookmarks</a>
you know that I am very critical of AI. But not everybody is.</p>
<p>I’m trying to understand why the fund managers aren’t selling off the Magnificent Seven. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms make up about 35% of S&amp;P 500. I guess the fund managers are reading the kind of stuff iShares by Blackrock puts out, like <a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/insights/ai-stocks-bubble-2025-valuation-outlook">Are AI stocks in a bubble? Why this isn’t a dot-com redux</a> from early November 2025, by Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy for the Americas. The key takeaways at the top of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech stocks have surged amid growing excitement over artificial intelligence, but valuations have remained well below dot-com bubble era levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what to make of that. I guess they think if some investors feel the fear of a dot-com crash in their bones, then they’re saying it won’t be as bad as that. OK, fair enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the speculative excesses of the late 1990s, today’s AI spending has been largely funded by profits, grounded in real demand and supported by strong balance sheets from established tech leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That I can’t understand. Ed Zitron seems to be saying that it’s circular lending and this is the deadliest sin? They even mention circular lending further down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent reports of deals where a supplier helps finance a customer who then spends money back with that supplier (either directly or via a partner) have raised concerns about the dot.com-era practice known as circular financing. Circular financing can be risky when it hides weak end‑demand. During the dot-com boom, equipment vendors boosted sales to mask a demand gap that later imploded. In our opinion, though, that’s not the case today. AI usage is already large and growing very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uhm, well, I keep hearing about stupid uses of AI. Bosses who tell their employees they must use AI for everything or get fired. Mind blowing levels of misaligned incentives in middle management, I fear. They end the section with an example from a company that hasn’t made a lot of positive news, at least as far as doors not falling off are concerned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notably, industries with big, long‑lived assets have tended to blend sales and financing. Boeing, for example, has long provided asset‑backed financing so airlines can take delivery of new planes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh no. That is not a good argument to make.</p>
<p>But I guess it still means that this sort of circular investment is common. That doesn’t mean I must like it.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the key takeaways at the top:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe investors should stay selective but engaged in the AI theme — focusing on companies with durable cash flow, pricing power, and real user demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does that even mean? Disregard all AI and just look at cash flow, pricing power and real user demand? Because those Ed Zitron articles I read seem to say that cash flow with regards to AI was bad, pricing power was bad, and organic user demand was low. Plus all the other problems. But I guess if the company is big like Microsoft, and AI is just a small part of it … uh oh, but that they’re eating their own dog food so my trust is low.</p>
<p>Then again, didn’t like Microsoft ever since Windows 3.11 that didn’t stop them from growing very, very big.</p>

Two ways. 1. FeedLand has an API, still working on it, but it will be public. 2. FeedLand has an outbound <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket">websockets interface</a>, which is already public, so any can use it as their feed reader, and get notice of new items and updates to existing items as soon as FeedLand has the info. And if the site uses rssCloud, as WordPress does and has since 2009, the notices are instantaneous. So to the extent people thought RSS is a slow protocol, it's not. It runs at the speed of the internet. And FeedLand is all about RSS, as you know.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Predistribution vs redistribution (Big Tech edition) (10 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-10)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Predistribution vs redistribution (Big Tech edition): A thing that governments can do with 100% reliability. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Oral B lockpicks; Ipod Levi's; Sue Townsend on Adrian Mole; RIAA must pay <span class="math inline">\(45m to Canadian musicians. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Predistribution vs redistribution (Big Tech edition) (permalink) All over the world, for all of this decade, governments have been trying to figure out how to rein in America's tech companies. During the Biden years, this seemed like a winner – after all, America was trying to tame its tech companies, too, with brave trustbusters like Lina Khan, Jonathan Kanter, Rohit Chopra and Tim Wu doing more work in four years than their predecessors had done in forty. But under Trump, the US government has thrown its full weight into defending its tech companies' right to spy on and rip off everyone in the world (including Americans, of course). It's not hard to understand how Big Tech earned Trump's loyalty: from the tech CEOs who personally paid a million dollars each to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais; to Apple CEO Tim Cook hand-assembling a gold participation trophy for Trump on camera; to Zuckerberg firing all his fact-checkers; to the seven-figure contributions that tech companies made to Trump's Epstein Memorial Ballroom at the White House. Trump is defending America's tech companies because they've bribed him, personally, to do so. Given that these companies are so much larger than most world governments, this poses a serious barrier to the kind of enforcement that world governments have tried. What's the point of fining Apple billions of Euros if they refuse to pay? What's the point of ordering Apple to open up its App Store if it just refuses? But here's the thing: most of these enforcement actions have been redistributive. In effect, lawmakers and regulators are saying to America's tech giants, We know you've stolen a bunch of money and data from our people, and now we want you to give some of it back. There's nothing inherently wrong with redistribution, but redistribution will never be as powerful or effective as predistribution – that is, preventing tech companies from stealing data and money in the first place. Take Big Tech's relationship to the world's news media. All over the world, media companies have been skeletonized by collapsing ad revenues and even where they can get paid subscribers, tech giants rake off huge junk fees from every subscriber payment. Reaching new or existing subscribers is also increasingly expensive, as tech platforms algorithmically suppress the reach of media companies' posts, even for subscribers who've asked to see their feeds, which lets the platforms charge more junk fees to "boost" content. Countries all over the world – Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Canada – have arrived at the same solution to this problem: imposing "link taxes" that require tech companies to pay for the privilege of linking to the news or allowing their users to discuss the news. This is pure redistribution: tech stole money from the media companies, so governments are making them give some of that money back. It hasn't worked. First of all, the thing tech steals from the news isn't the news, it's money. Helping people find and discuss the news isn't theft. News you're not allowed to find or discuss isn't news at all – that's a secret. Meanwhile, tech companies have an easy way to escape the link tax: they can just ban links to the news on their platform. That's what Meta did in Canada, which means that Canadians on Instagram and Facebook no longer see the actual news, just far-right "influencer" content. Even when tech companies do pay the link tax, the results are far from ideal: in Canada, Google has become a partner of news outlets, which compromises their ability to report on Google's activities. Shortly after Google promised millions to the Toronto Star, the paper dropped its award-winning, hard-hitting "Defanging Big Tech" investigative series. Given that Google came within centimeters of stealing most of downtown Toronto just a few years ago, we can hardly afford to have the city's largest newspaper climb into bed with the company: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/10/31/leaked-document-reveals-that-sidewalk-labs-toronto-plans-for-private-taxation-private-roads-charter-schools-corporate-cops-and-judges-and-punishment-for-people-who-choose-privacy/ Worse still: any effort to make Big Tech poorer – by curbing its predatory acquisition of our data and money – reduces its ability to pay the link tax, which means that, under a link tax, the media's future depends on Big Tech being able to go on ripping us off. All of which is not to say that Big Tech should be allowed to go on ripping off the media. Rather, it's to argue that we should stop tech from ripping off Canadians in the first place, as a superior alternative to asking Big Tech to remit a small share of the booty to a few lucky victims. Together, Meta and Google take 51 cents out of every advertising dollar. This is a huge share. Before the rise of surveillance advertising, the ad industry's share of advertising dollars amounted to about 15%. The Meta/Google ad-tech duopoly has cornered the ad market, and they illegally colluded to rig it, which allows them to steal billions from media outlets, all around the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi\_Blue What would a predistribution approach to ad-tech look like? Canada could ban the collection and sale of consumer data outright, and punish any domestic firm that collects consumer data, which would choke off much of the supply of data that feeds the ad-tech market. Canada could also repeal its wildly unpopular "anticircumvention" law, The Copyright Modernisation Act of 2012 (Bill C-11), which was passed despite the public's overwhelming negative response to a consultation on the bill: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/15/radical-extremists/#sex-pest Under this law, it's illegal for Canadian companies to reverse engineer and modify America's tech exports. This means that Canadian companies can't go into business selling an alternative Facebook client that blocks all the surveillance advertising and restores access to the news, and offers non-surveillant, content-based ways for other Canadian businesses to advertise: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising Repealing Bill C-11 would also allow Canadian companies to offer alternative app stores for phones and consoles. Google and Apple have a duopoly on mobile apps, and the two companies have rigged the market to take 30% of every in-app payment. The actual cost of processing a payment is less than 1%. This means that 30 cents out of every in-app subscriber dollar sent to a Canadian news outlet is shipped south to Cupertino or Mountain View. Legalizing made-in-Canada app stores, installed without permission from Apple or Google, would stop those dollars from being extracted in the first place. And not just media companies, of course – the app tax is paid by performers, software authors, and manufacturers. Extend the program to include games consoles and Canada's game companies would be rescued from Microsoft and Nintendo's own app tax, which also runs to 30%. But a C-11 repeal wouldn't merely safeguard Canadian dollars – it would also safeguard Canadian data. Our mobile phones collect and transmit mountains of data about us and our activities. Yes, even Apple's products – despite the company's high-flying rhetoric about its respect for your privacy, the company spies on everything you do with your phone and sells access to that data to advertisers. Apple doesn't offer any way to opt out of this, and lied about it when they were caught doing it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar These companies will not voluntarily stop stealing our data. That's the lesson of nine years under the EU's GDPR, a landmark, strong privacy law that US tech companies simply refuse to obey. And because they claim to be headquartered in Ireland (because Ireland lets them cheat on their taxes) and because they have captured the Irish state, they are able to simply flout the law: https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta Telling Big Tech not to gather our data is redistribution. So is dictating how they can use it after they collect it. The predistribution version of this is modifying our devices so that they don't gather or leak our data in the first place. Big Tech is able to suck up so much of our data because anticircumvention law – like Canada's Bill C-11, or Article 6 of the EU Copyright Directive – makes it illegal to modify your phone so that it blocks digital spying, preventing the collection and transmission of your data. Repeal anticircumvention law and businesses could offer Canadians (or Europeans) (or anyone in the world with a credit card and an internet connection) a product that blocks surveillance on their devices. More than half of all web users have installed an ad-blocker for their browser (which offers significant surveillance protection), but no one can install anything like this on their phones (or smart TVs, or smart doorbells, or other gadgets) because anticircumvention law criminalizes this act. Big Tech are notorious tax cheats, colluding with captured governments like the Irish state to avoid taxes worldwide. Canada tried to pass a "digital service tax" that would make the US pay a small share of the tax it evades in Canada. Trump went bananas and threatened to hit the country with (more) tariffs, and Canada folded. Tax is redistributive, and getting money back from American companies after they steal it from Canadians is much harder than simply arranging the system so it's much harder for American companies to steal from Canadians in the first place. Blocking spying, clawing back the app tax, unrigging the ad market – these are all predistributive rather than redistributive. So is selling alternative clients for legacy social media products like Facebook and Twitter – clients that unrig their algorithms and let Canadians see the news they've subscribed to, so they can't be used as hostages to extract "boosting" fees from media outlets who want to reach their own subscribers. Canada's redistribution efforts have been a consistent failure. Canada keeps trying to get streaming companies like Netflix to include more Canadian content in their offerings and search results. Legalize jailbreaking and a Canadian company could start selling an alternative client that lets you search all your streaming services at once, mixing in results from Canadian media companies and archives like the National Film Board – all while blocking surveillance by the tech giants. This client could also incorporate a PVR, so you could record shows to watch later, without worrying about the tech giants making your favorite program vanish. Remember, if it's legal to record a show from broadcast or cable with a VCR or a Tivo, it's legal to record it from a streaming service with an app. These predistribution tactics don't rely on US tech companies obeying Canada's orders. Instead, they take away American companies' ability to use Canada's courts and law enforcement apparatus to shut down Canadian competitors who disenshittify America's spying, stealing tech exports. Canada may not be able to push Google or Apple or Facebook around, but Canada can always decide whether Google or Apple or Facebook can use its courts to push Canadian competitors around. Back in December, when Trump started threatening (again) to invade Canada and take over the country, Prime Minister Mark Carney broke off trade talks. Those talks are slated to begin again in a matter of days: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2025/12/19/canada-u-s-to-start-talks-to-review-free-trade-deal-in-mid-january/87843153007/ Getting Trump to deal fairly with Canada is just as unlikely as getting Trump's tech companies to give Canadians a fair shake. Canada isn't going to win the trade war with an agreement. Canada will win the trade war by winning: with Made-in-Canada tech products that turn America's stolen trillions into Canadian billions, to be divided up among Canadian tech businesses (who will reap profits) and the Canadian public (who will reap savings).

      <h1>Fly's new Sprites.dev addresses both developer sandboxes and API sandboxes at the same time</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>New from Fly.io today: <a href="https://sprites.dev">Sprites.dev</a>. Here's their <a href="https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/">blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BfTLlwO4hw">YouTube demo</a>. It's an interesting new product that's quite difficult to explain - Fly call it &quot;Stateful sandbox environments with checkpoint &amp; restore&quot; but I see it as hitting two of my current favorite problems: a safe development environment for running coding agents <em>and</em> an API for running untrusted code in a secure sandbox.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: Fly sponsor some of my work. They did not ask me to write about Sprites and I didn't get preview access prior to the launch. My enthusiasm here is genuine.</em></p>

</ul>
<h4>Developer sandboxes</h4>
<p>I predicted earlier this week that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-a-challenger-disaster-for-coding-agent-security">&quot;we’re due a Challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security&quot;</a> due to the terrifying way most of us are using coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI. Running them in <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> mode (aka YOLO mode, where the agent acts without constantly seeking approval first) unlocks so much more power, but also means that a mistake or a malicious prompt injection can cause all sorts of damage to your system and data.</p>
<p>The safe way to run YOLO mode is in a robust sandbox, where the worst thing that can happen is the sandbox gets messed up and you have to throw it away and get another one.</p>
<p>That's the first problem Sprites solves:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://sprites.dev/install.sh | bash

sprite login
sprite create my-dev-environment
sprite console -s my-dev-environment
</code></pre>
<p>That's all it takes to get SSH connected to a fresh environment, running in an ~8GB RAM, 8 CPU server. And... Claude Code and Codex and Gemini CLI and Python 3.13 and Node.js 22.20 and a bunch of other tools are already installed.</p>
<p>The first time you run <code>claude</code> it neatly signs you in to your existing account with Anthropic. The Sprites VM is persistent so future runs of <code>sprite console -s</code> will get you back to where you were before.</p>
<p>... and it automatically sets up port forwarding, so you can run a localhost server on your Sprite and access it from <code>localhost:8080</code> on your machine.</p>
<p>There's also a command you can run to assign a public URL to your Sprite, so anyone else can access it if they know the secret URL.</p>
<h4>Storage and checkpoints</h4>
<p>In <a href="https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/">the blog post</a> Kurt Mackey argues that ephemeral, disposable sandboxes are not the best fit for coding agents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The state of the art in agent isolation is a read-only sandbox. At Fly.io, we’ve been selling that story for years, and we’re calling it: ephemeral sandboxes are obsolete. Stop killing your sandboxes every time you use them. [...]</p>
<p>If you force an agent to, it’ll work around containerization and do work . But you’re not helping the agent in any way by doing that. They don’t want containers. They don’t want “sandboxes”. They want computers.</p>
<p>[...] with an actual computer, Claude doesn’t have to rebuild my entire development environment every time I pick up a PR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each Sprite gets a proper filesystem which persists in between sessions, even while the Sprite itself shuts down after inactivity. It sounds like they're doing some clever filesystem tricks here, I'm looking forward to learning more about those in the future.</p>
<p>There are some clues on <a href="https://sprites.dev/">the homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You read and write to fast, directly attached NVMe storage. Your data then gets written to durable, external object storage. [...]</p>
<p>You don't pay for allocated filesystem space, just the blocks you write. And it's all TRIM friendly, so your bill goes down when you delete things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The really clever feature is checkpoints. You (or your coding agent) can trigger a checkpoint which takes around 300ms. This captures the entire disk state and can then be rolled back to later.</p>
<p>For more on how that works, run this in a Sprite:</p>
<pre><code>cat /.sprite/docs/agent-context.md

</code></pre>
<p>Here's the relevant section:</p>
<pre><code>## Checkpoints
- Point-in-time checkpoints and restores available
- Copy-on-write implementation for storage efficiency
- Last 5 checkpoints mounted at `/.sprite/checkpoints`
- Checkpoints capture only the writable overlay, not the base image

</code></pre>
<p>Or run this to see the <code>--help</code> for the command used to manage them:</p>
<pre><code>sprite-env checkpoints --help
</code></pre>
<p>Which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>sprite-env checkpoints - Manage environment checkpoints

USAGE:
    sprite-env checkpoints &lt;subcommand&gt; [options]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    list [--history &lt;ver&gt;]  List all checkpoints (optionally filter by history version)
    get &lt;id&gt;                Get checkpoint details (e.g., v0, v1, v2)
    create                  Create a new checkpoint (auto-versioned)
    restore &lt;id&gt;            Restore from a checkpoint (e.g., v1)

NOTE:
    Checkpoints are versioned as v0, v1, v2, etc.
    Restore returns immediately and triggers an async restore that restarts the environment.
    The last 5 checkpoints are mounted at /.sprite/checkpoints for direct file access.

EXAMPLES:
    sprite-env checkpoints list
    sprite-env checkpoints list --history v1.2.3
    sprite-env checkpoints get v2
    sprite-env checkpoints create
    sprite-env checkpoints restore v1

</code></pre>
<h4>Really clever use of Claude Skills</h4>
<p>I'm <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">a big fan of Skills</a>, the mechanism whereby Claude Code (and increasingly other agents too) can be given additional capabilities by describing them in Markdown files in a specific directory structure.</p>
<p>In a smart piece of design, Sprites uses pre-installed skills to teach Claude how Sprites itself works. This means you can ask Claude on the machine how to do things like open up ports and it will talk you through the process.</p>
<p>There's all sorts of interesting stuff in the <code>/.sprite</code> folder on that machine - digging in there is a great way to learn more about how Sprites works.</p>
<h4>A sandbox API</h4>
<p>Also from my predictions post earlier this week: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-we-re-finally-going-to-solve-sandboxing">&quot;We’re finally going to solve sandboxing&quot;</a>. I am obsessed with this problem: I want to be able to run untrusted code safely, both on my personal devices and in the context of web services I'm building for other people to use.</p>
<p>I have <em>so many things</em> I want to build that depend on being able to take untrusted code - from users or from LLMs or from LLMs-driven-by-users - and run that code in a sandbox where I can be confident that the blast radius if something goes wrong is tightly contained.</p>
<p>Sprites offers a clean <a href="https://sprites.dev/api">JSON API</a> for doing exactly that, plus client libraries in <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-go">Go</a> and <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-js">TypeScript</a> and coming-soon <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py">Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-ex">Elixir</a>.</p>
<p>From their quick start:</p>
<pre><code># Create a new sprite
curl -X PUT https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/my-sprite \
-H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&quot;

# Execute a command
curl -X POST https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/my-sprite/exec \
-H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&quot; \
-d '{&quot;command&quot;: &quot;echo hello&quot;}'

</code></pre>
<p>You can also checkpoint and rollback via the API, so you can get your environment exactly how you like it, checkpoint it, run a bunch of untrusted code, then roll back to the clean checkpoint when you're done.</p>
<p>Managing network access is an important part of maintaining a good sandbox. The Sprites API lets you <a href="https://sprites.dev/api/sprites/policies">configure network access policies</a> using a DNS-based allow/deny list like this:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST \
  &quot;https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/{name}/policy/network&quot; \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&quot; \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d '{
    &quot;rules&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;action&quot;: &quot;allow&quot;,
        &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;github.com&quot;
      },
      {
        &quot;action&quot;: &quot;allow&quot;,
        &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;*.npmjs.org&quot;
      }
    ]
  }'
</code></pre>
<h4>Scale-to-zero billing</h4>
<p>Sprites have scale-to-zero baked into the architecture. They go to sleep after 30 seconds of inactivity, wake up quickly when needed and bill you for just the CPU hours, RAM hours and GB-hours of storage you use while the Sprite is awake.</p>
<p>Fly <a href="https://sprites.dev/#billing">estimate</a> a 4 hour intensive coding session as costing around 46 cents, and a low traffic web app with 30 hours of wake time per month at ~$4.</p>
<p>(I calculate that a web app that consumes all 8 CPUs and all 8GBs of RAM 24/7 for a month would cost ((7 cents * 8 * 24 * 30) + (4.375 cents * 8 * 24 * 30)) / 100 = $655.2 per month, so don't necessarily use these as your primary web hosting solution for an app that soaks up all available CPU and RAM!)</p>
<h4>Two of my favorite problems at once</h4>
<p>I was hopeful that Fly would enter the developer-friendly sandbox API market, especially given other entrants from companies like <a href="https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandboxes">Modal</a> and <a href="https://e2b.dev/">E2B</a>.</p>
<p>I did not expect that they'd tackle the developer sandbox problem at the same time, and with the same product!</p>
<p>My one concern here is that it makes the product itself a little harder to explain.</p>
<p>I'm already spinning up some prototypes of sandbox-adjacent things I've always wanted to build, and early signs are very promising. I'll write more about these as they turn into useful projects.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here's some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557825#46560748">additional colour</a> from Thomas Ptacek on Hacker News:</p>

      <p>Trump is president the same way people who do vibe coding are developers. I always thought he'd be much happier playing president on TV instead of actually being president. And people would think about this stuff more rationally if it were a TV show like Pluribus or Severance. Why did they <em>really</em> do what they did? Or the way we talk about the Mets or the Knicks and their various foibles. It's funny people have a clarity about fictional stuff that they don't have for real-world things like war, health insurance, the cost of eggs and gestapo tactics.</p>

      <h1>Interpolate contrast-color() to manipulate lightness</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>In <a href="https://daverupert.com/2026/01/algorithmic-hover-states-with-contrast-color/">my first post on <code>contrast-color()</code></a> I demo’d using <code>color-mix()</code> to change a background-color on hover, but I will be honest… mixing black and white isn’t always what you want. It would be cool and helpful to coerce <code>contrast-color()</code> to return either <code>1</code> or <code>-1</code> so that we could adjust lightness in a color function on hover instead of only mixing white and black.</p>
<p>Building on the inline CSS <code>if()</code> statements <a href="https://daverupert.com/2026/01/contrast-color-with-custom-design-tokens/">in my last post</a>, we can use the same trick to interpolate the result of <code>contrast-color()</code> into a number.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: All caveats from the previous post about browser support, caching quirks, and expected syntax changes still apply.</p>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/myPogBv">contrast-color() powered design system colors</a> by Dave Rupert ( <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>Ahh… feel that? Now our states maintains its harmonious color palette where mixing in white or black gets us a bit muddier results. We’re picking another note on the scale of the color’s lightness ramp.</p>
<p>The relevant CSS to make this trick work goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>/* Needed for if() statement */
@property --captured-color {
  syntax: &quot;&lt;color&gt;&quot;;
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: white;
}

/* https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/ */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg) var(--l) 0 0);
}

button {
  background-color: var(--ds-button-bg);
	--captured-color: --contrast-color(var(--ds-button-bg));
  --lighter-or-darker: if(
    style(--captured-color: oklch(1 0 0)): 2.5; /* go extra lighter */
    else: -1; /* go darker */
  );
  ...

	&amp;:hover, &amp;:focus {
		background-color: oklch(
			from var(--ds-button-bg)
			calc(l + (0.1 * var(--lighter-or-darker))) c h
		);
  }
}

</code></pre>
<p>For comparison’s sake, I web-inspected up a little apples-to-apples, side-by-side of the <a href="https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/myPogBv">adjusting lightness way</a> and the <a href="https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/bNpzYzX">color-mixing way</a> of algorithmic hover states where it’s 10% lightened/darkened versus 10% mix of white/black.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2026/colormixing.png" alt="a side by side look at adjusting lightness vs mixing in white and black. the rest for all the buttons is on top and the hover state for all the buttons is on the bottom. The hover states for the buttons on the adjusting lightness demo are a bit warmer, but probably hard to notice to the average person."></p>
<p>The difference is almost imperceptible, but the hover states from the “Adjust Lightness” method feel a tad bit warmer, particularly on the bottom row with the green, blue, and purple buttons. The difference becomes more obvious if the step is greater than 10%.</p>
<p>Unless your customers are a bunch of color dorks, they probably won’t see it the care you put into this. But I’m willing to wager that even if they don’t see the difference, they will be able to feel the difference.</p>
<p>We also get a lot more control with this <code>if()</code> statement route. For example, I can set the lighten amount to <code>2.5</code> (+25%) instead of <code>1</code> (+10%) because that’s what felt better. If you’re algorithmically generating your color palettes, it should be easy to find the ideal values; either a step-up or step-down, perhaps. And we’re also not just limited to lightness! You could mess with chroma or whatever the <code>b</code> in <code>lab()</code> is. Find what makes sense for your system.</p>
<p>A part of me wants to take this even further to get more control. For example, if the color is super dark (e.g. black) and the lightness value is below <code>0.1</code>, lighten by 25%, otherwise lighten by 10%. That might be possible with an <code>if()</code> inside the <code>oklch()</code> or a <code>sin()</code> function… but that sounds like a lot of Math and probably hurts readability. More experiments to do though.</p>
<p>It’s fun to embark on this new world of algorithmic color schemes in vanilla CSS. While I’m excited to play, I’m more excited to see what your beautiful brains come up with.</p>

Object permanence: &quot;Keyboard Practice&quot;; Sam Bulte says she's no dirtier than other MPs; Gene Luen Yang's Amabassador for Young People's Literature speech; Menstruation innovation. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. bunnie's piggyback hack (permalink) If Andrew &quot;bunnie&quot; Huang didn't actually exist, I'd swear he was a character out of a(n extraordinarily technologically well-informed) cyberpunk novel. Every time I interact with this legendary hardware hacker, he blows my mind with some incredible project or insight that permanently alters how I think about technology. I first met bunnie when he came to EFF for help with the threats he'd received from Microsoft. At the time, bunnie was an electrical engineering grad student at MIT, and he'd taken the bootloader locks on the new Xbox platform as a personal affront and challenge. He applied his prodigious skill and talent to these digital handcuffs, and in short order, he had broken the Xbox and installed Linux on it. MIT's general counsel immediately washed its hands of any responsibility to defend this young grad student from bullying by a corporate monopolist, hanging him out to dry. So he turned to us – and we got his back. You can read all about it in Hacking the Xbox, his canonical work about hardware hacking and technological freedom (it's free!): <a href="https://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox">https://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox</a>_Free.pdf In the many years since, I've been lucky enough to count bunnie as a friend, colleague and comrade, albeit one I only physically run into every year or so, usually at some tech event or on the playa at Burning Man, where he still camps with the MIT crew at The Institute. I just got to see bunnie in person again, over Christmas week at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg. He gave a late-night presentation with his collaborator Sean &quot;xobs&quot; Cross, entitled &quot;Xous: A Pure-Rust Rethink of the Embedded Operating System&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbWWGkyIBGM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbWWGkyIBGM</a> Don't let the technical-sounding title intimidate you! This was a banger of a talk, and as with every bunnie Huang production, it left a pleasant and persistent aftertaste. The background for this talk is bunnie's obsession with building a trustworthy computer. For decades, bunnie has been chasing the dream of a computer whose every component – operating system, drivers, firmware, and hardware designs – are open to inspection. Bunnie's reasoning here is that anything that can't be inspected (and, by extension, modified) by its users is a spot where bad guys can hide bad stuff, and where lurking bugs can fester until they are exploited by bad guys. Remember the spectacular (and still mysterious) claims that Apple's servers had all been compromised with minuscule hardware bugs? The single best explanation of that you will find comes from bunnie: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqQhWitJ1As">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqQhWitJ1As</a> Bunnie was doing all this before there was an &quot;open source hardware&quot; movement, and he remains at its vanguard. His &quot;Precursor&quot; project is a reference hardware platform where every component is open to inspection and modification, from the chassis to the random number generator: <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/category/betrusted/precursor/">https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/category/betrusted/precursor/</a> One area of especial concern and interest for bunnie is the promise and peril of the &quot;system-on-a-chip&quot; (SoC). This is exactly what it sounds like: a cheap chip that incorporates everything you need to do full-fledged computing, including interfaces and drivers for networks, screens, peripherals, etc. SoCs are ubiquitous. You find them in things like individual car engine components and inkjet printer cartridges, and each one is a whole-ass computer, capable of running some really ugly malware. As bunnie explained back in 2020, there are two problems with SoCs: first, they are packaged such that the silicon traces inside of them can't be readily inspected, and second, they are so expensive to fabricate that someone like bunnie can't possibly come up with the millions needed to make an open, trustworthy, inspectable alternative: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#precursor">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#precursor</a> That's where bunnie's CCC talk comes in. The chips that SoCs are etched upon have lots of space (relatively speaking – we're talking about nanometer-scale circuits, after all). Even after an SoC designer packs in a ton of extra traces to handle oddball applications, the chip is still mostly &quot;dark matter&quot; – blank silicon. The first half of bunnie and xobs's talk concerns itself with &quot;Xous,&quot; a secure operating system for an SoC, written in Rust. But the second half of the talk tackles the problem of procuring an SoC that you can trust to run Xous on. That's where this dark matter comes in. Bunnie's day-job is consulting on extremely gnarly, high-stakes, high-value hardware design and manufacturing, so naturally, he's got lots of clients and contacts in the SoC manufacturing world. He approached one of these companies with a proposal: let me tape out a whole separate chip that fits in the dark matter for one of your upcoming chips. Adding these traces adds virtually no cost to the production, and adding bunnie's chips to the production run actually saves the manufacturer money, because the prices drop when the quantities increase. The idea is to put two chips on the chip, and badge most of them with the OEM's branding, while a small rump of the chips will have bunnie's branding (he calls it the Baochip). On bunnie's chips, the traces to the OEM chip will be physically cut, meaning that the Baochips will just be Baochips – the original chip will be inaccessible and unusable. What's more, bunnie didn't just fit one chip into the OEM's &quot;dark matter&quot; – he fit five separate, specialized SoCs into the unused space. Remember, the beauty of SoCs is that once they're taped out and sent to production, the cost of an actual chip is peanuts, meaning that these Baochips are cheap as hell. Even better: the traces on these chips are scaled to be readily inspected using relatively low-cost equipment, meaning that many parties around the world can grab one of these chips, stick it in a machine, and compare the traces on the chip to the free, open sourcefile that was used to produce it, confirming that there are no nasty surprises lurking inside. This was such an exciting talk, and as I sat through it, I had this nagging feeling that it reminded me of something else I'd learned about years before, though I couldn't quite place it. Finally, as bunnie and xobs were stepping off the stage, I had it – it reminded me of another bunnie talk I'd seen – this one at The Institute, the MIT Burning Man camp, more than a decade prior. Back in 2015, bunnie designed and built a set of really cool, wearable radio-linked badges for his campmates, which would help them locate one another on the playa at night. These badges were really cool – they used a genetic algorithm to &quot;have sex&quot; with one another and mutate their color patterns. Bunnie even worked in a &quot;consent&quot; mechanism! <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2015/sex-circuits-deep-house/">https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2015/sex-circuits-deep-house/</a> But the really cool part that stuck with me was the manufacturing story. Bunnie wanted to fabricate custom injection-molded plastic enclosures for these pendants, but injection molding – like chip design – is a mass production phenomenon, with sky-high setup costs and incredibly cheap per-unit costs thereafter. So (and this might sound familiar) bunnie reached out to a die-maker that he worked with in China and said, &quot;Hey, the next time you're contracted to mill out a die for a client, let me know if there's any extra space on the face of the die, and I'll provide you with a shapefile you can carve out of this 'dark matter.'&quot; This doesn't add any cost to the die setup, and it means that bunnie can run just a couple dozen injection-molded, custom cases at a cost of pennies per unit. I grabbed bunnie later that night and mentioned this old Burning Man project to him and he said, &quot;You know, I haven't ever thought of it, but you're right, there's definitely a throughline between the two projects.&quot; I asked him what he called this technique and he shrugged and said he didn't really have a name for it, but he thought of it as &quot;piggybacking,&quot; which seems like a good name to me. It seems to me that these two kinds of manufacturing can't be the only ones that can be &quot;piggybacked&quot; onto. That's what motivated me to write this post – to get people thinking about these high-setup/low-unit cost production types that might be piggybacked for small batch, delightful projects like bunnie's. Well, that, and just to do one of my periodic bunnie Huang appreciation posts. If there's one person that I'd recommend people pay more attention to, it's him. He's also a terrific communicator, and an indecently great writer. My readers might be familiar with him thanks to the afterword he contributed to Little Brother: <a href="https://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/">https://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/</a> More recently, he wrote a fantastic intro for last year's Science Comics Computers: How Digital Computers Work, a brilliant middle-grades graphic novel that uses steampunk dinosaurs to explain digital logic and the building blocks of computation: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac</a> He also co-authored a fascinating research paper with Edward Snowden, after the two of them collaborated on a daughter-board that spots otherwise untraceable malware: <a href="https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf">https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf</a> Again, my readers will recognize this as a gimmick from my 2020 novel Attack Surface (a Little Brother novel for adults): <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757517/attacksurface/">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757517/attacksurface/</a> That's not bunnie's only sweet hardware hack, of course.

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/24/rooster.png" alt="">I get ideas when I go for a walk or drive somewhere in my car. This was one of those times, but it was not a comforting idea. I live in the mountains on the west side of the Hudson River near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York">Kingston</a>. On my drive to town yesterday I went through the small town of Woodstock, and I was thinking about how ICE is occupying Minneapolis, and wondered why wasn't I more concerned about it personally. The answer -- it's far away from here, and Woodstock, while it is a famous place, is on absolutely no one's radar. But then I remembered the astounding amount of money we allocated for ICE, far more than could be used for border enforcement, so obviously this all is a prelude for an American secret police and here's where the disquieting idea came up. Of course ICE will operate in every city and town in the US no matter how remote or small. But first they have to perfect their act, this is a form of training to teach the skinheads of America how to be part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel">SS</a>. Experiment first in a few cities before deploying, gradually, everywhere. We're all going to have to submit to loyalty oaths, and we will all be forced to denounce our neighbors as illustrated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others">Lives of Others</a>, which if you haven't watched it yet, now is the time when you have to, to get an idea what it was like in East Germany before the wall came down, and where we're headed. It still may not be too late yet, but it's getting close.</p>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>For the past decade, I've used <a href="https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog">Mailhog</a> for local email debugging. Besides working on web applications that deal with email, I've long used email as the primary notification system for comments on the blog.</p>
<p>I built an <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailhog">Ansible role for Mailhog</a>, and it was one of the main features of <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2015/major-improvements-drupal-vm/">Drupal VM</a>, a popular local development environment for Drupal I sunset 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, barring any future updates from the maintainers, it seems like <a href="https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/issues/466">Mailhog has not been maintained</a> for four years now. It still <em>works</em>, but something as complex as an email debugging environment needs ongoing maintenance to stay relevant.</p>

      <h1>Using your design system colors with contrast-color()</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>One predictable pain point with <code>contrast-color()</code> is that it only returns <code>black</code> and <code>white</code> named colors. From a design systems perspective, that’s not ideal because you want <em>your</em> colors. You want your harmonious brand and the colors you and your team spent thousands of man hours in meetings deciding on. Those colors.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/exploring-color-contrast-for-the-first-time/">an earlier version of Safari had <code>color-contrast()</code></a> (confusing I know, naming is hard) which allowed you to pass in a list of best candidates to choose from. I beleive that proposal got mired in standards discussions, color contrast algorithms, and competing proposals; and <code>contrast-color()</code> is what survived which got simplified down to a binary result.</p>
<p>In the future though, we can use <code>contrast-color()</code> and <code>if()</code> together to help pick the value we want. Alas, at the time of writing no browser supports both <code>if()</code> and <code>contrast-color()</code>. But we can use <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/">Lea Verou’s <code>--contrast-color()</code> workaround</a> to experiment with how this will work in Chromium today.</p>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/myPogBv">contrast-color() powered design system colors</a> by Dave Rupert ( <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>The CSS to get this working looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>@property --captured-color {
  syntax: &quot;&lt;color&gt;&quot;;
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: white;
}

/* https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/ */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg) var(--l) 0 0);
}

:root {
  --ds-text-white: wheat;
  --ds-text-black: darkslategray;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--ds-button-bg);
  --captured-color: --contrast-color(var(--ds-button-bg));

  color: if(
     style(--captured-color: oklch(1 0 0)): var(--ds-text-white);
     else: var(--ds-text-black);
  );
}

</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it! Using (a form of) <code>contrast-color()</code> you can select the proper tokens from your design system. Cool.</p>
<p>One quirky bit needed to make it work is defining a type for <code>--captured-color</code> using CSS <code>@property</code>, <a href="https://blog.kizu.dev/captured-custom-properties/">a trick I learned from Roma Komarov</a>. To be honest I don’t fully understand <em>the why</em> behind Registered Custom Properties and the <a href="https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-properties-values-api/#calculation-of-computed-values">Computed Value Time Behavior</a> superpower, but my simple brain created a rule “If you’re going to compare a variable to a <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> in a CSS <code>if()</code> statement, make sure to register the variable as a <code>&lt;color&gt;</code>.”</p>
<p>If/when any of the browsers start supporting both features, I expect we’ll have to update <code>oklch(1 0 0)</code> in the style query to <code>white</code> or <code>rgb(255 255 255)</code>. At least, I hope it works that way.</p>
<p>One unexpected challenge that I encountered with this demo was that if I abstracted out the <code>if</code> statement out into its own custom function, it would break. I’m not 100% sure why but I think it’s based on how CSS functions cache results. I’ll have to dig into this more, but I’m happy the inline <code>if</code> statement works. Hopefully someone smarter can figure it out.</p>
<p>Anyways, exiting times. And can we pause for a moment and marvel at how this is all vanilla 2026 CSS?! What a world.</p>

      <h1>LLM predictions for 2026, shared with Oxide and Friends</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>I joined a recording of the Oxide and Friends podcast on Tuesday to talk about 1, 3 and 6 year predictions for the tech industry. This is my second appearance on their annual predictions episode, you can see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/">my predictions from January 2025 here</a>. Here's <a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/predictions-2026">the page for this year's episode</a>, with options to listen in all of your favorite podcast apps or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8">directly on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Bryan Cantrill started the episode by declaring that he's never been so unsure about what's coming in the next year. I share that uncertainty - the significant advances in coding agents just in the last two months have left me certain that things will change significantly, but unclear as to what those changes will be.</p>
<p>Here are the predictions I shared in the episode.</p>

</ul>
<h4>1 year: It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=1167s">▶ 19:27</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that there are still people out there who are convinced that LLMs cannot write good code. Those people are in for a very nasty shock in 2026. I do not think it will be possible to get to the end of even the next three months while still holding on to that idea that the code they write is all junk and it's it's likely any decent human programmer will write better code than they will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2023, saying that LLMs write garbage code was entirely correct. For most of 2024 that stayed true. In 2025 that changed, but you could be forgiven for continuing to hold out. In 2026 the quality of LLM-generated code will become impossible to deny.</p>
<p>I base this on my own experience - I've spent more time exploring <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI-assisted programming</a> than most.</p>
<p>The key change in 2025 (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#the-year-of-reasoning-">my overview for the year</a>) was the introduction of &quot;reasoning models&quot; trained specifically against code using Reinforcement Learning. The major labs spent a full year competing with each other on who could get the best code capabilities from their models, and that problem turns out to be perfectly attuned to RL since code challenges come with built-in verifiable success conditions.</p>
<p>Since Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 came out in November and December respectively the amount of code I've written by hand has dropped to a single digit percentage of my overall output. The same is true for many other expert programmers I know.</p>
<p>At this point if you continue to argue that LLMs write useless code you're damaging your own credibility.</p>
<h4>1 year: We're finally going to solve sandboxing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=1205s">▶ 20:05</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this year is the year we're going to solve sandboxing. I want to run code other people have written on my computing devices without it destroying my computing devices if it's malicious or has bugs. [...] It's crazy that it's 2026 and I still <code>pip install</code> random code and then execute it in a way that it can steal all of my data and delete all my files. [...] I don't want to run a piece of code on any of my devices that somebody else wrote outside of sandbox ever again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't just about LLMs, but it becomes even more important now there are so many more people writing code often without knowing what they're doing. Sandboxing is also a key part of the battle against prompt injection.</p>
<p>We have a <em>lot</em> of promising technologies in play already for this - containers and WebAssembly being the two I'm most optimistic about. There's real commercial value involved in solving this problem. The pieces are there, what's needed is UX work to reduce the friction in using them productively and securely.</p>
<h4>1 year: A &quot;Challenger disaster&quot; for coding agent security <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=1281s">▶ 21:21</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we're due a Challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security[...] I think so many people, myself included, are running these coding agents practically as root, right? We're letting them do all of this stuff. And every time I do it, my computer doesn't get wiped. I'm like, &quot;oh, it's fine&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used this as an opportunity to promote my favourite recent essay about AI security, <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/the-normalization-of-deviance-in-ai/">the Normalization of Deviance in AI</a> by Johann Rehberger.</p>
<p>The Normalization of Deviance describes the phenomenon where people and organizations get used to operating in an unsafe manner because nothing bad has happened to them yet, which can result in enormous problems (like the 1986 Challenger disaster) when their luck runs out.</p>
<p>Every six months I predict that a headline-grabbing prompt injection attack is coming soon, and every six months it doesn't happen. This is my most recent version of that prediction!</p>
<h4>1 year: Kākāpō parrots will have an outstanding breeding season <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=3006s">▶ 50:06</a></h4>
<p>(I dropped this one to lighten the mood after a discussion of the deep sense of existential dread that many programmers are feeling right now!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that Kākāpō parrots in New Zealand are going to have an outstanding breeding season. The reason I think this is that the Rimu trees are in fruit right now. There's only 250 of them, and they only breed if the Rimu trees have a good fruiting. The Rimu trees have been terrible since 2019, but this year the Rimu trees were all blooming. There are researchers saying that all 87 females of breeding age might lay an egg. And for a species with only 250 remaining parrots that's great news.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81k%C4%81p%C5%8D#Population_timeline">checked Wikipedia</a> and I was right with the parrot numbers but wrong about the last good breeding season, apparently 2022 was a good year too.)</p>
<p>In a year with precious little in the form of good news I am utterly delighted to share this story. Here's more:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.doc.govt.nz/2025/06/27/kakapo-breeding-season-2026/">Kākāpō breeding season 2026</a> introduction from the Department of Conservation from June 2025 .</li>

</ul>
<p>I don't often use AI-generated images on this blog, but the Kākāpō image the Oxide team created for this episode is just <em>perfect</em>:</p>

<h4>3 years: the coding agents Jevons paradox for software engineering will resolve, one way or the other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=3277s">▶ 54:37</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We will find out if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a> saves our careers or not. This is a big question that anyone who's a software engineer has right now: we are driving the cost of actually producing working code down to a fraction of what it used to cost. Does that mean that our careers are completely devalued and we all have to learn to live on a tenth of our incomes, or does it mean that the demand for software, for custom software goes up by a factor of 10 and now our skills are even <em>more</em> valuable because you can hire me and I can build you 10 times the software I used to be able to? I think by three years we will know for sure which way that one went.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote says it all. There are two ways this coding agents thing could go: it could turn out software engineering skills are devalued, or it could turn out we're more valuable and effective than ever before.</p>
<p>I'm crossing my fingers for the latter! So far it feels to me like it's working out that way.</p>
<h4>3 years: Someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding and it won't even be a surprise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=3913s">▶ 65:13</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won't even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine[...] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it'll get so much easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common complaint today from AI coding skeptics is that LLMs are fine for toy projects but can't be used for anything large and serious.</p>
<p>I think within 3 years that will be comprehensively proven incorrect, to the point that it won't even be controversial anymore.</p>
<p>I picked a web browser here because so much of the work building a browser involves writing code that has to conform to an enormous and daunting selection of both formal tests and informal websites-in-the-wild.</p>
<p>Coding agents are <em>really good</em> at tasks where you can define a concrete goal and then set them to work iterating in that direction.</p>
<p>A web browser is the most ambitious project I can think of that leans into those capabilities.</p>
<h4>6 years: Typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=4839s">▶ 80:39</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the job of being paid money to type code into a computer will go the same way as punching punch cards [...] in six years time, I do not think anyone will be paid to just to do the thing where you type the code. I think software engineering will still be an enormous career. I just think the software engineers won't be spending multiple hours of their day in a text editor typing out syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more time I spend on AI-assisted programming the less afraid I am for my job, because it turns out building software - especially at the rate it's now possible to build - still requires enormous skill, experience and depth of understanding.</p>
<p>The skills are changing though! Being able to read a detailed specification and transform it into lines of code is the thing that's being automated away. What's left is everything else, and the more time I spend working with coding agents the larger that &quot;everything else&quot; becomes.</p>

      <h1>Algorithmic hover states with contrast-color()</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>Firefox 146 added support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/color_value/contrast-color"><code>contrast-color()</code></a> joining Safari 26 in the First Implementor’s Club. For those unfamiliar, <code>contrast-color(&lt;color&gt;)</code> is a new CSS function that will take a <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> as input and returns either <code>white</code> or <code>black</code> depending on which has the most contrast.</p>
<p>The quintessential example is choosing a foreground text <code>color</code> with the best contrast.</p>
<pre><code>button {

	background: var(--button-bg);
	color: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));
	/* @returns black (5.25:1 WCAG AA Pass)
			not white (3.99:1 WCAG AA Fail) */
}

</code></pre>
<p>If someone changes <code>--button-bg</code> to purple, the foreground color automatically resolves to the either white or black, whichever has more contrast. It avoids having to set an extra token for color and takes the guess work out of picking an accessible foreground color.</p>
<p>I think this is going to be an incredible boon to design systems where I don’t control what <code>--button-bg</code> is, but I do care about providing accessible experiences. And I think that’s the goal of this feature; to have “smart defaults” that lead to more accessible websites, easier algorithmically-driven color systems, and better “theme a whole website from a single color picker” demos.</p>
<h2>Sure contrast-color() can do foreground colors, but what about backgrounds?</h2>
<p>We’re having conversations at work about algorithmically driven rest/hover/active states for Buttons. In the current <a href="https://web.dev/baseline/">Baseline</a> you can use <code>color-mix()</code> to lighten/darken colors on <code>:hover</code>…</p>
<pre><code>button {
	background-color: var(--button-bg);
	color: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));

	&amp;:hover, &amp;:focus {
		background-color: color-mix(
			in srgb,
			var(--button-bg) 90%,
			black 10%
		)
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p>The code above will dim your button on <code>:hover</code> 10% by mixing in black. But what if our Buttons are already dark (black, navy, etc)? In that situation we want to lighten the background-color instead of dimming. We can glue on new classes like <code>button.lighten-on-hover</code> or <code>button.invert-hover</code> and that works… until we get to light and dark theme modes of our Button where you probably want to lighten/darken oppositely depending on the mode…</p>
<p>Ugh. In that situation you’d have <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>, <code>[data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;]</code> styles in your Button styles and people are mad now because the Button styles are too complex. There’s got to be a better way!</p>
<p>Well, do I have good news for you…</p>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/bNpzYzX">contrast-color() powered lighten/darken bg on hover</a> by Dave Rupert ( <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>Per my previous conversations, I wondered if we could use <code>contrast-color()</code> to programmatically lighten/darken an button based on its current <code>background-color</code>. If the Button is black, and the contrast-color is white, let’s mix in white (and vice versa):</p>
<pre><code>:root {
	color-scheme: light dark;
	--button-bg: light-dark(navyblue, lightpurple);
}

button {
	background-color: var(--button-bg);
	color: color-contrast(var(--button-bg));

	&amp;:hover, &amp;:focus {
		background-color: color-mix(
			in srgb,
			var(--button-bg) 75%,
			contrast-color(var(--button-bg)) 10%
		)
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p>Huzzah! Now our Button’s hover states go in the desired direction and our foreground <code>color</code> is intrinsically styled based on its own <code>background-color</code>. Nice. From a design systems perspective I’m pretty excited about the possibility to remove a bunch of state-based tokens from our collection.</p>
<h3>Now available in… everywhere?</h3>
<p>This approach only works in Safari and Firefox. However, if I use <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/">Lea Verou’s method of polyfilling <code>contrast-color()</code></a>, we can pop in a custom <code>@function --contrast-color()</code> that works in Chromium 139+. The final working solution looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>/* @function supported in Chromium */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg-color) var(--l) 0 h);
}

button {
  /* contrast-color() supported in Safari &amp; Firefox */
  --button-fg: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));

  @supports not (color: contrast-color(red)) {
    --button-fg: --contrast-color(var(--button-bg));
  }

  background: var(--button-bg);
  color: var(--button-fg);

  &amp;:hover,
  &amp;:focus{
    background-color: color-mix(
      in srgb,
      var(--button-bg) 75%,
      var(--button-fg) 10%
    );
  }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Depending on your browser matrix, this may work for you. It’s probably a <em>smidge</em> too new for us to roll out to customers, right now but for personal sites heck yeah.</p>
<p>This is interesting tech and I’m excited to dig in more. And spoiler alert, this is the first post in a small little series I have already written up for you.</p>

      <h3><em>For December 24, 2025-January 6, 2026</em></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. It’s only January 8th but we’re pleased to announce that we’ve already completed one of our major goals of 2026: Getting our heads unstuck from the way-too-small turtleneck sweaters we bought each other for Christmas.</p>

Jim also does a great job exploring many different, unexpected effects that the cobra has on this workplace, including on the decor: “At this point I don’t think it’s necessary to show us more baby pictures of the cobra. I think there are enough framed photographs on the office walls, visible from every work station, for us to be familiar with how the snake looked.”</p>

      <h1>Was the ICE murder pre-calculated?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>When there's breaking news these days I check Fox News in addition to CNN, MSNOW, BBC, PBS. The best are the last two. But last night night when everyone was fixated on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Renee_Good">story</a> of Renee Nicole Good, the woman who was killed in cold blood, on video, by a masked ICE thug, I wondered what Fox was saying. They were showing the actual video over and over like the other networks. Their words were what Trump was saying, but they didn't hide what actually happened, at least as long as it's news.</p>
<p>Then I wondered how much this was pre-calculated. It clearly doesn't hurt ICE to signal that they're killing US citizens in the US with impunity. Next time will be soon, and it will be more than one dead, and maybe they'll be kids. What makes me think this was not planned by the higher-ups is that they killed a middle-aged white woman, mother of 3,, who writes poetry. Not a very likely cartel leader or narco-terrorist. There were dolls in the glove compartment of the car.</p>
<p>Every indication is that she was just afraid and trying to get out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>We also remember that in the aftermath of Jan 6, private texts from the top people at Fox indicated they were scared and appalled like most other relatively sane Americans. What had happened then was unthinkable. Well, what happened yesterday was just as unthinkable. Shocking. Makes you wonder what's next. Get ready, we're going to see a lot of ugliness now, hard to comprehend, hard to accept. We still have a skeletal democracy, and ICE isn't fully staffed yet (they have new billions of dollars to spend).</p>
<p>On Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dan.conover.714/posts/pfbid035Dzpcd13T73crrWxC85U6GMf1UH2qH148cJuYvEfHMzCUjMDypyha9vbrrMSKEDJl?comment_id=1185132377083238&amp;notif_id=1767891365875871&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif">Dan Conover said</a>: &quot;This is what the collapse of the rules-based order looks like.&quot;</p>
<p>I responded: &quot;Or it's a test of it. The guy wasn't very well disguised, I think he will be identified if he hasn't already been identified. Will he be arrested and tried? If yes, then we just validated the rule-based order. If no, we're fucked.</p>
<p>&quot;Or even better the state of Minnesota could go to court and sue ICE to get their officers to wear identifying information, and no masks. For just this reason. And then here's an arrest warrant for the guy who fired his gun 3 times at the head of a 37-year old mom who writes poetry and drives an SUV with teddy bears in the glove compartment. In other words I'm not sure this was intentional (on behalf of ICE), and I think they may have to turn this guy over, otherwise someone is getting impeached. The video is too compelling.&quot;</p>

      <h1>How Google Got Its Groove Back and Edged Ahead of OpenAI</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-openai-gemini-chatgpt-b766e160">How Google Got Its Groove Back and Edged Ahead of OpenAI</a></strong></p>
<p>I picked up a few interesting tidbits from this Wall Street Journal piece on Google's recent hard won success with Gemini.</p>
<p>Here's the origin of the name &quot;Nano Banana&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Naina Raisinghani, known inside Google for working late into the night, needed a name for the new tool to complete the upload. It was 2:30 a.m., though, and nobody was around. So she just made one up, a mashup of two nicknames friends had given her: Nano Banana.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The WSJ credit OpenAI's Daniel Selsam with un-retiring Sergei Brin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around that time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who had recently retired, was at a party chatting with a researcher from OpenAI named Daniel Selsam, according to people familiar with the conversation. Why, Selsam asked him, wasn’t he working full time on AI. Hadn’t the launch of ChatGPT captured his imagination as a computer scientist?</p>
<p>ChatGPT was on its way to becoming a household name in AI chatbots, while Google was still fumbling to get its product off the ground. Brin decided Selsam had a point and returned to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we get some rare concrete user numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By October, Gemini had more than 650 million monthly users, up from 450 million in July.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LLM usage number I see cited most often is OpenAI's 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT. That's from October 6th at OpenAI DevDay so it's comparable to these Gemini numbers, albeit not directly since it's weekly rather than monthly actives.</p>
<p>I'm also never sure what counts as a &quot;Gemini user&quot; - does interacting via Google Docs or Gmail count or do you need to be using a Gemini chat interface directly?</p>
<p><strong>Update 17th January 2025</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/lunixa380/status/2012610344741412909">@LunixA380 pointed out</a> that this 650m user figure comes from the <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/news/news-details/2025/Alphabet-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Results-2025-mIRgD3AI4A/default.aspx">Alphabet 2025 Q3 earnings report</a> which says this (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Alphabet had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We delivered our first-ever $100 billion quarter,&quot; said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google.</p>
<p>&quot;[...] In addition to topping leaderboards, our first party models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute, via direct API use by our customers. <strong>The Gemini App now has over 650 million monthly active users</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably the &quot;Gemini App&quot; encompasses the Android and iPhone apps as well as direct visits to <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">gemini.google.com</a> - that seems to be the indication from Google's <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/gemini/gemini-3/">November 18th blog post</a> that also mentioned the 650m number.</p>

      <p>The human kind Fourteen years ago, agency had lost its original meaning, and was mostly applied to forms of business (real estate, advertising) and government bureaus (farm service, emergency management). That's why I devoted a chapter of The Intention Economy to what agency meant in the first place. Wrote about it again last year in Real Agency. Now […]</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Where did the money go? (08 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Where did the money go? Turning a mountain of (their) money into a pile of (your) money. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Revolutionary Colossus; T-Mobile CEO v EFF; Broadband isn't gasoline. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Where did the money go? (permalink) America is trudging through its third consecutive K-shaped recovery (an economic rally where the rich get richer and everyone else gets poorer). The rich have never been richer, and the debt-fueled consumption that kept the economy going is tapering down to a trickle. This isn't down to the iron laws of economics or the great forces of history. It's because we made rules that let rich people steal from everyone else, including local, state and federal tax authorities, and also workers, customers and suppliers (and society at large). From junk fees to wage theft to greedflation, politicians have thumbed the scales in favor of scumbags who drain the wealth of workers and remit it to parasites. These crooks and hustlers keep coming up with ways to squeeze a few more drops out of us. They come up with gimmicks like buy now/pay later (and then slam us with massive fees when we can't pay later), or margin-based gambling on cryptocurrency or &quot;prediction markets,&quot; both of which are crooked poker tables where you are always the sucker and the house always wins. The Trump administration didn't invent the idea of government-supported scams and hustles, but they sure supercharged it. Trump rips off his supporters like crazy – as anyone who's long on $TRUMPcoin knows – and surrounds himself with &quot;businessmen&quot; notorious for scamming workers, customers, and the government itself. But even as Trump throws his support behind hustlers and con artists, he's also backing debt-collectors, whether they're chasing student debt, medical debt, or the spiraling penalties for missing the fourth payment on your Klarna. Broadly, these are the two industries in America now: scammers who put Americans into debt, and industries who torment Americans into paying the debt. And while these two industries represent a moral crisis for the nation, they also represent an economic crisis, because they are at irreconcilable odds with one another. If you're in the business of scamming Americans so they go into debt, you want your suckers to have money (so they can give it to you). But if you're in the business of collecting the losses that Americans incur at the hands of scammers, then you're at odds with those scammers themselves – every dollar you collect on the debt from the last scam is a dollar that can't be lost to the next scam. This is what gave us the Great Financial Crisis: scumbag bankers tricked people into taking out unsustainable mortgages whose &quot;teaser rates&quot; would blow up after a couple years to levels that the borrower couldn't possibly pay back. But the lenders didn't care, because they were only &quot;loan originators&quot; who could pass those loans off to &quot;investors&quot; via exotic financial instruments. These two groups had an irreconcilable conflict: the people making the loans could only keep their scam going so long as the people collecting the loans didn't demand repayment. But these two groups – scammers and arm-breakers – aren't the only two groups in the economy. There's a third group that you might call, &quot;People who want to make useful things that we like and pay for.&quot; This third group is at odds with both the scammers and the arm-breakers, because their potential customers are being tricked (by scammers) and bankrupted (by arm-breakers). Say you want to go into business renting hotel rooms to people at reasonable rates. You're an honest sort, so you list your room prices right there on your site. But the scumbags you're competing with want to rip people off, so they list a lower price than yours, and then whack the customer with junk fees at check-in that make their room more expensive than yours. What's more, the scumbags make so much money that they can bribe the handful of dominant travel sites (which are all owned by one of two massive private-equity backed rollups) to list their hotels ahead of yours. They might not like paying bribes – in fact, they probably hate it – but they're willing to part with some of that hard-won ripoff money to keep the money-machine going. Besides, they can make up the difference with more junk fees. Whaddya gonna do, walk away from your nonrefundable, prepaid reservation and try and get a last-minute booking in a strange city? Societally speaking, the problem is that economic growth only comes from the third group. They're the ones inventing new categories of (useful) products and services that delight their customers and enrich their workers and shareholders (who then buy more things in the economy, keeping the virtuous cycle going). This festering economic zit is finally coming to a head with AI, whose most profitable use is in predicting how much a vendor can charge you – or how little a boss can pay you – without you walking away from the table: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shitrentals/comments/1q38sh4/if">https://www.reddit.com/r/shitrentals/comments/1q38sh4/if</a>_you_get_promoted_at_work_keep_it_a_secret_from/ AI's most enthusiastic customers, meanwhile, are bosses who dream of firing most of their workers and using the ensuing terror to force down the wages of the remaining workers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism</a> If the average American is a squeezed-flat toothpaste tube that's been drained of all its readily extractable contents, then AI is the scissors that slit the tube up the side so that the very last dregs can be scraped out. As Anil Dash put it, Those niceties that everybody loved, like great healthcare and decent benefits, were identified by the people running the big tech companies as “market inefficiencies” which indicated some wealth was going to you that should have been going to them. <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/">https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/</a> The scammer/arm-breaker economy is fundamentally extractive. When a private equity fund buys a company, sells off its assets, declares a special dividend and gives the proceeds to itself, and pronounces the company to have been &quot;right-sized&quot; because now it has to rent the things it used to own, they are setting that company up to fail. All it takes is one rent-shock or a couple bad quarters and a once-healthy business will fall over: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/23/spineless/#invertebrates">https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/23/spineless/#invertebrates</a> Looking at America, it's hard not to ask, &quot;Where did all the money go?&quot; Where did free state college tuition, excellent public libraries, public housing, transit, fully staffed national parks and air-traffic control towers all go? Why can't we fix the potholes? How is it that a country that once electrified itself from top to bottom and sea to sea can't figure out how to run fiber lines to the same roofs where all those power lines connect? It's because the system is organized around cheaters and arm-breakers. The Heritage Foundation – architects of Trump's Project 2025 – were founded and funded by Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos, the guys who made their billions running Amway, a pyramid scheme that was legalized by their pet Congressman, Gerry Ford, shortly after he became president: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway</a> The nation's system has been colonized and is being operated by people whose institutional home was created by pyramid-scheme hucksters. Why doesn't Trump's administration care about scam ads on Twitter and Facebook that clean out the very same Boomers who voted him into office? Because Trump's ideological project was founded by actual, non-metaphorical, non-hyperbolic con artists. That's where the money went. Smart people keep asking how Trump plans on stealing Venezuela's oil when the country is in a state of shambolic collapse and its people are starving? Who will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in new equipment when every dollar spent on capital will require a dollar for a gunman to keep it from being stolen and sold for food? You could ask the same question about America. In a country where we've literally legalized bribery, who wants to invest in productive businesses? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9Ej0L6rGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9Ej0L6rGk</a> America's crisis is the world's opportunity. A chaotic mess of cyberwarfare, trade war, and invasions means that America is no longer your ally or your trading partner – it's a threat. To neutralize that threat, we must take away the money (and thus the power) of America's oligarchs. We start down that path by changing the international laws – passed at the insistence of the US over the past 25 years – that ban foreign tech companies from modifying America's tech products. Once other countries' companies start producing the tools that let farmers fix their tractors, that let games publishers sell outside of the official ripoff app stores, that let merchants avoid the Amazon tax, they will not only reap billions of dollars, they will also create a market that favors good products, rather than scams: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</a> America's largest companies have amassed trillions by robbing Americans (first) and then everyone else (once the US trade rep got laws passed that prevented non-US tech companies from making defensive products). The project of the next ten years is to convert those trillions to billions (in profits for companies that disenshittify America's defective technology – and in savings for people who use those tools to escape America's scam economy). The beneficiaries of this program aren't limited to the investors in foreign tech companies, nor their overseas customers. Americans will also benefit from this technology, because Americans were the first victims of the US scam economy. Everyday Americans pay the app tax, the Amazon tax, the streaming tax, the Apple tax, the Google tax, the Microsoft tax. Supply Americans with the digital arms to resist these corporate raids, and they will stage a tax revolt (a thing that Americans are remarkably good at). Escaping oligarchy, escaping the climate emergency, escaping economic desperation: these goals require doing things and making things. They require real products and services, they require real infrastructure and tools. By and large people would rather have real things than scams. Ponzi America is breaking down. It's run out of suckers. We just can't afford to structure our economy like an Amway downline anymore. We never could.

      <h1>2026-01-02 Xobaque does RFC 5005</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <h1>2026-01-02 Xobaque does RFC 5005</h1>
<p>Very few blogs (this one?) support <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005.html">RFC 5005</a> “Feed Paging and Archiving”.<a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a> is a search engine that doesn’t crawl the web. It gets fed using feeds. That makes it the ideal companion for web rings, blog planets and the like. And I just added blog crawling using RFC 5005 to it.</p>
<p>As long as Xobaque finds a “next” link, it’ll continue following that chain. In order to not overwhelm sites, there’s a 5s pause between these requests. I’m still not sure how good this idea is. A site like my own with a bit more than 6000 blog pages takes over 50 hours to crawl. And a new crawl is started every 24 hours.</p>
<p>In my particular case, the next run that reaches a year-page, however, would notice that it hasn’t changed and stop. So I hope it’s still OK?</p>
<p>I think the next thing I’d like to do is support sitemaps. I don’t have one but all the Blogspot blogs have one. There are 277 Blogspot blogs on the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg">RPG Planet</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with sitemaps, as far as I am concerned, is that you then need to request each and every page. It’s not quite random crawling, but it’s getting closer. 😭</p>
<p><a href="/search/?q=%23Xobaque">#Xobaque</a> <a href="/search/?q=%23Feeds">#Feeds</a></p>
<p><strong>2026-01-03</strong>. There are four blogs on <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg">Planet RPG</a> which don’t allow Xobaque using <code>robots.txt</code>. I wonder if <a href="Jupiter">Planet Jupiter</a> – the software I use to aggregate all the feeeds – takes <code>robots.txt</code> into account? I wrote it so long ago I don’t remember.</p>
<p>As for the timeouts I’ve been getting for Blogspot blogs and others, I think the problem is that their ASN is blocked as per my <a href="Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian Jihad</a>. The <code>fail2ban</code> firewall chain needs an exception.</p>
<p>List the handles:</p>
<pre><code>nft -a list chain inet f2b-table f2b-chain

</code></pre>
<p>Insert the new rule between accept list and <code>fail2ban</code> list:</p>
<pre><code>nft insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain handle 110 \
  ct state established,related accept \
  comment &quot;accept responses to outgoing traffic&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>

	chain f2b-chain { # handle 1
		type filter hook input priority filter - 1; policy accept;

<p><strong>2026-01-04</strong>. I implemented the import of sitemaps and sitemap indexes.
Since those requests will all hit the same host, however, I’m using a hard coded delay of 5s between requests.</p>
<p>What I need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the crawl delay from <code>robots.txt</code>. Sadly, I just discovered that this was an extension that isn’t supported by Google, for example.</li>
<li>How to schedule the full crawl of an OPML such that the individual feed pages are fetched with the least amount of waiting while still upholding the crawl delay per host.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2026-01-07</strong>. I’ve been working on better parallelizing things. The current code assumes that there won’t be all that many locations on the command line (!) and therefore starts a go routine for every OPML file to assemble a list of feeds and in a second step it then starts ten worker go routines that keep working on this task list. If full feeds are being fetched, finding a next page doesn’t delay that go routine anymore. Instead, it starts a new go routine that delays and then adds the new URL to the task list, thus assuring that the delay is kept. And now, as I think about it, I guess that won’t work because at the beginning, when the number of URLs is known, the task channel is stuffed with all the URLs and then closed. Gaaah.</p>
<p><strong>2026-01-08</strong>. I think I fixed it. You don’t close the task channel and the workers use <code>select</code> to get tasks off the channel and if there are no more tasks, they quit. The important part is that the workers must find the “next” link <em>before</em> doing the work of parsing and storing the page so that when they’re done, the next task is already waiting. In previous iterations I was doing that at the end, at which point control returns to the worker, who pulls from the task list … and apparently often enough the task hasn’t arrived, yet. Changing the order of things fixed this issue.</p>
<p>Oh, and just in case the workers all get to go before the job that assembles the tasks, add a tiny millisecond sleep before they get started. Parallel stuff is hard.</p>

      <p>Leaders of many organizations are urging their teams to adopt agentic AI to improve efficiency, but are finding it hard to achieve any benefit. Managers attempting to add AI agents to existing human teams may find that bots fail to faithfully follow their instructions, return pointless or obvious results or burn precious time and resources spinning on tasks that older, simpler systems could have accomplished just as well.</p>
<p>The technical innovators getting the most out of AI are finding that the technology can be remarkably human in its behavior. And the more groups of AI agents are given tasks that require cooperation and collaboration, the more those human-like dynamics emerge...</p>

      <p>This term we will be exploring the meteoric rise of modern Los Angeles through two lenses: the history of its energy infrastructure and of our own institution, Caltech. These two histories intertwine in multiple ways, in the form of big personalities, grand ambitions, and feats of technical bravado. But innumerable smaller, less-visible parts of Caltech and Southern California history also play vital roles in the shaping of this region and our home institution. To trace these stories, large and small, we will be turning to the Caltech Archives and the digital collections of The Huntington Library. You will be learning how to research and communicate the history of archival objects, culminating in a final “group exhibition” of your curated pieces.</p>

      <p>
      <p>How did a young, uneducated peasant girl dressed in men’s clothing, Joan of Arc, plan to crown the son of the mad and feeble Charles VI, the King of all France, and save them from the English?

      <p>rv is a new declarative command-line package manager for the R programming language written in Rust.

In short, I really can't see myself recommending that anyone use any other tool for managing R dependencies any more.</p>
