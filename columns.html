<p>X isn’t Twitter. X isn’t even driven by human emotions any longer and
is run by a management that doesn’t care about people, emotions or the
dangers of propaganda. That’s why a lot of people who made Twitter grow
in the beginning – real content creators – now meet on BlueSky. I do,
too, but […]</p>

This essay is so good. You probably have seen it linked a few times on
social media. I certainly have. And yet, perhaps you have not. If you
have not, it’s a great read tying together our terrible computer
experiences, us being exploited by big tech, enshittification and rot
economy. The growth mindset that kills us all.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Holding these people to a higher standard at scale is what brings about
change. Be the wrench in the machine. Be the person that explains to a
friend why Facebook sucks now, and who chose to make it suck. Be the
person to explain who Prabhakar Raghavan is and what his role was in
making Google Search worse. Be the person who tells people that Sam
Altman burns $5 billion a year on unsustainable software that destroys
the environment and is built upon the large-scale larceny of creative
works because he’s desperate for power. –

<p>
Now there is a mission statement for bloggers and people on social
media.
</p>
<p>
It also confirms my peculiar service offerings like Emacs Wiki or
Campaign Wiki. They are free for users. They are simpler and they don’t
change much. There are no ads and there is no “growth” to be had. In
fact, if more people set up similar sites that are similar in these
respects, it’ll be better for us. We’ll be more resilient, more adapted
to our local needs, it’ll be more like community tools for all of us
instead of slop for us and billions for them. This is where I want to
go.

am ready to start programming ChatGPT, the same way I have built my own
code writing and deploying software on Macintosh. I want to create rules
in some kind of macro language that it will never violate. I find it has
huge problems with memory, it says it’s remembering something, but has
forgotten it 24 hours later. This is like the

Whale</a> in the early days of Twitter. Cute, because the system is
doing something so new, futuristic and useful, but after a while it’s
not cute because we’re using the system for real work. The web is
programmable, our operating systems are, of course the AI-o-verse will
be programmable too. We are able to create entirely new development
environments, these platforms deserve a fresh new look at
<i>everything.</i> I’d also like to note that at the same time, the
platforms are breaking through in web user interfaces. Remarkable
progress. Far beyond what we were doing in the very stagnant Web 2.0
world. They’re still stuck on whether or not our writing can have
titles. So bizarre to have to exist in a world that is deliberately
hobbled, and another with infinite horizons. Anyway this is what I’m
thinking about just before hunkering down with my Knicks and popcorn, a
Christmas tradition for many many years. Ho ho ho.</p>

<p>I have a fairly large and old
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier">C application</a> that
was written to run on the Mac and Windows. I still use it today on a
relatively modern Macintosh. I wonder if it will soon be possible to
turn this project over to an AI like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity or
some other, to convert it to run on Linux, where it should be able to
run in perpetuity, or at least a lot longer than on the Macintosh. I
would be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to do this work.</p>

<p>Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. It was what I needed
to build <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, it defines
its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features
writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no
character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of.
Defining a new network where if you want to play you’ll need to start
thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can’t be on the
open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like
features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into
copying and pasting into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>, that’s how you know you’re in a silo. If you can use any
writing tool to post to a network, then it <i>is</i> on the web. Pretty
simple. Right now – <i>none</i> of the popular ones qualify. None.</p>

idea and realized if it takes off it will turn podcasting into its own
loosely-coupled social network. Really low tech, like the web. And not
possible for one company to control. All it will take is one popular
podcast client to get the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump#Priming_a_pump">pump

This is how it worked with podcasting. Steady mission broadcasting, keep
beating the drum, and if it’s the right idea and when it’s the right
time, eventually, it happens. It will be that way too for this layer of
the network, but at this time I don’t own a podcast client, and that’s
the most basic ingredient in this bootstrap, so we wait, and keep

<p>Today the House Ethics Committee released its report on its
investigation of widely reported allegations that while in office,
former representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) had engaged in sexual misconduct
and illicit drug use, shared inappropriate videos on the House floor,
misused state records, diverted campaign funds for his own use, and
accepted a bribe or an impermissible gift.</p>

<p>December at work was a bit busy. A much more travelling than I have
been used to and also other things. So I had little time for anything
else. Even my cycling (I normally commute daily on a bicycle) was
somewhat limited. Also I had some flu in November and as a result I was
cautious when it came to outdoor and social activities.</p>

<h2 id="css-wants-to-be-a-system">CSS wants to be a system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’ve realized something obvious again, this time about CSS; that CSS
wants to be a system. At the core of CSS is a series of cascading rules
and classes marrying and mingling in an elegant symphony of style
application. Dozens and dozens of declarative instructions for painting
pixels on the screen come together in under a millisecond. Sometimes it
creates magic, other times it creates memes.
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/cssisawesome.png" alt="CSS is aweso-me" height="436" width="600" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
<p>
At its core, CSS wants to be a system and – besides its quirky selector
power ranking algorithm – it doesn’t come with one out of the box. CSS
wants you to build a system with it. It wants styles to build up, not
flatten down. It even has
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer">layers</a>
as a feature! You can start small with a
<a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/">minimalist
reset</a> or satisfy your inner typenerd with a
<a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2433">typographic default</a> and
build up from there. You can make your own reset. You can establish your
own naming convention. You can decide to nest or not. You can use IDs.
You can use only-classes. You can even dip a toe into the Shadow DOM if
you crave the dark arts. Hell, I encourage you to use
<code>!important</code> just to feel something.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone wants to conduct that symphony and I understand that. A
nice thing about that CSS is that it’s sharable! Plenty of pre-built
systems exist to let you offload that skill. Through the magic of
copy-and-paste, you too can have high quality design! But don’t mistake
a shortcut as the only valid option. We as humans and technologists like
to compare objects and declare winners – to be kingmakers! – but it’s a
mistake to shop at only one store and only eat meatballs despite the
ubiquitous appeal of Scandinavian design.
</p>
<p>
CSS wants to be a system and it’s not an impossible task to make your
own. Will there be mistakes and bad assumptions? Yeah. Will there be a
<code>junk.css</code> file? Probably. Will you commit CSS crimes?
Indubitably. Is CSS just thousands of key-value pairs with random
collisions implemented in an uneven distribution among a handful of
different browsers? It sure is, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.
</p>
<p>
In all my years of programming I have never loved a language more than
CSS. There’s no other programming language that sparks my brain and
lights up my imagination like CSS. Even after thirty years, there’s a
rush of adrenaline when I see a complex design and I wonder “How am I
going to make that happen?” which leads me to “And how am I going to
make that happen on a phone and older browsers?” That’s the fun part of
the job. And it’s good to know that there are other people out there who
are great at CSS, people who can build up and tear down these systems
with ease, people I can siphon knowledge from and build up my own skills
when a new challenge arises.
</p>
<p>
So cheers to the CSS folks, the tinkerers. Your obsessive animations,
pixel pushing, and system building – both delicate and strong – are fun
to see and experience.

<p>BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not
staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for
software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook
was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users
are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end
while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral
reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from.
Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in
the 60s,. You would have missed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all
that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the

we need, now, is a system to compete with Twitter. A system as capable
as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted
not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can’t be
guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly.
Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and

needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than
Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.</p>

Godot on iPhone, I forgot to disable it from the TestFlight and it sort
of runs.
</p>
<p>
My opinion was that we should block it, but people love it. And in the
last 12 hours I can’t stop thinking of some easy wins to make it at
least passable.
</p>
<p>
But perhaps the right thing is still to prevent from running on iPhone
or be destroyed by unhappy users reviews
