2024-07-23 Eglot for Go, Perl and Markdown
</h1>
<p>
Apparently there’s a way to have Oddµ and Eglot cooperate in Emacs using
<a href="https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman">Marksman</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that LSP integration only works in a “project”: a VCS repository,
or in the case of Marksman, a directory containing an (empty)
<code>.marksman.toml</code> file. This latter option is important if
your notes aren’t under version control.
</p>
<p>
After installing the Marksman binary, use something like the following.
This installs Eglot for Go mode, Perl mode and Markdown mode.
</p>
<pre><code>;; There is probably a way to put this inside the use-package form but
;; this is how it works for me.
(add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'perl-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(autoload 'eglot-ensure &quot;eglot&quot; &quot;Start Eglot session for current buffer if there isn’t one.&quot;)

(use-package eglot :ensure t
  :config (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(markdown-mode . (&quot;marksman&quot;))))

(setq-default eglot-workspace-configuration

<p>All the reporters know the Repubs refused to fund border stuff so
they could use it to tag the Dems in the election. So the first thing
the Repubs do is tag VP Harris with the border. The reporter asks a Dem
what they have to say about that. But the reporter <i>knows</i> what the
Repubs did. So why do they even ask the freaking question? They just
play the script the Repubs wrote for them. They are so savvy, but we
heard all that too, so we know how corrupt they are. They don’t care if
we know.</p>

<h2 id="podcast-starts-with-linkblogging">Podcast starts with
linkblogging</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A 20-minute morning coffee notes rambler
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/23/randomMorningCoffeeNotes.m4a">podcast</a>,
started with a narration of how we do linkblogging these days, mostly by
hand, and how Bluesky is being hurt by not having a large-enough
character limit. Another plea for textcasting, some standards for what
we put on the wire over the social web.
</p>
<p>
Also talked about twitter-like systems, and idea borrowed from
algol-like and lisp-like.
</p>
<p>
I talk about what made Unix so great.
</p>
<p>
Eric Raymond once told me that <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>
was very much like Unix, and I said oh yeah, and so is
<a href="http://reallysimple.org/">RSS</a> and the rest. Huge compliment
because the simplicity of Unix is what I strive for, put huge time into.
</p>
<p>
Journos once said Apple is dead, but that was ridiculous because they
had built a product that was just starting to grow and they had planted
the seeds of huge growth in the 80s when they focused on selling to
education, which made sure that kids when they grew up would have good
feelings about Apple, and it totally worked. When the reporters were
calling them dead, they were actually just about to boom in a whole new
way, on the web, which the Mac was perfect for, given the built in
simple networking. And then boom again when Jobs came back. And again
with the iPod and then again with the iPhone. See how reporters miss the
big picture. We shouldn’t give them so much power, they pretend they
know, but they are usually pretty clueless.
</p>
<p>
This podcast is also a demo of how my mind works. I flit around all over
the place but also have learned over the years that if I want to get
anything done I have to focus on one thing for at least a few hours
every day, and string those days together.
</p>
<p>
I want to document this stuff for the benefit of young programmers. I
learned a lot from reading the code of Unix, I always want to pay that
back, the message is to strive for simplicity, keep technical debt to a
minimum, and factor, factor and factor again to reduce technical debt.
Those are the hardest projects, I’m doing one of those right now, but in
the end it’s worth it, because with simplicity you get to build higher.

twitter. This
<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-lover-elon-musk-already-145940678.html">report</a>
says that Musk is rate-limiting followers on that account. Of course we
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">warned</a>
what could happen if a Republican bought twitter, but I didn’t honestly
contemplate that a fascist would. These days our greatest fears aren’t
scary enough. People laugh that Musk paid too much for twitter, but if
the US ends up as an autocracy, the oligarch that owns the entire news
distribution system for the world will probably have the last laugh.
BTW, if you want to know why we’re so thrilled to have Harris as the
candidate, even though we didn’t want Joe to give in, it’s because no
informed and sane person wants to live in a new Trump term. We tried
that if you recall. The hope you hear now is much greater than the hope
we had when Obama was selling that (though hope was a good word for it).
Today it’s the hope that we won’t be deported or worse.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">2024-07-21 What was
hard about the Oddµ architecture?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-21-what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">
2024-07-21 What was hard about the Oddµ architecture?
</h1>
<p>
If you know Go, I think you’ll find the architecture of Oddmu to be very
traditional: There is a list of actions it knows how to handle when it
serves a site on the web and a list of commands it understands when
called from the shell. Everything involving HTML or the RSS feed uses a
Go template.
</p>
<p>
There were two things that were tricky, in hindsight. I didn’t know
enough Go to know how best to do it and so it took me a long time to
figure them out.
</p>
<p>
The first was what data to keep in memory. I didn’t want search to
involve a database so I experimented a lot with different ways of
indexing the content. Trigrams? Full-text? And what about scoring? In
the end, I dropped all of that. The only thing I keep in memory is a map
of page names and page titles as well as a map of hashtags and pages. I
find that searching titles and hashtags is what I do most often. For
everything else, I search the files. This, of course, is much slower but
for a site of ten thousand pages it’s still fast enough. So figuring out
how to do search was hard. Once I had this figured out, I discovered
that keeping maps in memory when there are multiple Go routines being
used by the web server means that I need locks. Both of my maps are in
fact data structures that each contain a map and a lock. This was new to
me and it took me a long time to realize that having the lock was
important. For a while, I didn’t have those locks. 😅
</p>
<p>
The second thing that took me a long time to get right is that I wanted
pages to be served from Oddµ when it runs as a web server and I wanted
to be able to edit files locally and upload them (using rsync, for
example) while it was still running on the server. I didn’t know about
watching the filesystem for changes and had to learn how to do this: a
watcher per directory, spawning new watchers when directories are
created, and updating those maps I keep in memory as files are added,
deleted or edited.
</p>
<p>
Watching the files introduced another complication, however: What if a
user edited a page via the web? I already had code in place that would
update my maps. Now the file system watcher would report the same file
being written to, resulting in two updates. And what about a change to a
file that results in multiple events: create a file, write something to
the file, write some more to the file. Three events resulting in three
updates? The code is therefore complicated.
</p>
<p>
If Oddµ knows that a file is going to change ahead of time, like when a
user on the web saves an edit, the file is added to a map of ignored
files for a second. When the file system watcher sees those changes, no
updates are done because it knows that the edit handler already does it.
</p>
<p>
If Oddµ sees a file change because of somebody editing files directly, a
one second timer is started. If another event for the same file arrives,
the timer is reset to one second. Only when a second has elapsed without
changes does the watcher do the updates to the internal data structures.
That is to say, changes made to the file system regarding page title
changes or hash tag changes take an effect on the web with a one second
delay.
</p>
<p>
So now, with all that in place, think of all the go routines running in
parallel. Every one second timer is a go routine. Every go routine
accessing a map like the map if files to ignore means that this map
needs to be a data structure containing a map and a lock.
</p>
<p>
When I look at that part of the code, I still get dizzy. 😵‍💫

<strong>2024-07-21</strong>.
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bouncepaw">@bouncepaw</span></a> asked
about usability issues, specially in the context of using Oddµ for
picture galleries. In my case, I think the hardest part is finding
particular pictures. Consider <a href="2020-blumen/index">the page of
flowers in 2020</a>. I know that there’s a sanseveria in bloom on that
page, for example. But how can I find it? I can find the page if I
search for “bogenhanf #pictures”, and then I can search for the same
word on the page, and then I have to wait for a bit as the browser
lazy-loads pictures.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, if I could get into the habit of putting the image description
into the Markdown alt text, I could index all the images and their alt
text, providing direct access to the images. I guess I would also have
to add special code to the Markdown renderer that made the alt text
visible for regular visitors (as title attribute or as regular
paragraphs). That’d be interesting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later</strong>. I have implemented something useful, I hope. If
one of the search terms (excluding hashtags and predicates) matches an
alt-text of an image, that image is included in the result.
</p>
<p>
Of course, almost none of my galleries use the alt-text, so right now
there aren’t many pages that will show results for a query like
“bogenhanf #pictures”.
</p>
<p>
My expectations regarding alt texts and title attributes for images have
changed significantly as I’ve spent time on fedi, so I’m really not sure
what to do about Markdown in this respect. Right now I’m in the habit of
adding neither alt-text nor title attribute, trying to provide enough
text in the paragraphs above or below. With this new search option, that
might have to change, too. As a sighted person, I sort of expect the
title attribute to be the same as the alt text.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Sometimes I have the urge to write a small
editor, something like the kilo project: so small that it is barely
usable. I also imagine it to have a sort of conversational UI – which I
guess ed has? – if ed is your grumpiest of companions! – or maybe the
M-x commands for emacs – and I guess I‘m looking at Oddmu as a site
generator and Markdown file server and I wonder: what sort of editor
would I need to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing
capabilities would be nice to have?

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">The
state of Docker on popular RISC-V platforms</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been testing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/47&quot;&gt;Milk-V Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; this week, and have tested a number of other RISC-V development boards over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
As with any new CPU architecture, software support and ease of adoption
are extremely important if you want to reach a wider audience. I
wouldn’t expect every developer and SBC hobbyist to be able to compile
the Linux kernel, and the need to compile much of anything these days is
getting rare. So having any instance where one <em>has</em> to know how
to tweak a Makefile or pass in different flags to a compiler is a bit of
a turn-off for platform adoption.
</p>
<p>
So one thing I’ve followed closely is how easy it is for me to get my
own software running on RISC-V boards. It’s one thing to run some
vendor-provided demos. It’s another entirely to take my real-world
applications and infrastructure apps, and get them to work without
hassle.
</p>
<p>
And to that end, Docker and Ansible, two tools I use extensively for
dev/ops work, both run stably—though with plenty of caveats since RISC-V
is still so new.

I grew up in the same part of Queens as Trump, about ten years after he
did. His family was in Jamaica, mine in Flushing. Here’s a
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/2931+170th+Street,+Queens,+NY/85-15+Wareham+Pl,+Jamaica,+NY+11432/@40.74413,-73.7982607,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7948958!2d40.7696471!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2611ad4d2c6a5:0xfe60c1b9262c3e04!2m2!1d-73.7858048!2d40.7170409!3e0?entry=ttu">map</a>
that shows you where the two houses are. 4.0 miles apart if you take
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway">Utopia
Parkway</a>. A great name for a street, but it’s not a parkway and it’s
nice but definitely not a utopia.
</p>
<p>
People who aren’t from huge cities like New York don’t know that Trump
what our losers look like. They probably have their own loser types. I
think that’s where 99% of the confusion is. They really don’t believe
he’s so bad. Don’t hold that against them, that’s nowhere near as bad as
knowing what he is and being okay with that.
</p>
<p>
He’s a mean bully type. The name-calling is a big clue. Distracts from
<i>his</i> weaknesses, which are very obvious. I don’t believe in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shaming">body shaming</a>,
because I care about other people’s feelings. If I criticize his
appearance it might reflect poorly on nice people who have his body type
who may not be mean bully losers like Trump.
</p>
<p>
He’s also a really good comedian if you don’t think he wants to have the
power to kill millions of people and control many more people. Last time
he was our president just through incompetence, without trying, he was
responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the
Covid disaster. He also wanted the army shoot protestors, that’s the
mean part of our former president. Luckily the people who worked for him
told him to fuck off. They saved us from going into a very deep hole
that would have been hard to escape from.
</p>
<p>
I watched the coverage of the aftermath of the assassination attempt,
and listened to the Americans they interviewed, not the actors they put
behind him on stage, to make him look like a badass I guess, these were
just normal people who mostly like Trump, but seem pretty likeable
themselves. The one thing you heard over and over was how If you don’t
like a candidate vote against them don’t shoot them. That’s American and
it’s not fascist at all. I don’t think they know that he wants to make
big changes in how our politics work. People think if he’s bad they can
just vote him out next time. He tells them this will be the last
election if he wins, he actually says that, but somehow it doesn’t seem
to register.
</p>
<p>
<div class="divInlineImage">

<img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/22/massDeportationNow.png">
</center>
Do Trump supporters understand what they support?
</div>
</p>
<p>
Of course the journalists are distorting who Trump supporters are. Trump
is deplorable if you take him at his word. Some of Trump’s followers are
deplorable too, like the ones who rioted at our Capitol and January 6
and the people who are lined up to work in his next administration if he
wins. They are awful people who want to control all of us. They’re
already doing it via the Supreme Court. It’s going to get a lot worse if
we go the wrong way. We shouldn’t accept that we’re horribly divided.
The powerful media people want us to be divided, I don’t know why and I
don’t care, I just know they do, based on their actions.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I know we’re at a high moment, we’re excited, and I’m going to
enjoy the feeling. We all seem to be pulling the same way, at least on
“our side” but I hold out hope that being an American still means
something, that we can be friends, and fellow countrymen, and work
together. I think that’s still our greatest challange and our greatest
opportunity. Yeah I am woke, that means I care about all of us. I think
most of us do no matter who you vote for.

2024-07-20 Bots again
</h1>
<p>
Today I couldn’t log into the server. <code>ssh</code> just sat there,
waiting for the server. Some web page loaded a few bytes and stopped. I
knew it: some idiot had once again written a bot that was hitting my web
apps (also known as “expensive endpoints”) because they ignored all the
rules. They also didn’t get caught by fail2ban because of they were
using cloud services, of course. And the only thing that helps against
these fuckers is banning the whole network. Time to get working.
</p>
<p>
First, I had to reboot the server via the website of my service
provider.
</p>
<p>
Then I had to figure out which app it was. It’s impossible for me to
find out. All my expensive apps are from a directory called
<code>/home/alex/farm</code>.
</p>
<p>
When I look at the system log file I, find entries like these:

This is not helping. Who is 12041? There are large lists of the process
identifiers and some numbers in the log, but the name is always
shortened:

<p>
Useless.
</p>
<p>
By that time, however, the system was slowing down again. I fired up
<code>htop</code> and saw a gazillion instances of the Community Wiki
script. Looking at the <code>/etc/log/apache2/access.log</code> file
shows that bots were requesting the edit pages (!) of all the thousands
of Community Wiki pages.
</p>
<p>
Thanks, idiots.
</p>
<p>
I needed to find where these requests where coming from. My
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/leech-detector">leech-detector</a>
script was as limited to single IP numbers as fail2ban. So the first
order of business was to add some functionality: If given the option
<code>–networks</code>, it now looks up the network range the requests
come from and reports those:
</p>
<pre><code>tail -n 50 /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep communitywiki | bin/admin/leech-detector --networks
</code></pre>
<p>
This is expensive, of course, so I try to cache the
<a href="https://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/index.php/collectors/">Route
View ASN lookups</a> but the cache doesn’t persist between calls. Using
a small number of rows is the correct approach, here.
</p>
<p>
The result is a table like the one below. When I ran it, I used 400 rows
or so.

If you then start using <code>whois</code> on the numbers, you’ll see:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
117.22.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
59.172.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
114.104.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
220.184.0.0 → Zhejiang Telecom
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think you know where this is going.
</p>
<p>
And so I copying the network IP, calling <code>whois</code>, verifying
that it was Chinese Telecom or related, and added it to my
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> script.
(Note how I’m using <code>netfilter-persistent</code> these days so that
I don’t have to run <code>ban-cidr</code> after every server restart.)
</p>
<p>
And now I’m going to add the ranges above to the script.
</p>
<p>
Some days I feel like I’m slowly starting to ban the whole commercial
cloud service internet because nothing good ever seems to come of it. Do
you feel the same?

<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Here’s another slight annoyance, for
<code>ngircd</code>. There are a lot of log lines for a day:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21&quot;|wc -l
7436
</code></pre>
<p>
More than half of them come from a single IP hosted by Octopuce:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*2001:67c:288:2::231&quot;|wc -l
4347
</code></pre>
<p>
They all have this format:
</p>
<pre><code>Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Accepted connection 16 from &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; on socket 8.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Using X509 credentials from slot 0
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; ...
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Client unregistered (connection 16): SSL accept error, closing socket.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Connection 16 with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; closed (in: 0.0k, out: 0.0k).
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m going to try and use <code>fail2ban</code> for this.
</p>
<p>
Looks like this is happening every 10 seconds:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*Shutting down&quot;|tail|cut -d ' ' -f 3
23:58:23
23:58:33
23:58:43
23:58:53
23:59:03
23:59:13
23:59:23
23:59:33
23:59:43
23:59:53
</code></pre>
<p>
So here’s my attempt at a filter,
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/ngircd.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Fail2Ban filter for failed ssl connections to the ngIRC daemon

[INCLUDES]
# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from
# common.local
before = common.conf

[Definition]
# Example:
# Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:44846&quot;
_daemon = ngircd
failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)sShutting down connection [0-9]+ \(SSL accept error, closing socket\) with &quot;&lt;HOST&gt;:[0-9]+&quot; \.\.\.$
ignoreregex = 

[Init]
journalmatch = _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ngircd.service + _COMM=ngircd

# Author: Alex Schroeder
</code></pre>
<p>
And this is the jail, <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ngircd.conf</code> –
and here I want to ban them after four failed connects in a minute.
Remember the default ban lasts 10 minutes. Since this attack is moving
so slowly, I want to increase this ban time to an hour.
</p>
<pre><code>[ngircd]
enabled = true
findtime = 60
maxretry = 4
bantime = 60m
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s give it a try!
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload fail2ban
</code></pre>
<p>
Then again: fail2ban is only for future attacks. The current level of
persistency also deserves its own treatment:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ipset add banlist6 2001:67c:288:2::231
</code></pre>
<p>
There we go.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and as soon as I did that, it switched to 91.194.61.231, but only
once every two or three minutes. Still Octopuce, though.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add banlist 91.194.60.0/23
</code></pre>
<p>

there is a

resolves it in a minute, if the Cabinet goes along with the idea that
the current president isn’t able to do the job, and if being re-elected
is a legitimate part of doing the job.

Pretty sure most people don’t get that being president is a job, not a
role someone plays in a TV sitcom.

Great wealth is poison, that’s what’s playing out in the
NYT-orchestrated overthrow of the American government. They’re driving
us into the arms of the Nazis. Who knows why, or even if there is a
reason, other than their drive to find meaning in their great wealth.
Their problem, and ours, is that it has no meaning, no human can use the
money they’ve accumulated. These are not human-size fortunes, playing a
game of make-believe, what if we really were as smart as we think our
money says we are. Well you ain’t that smart.
