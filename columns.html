<h2 id="pseudo-code-and-kitchen-table-conversations">Pseudo code and
kitchen table conversations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Today‚Äôs
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/10/07/pseudoCodeAndKitchenTableConversations.html">podcast</a>
has nothing to do with the 30 year milestone, except that it is totally
unscripted, stream of consciousness, for 30 minutes, on two topics.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The idea of what a programming language is, is about to be completely
overturned. The verbs and nouns will, at least at first, be pretty much
exactly like we do it now, but the way you specify how they work, how
they interact both in the UI and on the backend, will be done more or
less as you would document the user interface. The AI system is almost
ready to work at that level. With a few more iterations by human
designers it should all meet up in a place where the slogging type work
I‚Äôve been doing for 50+ years will be obsolete. We will all become
anachronisms. All of us. Get ready for it. And btw I was the biggest
skeptic of the idea of a higher level more human way of programming.
Scoffed at the idea. Repeatedly. Never say you can‚Äôt teach an old dog
new tricks.
</li>
<li>
The second part is about kitchen-table conversations in families, the
bored rantings of our ancestors, passed on lovingly from generation to
generation. Should have realized that we did not turn a racial corner
with the election of Obama, we all should have gotten prepared for the
backlash from children of the slavers and fascists, who were raised
alongside us as victims of slavery and fascism were raised to feel
persecuted. We all revert to our comfortable roles. The question is can
we rise above that and forget for a moment what our ancestors taught us
as gospel and take an interest in going beyond that, or do we have to do
another loop around the genocide and its consequences, which this time
will be <i>far worse</i> than they were in the 1940s because of all the
new war and computer tech and the damage done by the post-war growth.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I feel good about this podcast, because it has nothing to do with the
milestone. I have an idea of what it feels like to have been blogging
for 30 years, but no conclusions to offer that would mean anything to me
or anyone else, except perhaps a psychologist.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been watching a lot of sports recently and the interviews with star
athletes saying the same predictable bullshit after being asked how it
felt to do whatever heroic thing they just did. All of TV and news is
like that, none of it is news, all of it is predictable bullshit. That
is probably why they have so much trouble reporting the truth about
Trump and Musk. It doesn‚Äôt fit into their job description, it‚Äôs not in
anyone‚Äôs job to tell the truth. And <i>that‚Äôs</i> the truth.

in the Guardian, I‚Äôm hearing from people all over the world about what
blogging means to them. I appreciate all of the messages, but would
appreciate them <i>even more</i> if they were on your blog. We need to
keep using the tech. Blogging is kind of lost, and I would like to see
that change. Every time you post something you‚Äôre proud of on a social
media site, how about taking a moment and posting it to your blog too.
And while there, if appropriate, link to something from some part of
your post, even though the social media sites don‚Äôt support linking, the
web is still there and it still does.</p>

<h2 id="how-about-those-mets-day-2">How about those Mets, day 2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
I am reminded of 2015, when the Mets were so charmed ‚Äì they could be
down 9-0 in the 8th inning and you would tune into the game to see how
they‚Äôd win it. It‚Äôs not the usual thing for the Mets, who pull defeat
from the jaws of victory far more often than the other way.
</p>
<p>
And omg, 2024 is shaping up the same way.
</p>
<p>
Sit down and shut up, here come the Mets!
</p>
<p>
Briefly, because I have stuff to do ‚Äì the Mets were down 1-0 in the
bottom of the 8th, having been thoroughly shut down by the amazing Zach
Wheeler. Imagine someone throwing a ball at you at 100 mph that looks
like it‚Äôs going down but actually goes up and to the left. Or next time
down and to the right. You could try to swing but you‚Äôd have to be very
lucky to connect. And so it was for the first seven innings until they
took out Wheeler (pitchers don‚Äôt do complete games any longer, they used
to).
</p>
<p>
The Mets were ready. Hit after hit after hit and before you knew it, it
was 5-1. Alonso, the star of the last Milwaukee game drove in one of the
runs with a long sacrifice fly to center.
</p>
<p>
The Phillies and their fans who had been so confident of victory were
shocked. And left to plan for today‚Äôs game at 4PM on Fox. You gotta know
where I‚Äôll be ‚Äì glued to the set and dreaming about the fate of this
Mets team who shows real signs of strong

<h2 id="wordpress-destiny-day-2">WordPress destiny, day 2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Glad I wrote the piece I wrote
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html?title=wordPressDestiny1">yesterday</a>.
</p>
<p>
I could have written it any time in the last year as I was investigating
and developing on the WordPress API and back end, but now seemed to be a
good time, with all the attention its getting, and Matt‚Äôs interviews, I
and others are getting a better idea of what the various components of
the community are. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of you, but I had only a
vague idea of what WordPress is beyond a piece of software used for
commerce and to a lesser extent these days, writing on the web.
</p>
<p>
A few ideas ‚Äì not in any particular order:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
From my point of view, blogging and the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>, WordPress is being
built <i>around</i> more than being built on, when it is such a
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">potent</a> and surprisingly open
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef">platform</a>.
I took the time to look, and underneath the cluttered user interface is
a strong foundation that you could build <i>any kind of writing
software</i> on.
</li>
<li>
If a community developed at this level, writing tools, we‚Äôd be
compatible at a very deep level, so the opportunities for
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">interop</a>
are amazing. I don‚Äôt say that lightly. (I had asked them to allow apps
to attach their own data to posts for years, until I discovered earlier
this year the API has that feature. If only they had listened to the
question and answered it thoughtfully, we could have saved years. The
company desperately needs an evangelism function.)
</li>
<li>
The WordPress platform could be a very strong part of the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>. The comparison
between developer freedom on the WordPress platform and the Facebook one
(which is what Threads is built on) is stark. I have worked on the
Facebook platform, btw ‚Äì and from a software design perspective it‚Äôs
brilliant, a breakthrough, something to emulate, which I did in the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpidentity</a> package
I wrote. But from a policy standpoint, after the 2016 election
Facebook‚Äôs API was radically restricted, not something many people know
about (it was a fully public event). WordPress has an API that doesn‚Äôt
appear to have any such limits, and even if they imposed them, in theory
their server could be cloned (it‚Äôs open source) but it certainly could
be emulated at an API level.
</li>
<li>
It‚Äôs enticing. All those users ‚Äì there should be a market for writing
tools there, but there isn‚Äôt. Why is that??
</li>
<li>
I feel like we‚Äôre like ships passing in the night. I thought I should
point this out, at least once, as Matt and company go off in a direction
I don‚Äôt understand and don‚Äôt see why I should want to. Did they care
when the move to HTTPS undermined what remains of the original
blogosphere? I don‚Äôt see any evidence of it. It‚Äôs like Walmart sought to
build a shopping center on the remains of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">Library of
Alexandria</a>. People don‚Äôt seem to have any respect for independent
writing on the web, what we dreamed of in the beginning, and <i>the
dream was realized.</i> No wonder the tech industry wants to tear it
down. It contradicts a basic premise of the programming priesthood. And
no wonder journalism doesn‚Äôt defend it, they are offended by the idea of
people writing for free, based on the incorrect assumption about what we
do. We‚Äôre their sources, dammit, not their competitors, at least if they
would do their jobs (which is another problem altogether) and if they
spent any time thinking and questioning before condeming.
</li>
<li>
Look at
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer">John
Naughton‚Äôs piece</a> today in the Guardian. He‚Äôs doing more to focus
attention on the web as a writing environment than the whole tech
industry which is built on our work, especially Automattic. The
ignorance and in some cases resentment in the industry is huge,
something else Naughton points out so well. We can turn this around, I
guess since WordPress is open source, it doesn‚Äôt have to wait for Matt
to turn in that direction.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Just some thoughts as the world seems to be converging on something, not
sure what. There are so many doors that are now open that never were
before, the question is ‚Äì do we have the courage to connect the dots and
work together, or do we all insist on going our own ways to a fairly
dark future.
</p>
<p>
PS: If you‚Äôre a developer, this is the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">API</a>
you use in browser-JS code for the wpidentity package. This was the way
Facebook packaged their API for developers, and it was far more
efficient than the way Twitter did and WordPress too. So I added this to
the stack, and built on it.
