<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Podcast:
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/21/iProgramMoreSlowlyNowThanksToChatGPT.m4a">27
minutes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sorry about the recording quality, I was in a large space with bad
acoustics. I’ll try to remember not to do that in the future.
</p>
<p>
I’ve noticed I spend less time programming, I go more slowly and
carefully because now I can know a lot more about each problem I’m
solving, and use the packages I build on, jQuery, MySQL, Node, the
browser, Bootstrap, Font-awesome, Frontier, to greater advantage. A new
kind of programming is possible, and it’s better.
</p>
<p>
I go into some detail in this podcast about how the process works.
</p>
<p>
Interested in hearing similar stories from other developers using
ChatGPT or something like it.

it is termed

<blockquote>
it is defined as the process of seeking electoral victory or legislative

Currently, the crypto-bros have poured money into primaries, defeated
several incumbents deemed to be insufficiently crypto-friendly, and have
accumulated an immense war-chest for November’s general election. This
pot of gold was enough to turn Trump from

Below the fold I discuss the gaslighting the cryptosphere is using in
their massive attempt to purchase “regulatory clarity”, and what the
scale of this investment suggests about the profits they expect to
garner if it succeeds.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Why
does astroturfing exist? Lobbyists going to politicians and saying “I
know your constituents don’t want you to vote X, but if you do I’ll give
you a boiat-load of money” make the politicians uncomfortable. The
lobbyists need to cover this unpleasant reality with a fig-leaf. So on

A <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/swingstatevoter/">poll

issue.
<a href="https://policy.paradigm.xyz/writing/March-2024-Polling">A
separate nationwide survey</a> of registered voters commissioned by the
crypto firm Paradigm found that crypto ownership is higher among
communities of color and young people — key constituencies that helped
boost Biden in 2020 but are now proving to be challenging for him to win
over.<br /> <br /> Crypto has gained support from politicians on the
right who tout it as an alternative to the mainstream financial system.
The Paradigm poll found earlier this year that crypto owners favor Trump
over Biden, 48 percent to 39 percent, with 13 percent undecided.

translates into pro-crypto sentiments across the board” and advising
political candidates to adopt pro-crypto stances to attract voters. Many
of the questions were framed ambiguously — such as the “Crypto is a
major issue I’m considering during the next election” one — which
allowed DCG to put “21% agree” in big letters while obfuscating the fact
that those who agreed were not necessarily crypto supporters. In fact,
if you do the math, more than 100 of the 252 people (~40%) who said they
felt crypto was a major issue in upcoming elections do not feel
positively towards crypto — in other words, there’s a contingent of
fellow skeptics among that 21%, who are likely hoping for candidates who
might support more aggressive approaches against the industry.<br />
</blockquote>
White extracted the agree/disagree data from the Harris poll and
generated a useful chart. From it I extracted the questions that two out
of three respondents somewhat or strongly disagreed with in this
table.<br />

This is not a pro-crypto sample. I have to agree with White that DGC is
gaslighting the results. She
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/2024-cryptocurrency-election-spending/">concluded</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Frankly, it just doesn’t seem likely to me that a substantial number of
people are single-issue crypto voters and would be swayed to vote for a
candidate they might not otherwise support because of it. Many of the
people celebrating Trump’s recent crypto U-turn were probably already
planning to vote for him, and I doubt there were many crypto-skeptical
people out there previously who didn’t otherwise support Trump, but who
intended to vote for him because of his former position on the industry.
</blockquote>
The most worrying answer is that 73% of the sample are not paying
attention to candidates’ positions on cryptocurrencies; this gives the
candidates license to ignore their constituents’ anti-crypto
views.<br /> <br />

Covered by this bogus fig-leaf, the tsunami of money started flowing.
May 30<sup>th</sup> saw some of the first reports of money with Hannah
Miller and Olga Kharif’s
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/andreessen-horowitz-a16z-donates-25-million-to-crypto-pac-fairshake"><i>Andreessen
Horowitz Donates $25 Million to Fairshake PAC</i></a> and Molly White’s
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/2024-cryptocurrency-election-spending/"><i>Cryptocurrency
companies have raised over $135 million to influence US elections this
cycle, and they’re just getting started</i></a>. White went on to start
<a href="https://www.followthecrypto.org/"><i>Follow the crypto</i></a>,
a site devoted to tracking the cryptosphere’s political fundraising and
donations. Much of this post is based on White’s research.<br /> <br />
Initially, the crypto-bros had consideable success by pouring money into
defeating crypto-skeptics in primaries, as the Emily Wilkins’
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/crypto-pac-house-senate-elections.html"><i>Crypto
industry super PAC is 33-2 in primaries, with $100 million for House,
Senate races</i></a> reported on 26<sup>th</sup> June:<br />
<blockquote>
A super PAC bankrolled by a small group of crypto companies has backed
the winning candidate in 33 of the 35 House and Senate primary races it
entered.<br /> <br /> Fairshake PAC kicks off the general election
season with a strong track record and at least $100 million to spend on
crypto-friendly candidates for Congress.
</blockquote>
Wilkins made two important
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/crypto-pac-house-senate-elections.html">observations</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The PAC has spent tens of millions already on ads that rarely mention
crypto. Instead, the messages they deliver are about “fairness” and
“integrity.”
</blockquote>
Note that the crypto-bros aren’t fooled by their gaslighting; they know
that the vast majority of the voters are anti-crypto. Molly White’s
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-64/"><i>Pointing its
arsenal at our friends</i></a> makes the point:<br />
<blockquote>
I’ve noted before that, despite the industry’s attempts to convince
incumbent politicians, candidates, campaign managers, and anyone else
who will listen that there is a major bloc of single-issue voters who
will vote for people with pro-crypto policy stances, the people in
charge of actually running strategy don’t seem to truly believe it. Ads
run by the Fairshake PAC and related crypto-focused super PACs make no
mention of cryptocurrency, for example, suggesting that those behind
them understand that it’s not an issue that’s likely to sway voters.
</blockquote>
Wilkins’ second
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/crypto-pac-house-senate-elections.html">observation
is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Of the $160 million in total contributions Fairshake has raised since it
was founded, around $155 million — or 94% — can be traced back to just
four companies: Ripple, Andreesen Horowitz, Coinbase and Jump Crypto.
</blockquote>
And note the classic astroturfing; a PAC funded by a few huge companies
claiming to represent the
“<a href="https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report/">40%
of American adults now own crypto</a>”. This is more gaslighting. Other
crypto-friendly sites claim
“<a href="https://coinweb.com/trends/how-many-americans-own-crypto/">14%
of US adults own cryptocurrencies</a>”.<br /> <br /> Grifters like Trump
know which side their bread is buttered. Already by 7<sup>th</sup> June
Alexandra Ulmer was writing
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pitches-himself-crypto-president-san-francisco-tech-fundraiser-2024-06-07/"><i>Trump
pitches himself as ‘crypto president’ at San Francisco tech

<blockquote>
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump presented himself as a
champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats’ attempts to regulate
the sector during a San Francisco fundraiser on Thursday, three sources
present told Reuters.<br /> <br /> Trump raised $12 million from the
fundraiser hosted by tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath
Palihapitiya at Sacks’ home in the swanky Pacific Heights neighborhood.
</blockquote>
Four days later David Pan reported
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/trump-meets-bitcoin-btc-miners-in-his-latest-pro-crypto-overture"><i>Trump

<blockquote>
Several Bitcoin miners met with former president Donald Trump at
Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night, according to Matthew Schultz, executive
chairman at crypto mining company CleanSpark Inc.<br /> <br /> Trump
told attendees that he loves and understands cryptocurrency, adding that
Bitcoin miners help to stabilize energy supply from the grid, according
to Schultz. Trump said he’d be an advocate for miners in the White
House, Schultz added.
</blockquote>
This culminated on 27<sup>th</sup> July at the recent
<a href="https://bitcoin2024.b.tc/">Bitcoin2024</a> gathering of the
faithful with a bizarre
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiEIfBatnH8">48-minute rambling
monologue</a> that was mostly a rehash of his stump speech.<br /> <br />
Six days earlier, Joe Biden had dropped out of the race, disrupting the
crypto-bros plans. Molly White
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-64/">observes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But it does seem that some of the more gullible executives and
figureheads within the crypto world have themselves been bamboozled by
the
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/2024-cryptocurrency-election-spending/">questionable
numbers and creatively interpreted polls</a>. The feeling among that
group is not that they need to pursue a positive relationship with a
possible future Harris administration, but rather that this supposed
crypto vote will decide the election, and that they are its gatekeepers.
</blockquote>
Like me, Cory Doctorow leverages White’s research in
<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/31/greater-fools/#coinbased"><i>The
largest campaign finance violation in US history</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<tt> But the real whale that’s backstopping the crypto campaign spending
is Coinbase, through its Fairshake crypto PAC. Coinbase has donated
$45,500,000 to Fairshake, which is a lot:<br /> <br />
<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/how-to-get-regulatory-clarity-for-crypto&lt;">https://www.coinbase.com/blog/how-to-get-regulatory-clarity-for-crypto</a><br />
<br /> But $45.5m isn’t merely a large campaign contribution: it appears
that $25m of that is the largest illegal campaign contribution by a
federal contractor in history, “by far,” a fact that was sleuthed out by
Molly White:<br /> <br />
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/coinbase-campaign-finance-violation/">https://www.citationneeded.news/coinbase-campaign-finance-violation/</a><br />
<br /> At issue is the fact that Coinbase is bidding to be a US federal
contractor: specifically, they want to manage the crypto wallets that US
federal cops keep seizing from crime kingpins. Once Coinbase threw its
hat into the federal contracting ring, it disqualified itself from
donating to politicians or funding PACs: </tt>
</blockquote>
<p>How wonderful is it that this great country enjoys the blessings of
democracy? Just imagine how much money the companies donating to these
PACs stand to make from obtaining “regulatory clarity” if they are
“investing” close to $200M in a <i>chance</i> to get it.<br />

There often is a NY Times headline in the image, saying something silly
like how prisons are dealing with an influx of convicted house pets
(like the kitten).

<p>
In this

cute she is (it’s important to emphasize that in the AI prompt because
otherwise you get less cute kittens in the drawing).
</p>
<p>
This is therapeutic. Finally I can see the NYT doing something useful!

<p>
When President Biden took the stage last night at the DNC, I had a
moment of buyer’s remorse. He looked so good in his black suit, and the
pictures of the new candidates, and their spouses, looked comical in
comparison to the <i>president</i> who was about to speak.
</p>
<p>
Why did Walz have a permanent frown on his face. I find his presence
next to Harris is almost always awkward. He’s taller, and moves a lot. I
noticed this with Sanders when he was debating Clinton in 2016. She
stood still and Sanders waved his hands a lot. She spoke quietly, he
shouted.
</p>
<p>
Biden shouted last night, and he was mostly unplugged. On the team, but
you have to wonder, how did the journos get so much power that they
could force this change. He gave a fine speech. I’m not sure that
pushing him aside, net-net, was a win for us. Maybe Harris will be a
sugar high.
</p>
<p>
One thing I know for sure, the new Democratic Party must not make the
mistake that Biden did, must not subjugate itself to the press. When
they go on the attack, you must respond. Break their wall of
objectivity, these people are political players, and so far not subject
to rebuttal. That must end. If they want to be in the middle, then don’t
pretend they aren’t.
</p>
<p>
They will yell about the First Amendment, which also applies to elected
leaders and candidates for office, and there is no special right for
publications like the NYT, they have no immunity to First Amendment
speech about them.
</p>
<p>
To the extent we can, it’s time to push them aside.
</p>
<p>
When someone quotes the NYT in frustration, I have a mantra I repeat
over and over, “Ignore the NY Times.” I’m going to paste it in 25 times
now so you get the idea. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.
Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore
the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY
Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.
Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore
the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY
Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.
Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.

<h1 id="2024-08-19-something-new-intrigue">
2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue
</h1>
<p>
A while ago,
<a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="enfors">@enfors</span></a> said he wanted
his sandbox generator supplement to have something special. I wasn’t
exactly sure what he was thinking of, but I started thinking about the
things that I feel are under-explored.
</p>
<p>
A while ago, for example, I wondered: What would be the simplest game
that emphasises how many friends you make, that rewards the size of the
community you build? Back in 2016 I wrote a game called
<a href="2016-08-19_Romantic_Fantasy">Best Friends</a> that I never
used. It was <a href="2019-10-10_Non-adventure_games%3F">still an
adventure game</a>. Basically, replace your “level” with the number of
friends you have. Something like that.
</p>
<p>
But that still doesn’t get into really new territory. Something I would
like to see is a system for how to run an intrigue as a party –
including everybody at the table, for all the classes and skill
profiles. I feel that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> attempted to do
this but the result wasn’t great, at least at my table.
</p>
<p>
Quoting my past self:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’m also not too happy with A Song of Ice and Fire. We’ve only played
three times, so I’m willing to give it more time. When I ran one of the
sessions I basically split the party to the max since since all
characters are so diverse. There is no D&amp;D like party and that also
requires me to rethink my adventure design. –
<a href="2010-04-08_Spring">2010-04-08 Spring</a>
</p>
<p>
I can always switch into a movie director stance, go around the table,
point at players, “now you!” and after a bit when the exchange happened
and a die was maybe cast, “as we wait for that, we cut to…” and soon
enough “in the mean time…” – and I do this aggressively, in small time
slots. This results in a somewhat military style of pointing at people
to let them know that now is their turn, while simultaneously waving at
others to hold their thoughts, or maybe cutting talkative players off
when they’re running too long. It’s weird, but when there’s a lot of
players, or when there’s no party play to return to, it works well
enough. We’ve made these kinds of mistakes in games where there are
characters that are well suited for fighting and others that are not,
with their players trying to solve problems by fighting, and players do
not. This happened to me when I ran a one-shot of <em>A Song of Ice and
Fire</em>. It worked for a session, but it was exhausting and I don’t
want to claim that it’s a good solution. It was simply a short term
solution that worked, for me. Next time, however, make sure players
create characters that will adventure together. –
<a href="2021-02-27_Cohesion">2021-02-27 Cohesion</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps the split into combat and intrigue that the game introduced
wasn’t good game design because it made sense from the perspective of
emulating the books but it didn’t make sense from the perspective of
some people wanting to play a game together. Or maybe it just didn’t fit
my expectations of what it means to play together. Or maybe we just
missed the implied recommendation to focus on either combat or intrigue
and everybody having two characters, one for each domain. Or maybe just
run either a combat campaign or an intrigue campaign.
</p>
<p>
So what I’m looking for is a way to get intrigue results, using
procedures like we do for combat or exploration, for dungeons or the
wilderness. The goal is to bring about a change in leadership of a town,
a gang, a castle, an army unit, or to succeed in an act of sabotage, to
incite a rebellion – things that are either hand-waved or the party is
hired for the dirty work while the non-player characters are the
politicians and rabble-rousers. I know this can work. It’s OK for the
party to do the dirty work, to assassinate a tyrant and the non-player
characters then taking the throne and similar things, but I want to go
further. I want to involve all the players at the table. I want the
players to think about the logistics of war, the organising and
preparations of revolutions, the intricacies of marriage politics.
</p>
<p>
What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1–3 is for dungeons, 4–6 is for the
wilderness and 7–9 is <em>for politics</em>. Doesn’t that sound
fantastic? What sort of rules would you find in that third book? You
would not get to name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land
but by taking over an existing position of power – through intrigue.
Oust the abbot, kick out the bishop, marry into the baron’s family, take
over the guild. With the help of your friends. Without resorting to
combat, but with dice rolling.
</p>
<p>
The dice rolling and the procedures are important to me because
otherwise it all goes in a direction I don’t like:
<a href="2014-08-21_No_Dice">the referee decides everything and that is
exhausting</a>.
</p>
<p>
Not something like Burning Wheel’s Duel of Wits but something like
social combat for Fate games, like the <a href="social-combat">social
combat system in Diaspora</a>, for example. Note
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@bradjmurray" title="@bradjmurray@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bradjmurray">@bradjmurray</span></a>’s most
recent take on those rules:
<a href="https://vscadotblog.wordpress.com/2020/02/20/social-combat-in-diaspora/">social
combat in diaspora</a>.
</p>
<p>
This space deserves more attention.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RPG">#RPG</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-20</strong>. I find that urban adventures suffer from
the same problem. If it’s just two or three buildings and those act like
dungeons, my games work. If it’s just social encounters that can be
resolved with reaction rolls, my games work. But everything else in an
urban environment seems to be politics, to me. And I have no good
procedures to resolve those. So if anybody reading this is thinking
about writing a blog post on the topic, I’d love to read it.

<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Elon Musk bought the biggest airport on the social web. A major world
hub like Atlanta,
<a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-london-heathrow-lhr">London</a>
or Dubai.
</p>
<p>
Bluesky is a regional airport in a cool place, maybe Austin.
</p>
<p>
Mastodon is a network of airports, like the ones served by
<a href="https://www.ryanair.com/us/en/cheap-flight-destinations">Ryanair</a>
in Europe.
</p>
<p>
Threads is potentially one of the big airports like the one Musk bought,
but it’s not as much of a hub yet.
<a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-orlando-mco">Orlando</a>?
<a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-frankfurt-fra">Frankfurt</a>?
</p>
<p>
There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it’s where
most of the traffic already goes. It’s quite possibly not running that
smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction,
huge traffic, broken systems.
</p>
<p>
But it does actually work pretty reliably most of the time.
</p>

I was first getting started in tech, when we got the initial angel
funding for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext">LVT</a>, I
asked the lead investor, Bill Jordan, if Apple was going to go out of
business. At the time, 1983, a lot of people said it would. He asked
what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. He said they’re not going
away. Companies that large don’t disappear. After 40 years of experience
in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very
rarely disappear. It
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Computer_Corporation">does</a>
happen. But not often. More likely is Musk will right the ship, and it
will grow to dominate the market. Threads will possibly be Pepsi or
Avis. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles#Counterculture_of_the_1960s_and_1970s">Laurel
Canyon</a>. Or who knows?
</p>
<p>
But there’s a high probability that Musk’s company will be the market
leader for the forseeable future.

influencers</a> this year. I hear them say this is the first time, but I
beg to disagree. A few dozen bloggers were
<a href="http://scripting.com/2004/07/07.html">at the DNC in 2004</a>,
and were treated well, in many ways. I think the word influencer and
blogger have fairly similar meanings. Blogger is a broader term, because
it’s possible to have a very small readership for a blog, thus not be
influencing very much, but still have a lot of value. And you always can
influence your mom and little sister, right? <span

the reader. This isn’t exactly a new
<a href="https://this.how/rulesForJournalism/">rule for journalism</a>,
but it’s worth mentioning anyway. If you wouldn’t want to read the piece
yourself, don’t let them put your name on it. Example. A
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/kamala-harris-2010-debate.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EE4.7g6L.aTYQ0sm2Xwz6&smid=url-share">story</a>
promises to tell you about 47 seconds that saved Kamala Harris’s career.
They do eventually tell you the words, but you have to wade through a
lot of pointless bullshit to get to it. If I were writing it, the first
words of the piece would have to be the words, and then explain it.
You’ve seen this over and over and it gets worse all the time. I still
don’t understand why they do it, if I’m reading the piece, I’m a paying
subscriber, right? Another example of disrespect, quit trying to upsell
paying customers. Once a month maybe, but not every 8th time I visit
your site. Most businesses have no regard for their customers’ time, but
the ones that do, really make an impression.</p>

storage over time is not here yet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m working on a project which may or may not ship, but it presents an
interesting design challenge either way.
</p>
<p>
The idea is I want to write lots of little bits, less than 5000
characters each, they have titles, use styling, links, include images,
etc.
</p>
<p>
Or it could also be as small as a single emoji.
</p>
<p>
This is what we’ve settled on in 2024 as the basic unit of writing. From
a tweet to a long blog post.
</p>
<p>
I want to make an editor and storage system that fits this model
perfectly based on all we know about this stuff, and the latest server
and network technologies.
</p>
<p>
It should have the best simplest API we know how to make in 2024.
</p>
<p>
In every way it’ll be the nicest, fastest and most flexible way to
create structures of writing over time.
</p>
<p>
In that last sentence is the gotcha – <i>over time. </i>It’s the
frontier, the leading edge. Because in 2024 there’s no way for me, as an
individual developer to create a structure that lasts over time.
</p>
<p>
I can create a structure that has a high probability of lasting a month.
A pretty good chance of lasting a few years, but beyond that, it gets
less likely probably at a pretty good clip and eventually goes over a
cliff.
</p>
<p>
The way I have answered that in the past was with GitHub.
</p>
<p>
In 2017, I started an
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog">archive</a>
of my <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> writing on
GitHub. It’s still just a fraction of my writing, I’m not doing anything
like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I’ve managed
to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month,
which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the
other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.
</p>
<p>
So I guess for the project I’m doing I will again use GitHub to mirror
the content in the database until and unless GitHub proves unusable for
this purpose, or something much better comes along.
</p>
<p>
Note that GitHub has made no promise about the continued availability of
their service, all we have to go on is that they have been reliable for
enough time to present the <i>illusion</i> of persistence. <span

I was

the other day
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-wOWuDJUU6">about
rss.app</a> and how they have feeds for
<a href="https://www.threads.net/">Threads</a> accounts. They do. But
there are two caveats.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It <a href="https://rss.app/pricing">costs</a> $9.99 per month for 15
feeds. Could be a bit expensive for some people’s budgets.
</li>
<li>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validRss.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The
second concern is more serious. It doesn’t handle titleless items
properly. It repeats the contents of the tweet in the title and
description of the feeds it generates. An
<a href="https://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://rss.app/feeds/3A2qGRnWMHFk5DvE.xml">example</a>.
This is not right, and it’s not the way Mastodon and Bluesky do it.
There’s nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has
no title you do the common sense thing – omit the title. I’m happy to
help with this. I wrote the
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0 spec</a>, and
am something of an authority on this. It’s important to get this right.

<h2 id="the-state-of-ransomware">The State of Ransomware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-15, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Palo Alto Networks published its
<a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-ransomware-leak-site-data-analysis/">semi-annual
report</a> on ransomware. From the Executive Summary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Unit 42 monitors ransomware and extortion leak sites closely to keep
tabs on threat activity. We reviewed compromise announcements from 53
dedicated leak sites in the first half of 2024 and found 1,762 new
posts. This averages to approximately 294 posts a month and almost 68
posts a week. Of the 53 ransomware groups whose leak sites we monitored,
six of the groups accounted for more than half of the compromises
observed.
</p>
<p>
In February, we reported a 49% increase year-over-year in alleged
victims posted on ransomware leak sites. So far, in 2024, comparing the
first half of 2023 to the first half of 2024, we see an even further
increase of 4.3%. The higher level of activity observed in 2023 was no
fluke…

<h1 id="2024-08-18-indie-search-for-oddmu">
2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu
</h1>
<p>
This is a follow-up for
<a href="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexes">2024-08-16 JSON feed for
indexing</a> where I linked to
<a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a>.
I want to see what’s required for this to work.
</p>
<p>
First, I need to install Pagefind. Lucky me, I already have a Rust build
environment installed.
</p>
<pre><code>cargo install pagefind
</code></pre>
<p>
Next, I need a static HTML copy of my site:
</p>
<pre><code>env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en  oddmu static -jobs 3 /tmp/alex
</code></pre>
<p>
Create the index:
</p>
<pre><code>pagefind --site /tmp/alex
</code></pre>
<p>
Upload:
</p>
<pre><code>mv /tmp/alex/pagefind .
make upload
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s now available at
<code>https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind</code>.
</p>
<p>
Adding the info to the page header:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;application/pagefind&quot; href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind&quot; title=&quot;Alex Schroeder’s Diary&quot;&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) =&gt; {
  new PagefindUI({ element: &quot;#pagefind&quot;, showSubResults: true });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And a div to the page body:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;pagefind&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And I had to add <code>‘unsafe-eval’</code> to the
<code>script-src</code> Content-Security-Policy header.
</p>
<p>
Too bad the search result links all end in <code>.html</code> … that
requires an extra rewrite rule, to get rid of. On the other hand, it
also allowed me to get rid of <code>baseUrl: "/view/"</code>.
</p>
<p>
Since there are still rough edges, this search is only available via
<a href="pagefind.html">Pagefind</a>. I’m also not promising any updates
to the index.

<strong>2024-08-19</strong>. While I was experimenting with this all, I
asked
<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="byjp">@byjp</span></a> some questions.
</p>
<p>
<em>Sites provide local indexes in the Pagefind format, as a static
file?</em>
</p>
<p>
Correct — except it’s many files, organised so as to allow minimal
transfer for a single search query — but all can be retrieved to have a
full local index
</p>
<p>
<em>Clients register one or more of these files and allow searching
them?</em>
</p>
<p>
Correct — they can be retrieved/cached to query locally, or queried
efficiently remotely.
</p>
<p>
<em>Users can install a large number of them, locally? Like I have 23
local dictionaries installed for my dictd and I can query them,
locally.</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Many can be kept locally or remotely. The sites you “register”/add
become your search index.
</p>
<p>
<em>Is it possible for a website to offer just a Pagefind installation
with a number of URLs to Pagefind indexes without hosting pages and
indexes? Clients visiting this Pagefind installation would download all
the indexes pointed to in the list and search them locally?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes (with minor hackery). Each Pagefind instance <em>is</em> the index,
a small bootstrapping JS/WASM blob, and ~5 lines of init JS. Those 5
lines can include locations of multiple indexes for the (exclusively
client-side) JS to query when searching; by default the only one
configured is the “local” index that created with the Pagefind JS/WASM
blob, but you could strip away an empty index and have what you describe
— in fact, that’s what my
<a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch</a> demo
does!
</p>
<p>
<em>If instead of visiting a site with a Pagefind installation one
installs a Pagefind browser extensions, is it possible to point it to a
URL that hosts a list of indexes?</em>
</p>
<p>
I haven’t built that (yet), but yeah — I’d want to build an mf2/IndieWeb
compatible “new user experience” that’d guide folks to finding a
good-for-them set of defaults. My demo automatically (provisionally)
adds any site you visit that supports IndieSearch, so you’d get better
coverage fast. I’d also consider default-importing from blogrolls and
the like. (Management &amp; performance gets tricky with 1000s of
indexes. Probs an “if we get there” problem. 😅)
</p>
<p>
<em>Is it possible to “merge” Pagefind indexes and pass those aggregates
on? I’m afraid that having local copies of the indexes means that
clients will have to at least query thousands of sites for updates to
their page indexes.</em>
</p>
<p>
Not yet, but I asked exactly this question of the Pagefind devs and they
offered that it’s currently too hard, but that there is a potential
route they’d consider, see
<a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/discussions/564#discussioncomment-8702059">#564</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Thank you so much for answering the questions!</em>
</p>
<p>
I’m still thinking about the situation where I’m part of a community and
we want to all share search, like using
<a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a> for a webring – except I’d
like a solution where I don’t have to do the crawling.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, the communities I’m part of are planets such as
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> or
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>, each with
hundreds of blogs. I suppose most of them don’t offer a Pagefind index,
being hosted on Blogspot and Wordpress, but what I’m considering is
ingesting their feed and indexing it. This could be a service I could
perform for people. Luckily, it’s often possible to get all the blog
pages via the feed. This is how I’ve made
<a href="2010-05-31_Blognapping">local backups of other people’s
blogs</a>. I guess that each site would be a separate index, however?
</p>
<p>
I’d like to find a way that doesn’t require me to always download all
the pages. I’d like to find a way to update the index as it’s being
used.
</p>
<p>
I’d need a way to figure out how to configure it such that the results
link back to the original pages, of course.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I’m considering is that my own site is rendered live, from
Markdown files… it’s not a static site. So ideally I’d be able to ingest
Markdown files directly. Or I can go the route of exporting it all into
a big feed and ingesting that, once I’ve solved the problem above, I
guess. But the problem above might also be easier to solve by extracting
HTML pages from the feed. It’s what I’ve done in the past. Create
something that works, first, then improve it later?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, ideas are swirling around.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-19</strong>. I notice more things that aren’t quite
working the way I like them to work.
</p>
<p>
The sort order of the results is less than ideal, for example. I like to
emphasize more recent blog posts. Pagefind, however, returns them in
some sort of scoring order so that I’ve seen quite a few results with
pages around 20 years old.
</p>
<p>
Image previews seem to rarely work. I suspect the problem is pages in
subfolders linking to images in that same subfolder. Such relative links
don’t need a path – but they do if Pagefind is not in the same
directory.
</p>
<p>
Here’s another thing to consider: The index takes up more space than the
full HTML of the entire site, compressed!
</p>
<pre><code>alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; du -sh alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz 
 43M    alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind
9.7M    alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz
</code></pre>
<p>
So the Pagefind index takes about 4× more space than the full HTML, for
this site. This matches my experience with better indexing for my own
site where I experimented with full text indexes and trigram indexes.
Back then:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the 15 MiB of markdown files seem to have generated an index of 70 MiB –
<a href="2023-09-11-oddmu">2023-09-11 Oddµ memory consumption</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, in terms of copyright incentives, handing off the entire site
like that is tricky. Doing it with a feed feels OK. Doing it for a
search engine seems like handing the keys to Google. This provides an
incentive to use a pre-computed index.
</p>
<p>
It also reminds me that the idea I had of building a search engine out
of feed slurping without consent is probably a bad idea – like all ideas
based on non-consensual acts.
</p>
<p>
Whether self-indexing is a good thing in terms of avoiding an
English-first focus I don’t know. I suspect that most people will be
using free software and therefore there’s no reason to suspect that a
search engine doesn’t have the means to process the languages. Then
again, that’s a lock-in where in order to support a new language, you
have to support the software your favourite search-engine supports. So
people indexing our own pages might have long term benefits.
</p>
<p>
I’m still wondering about the comparison of Pagefind and Lunr, to be
honest. How many such static search solutions are there? Is there a
benefit of one implementation over another?
</p>
<p>
I guess now I should look into Pagefind some more? Indexing non-HTML
pages, handling image previews for pages not in the root directory and
relative image source URLs, the sort order of results, the use of the
.html extension in results… there are still rough edges as far as I am
concerned – and per discussion above the onus is on me to fix my
indexing. 😭

<h1 id="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexing">
2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing
</h1>
<p>
Recently,
<a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dredmorbius">@dredmorbius</span></a> wrote
about Google and search and posed the question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What if websites indexed their own content, and published a permuted
index in a standard format, in a cache-and-forward model similar to how
DNS works?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A while ago I wondered about
<a href="2023-03-07_A_vision_for_search">self-published indexes</a>. We
have software to generate feeds. Why not software to generate indexes?
Back then I proposed a JSON format. Today I finally took a look at
<a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/">JSON Feed</a>. I think
it has everything we need.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the example for this site:
<a href="/.well-known/search-feed.json.gz">.well-known/search-feed.json.gz</a>.
This file has about 9.7MiB. The source material is 6740 Markdown pages,
a total of about 21.5MiB, or 8.4MiB compressed.
</p>
<p>
Using the <code>next_url</code> attribute, it would be possible to split
this file up into chunks of 100 pages each, or a chunk per year, if the
platform promises that older pages never change. This wouldn’t work for
my wiki, but perhaps it would for certain platforms.
</p>
<p>
Somebody will have write up a best-practice on how to use HTTP headers
to avoid downloading the whole file when nothing has changed. Sadly,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13">section
13 of RFC 2616</a> is pretty convoluted. Basically something about the
use of If-Modified-Since and ETags headers.
</p>
<p>
We also need to agree on how to use some of the JSON Feed attributes.
</p>
<p>
<code>content_text</code>: If used, all markup should be ignored by the
server (no guessing whether the text is Markdown or not). It would be
fine if this contained just the text nodes of the HTML, separated by
spaces. This can be useful to see whether words occur in the text, how
frequent they are, etc.
</p>
<p>
<code>content_html</code>: This is the preferred way to include pages in
the index. It is up to the search engine provider to extract useful
information from the HTML, including summaries, extracts, scoring, etc.
It is up to index providers to provide the kind of HTML they think
serves search engines best. This includes using the semantic HTML tags
and dropping style, scripts, footers and other elements that might be
used by search engines to reduce the relevance of the item.
</p>
<p>
I also find <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005">RFC
5005</a> to be very instructive in how to think about feeds for
archiving.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> commented, saying
that it was important to think about how search indexes were going to be
used:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
so given that no single machine would or should store a whole index of
the internet or even all your local internet, you can go a few ways with
that, take the global quorum sensing path and you get a bigass global
dht-like thing like ipfs. if instead you think there should be some
structure, then you need proximity. is that social proximity where we
swap indexes between people we know? or webring like proximity dependent
on pages linking to each other and mutually indexing their neighborhood?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s an interesting question but I think I want incremental improvements
to the current situation. So if a person has a website right now, on
server, what’s the simplest thing they can do so that they aren’t
drowned in crawlers and can still be found via search? That would be
publishing an index, analogous to publishing a feed. Having more search
engines (even if using legacy centralized architecture) would be better
than what we have now. Not depending on crawlers would be better what we
have now.
</p>
<p>
In terms of decentralisation, I think I like community search engines
like lieu. The idea is great: a community lists a bunch of sites. Lieu
generates a web ring and crawls them to build an index of all the member
sites. Instead of crawling, it could fetch the indexes. This would be
much better than what it does right now, because right now, lieu uses
colly for crawling and colly ignores robots.txt. This means that
<a href="2024-06-22-lieu">lieu instantly bans itself when it visits my
site</a> because it’s not rate limited. It’s just an implementation
detail, but sadly I am biased. I’ve been on a Butlerian Jihad since 2009
when I discover that <a href="2009-10-15_Network_Traffic">over 30% of
all requests I serve from my sites are for machines, not humans</a>.
</p>
<p>
It makes me want to raise my keyboard and scream “CO₂ for the CO₂ god!!”
</p>
<p>
Somebody should draw a Hacker Elric doing that, standing on a mountain
of electro-trash with the burnt and dead landscape of the
post-apocalypse in the background.
</p>
<p>
But back to the problem of indexing. Right now, search engine operators
and their parasites, the search engine optimisation enterprises, crawl
every single page including page histories, page diffs, and more, on my
wikis. If every wanna-be search engine downloaded my index once a day, I
would be saving resources. Whether that’s a step in the right direction,
I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> also said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
i just think that the ability to fundamentally depart from the
commercial structure of the web and all its brokenness doesn’t happen
gradually and esp. not with the server/client stack we have now
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, there must be another way. I just don’t see it, right now. It’s
always hard to imagine a new world while you’re still living in the old
one. I’m sure the solution will seem obvious to the next generation,
looking back.

<a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@splitbrain" title="@splitbrain@octodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="splitbrain">@splitbrain</span></a>
suggested that this was the same as the sitemaps.org concept, but I
think the sitemap lists the URLs available and you still have to crawl
the site. At least now you never miss a page.
</p>
<p>
Would having such an index generate too much traffic? I think it would
worm if all other crawling would stop. That’s the necessary trade-off,
of course. No stupid crawlers lost in my wiki admin links (history
pages, diffs) wasting resources – that is my goal. Also, since I ask for
a crawl delay, crawling has to reconnect all the time, negotiate TLS all
the time, start up CGI scripts all the time… having basically a static
snapshot for download would obviate that (in a world where crawlers are
smart enough to understand that the don’t need to crawl).

<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@zens" title="@zens@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="zens">@zens</span></a> mentioned Lunr but
then suggested that
<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="byjp">@byjp</span></a>’s solution to the
problem is even better: the server provides indexes that are used
client-side and a browser extension allows querying multiple such
indexes, locally.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Lunr.js is a small, full-text search library for use in the browser. It
indexes JSON documents and provides a simple search interface for
retrieving documents that best match text queries.
</p>
<p>
After indexing, Pagefind adds a static search bundle to your built
files, which exposes a JavaScript search API that can be used anywhere
on your site. Pagefind also provides a prebuilt UI that can be used with
no configuration. – <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a>
</p>
<p>
Any time they visit the IndieSearch homepage (a page served from their
browser extension) they can now search all the sites supporting
IndieSearch they’ve visited and/or included. –

I was surprised that Donald Trump was so famous because I didn’t watch
reality TV. I come from NY and he was a pretty small thing in NY, even
though I guess the rest of the world thinks he’s big in NY.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I come from Queens, actually, so I know the Trump character pretty well
too. Self-important narcissists who inside feel worthless, lashing out
at everything they come in contact with. Not the ordinary Scotch/German
in Queens, but not that rare either.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The same thing is probably happening now with Elon Musk, because
attention of people like me has wandered away from Twitter, but the
audience is huge, and probably every bit as movable as it was for Trump
in 2016, and Musk owns it? Seems so.
</p>
<p>
People who think this is over are fooled, imho.

By giving them equal weight as news or op-ed pieces, it’s more likely

Maybe they’ll even respond. This is the beginning of accountability. The

is no accountability, no checks and balances, no requirement of

trying to do, what their goals are.</p>
