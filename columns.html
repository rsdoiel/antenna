<h2 id="oddŒº-hashtags">2025-08-07 OddŒº hashtags</h2>

<h1 id="2025-08-07-oddŒº-hashtags">
2025-08-07 OddŒº hashtags
</h1>
<p>
I was recently looking at my homepage and wondered about all the
hashtags I used and how not all of them had a topic page. The
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">OddŒº</a> page, for example, collects all the
blogposts tagged <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23OddŒº">#OddŒº</a>
(including this one). So I looked at the
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">hashtags</a> command and figured, ‚Äúthis
is going to be easy.‚Äù ü§£
</p>
<p>
The first problem is that there are a lot of garbage hashtags. There are
over 1000 hashtags used on this site! The garbage hashtags are the
result of Markdown parsing mistakes that I never fixed. Apparently the
list of hashtags includes the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#1)
#fennel‚Äù
#fudge](fudge)_and_the_[pdq](../wiki?action=edit;id=pdq_&quot;click_to_edit_this_page&quot;)_rules_used_in_[zorcererofzo.
ffffff;fill-opacity:1&quot;)
###ÔΩ£
</code></pre>
<p>
This is not great. üòî
</p>
<p>
I should fix those, and many more. ü§®
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the hashtags are all downcased. So given a hashtag such as
<code>#advanced_squad_leader</code> the code would have to infer the
page name ‚ÄúAdvanced Squad Leader‚Äù. But what about the hashtag
<code>#√§lter werden</code>? If at all, that should link to a page called
‚Äú√Ñlter werden‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
And so I concluded that this wasn‚Äôt easy after all. I saved the changes
I made on a branch, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be merging that into the main
branch.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Wikis">#Wikis</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-09</strong>. Well! I think I worked on it and I worked
on it, and then I ran it, and kept on fixing the topic pages it created.
But I think it worked!
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-10</strong>. Yesterday I cleaned up my site (somewhat)
and today I released v1.18 of OddŒº. Yay me!

<p>date: 2025-08-09, from: Tracy Durnell Blog</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a friend and I were discussing the sci-fi genre
(in books). Despite both of us reading little sci-fi in the past five
years, we recognized all the authors on the Hugo finalists list. Only
three of the finalist novels were sci-fi, two from the same author.

<p>There‚Äôs a difference between reading a site in a web browser and it
being part of the web. As it turns out what became Web 2.0, all built as
silos, could more accurately be called Anti-web 2.0. Underneath all the
silos, the heart of the web is still beating. Ready for us to build on
it again.</p>

<h2 id="gotosocial-and-the-butlerian-jihad">2025-08-03 GoToSocial and
the Butlerian Jihad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-09, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-08-03-gotosocial-and-the-butlerian-jihad">
2025-08-03 GoToSocial and the Butlerian Jihad
</h1>
<p>
I run a single user instance for the fediverse using GoToSocial and
since I‚Äôm blocking <a href="2025-07-23-test">thousands of IP address
ranges</a> ‚Äì mostly from companies renting out bandwidth and computing
power to web scrapers ‚Äì I‚Äôm also blocking my instance from seeing a lot
of the fediverse. That‚Äôs not good.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to continue blocking the big cloud providers like
Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Hentzner, OVH, Alibaba and whatever else they
are called. But if I‚Äôm following somebody from a fedi instance hosted by
these big cloud providers, I should put the IP numbers associated with
just those domain names onto a separate allow list.
</p>
<p>
Instead of using the Mastodon client protocol to get the list of people
I‚Äôm following, I can just access the database directly.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs the script that adds IP addresses:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# Redirect the output of this script into /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.sh
echo &quot;#&quot; (date --iso)
set domains (sqlite3 /home/gotosocial/sqlite.db '
select distinct b.domain from follows as f
join accounts as a on f.account_id = a.id
join accounts as b on f.target_account_id = b.id
where a.username = &quot;alex&quot;
and b.domain is not null
union
select distinct b.domain from follow_requests as f
join accounts as a on f.account_id = a.id
join accounts as b on f.target_account_id = b.id
where a.username = &quot;alex&quot;
and b.domain is not null
order by 1')
set i 1
set m (count $domains)
for domain in $domains
    set ipv6 (host -t AAAA $domain | awk '/has IPv6 address/ { print $5}')
    set ipv4 (host -t A $domain | awk '/has address/ { print $4}')
    echo &quot;$i/$m $domain:&quot; $ipv4 $ipv6 &gt;&amp;2
    set i (math 1 + $i)
    for ip in $ipv4
        echo &quot;ipset add gotosocial $ip # $domain&quot;
    end
    for ip in $ipv6
        echo &quot;ipset add gotosocial6 $ip # $domain&quot;
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This prints lines such as the following to STDERR:
</p>
<pre><code>157/244 republik.ch: 172.67.74.47 104.26.5.143 104.26.4.143 2606:4700:20::681a:48f 2606:4700:20::ac43:4a2f 2606:4700:20::681a:58f
</code></pre>
<p>
And it prints lines such as the following to STDOUT:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add gotosocial 172.67.74.47 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial 104.26.5.143 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial 104.26.4.143 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::681a:48f # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::ac43:4a2f # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::681a:58f # republik.ch
</code></pre>
<p>
I redirect STDOUT to a file called <code>gotosocial.sh</code> and then I
run this script, which creates to IP sets called <code>gotosocial</code>
and <code>gotosocial6</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/iptables-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands

ipset create gotosocial hash:ip
ipset create gotosocial6 hash:ip family inet6

# this set is inserted at the beginning
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set gotosocial src -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set gotosocial6 src -j ACCEPT

# recreate using: gotosocial-follower-ips &gt; gotosocial.sh
source gotosocial.sh

netfilter-persistent save

# Find the number of the rule (hopefully it is number one)
#   iptables --list INPUT
#   ip6tables --list INPUT
# To delete, verify the number of the rule:
#   iptables --list INPUT 1
#   ip6tables --list INPUT 1
# Now delete it the rule:
#   iptables --delete INPUT 1
#   ip6tables --delete INPUT 1
# Now you can destroy the two ipsets, too
#   ipset destroy gotosocial
#   ipset destroy gotosocial6
# And now you can rerun this script!
</code></pre>
<p>
If you run it, you‚Äôll get warnings about duplicate entries, I‚Äôm sure:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset v7.17: Element cannot be added to the set: it's already added
</code></pre>
<p>
In my case, for example, I have both of these entries and I didn‚Äôt
bother to fix this:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add gotosocial 151.101.129.91 # mastodon.online
ipset add gotosocial 151.101.129.91 # mastodon.social
</code></pre>
<p>
There are plenty more, of course.
</p>
<p>
In any case, you should now have an allow list that prevents these IP
addresses from getting blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> because the
<code>gotosocial</code> rule comes first:
</p>
<pre><code># iptables --list INPUT
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set gotosocial src
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set allowlist src
f2b-alex-apache  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports http,https
f2b-butlerian-jihad  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-butlerian-jihad-week  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-alex-bots  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports http,https
f2b-recidive  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            
DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set banlist src
</code></pre>
<p>
To delete and recreate the lists, I use the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
ipset flush gotosocial
ipset flush gotosocial6
source gotosocial.sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

With the renewed interest in TUIs, I also upgraded TermKit to modern
swift tooling and started adding a number of pending features.
</p>
<p>
Started also on a backend to swift-cross-ui- but the question is whether
a backend is the right thing, or if I should just have a custom
SwiftUI-like system that is completely adapted to TermKit.

real. ChatGPT has real limits. This has to be done off on the side. It
certainly could be done with their API. I‚Äôm head-down on other projects
and can‚Äôt do it myself but as I explain in the writeup, it would plug in
beautifully to stuff I‚Äôm doing and it would all be open, so a new kind
of feed reader is possible. And we could find news from other bloggers
that the journalists aren‚Äôt reporting on, the same way we relied on
blogs in the early days to learn about what was going on on the web.

widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed to
avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâor perhaps even delights
in‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâparticipating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt administration in
which flattery, fealty, gifts, and barely-concealed bribes are rewarded.
That the United States devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just
fine, because Apple‚Äôs pockets are deep enough to pay the vig.</p>
<p>But the alternative is more disturbing.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-the-web-to-be-like-harvard">I want the web to be like
Harvard</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-08, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Back in the beginning I wanted the web to be like Harvard.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs one of the reasons I went there as a research fellow in 2003.
</p>
<p>
I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the web, the density of minds wasn‚Äôt up to my
expectations, so I thought if I brought the web to the minds, that might
work better. I wanted to work on communication systems for people trying
to work together to solve big problems.
</p>
<p>
I chose Harvard over MIT, because the web was already strong at MIT, and
they weren‚Äôt friendly to my cause, they were busy trying to reinvent the
web when it imho didn‚Äôt need that. I hoped instead, Harvard, more a
school of the liberal arts, would be more open to innovation in
communication between people as opposed to between machines. I felt, in
2003, that was a solved problem on the web.
</p>
<p>
It didn‚Äôt happen there either, some
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting">great</a>
<a href="http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html">stuff</a>
did come out of that period, and some of it was lasting, but eventually
the university wasn‚Äôt on board with the web as a community for
intellect. Instead what came out of Harvard in that period was Facebook,
which is a great accomplishment. I am a FB user to this day and
appreciate how well it works at keeping friends from long ago in
contact.
</p>
<p>
I still want an intellectual community on the web. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm
putting so much effort into rebuilding it as a writing environment. All
this because the writing products of Silicon Valley are always will be
silos. As heroic as Ghost has been in supporting ActivityPub that is not
the web. The barriers are too high and the features too limited. The web
is the web, it‚Äôs well defined and well understood. And that‚Äôs where we
have to go, and I want the minds to be there or else it wasn‚Äôt worth the
effort.
</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/08/07/rickAndMorty.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Yesterday
I wrote a
<a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/08/07/chatgpt-5-is-even-more-of-a-bastard-than-4/">quick
review</a> of ChatGPT 5, after trying a simple programming exercise with
it. It was an awful collaboration because it lied to me about its
capabilities, leading me to develop a feature in my software to support
the capability that it later admitted that it didn‚Äôt have. I‚Äôve never
had a programming partner do that to me. I‚Äôve had people who never
showed up for work. Or people who were in so far over their heads that
it would have been better if they had never shown up. It lied
repeatedly, and when cornered it had the audacity to gaslight me. ‚ÄúI
understand why you feel that way.‚Äù Oh nothing pisses me off more than
that.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt understand why
<a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250807/p29#a250807p29">other
people</a> don‚Äôt review it based on its functionality, after all it
isn‚Äôt just a
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/02/big-tech-ai-spending?utm_source=chatgpt.com">money
sink</a>, or a technological breakthrough, it‚Äôs software that we pay
actual money for that is meant to help us in our work. I don‚Äôt know if
it‚Äôs by design that it‚Äôs such an asshole. I have a feeling that people
are going to focus on this eventually.
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT is not human, it‚Äôs like the world of
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Rick%20and%20Morty%22">Rick
and Morty</a>. And we‚Äôre meant to be one of the many versions of Rick
and/or Morty, but which is the real one? Before we lose sight of that,
let‚Äôs keep our heads on, we‚Äôre still the ones discovering stuff and
being creative and entertaining other humans, not the machines. It‚Äôll
all work a lot better when they‚Äôre programmed to behave like computers,
not these vain and corrupt pseudo humans. Still a breakthrough in
search. Really sticks it to Google. Yaaay. That‚Äôs good enough for me.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm more worried about AIs killing us by overwhelming our nervous
systems than taking our place at work. Has anyone actually used any of
the software an AI has written? I know people who have never written
software before are in awe, as I am about
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22wordle%20kitty%22">drawing</a>
characters I make up, but how does the software it builds rate? If it
lies to itself like it lies to me, the software doesn‚Äôt work at all,
even slightly. I‚Äôm pretty sure ‚Äúgarbage in garbage out‚Äù applies in the
new world of software.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/09.html#a191740">2019</a>: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd
love to understand how one can be a programmer and not always be
searching for the truth. Unlike just about any other profession I can
think of, ours depends on telling the truth. You can‚Äôt lie to a compiler
is one of my programming mottos. Garbage in garbage out.‚Äù
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The tech industry doesn‚Äôt get its relationship with paying human
customers. Had a problem with my cell phone service. I started getting
emails saying it was shutting off my service because my credit card was
being denied. Went to the account on the web and it looked fine. The
messages kept coming. I reached out for help. The people couldn‚Äôt
understand what I was saying. I eventually gave up because I didn‚Äôt
understand either. I might have two accounts, I don‚Äôt know, in some ways
it looks like two, in other ways just one. I presume <i>they</i> have a
way to find out, assuming there are actually any reasoning empathetic
human beings who care about doing quality work. If we were talking to
each other human to human, not as peripheral devices for a computer
network, we might have figured it out in five minutes, instead of having
the customer report it on their blog after weeks of
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bullshit">bullshit</a>
that did not uncover the truth. We still don‚Äôt know how many accounts I
have.
</p>
<p>
The company is Google. They‚Äôre good at dealing with imaginary customers
not real ones. If they ever understood how to communicate with people,
they have forgotten. And of course there‚Äôs a real possibility that all
my conversations were with <i>their</i> ChatGPT. If that‚Äôs true, no
wonder we were running around in circles never getting the answer.

<h1 id="2025-08-07-site-structure-blog-wiki-digital-garden">
2025-08-07 Site structure: blog, wiki, digital garden?
</h1>
<p>
Yes.
<a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@jayeless" title="@jayeless@toot.cat"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jayeless">@jayeless</span></a> recently
wrote about
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/conversation">conversations</a>,
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/link-rot">link rot</a> and
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/small-web-blogging-platforms">small
blogging platforms</a> and I mentioned how my use of the software I use
for publishing this site has changed.
</p>
<p>
I started using it as a wiki, which is why the
<a href="SiteMap">SiteMap</a> still uses ‚Äúcamel case‚Äù. I ended up
foregoing the wiki page approach because my opinion and experience with
a topic would keep changing and I didn‚Äôt want to keep rewriting my own
pages. And so the site slowly morphed from garden style to blog style
and now it‚Äôs explicitly a diary. And I guess the topic pages are in fact
the tag pages where I collect the links to all the tagged pages. üò¨
</p>
<p>
As I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm idly wondering whether a one-person wiki is
automatically a digital garden, whether thinking about terminology is a
waste of time ‚Äì I used to make fun of Germans who wanted to focus on
terminology first and foremost (‚ÄúBegrifflichkeiten!‚Äù) ‚Äì and whether a
wiki with comments is still digital garden, and now that I‚Äôve thought
about it for a bit I‚Äôm tired and I think it‚Äôs a waste of time.
</p>
<p>
In any case, Jessica noted that I like to update pages without rewriting
them. I wrote this <a href="Odd%CE%BC">OddŒº</a> feature just for me! The
‚ÄúAdd‚Äù link allows me to quickly add to the end of a page without editing
the whole page. This is important when I‚Äôm on a phone. It‚Äôs basically
the remnant of my old comment system since I kept commenting on my own
pages. üòÖ I mean, there were people commenting in the past ‚Äì and I‚Äôd
like to thank you all if you‚Äôre still reading! -‚Äì but I mostly felt
strange commenting on my own pages so often and I decided to embrace
this.
</p>
<p>
I update pages on my blog by adding to them, on purpose. In terms of
editorial style it fits with my goal of showing how everything is üöß
<em>work in progress</em> üöß and how arriving someplace can be hard.
There are enough places on the web where things look easy and clear and
so this approach of mine reflects my lived reality of how I try things
and then they don‚Äôt work and I come back again with more ideas or I
report on how things went.
</p>
<p>
It reflects how I‚Äôm failing forward through life. üòÇ

Scripting News</strong> (date: 2025-08-07, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting
News)</p>
<p>I recorded a good podcast yesterday about how I develop new stuff
like podcasting, and how it only works if there isn‚Äôt a huge dominant
platform vendor to FUD the project. That‚Äôs why RSS worked, sort of ‚Äì we
did get FUDded by the RDF folk, who had a few famous people on their
list of co-authors, and it put a big scar on RSS when it was just
starting to grow. We cleaned up their mess after a while, and then it
boomed, thanks to the New York Times. This is what usually happens, in
markets that are controlled by a big company. Google has that effect, so
does Apple as does the W3C. They force everything to stop and go through
a process that simply doesn‚Äôt work, it doesn‚Äôt yield innovation in the
market, because it wasn‚Äôt
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/10/howToBootstrapFederated140.html">bootstrapped</a>.
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like the idea of ‚ÄúPodcasting 2.0‚Äù whatever it is.
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@adam@podcastindex.social/114978962778121264">Adam
Curry says</a> on Masto that it‚Äôs all a big misunderstanding, but that‚Äôs
what the RDF people said too. Who cares what the name is. Everyone
cares, when it comes to the name of a standard or protocol. And when you
have an Apple or Google or IETF trying to confuse people about what
you‚Äôre doing, well you can‚Äôt make any progress on interop. They freeze
everything because users and developers will wait for them. Of course
that‚Äôs what ‚ÄúPodcasting 2.0‚Äù is all about. To make all the ideas flow
through <a href="https://podcasting2.org/">one place</a>. And whoever
they are (ChatGPT
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/07/isTherePodcastingTwoPointOh.png">says</a>
it‚Äôs Adam Curry btw) they didn‚Äôt even bring the power of an Apple or
Google to the table. They have nothing other than their aspiration to
own the name of an open format and protocol that made the world a little
happier for a while. For that of course someone has to try to own it.
That‚Äôs basically what I said, in a very long-winded way, in the podcast.
I also talked about ways we could move forward anyway even though there
is a 800-pound would-be gorilla trying to own our playground. Maybe I‚Äôll
just release the podcast as-is and ask you all to indulge me for my need
to say the same thing far too many times with so much vigor. :-)</p>

<h2 id="all-the-concerns-that-make-you-a-boring-developer">All the
concerns that make you a boring developer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-06, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I was thinking this morning about how once you understand that your
technology choices have security, performance, and accessibility
considerations you become a much more boring developer. Acknowledging
those obligations can sort of strips the fun out of programming, but
we‚Äôre better for it.
</p>
<p>
I decided to pull on that thread a little more and come up with a list
of all the concerns you might have as an engineer/developer that
ultimately compound to make you a boring, wet blanket of a person to be
in meetings with.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Security</strong> - Make sure you‚Äôre not opening the door for
hackers.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Privacy</strong> - Don‚Äôt leak personal information. Or don‚Äôt
collect it in the first place.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Performance</strong> - Can the software work on low-end devices?
Can you deliver the large bundle over bad internet? Those are your
problems.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Inclusion/Accessibility</strong> - Are you allowing people the
dignity to use your product? No? Oof. You should probably do that.
Ideally because you are an ethical person, but also because it‚Äôs a legal
liability.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Scalability</strong> - If a thousand people show up in the next
minute, does your software still work? You have 100 users now, but how
does it work for 1000? 1 million? 1 billion?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintenance</strong> - Ship a new feature? Great. Expect to
spend at least 40% of cost/time to maintain a feature over its lifetime.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Testability</strong> - Did you write the code in a way that‚Äôs
easy to test to make sure bugs don‚Äôt show up in production?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deliverability/Distribution</strong> - How do people get or use
your software?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Adoption/Onboarding</strong> - How do customers or partners use
your software? How do they get familiar?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Documentation</strong> - Email and DMs is probably not the most
efficient form on knowledge transfer.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ecological</strong> - Does your app burn through GPUs in Iowa?
What are you doing about that?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Financial/Cost</strong> - Servers and GPUs cost money, did you
build this in such a way that it costs as little as possible to run?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Monetizability</strong> - Good idea but does it make money or
cost money?
</li>
<li>
<strong>User feedback</strong> - What are customers or partners saying
about this? Does that impact how or what you write?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stakeholder feedback</strong> - Like user feedback but everyone
freaks out like their job depends on solving the problem that day
regardless if its a good idea or bad idea.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Organizational</strong> - How to get your co-workers onboard
with the plan plays an outsized part in software engineering. Welcome to
the world of office politics!
</li>
<li>
<strong>Staffability</strong> - There‚Äôs not a lot of Haskell developers
out there. Or the inverse, people over-optimize on technologies that are
‚Äúeasy to hire for‚Äù and now you have a billion lines of Java in your
application.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Support matrixes</strong> - For websites, of course we support
major browsers and the latest 2 versions? Do we need to go back further?
Weirdo browsers? Should we make native apps? Which ones? What
devices/CPU architectures do we support there? Niche Linux distros? The
list goes on.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Political</strong> - Some say ‚Äúall tech is political‚Äù, and I
tend to agree, but ask yourself: Did you put a politics inside the code?
You did, didn‚Äôt you?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Geopolitical</strong> - Rare, but happens. See:
<a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series">Facebook
Myanmar genocide</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Localization/Internationalization</strong> - Uh-oh, your UI
doesn‚Äôt work in German or Arabic. Also all your images and icons are
offensive to a particular country‚Äôs monarch. Are you ready to cross the
borders? Get ready for VAT tax tables, ughck.
</li>
<li>
<strong>SEO/Crawlability</strong> - Cool website you made, can robots
get to it and index it? Now LLMs are coming and slurping up your content
and traffic. Uh-oh!
</li>
<li>
<strong>Adjacent competitors</strong> - What your competitors are doing
will always play a role in engineering. Looking better than them is
good, being cheaper is good too, but one rule is the most important:
never be slower. See:
<a href="https://infrequently.org/2020/06/platform-adjacency-theory/">Platform
adjacency theory</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Throughput/Velocity</strong> - How fast can you and (more
importantly) your team ship an idea from conception to production. What
about turnaround times on bug reports?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you ever ask a developer if an idea is possible and their brain lags
out with a little loading spinner over their head, it might be this
enormous pile of concerns they‚Äôre mulling over. That can be an issue,
but I‚Äôd be more concerned about the developer that instantly says ‚ÄúYes‚Äù
to everything. And if you‚Äôre tired of developers saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù all the
time,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers/dp/0063018292">ask
your developer</a> about ways to put them in situations where they can
say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.

<p>
Everywhere I look, the news is telling me that atrocious crimes are
being committed by Israel.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza combines a staggeringly high death rate, shocking
violence toward children, unparalleled physical destruction, and now a
world-historical famine. The world has, by objective measure, never seen
anything like this. ‚Ä¶ What we have watched, what we are continuing to
watch, is the obliteration of a society of two million people. Every
facet of modern civilization, as well as the most elementary things
needed for even a state of basic subsistence for a human community, has
been deliberately and almost completely destroyed by the Israeli
military in Gaza. And now we are watching the gradual but accelerating
mass die-off of the people who once lived there, through a combination
of starvation, disease, and murder. ‚Äì
<a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/08/israel-gaza-worst-crimes-ever/">Israel‚Äôs
Gaza War Is One of History‚Äôs Worst Crimes Ever</a>, by Branko Marcetic,
for Jacobin
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The world is watching.
</p>
<p>
I remember speaking with a German accent on the streets of Portugal in
the eighties and another kid immediately reacted with ‚ÄúHeil Hitler!‚Äù I
was being reminded of what my Austrian ancestors had been part of. Even
if they had not committed the crimes themselves. A responsibility falls
not on only on those who commit the crime but on those who were there,
who did not stop it, and a responsibility falls on their children and
their grandchildren.
</p>
<p>
And remember, the genocide can still be stopped. There is a way to abort
this all. To just stop perpetuating it. There is a way to walk back.
Maybe not all the way back, but back to peace. To a just peace, even. To
pay the reparations now. To rebuild now. To help.
</p>
<p>
And to every company making money in Israel, cooperating with Israel,
benefiting from the genocide, closing their eyes and swallowing the
bitter pill of genocide in order to make some sweet, sweet silver and
gold, remember that aiding and abetting the dictators and war mongers of
the past is partaking in their crimes. These companies are taking part
in the genocide even if they don‚Äôt kill a single individual.

I recorded this morning, prime time, while getting things done, and
having ChatGPT getting in the way. It needs to become more invisible,
there‚Äôs no suspension of disbelief when you‚Äôre working with it. I think
we can do much better at finding a robot that can really augment human

<p>Whenever you have to get something done with a company, get ready for
lots of phone tag, waiting on hold, talking to bots, getting screened,
trying to convince a computer that you have legitimate business, and no,
what you‚Äôre looking for isn‚Äôt on their website (believe me I looked).
The stupid thing about it is that ChatGPT is becoming more like those
things every day. Companies have built awful systems for getting
anything done that might eat into their profits. Google is the absolute
worst. Even for services that cost real money, they absolutely will not
help. You better hope everything goes perfectly if you buy their
service.</p>

<h2 id="theater-ux">Theater UX</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I saw this summer‚Äôs Marvel movie in the theater on Sunday. A bit of a
last minute idea so we ended up going to the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù movie theater
across the highway. Before I continue, It‚Äôs important to understand my
local cinema dynamics. We have two theaters here in Austin:
<a href="https://drafthouse.com/">The Alamo Drafthouse</a> and All Other
Cinemas.
</p>
<p>
The best place to see movies in Austin is at the Alamo Drafthouse. If
you‚Äôve never been to an Alamo, I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs a movie theater for
people who love movies by people who love movies. They craft the entire
art house experience from end-to-end. From the custom pre-screener of
thematically topical clips, to the strict no late arrival and no texting
policies, to custom food and drink options that match the latest
blockbuster movie. A waiter brings you food, drinks, and refills so you
don‚Äôt have to leave your seat. The trailers are a tight 15 minutes
announcing new releases and special events where they bring back old
movie classics (set to an era-appropriate soundtrack, of course). Every
year they have an indie movie festival to showcase the weirdest films
the industry has to offer. Going to the Alamo is a thoughtful experience
through and through and they sell out nearly every show opening week.
You pay more going to the Alamo of course but I think everyone would
agree it‚Äôs worth it for most movies unless you‚Äôre looking for a quick n‚Äô
dirty alternative.
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1L3eeC2lJZs?si=i-jqBOufRqq5d9F3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
Contrast that to the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù theater. I call it the legacy theater
because this was the nice, brand new theater when I went to college 25
years ago; one of those big 24-screen nationwide chain movieplexes with
a four-machine arcade and stadium seating. Six plexiglass teller windows
tell the history of how popular this destination was in its time. It‚Äôs
flagship theater is an enormous 4D IMAX. It of course (like the Alamo)
has the push button recliners and swivel food trays. The nicest thing
about the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù theater is that there‚Äôs always open seats and that‚Äôs
where the problems start to reveal themselves‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
The first thing you notice at the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù theater is that no one
occupies the teller windows anymore. Instead you go inside to meet a
greasy teenager who scans a QR code for the ticket you have to buy
online. You go to the snack bar and load up on enormous free refill tubs
of popcorn, drinks, and overpriced candy; it‚Äôs almost certainly a $50
stop. Then you go to the nearly empty theater and wonder if you walked
into the wrong theater by accident. Before the movie starts you sit
through the hokey pre-screen trivia and local ads and when the start
time hits‚Ä¶ you watch 35 (!!!) more minutes of ads with a couple trailers
mixed in. And after all that you‚Äôre out of snacks and the movie starts.
</p>
<p>
The user experience contrast between the two couldn‚Äôt be more stark. One
is thoughtful and compounds the experience at every turn and the other
is enshittified with ads. One keeps you wanting to come back and the
other makes you wonder why you came here in the first place (or worse,
it makes you want to leave). At least its clean, I guess. One sees
attention as precious and not-to-be-disturbed, the other sees you as
captured by sunk costs and a pair of monetizable eyeballs. One will sell
you a fresh pizza, a popcorn, and a couple refillable sodas for $50 and
the other will sell you day-old popcorn, an impossibly large cup of
soda, and some Sour Patch Kids for $50‚Ä¶ after you do the math, the
better experience isn‚Äôt any more expensive so it‚Äôs not even competing on
price.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs no wonder why the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù theater is always empty. I bet its
owners would love to see all the seats full again. It all comes down to
UX. One works hard creates a vibrant scene and fosters a
culture<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
for people who like films, the other is real ‚Äúdeath of cinema‚Äù vibes.
People (sometimes thousands!) put so much effort into these films to
make the best film possible, only to have that experience ruined in the
last mile. It‚Äôs tragic and I guess I‚Äôll just catch it when it comes to
streaming.
</p>
<p>
In related news, last year Sony Entertainment acquired Alamo Drafthouse.
I‚Äôm not sure if that makes it more or less probable that you‚Äôll be able
to experience an Alamo in the future. We‚Äôll see where it goes from here.
Hopefully they can continue their relentless focus on the user
experience.

Alamo and revealed in 2022. While Alamo has done a lot to create immense
cultural capital here in Austin, that ascent has not been without
enabled bad behavior. Similar issues plague Hollywood too.

<h2 id="antisemitism-is-everywhere">Antisemitism is everywhere</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Academics, who speak scientific language, won‚Äôt say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no
antisemitism at UCLA‚Äù because they know that‚Äôs not true. Antisemitism is
everywhere. The question is how limiting and dangerous is it. And how
often is it encountered.
</p>
<p>
I grew up in the 1960s in a Queens neighborhood where antisemitism was a
real thing. We were blamed for World War II. If it weren‚Äôt for Jews my
uncle Pete would still be alive. That was the story. No doubt the kids
heard that at home.
</p>
<p>
Antisemitism was bred into us at home. Because of all the abuse my
parents and grandparents, uncles and cousins, suffered in Europe, before
coming the US during the war, their own idea of what it meant to be
Jewish was not entirely positive. You can‚Äôt help but feel responsible in
some ways for the abuse you suffer. And you can‚Äôt help but pass that on
to your kids.
</p>
<p>
There was and is a fair amount of pain associated with being Jewish in
the United States. Fact.
</p>
<p>
But: At UCLA? Harvard? Columbia? Please.
</p>
<p>
At the same time scientists can admit that there is antisemitism at
these places we must also acknowledge that to single these institutions
out among all, is complete utter total fucking bullshit.
</p>
<p>
That‚Äôs a scientific appraisal, btw. Provable in peer-reviewed
publications (though not submitted).
</p>
<p>
Antisemitism is complex. We should be hearing, openly, what exactly the
case is against these universities. The government is theoretically
representing the Constitution and the people of the United States. The
old ‚Äúno taxation without representation‚Äù
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation">thing</a>.
Let‚Äôs hear the case in clear terms, and why the universities are
supposedly so bad.

modest proposal for new holidays to manage your digital life</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The cost of being online is getting too damn high and I‚Äôm tired of
pretending it‚Äôs possible to fit these tasks into a normal life. That‚Äôs
why I‚Äôd like to share a modest proposal for a new set of holidays to
manage our digital lives:
</p>
<p>
(Ahem.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A day to clear out your inboxes
</li>
<li>
A day to reset your passwords and delete old accounts
</li>
<li>
A day to fix your calendars
</li>
<li>
A day to cancel online service subscriptions
</li>
<li>
A day to manage the tags on your website
</li>
<li>
A day to switch out any critical apps
</li>
<li>
A day to backup your computer and phone
</li>
<li>
A day to organize your photos
</li>
<li>
A day to organize your music collection and playlists
</li>
<li>
A day to setup your new phone/computer
</li>
<li>
A day to try out a new app or major piece of software for your primary
workflow
</li>
<li>
A day to delete old text messages
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All I‚Äôm asking for is 1/30th of a year that we end up cramming into
other days. I‚Äôm willing to trade some of the B-tier holidays (Easter,
Thanksgiving, etc) for this. If you work in the government please call
me, it is URGENT.

place where navigation feels good, like this is the right track. So I
took a

<p>A basic question I had about the
<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11752874-chatgpt-agent">ChatGPT
agents</a> that I can answer now that I have the feature, is whether or
not the code you create can run on a server, where you can give it a URL
and make it an endpoint other networked software can call. Or if it
could run periodically, say once every five minutes for a function that
was creating an RSS feed anyone could subscribe to. The answer is no ‚Äì
it can‚Äôt do either of these things. I‚Äôm sure they could do it at a
technical level, but they don‚Äôt want to host applications. But now I may
understand better why they want to make a web browser, I bet you will be
able to call these agents from apps that run in the browser. And in
their case, they might not even have to support JavaScript? Heh. A
wholly different programming model? Maybe I‚Äôm overestimating how much
they‚Äôre biting off? I wonder if anyone at OpenAI reads this blog and
might want to get me in a tighter loop, so I can be among the first to
try new features like this, rather than, in this case, among the very
last.</p>

<p>One of the more depressing things in having so much code that I can
easily search, is the number of times I‚Äôve rewritten the same code
without remembering I had written it before. Yesterday I did it
knowingly, I wanted a function that could tell me if one of a set of
categories applies to a WordLand draft. So I could say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt list
drafts with ‚Äòlinkblog‚Äô as a category.‚Äù It could have other categories,
and there could be more than one category to exclude. I wanted to take
the time to write perfect code for this one problem. Not dense, not
particularly efficient. No matter how inefficient the code is, on
today‚Äôs hardware such a function couldn‚Äôt use any time at all. It‚Äôs fair
to say I‚Äôve solved this problem before, but there was always more to it.
Here‚Äôs the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/d61110c1d74eb1162ebc726c09dd22f1">function</a>.
Now you know something about what I think is readable, understandable,
respectful of a human more than I am of the computer. I know the
computer would come up with much more dense and tricky code, but it
doesn‚Äôt have a mind, and I do. At times it can be relaxing, I magine, to
not have a mind. And btw, in a couple of years this layer of code will
be obsolete. We already are able to tell the machine how to do this in
human language, it understands what we mean. One tiny little but hugely
significant breakthrough made possible by ChatGPT and its cousins.</p>

<p>As you get older your memory gets less reliable. It makes programming
more of a challenge because as your software gets more features, there‚Äôs
more to remember and at the same time you‚Äôre getting older. I wonder if
there isn‚Äôt some way to use ChatGPT to augment the aging mind dealing
with more software complexity. It‚Äôs very much in line with the idea I‚Äôve
had for a long time of putting all my writing in an AI database so I
could then ask it to edit it down to book length. Or get a table of
contents of what I think and then be able to read chapter-length
sections on, say platforms, or how important prior art is, or what
interop makes possible, and why everyone should give back when they take
from open ecosystems. Each one of those topics has lots of associated
stories over the years, but I probably couldn‚Äôt find most of them, but
an AI database certainly could. How to set that up? I‚Äôve not figured
that out so far.</p>
