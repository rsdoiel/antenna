a decision on what to write or not to write. The problem with this
approach is that a session with an LLM doesn’t really have a memory

How to add a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">FeedLand blogroll</a> to
a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">Drummer
blog</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You must have a Drummer blog and a FeedLand account.
</li>
<li>
You can specify that all the feeds you’re subscribed to are in your
blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in
the blogroll.
</li>
<li>
The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new
post, it goes to the top of the list.
</li>
<li>
You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the
pubdate to go to the full item on the web.
</li>
<li>
It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the
list, Return to expand/collapse.
</li>
<li>
We’re working on WordPress plugin.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
blogrollUsername – required
</li>
<li>
blogrollServer – optional, if not specified it’s feedland.com
</li>
<li>
blogrollCategory – optional
</li>
<li>
blogrollTitle – optional, but you really should provide a title,
otherwise we invent a silly one for you. <span

to ask questions offer kudos, etc. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
PS: I’m not trying to sell you on using Drummer to run a blog. Rather I
needed a place to figure out how this works, so we know how to set up
and document the WordPress plugin.

<h2 id="new-lattice-cryptanalytic-technique">New Lattice Cryptanalytic
Technique</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, updated: 2024-04-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">new paper</a> presents a
polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving certain hard lattice
problems. This could be a big deal for post-quantum cryptographic
algorithms, since many of them base their security on hard lattice
problems.
</p>
<p>
A few things to note. One, this paper has not yet been peer reviewed. As
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/111385/polynomial-time-quantum-algorithms-for-lattice-problems">this
comment</a> points out: “We had already some cases where efficient
quantum algorithms for lattice problems were discovered, but they turned
out
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41731/new-quantum-attack-on-lattices-or-shor-strikes-again?rq=1">not
being correct</a> or only worked for
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/95187/what-does-the-work-an-efficient-quantum-algorithm-for-lattice-problems-achievin">simple
special cases</a>.”
</p>
<p>
Two, this is a quantum algorithm, which means that it has not been
tested. There is a wide gulf between quantum algorithms in theory and in
practice. And until we can actually code and test these algorithms, we
should be suspicious of their speed and complexity claims…

want to work with the best developers, I don’t care where they work. It
occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a>
about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out
opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn’t
happen, we don’t even look at each others software. After waiting a
whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short
periods, but it’s most of the time it’s been people trying to
deconstruct and reinvent other people’s work, not build on it. I’m still
open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more
time.</p>

don’t like how betting has invaded sports broadcasting. I don’t like
that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole
lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who
love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans
who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and
everything they (don’t) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks
(and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won’t be any of us left,
everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall,
because you can’t win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal
thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of
us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather
they’re feeding an addiction.</p>
