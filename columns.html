<h2 id="bluesky-feature-request">Bluesky feature request</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I posted a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lb46hc76n22p">feature
request</a> on Bluesky that has gotten a lot of flow.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bluesky devs..
</li>
<li>
How about a compromise.
</li>
<li>
Support inbound RSS.
</li>
<li>
Let me enter the URL of an RSS feed in settings.
</li>
<li>
I’ll ping a fixed location when the feed updates.
</li>
<li>
Would allow the same flow to go to other systems.
</li>
<li>
This would help a lot.
</li>
<li>
PS: I’ll help.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Imagine a Bluesky-like network that you could post to through any
blogging tool that can create an RSS feed. Imagine the new tools that
could be created. All of a sudden a whole world of writing tools opens
up.
</li>
<li>
It should happen faster than the proprietary format that Bluesky
defined, because RSS is so well understood in the developer world. Lots
of software out there for reading and writing. I have a couple of
toolkits of my own, for JavaScript, MIT licensed. In use in deployed
software so they work pretty well. (Knock wood.)
</li>
<li>
Also it would create an incentive for competitors to follow suit, and if
they do we suddenly have a strong and simple and broadly understood
basis for interop. It’s a brilliant competitive move, if they really
intend to give users choice, to not lock them in. It challenges their
competitors to follow suit. I don’t doubt that Mastodon would do it. And
Threads might even do it if they’re feeling competitive with Bluesky.
They’ve already chosen ActivityPub as a basis for interop, but that’s
been slow to develop. RSS is so simple and well understood it should
take a small fraction of the time to adapt.
</li>
<li>
Bluesky has already pioneered in providing excellent outbound RSS
support. I helped them do it, a while back, before the huge onslaught of
users.
</li>
<li>
The fact that so many users loved the idea is enough to have made it
worthwhile to suggest it. But I wouldn’t be tremendously surprised if
they actually did it.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feedback-on-sez.us-sign-up">Feedback on sez.us sign up</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Why I haven’t created an account on <a href="https://sez.us/">sez.us</a>
yet.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They ask for my first and last name before I sign up. Ask for that info
later, after I’ve created an account. I gave it a fake name to get to
the next screen.
</li>
<li>
Then they ask for my phone number. That’s when I hit the back button. I
already get too much spam on my phone, and the filters aren’t good
there. I am happy to provide an email address as my identifier as I do
on all other systems. Later, if I become a regular user, I don’t mind
providing the phone number as part of 2-factor identity, but not up
front.
</li>
<li>
Also I don’t like white on black letters. It’s hard for me to read. All
the competitive systems use black on white background. Offer it as an
option if it’s important to you, but please default to black on white.
</li>
</ul>

fediverse instances</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-11-18-being-on-small-fediverse-instances">
2024-11-18 Being on small fediverse instances
</h1>
<p>
The fediverse is the network of social media instances that communicate
via ActivityPub, mostly Mastodon but others exist as well. My own
instance runs GoToSocial. The benefit is that nobody can force you to
look at ads or sell your data.
</p>
<p>
Running such an instance means that you need the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a server and the admin skills to run it
</li>
<li>
space to store all the media files (my media folder currently uses about
19 GiB)
</li>
<li>
space to store all the messages (my database currently uses about 9 GiB)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But if you have a friend who runs one, or you’re a member of an
association that runs one, and you trust their admins, you can hop on.
Some friendly souls even run servers out of their own pockets, for free,
relying on donations to keep their servers up and running.
</p>
<p>
What I want to say: it’s possible to be part of the independent web.
</p>
<p>
There are, unfortunately, also problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
on larger instances, moderator burnout sometimes happens
</li>
<li>
on growing instances, budgets sometimes grow out of control
</li>
<li>
many people are harassed out of sight of the public
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think some people might prefer the bigger corporate players:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Twitter/X
</li>
<li>
Bluesky
</li>
<li>
Threads
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are a lot more people on those networks, that’s for sure.
Personally, I follow about 700 people with three accounts and I have
about the same number of people following me, I think. This is plenty! I
think it would be an illusion for me to think that in network with
millions more people my reach and influence would reach new heights. On
the contrary, the algorithm would probably bury my posts and even the
people who do want to see my posts would have to dig for them, past ads,
sponsored posts and posts with higher engagement metric.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that we often imagine our alternatives selectively. We
imagine the grass to be greener and our prospects to be better,
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking to get started, I’d be happy to help.

2024-11-17 Everything is slow and I don’t know why
</h1>
<p>
When I try to log into the server using SSH it takes a long time. Why is
that? <code>iotop</code> doesn’t show anything suspicious. And yet,
since Saturday 18:00, <code>munin</code> shows that something is up.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-1.jpg" alt="System CPU goes up. Everything goes up!" />

<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-4.jpg" alt="Utilisation per device goes up to 50%." />
</p>
<p>
I rebooted the server. “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” 🤷
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a>
</p>
<p>
And that seems to have worked. I wonder what I did back then.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-5.jpg" alt="Saturday 18:00 shows users connecting (me). Doing something. Who knows what." />
</p>
<p>
I was clearly doing something!
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I noticed: I uploaded a new version of the Norn bot, which
had an error. I replaced it. Was systemd spawning it again and again,
spamming the journal? Is that what caused the problem?
</p>
<p>
This is very strange.
</p>
<p>
But… rebooting helped!
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Or did it? The initial connect to the web
server still seems to take a second or five. Once the initial handshake
is done, the site serves quickly. So what could it be? The problem seen
above really is gone.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-6.jpg" alt="CPU is back to normal, lots of idle time." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-7.jpg" alt="Disk utilization is back to normal, nearly 0." />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Around midnight, I was exchanging emails
with
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="akkartik">@akkartik</span></a> and
everything seemed slow again. Nearly eight hours later, the problem
seems to be gone. And the graph supports that. The question is: What
does this mean? If I’m assuming that I installed a faulty bot on
Saturday 18:00 and fixed it Sunday 18:00 (plus a reboot), what happened
from midnight to 2:00?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-8.jpg" alt="Another spike from 0:00 to 2:00." />
</p>
<p>
Strangely enough, this spike in CPU usage was not accompanied in a spike
in disk usage.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I noticed this morning: Not only is my SSH extremely
sluggish – sometimes the command line takes half a minute or longer to
update – but my IPv4 banlist also wasn’t around. I had to run
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> again to reconstruct it. I’ve
been banning some more networks, too (mostly Contabo and Hetzner in
Germany). It doesn’t seem to be helping right now.
</p>
<p>
And while I’m snooping around: This hourly beat in Apache requests seems
like a clear sign of bot activity, too. Fuckers.
</p>

Lehrer asked</a> a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest
Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election)
they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of
destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn’t have to
invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn’t think his plan would succeed so
spectacularly. BTW, I don’t think Trippi’s network is the answer, but
maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was
using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along
than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my
presence with only
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, in and out.
Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start
building. It’s why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as
a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last
couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new
shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when
people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.</p>
