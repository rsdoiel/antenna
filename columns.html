<h2 id="bluesky-vs-mastodon-as-open-apis">Bluesky vs Mastodon as open
APIs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore
interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges,
will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex.
</p>
<p>
I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can
build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people
seem to understand it well enough, and I’ve been able to get it to do
what I need. Kind of like Amazon’s web service APIs. The designers seem
smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I’ve already
had apps built on their api break.
</p>
<p>
Neither one is in a particularly strong position.
</p>
<p>
Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you
can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook
into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their
protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things
that 99% of devs need to do.
</p>
<p>
Of course Mastodon isn’t supposed to be an API, the underlying API was
supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn’t complete,
and they need the functionality now, so they’ve implemented a REST API
for the other stuff. Makes sense, it’s what I would do in this
situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big
part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many
developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there.
</p>
<p>
As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that
process, that people will choose to interop with their product over
Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like “fediverse” get walked over
and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking
about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch).
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech
companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the
BigCos got involved. Still more hard work to do, and it must be working
<i>together. </i>It doesn’t work if people try to throw their
non-existent weight around. That’s basically with the big companies.

hindsight
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+medium">Medium</a>
chose the wrong business model. They could have done what Automattic has
done with WordPress. It’s a private company so I don’t know how much
it’s growing or how profitable it is, but from outside it’s obviously
growing and profitable. Basically, charge writers for the service, or
lots of services. Little extras you can add to your site. Use it as a
hook to sell domain names (huge recurring business). And open source the
Medium editor, when it came out it was a breakthrough in usability, and
offer it to Google to bundle with Chrome, upgrade the whole web while
you’re at it. With billions of windfall from the success of Twitter, why
argue over nickels and dimes. That’s what I always wondered about the
thinking behind Medium. Ev had the ability to change the course of the
industry, and make the same kind of money Google and Microsoft make. And
yes, I did urge him to do
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+medium">all
this</a> at the time, publicly (didn’t have access to him privately, if
you can believe that).</p>

<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2004/09.html">September 2004</a> was
the month when podcasting became a real community thing.
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html">Twenty years
ago</a>. I did eight podcasts that month. The mail list, which Adam
started, was going strong. This is the month where
<a href="http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html">podcasting
got its name</a>, thanks to some brilliant creativity from Dannie
Gregoire. Until then we were calling them “audio blog posts” or some
variant thereof. You can see it in this

on Airport Security</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting <a href="https://ian.sh/tsa">vulnerability</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
…a special lane at airport security called Known Crewmember (KCM). KCM
is a TSA program that allows pilots and flight attendants to bypass
security screening, even when flying on domestic personal trips.
</p>
<p>
The KCM process is fairly simple: the employee uses the dedicated lane
and presents their KCM barcode or provides the TSA agent their employee
number and airline.
<a href="https://www.apfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/KCM-Program-Changes_OCT19.pdf">Various
forms of ID</a> need to be presented while the TSA agent’s laptop
verifies the employment status with the airline. If successful, the
employee can access the sterile area without any screening at all…

<p>
The <a href="https://www.dungeoncontest.com/">One Page Dungeon
Contest</a> submissions are being read and discussed by the judges in
private but if you have a submission you’d like to get a paragraph of
review and feedback on, <a href="Contact">let me know</a>. I’m happy to
write a few words on this page.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://malachijs.itch.io/sundial-siphon">Sundial Siphon</a>: I
love the myconid picture and map; I had to read the part about the
rotating map multiple times and I’m still not sure it really contributes
to the game. Sometimes doors cannot be opened, sometimes some rooms
cannot be reached, but I’d have to see it at the table. I liked the
colour coding of monsters and connections. It says twice “Takes some
time to clear” but it’s unclear what the drawback is since there are no
random encounters? Is it a quarter rotation? Reading the Siphon makes me
think that after 4 phases all player characters are trapped in
constructs? That seems rather harsh. The dungeon says that that players
are racing against the clock but I think players wouldn’t know that, so
some sort of warning might be apt? There’s a warning in room 4 but I
feel a better warning is required, or the siphon should only affect room
5? In any case, the dungeon seems promising! 😄
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://peninsulancestral.itch.io/epona-temple">Epona’s
Temple</a>: I love the idea of achieving a permanent blessing of Epona.
The map is beautiful. I feel that the map doesn’t make clear which of
the obstacles are easy to sidestep. Can people go from 3 to 5 without
crossing 4 or 8? In 4 there’s a presence of insects but it wasn’t clear
to mean what that entails since there are no insect stats. From a logic
perspective the abandoned camp is puzzling. In any case, the rewards at
the end are my favourite thing. They match the premise at the entrance
and the theme of the temple itself. Love that. <em>E gostei muito de ver
um versão que não seja Inglesa. Muito bem feito!</em> 😄

2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor
</h1>
<p>
I tried to send an email from Emacs and it didn’t work. The error was:
</p>
<pre><code>msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>
<p>
I was able to reproduce the problem with the following
<code>hello.txt</code> file:
</p>
<pre><code>From: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
To: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
Subject: Test

This is the test.
</code></pre>
<p>
And then feeding that to <code>msmtp</code> with debugging enabled
(<code>-d</code>) and reading recipients from the mail
(<code>-t</code>):
</p>
<pre><code>msmtp -d -t &lt; hello.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
Now I had more info, however:
</p>
<pre><code>ignoring system configuration file /etc/msmtprc: No such file or directory
ignoring user configuration file /home/alex/.config/msmtp/config: Permission denied
falling back to default account
msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>
<p>
I checked permissions, and it was 0600 for the config file. Online, I
found a reference to AppArmor. Taking a peek at
<code>/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp</code> I didn’t see anything
surprising. But then I grew suspicious… I had in fact moved
<code>~/.config/msmtp</code> to <code>~/src/home/.config/msmtp</code>
(which is a Git repository) and replaced that with a symbolic link.
AppArmor didn’t like this and decided that <code>msmtp</code> was not
allowed to read that other file. Moving the directory back solved this
problem.
</p>
<p>
I guess I’ll be making occasional copies of this file into the Git
repository. 😒

<p>Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn’t an
Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him.
Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience,
had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer
product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an
iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he
himself wanted it, and that’s what made something an Apple product. It’s
probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the
products Jobs created for them. He told
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook">Cook</a> to innovate on
his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody
would be able to do it. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<p>Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be
a fanatical user of the company’s product. They must love it the way a
founder loves it. They must think the users are the smartest people in
the world because they love the best product in the world. As a founder,
I could not visualize the day I left the company for the last time. In
hindsight I felt that was the one factor most responsible for the
success of the company.</p>

Graham wrote a very
<a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html">useful piece</a>
about “Founder Mode.” As a founder myself, I think I can tell you why
founders have a central role to play as the company grows. They’re the
only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what
doesn’t and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and
the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the
company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned
managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in
my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional
CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho,
but – the founder understood what the company was about, and the
professional claimed to be a “market of one” and therefore didn’t have
an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be
delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company
were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought
new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don’t have to get
approval from anyone else. I’m sure in a company of today someone would
take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another
reason why companies have a hard time scaling. <span

<p>Already September 1st, and a tang of autumn in the morning air. I had
a two-week holiday with no laptop or emails, and lots of reading. Then a
two-week scramble to catch up with the accumulated email and work. So …
