Internet Enabled Mass Surveillance. AI Will Enable Mass Spying.</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If I hired a
private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your
home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I
would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of
those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you
under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom
you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.
</p>
<p>
Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive
and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting
where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they
did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track
our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk
to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what
we’re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become
cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used. What was manual and
individual has become bulk and mass. Surveillance has …

Ordinary</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>It’s about photographing things you see. It’s photographing the light
and direction of the light. It’s not stamp collecting. It’s about a
beautiful original photograph where you use your own initiative, your
own individuality, your own instincts to come up with something. It
doesn’t have to be the Hanging Gardens of f**king Babylon. It can …</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-04, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
I trusted a lot today. I trusted my phone to wake me on time. I trusted
Uber to arrange a taxi for me, and the driver to get me to the airport
safely. I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my
car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance
engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot
of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and
on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people
that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply
chain—any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted
thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in
this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning…
