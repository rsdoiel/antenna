<p>Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting “both
sides,” how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens
specific races, genders, lifestyles, religions and of course individual
people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he <i>doesn’t</i>
threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very revealing, and in
line with the true issue of this election. Time for you all to get in
sync with the actual American history that’s being made.</p>

line of code, a call to <i>new Date ()</i> in JavaScript, that was
behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The

<h2 id="health-is-nothing-to-screw-with">Health is nothing to screw
with</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Since I’m about to turn 70 (next May), and because my body is getting
old in ways it never has before (of course) – I’ve become a more active
participant in the health care system.
</p>
<p>
One thing I’ve learned is it can be hard to get the attention of the
doctors. And once you see your GP about a problem it’s almost certain
they’re going to send you to a specialist. So you go to the specialist
and it’s pretty random as to whether they put the effort into
understanding your situation in full. And they aren’t trying to solve
all your problems, just the ones they deal in.
</p>
<p>
An aside, a couple of years ago I had a condition that ChatGPT diagnosed
in a second but it took the doctors who weren’t paying much attention
(my primary care doctor had retired and I was being shuffled between NPs
and MDs until they could find someone to be my new main doctor) so they
were all sending me to the wrong specialists, all of whom said there was
no problem, yet I still had the symptoms which were getting worse. On
the fourth try, someone sent me to the right specialist and they
instantly diagnosed what ChatGPT had diagnosed at the outset. So when
people say AI could hurt medical care, I don’t think so, it would
probably be a good idea to have an AI looking over their shoulders and
asking if they’ve considered the Occam’s Razor specialist.
</p>
<p>
So you have to be alert, and push to get them to pay attention.
</p>
<p>
And communicating with the system is ridiculous. Almost everything has
to be done over the phone. They have email, but if you want to set up an
appointment, you have to call. And wait on hold. And wait and wait. And
then it’s a dice roll as to who you get connected to. There are some
people you talk to who seem to be trying to be annoying. It’s a total
pain in the ass, but you have to do it. (And since they have to ask for
your birthdate to identify you they know how old you are and treat you
accordingly.)
</p>
<p>
All the health care for a person my age seems to be directed at finding
the thing that’s going to kill you and treating it. That’s good, and
that’s a shift in perspective from someone who until recently had a
young body which basically took care of itself. Or so it seemed (I did
have emergency heart surgery at 47 that saved my life, although that’s a
fairly distant memory now).
</p>
<p>
So right now I have a thing that needs to be looked into because it
might be one of those serious things. And it’s really hard to get the
system to respond quickly, because if it’s serious it’s one of those
things that you want to deal with asap. I don’t think it is, but you
have to act as if it might be. And it can be humiliating to say the
least.
</p>
<p>
But there’s no law saying the doctor, or any of the others in the
system, could go to jail or lose their license if they treat any illness
I might have. I can now for the first time really understand what it
might be like to have to deal with that in addition to all the other
<i>serious</i> stuff you have to deal with.
</p>
<p>
That’s the point of this post. Throwing a wrench into the already broken
wheels of our medical system is the crime. They should go to prison for
doing this, the six Supreme Court justices and other Republican assholes
who stick their noses where they don’t belong. There should be a penalty
for what they’re doing, they should have the fear they’re putting women
through. They should worry about what happens when their decision is
overturned.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps they should lose their medical care as should all the members of
their families. Then they might get an idea of how sinful they have
been.

the plastic on display was how much drive space had the engineers fitted
in, and how much RAM did they have. Was the case a pretty colour, that
appealed to the latest 10-year-old-girl, or a rugged he-man, who was
hoping to make the school whatever team? In other words, rows of

2024-09-21 Getting started with that open table
</h1>
<p>
It‘s not that easy, unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
We used a dedicated channel where referees post game dates, and when
people say they want to play on that day, the announcement is updated to
include their name. If not enough people sign up, the game is cancelled.
</p>
<p>
There is a social channel that provides community and prevents the
server from falling away into ignored-land. Not sure how important that
is.
</p>
<p>
We keep signing up and chat about the game in a separate channel so that
the “next games” channel sticks out.
</p>
<p>
If the pool of players is small, offer a role to people interested and
tag it in the announcements.
</p>
<p>
That‘s all I got.
</p>
<p>
Going from “referee proposes a date and players sign up” to “players ask
me for available dates and recruit fellow players to the expedition”
took me <a href="2024-09-05-player-organized">45 sessions</a>…

<p>Has anyone attempted to make a higher level language on top of SQL?
It’s taken me a few iterations over years to finally (I hope) figure out
how to design a table to take advantage of the features that evolved
into making SQL efficient for the applications people really deploy. If
this were machine language, it would be time to start thinking about the
HLL that it inspires. Actually long past time imho.</p>

is a test. For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test
of a new server app that combines the functionality of several apps I
used to run as separate servers. The goal is to be able to integrate the
functionality of all the components. It’s time to invest in blogging in
a real way. The
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">2017
corner-turn</a> was about getting back to the foundation I had before
trying to co-exist with Twitter, Facebook, Medium. All three are now no
longer high value targets for interop. So while I wasted a lot of time
trying to <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/08/152655.html">peer</a>
with them, I did finally get off the horse and I had a decent setup
while developed <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> and
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> and in doing so learned how
to do scalable server apps with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>. I’ve wasted so much
time trying to be compatible with apps that didn’t want us. I have a
feeling that none of the current targets really want us either. So let’s
get back to the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html">Open

to be willing to look in that direction. This started out as a test post

distractions to sell me on something, that’s not their right. I paid

<p>I keep discovering uses for ChatGPT. I think it would be very useful
to learn a language, for example. I know how to say this in English,
could you explain to me, in English, how to say it in French. I bet it’s
very good at that. I am using it to learn to write SQL code that takes
advantage of all the arcane features they’ve added over the years to
handle cases that come up in real database work. It’s anything but a new
language, and efficiency is everything – so I think they pretty much
have all the cases covered. I remember how frustrating it was to learn
Algol when all I knew before that was Fortran and Basic. It would have
been great to have ChatGPT to coach me on it.</p>

<h2 id="driving-on-a-mountain-road">Driving on a mountain road</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/06/03/tinaTheBearNurseFromBojackHorseman.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
was driving on a mountain road yesterday to pick up a pizza in a nearby
town. I drive it fairly regularly, and I have a car that handles well so
I drive at the speed limit or a little above.
</p>
<p>
Still, what often happens on this road is some asshole tailgates,
getting so close that if I hit the brakes suddenly they would have no
time to react, and would slam into the rear of my car. And you do
sometimes have to hit the brakes because animals appear on the road,
deer, turkeys are common. Sometimes even bears.
</p>
<p>
I’ve never hit an animal, but I have come close.
</p>
<p>
There’s no way to pass on this road.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been in the other driver’s place when a tourist is driving 30 in a
45 mph zone, and what do you do? Keep your distance and don’t freak out.
It’s perfectly legal to go 30 in a 45 mph zone.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I slow down, to send a signal to the other driver, and also to
mitigate damage if there is an accident. This asshole leans on their
horn. I slow down more.
</p>
<p>
And when I come to a stop sign I come to a full stop and pause, thinking
okay they’ll pass me now, and I’ll get a chance to see who this asshole
is. They stayed behind and leaned on the horn again.
</p>
<p>
When we come to the next stop sign, it’s the end of the road and you can
go left or right. I’m going right, they’re going left, and the road is
wide so the asshole pulls up to the left of me and I look over and see a
middle-aged woman, could be a teacher or a nurse. I was amazed. The last
kind of person I would expect to make such a scene.
</p>
<p>
If I had a chance I would have asked what the hell they were doing.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I don’t speed on these roads because I like driving them, I love
the mountains, and the fresh air, and I wasn’t in any kind of a hurry.
It’s not uncommon to get a tailgater but usually they take the hint when
I slow down and add a few car lengths between us.
</p>
<p>
One of the reasons I have a blog is so I have a place to write these
stories. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China
</h1>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-14</strong>. I’m somewhere in the Italian-speaking parts
of Switzerland with my wife. There is a lot of running, hiking, hugging,
kissing, eating and drinking involved. 🥰
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-15</strong>. Still on the trip but late at night I spent
more than an hour trying to figure out why my server had a load of
nearly 40. 💻
</p>
<p>
All I discovered is that load went down when I shut down Emacs Wiki. See
also <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2024-09-16">2024-09-16</a>
on Emacs Wiki.
</p>
<p>
Well, I needed to sleep and I‘ve got plans for the next few days so I
shut it down while I slept hoping that the misconfigured spider is fixed
or the inept programmer discovers their mistake. Just another day in the
Butlerian Jihad. Some misguided soul probably wanted to download it all
and wrote a broken web crawler and when that got blocked they bought
some nice scaling infrastructure from Amazon, Hetzner, OHV or Alibaba
Cloud or whatever they are called, allowing them to use a gazillion
different IP numbers that will eventually lead me to implement some sort
of cloud service provider block.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-09-15-emacs-china.png" alt="Load shoots up to nearly 40 around midnight. The graph is for an entire week so the peaks are not shown. It just goes up to 30 multiple times." />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-16</strong>. Switched Emacs Wiki back on after a few
hours of sleep and it did fine. But then it restarted again… at 18:00,
19:00, 21:00, 22:00… and so I switched Emacs Wiki off again. Time to ban
some networks!
</p>
<p>
Anybody interested in my banning of IP ranges and possibly interested in
me reverting any of these, take a look at
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> … from a network that isn’t
banned, I guess. 😏
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-17</strong>. This continues to keep me busy and angry
every evening. Too bad I don’t have a real fast
<a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> to firewall ban
pipeline. I’m using this script instead of carefully checking IP numbers
and networks. I’m also sick and tired of the same networks popping up
again and again.
</p>
<p>
I added over a hundred Chinese networks to the firewall rules and I’m
seriously considering blocking the whole country for a week. It seems
that most of the offenders are networks run by China Telecoms and China
Mobile.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-18</strong>. So far, so good. Load stays below two.
</p>
<h2 id="example">
Example
</h2>
<p>
Here’s example usage for <code>network-lookup</code>, filtering for
Emacs Wiki and a URL parameter used when requesting recent changes or a
RSS feed for a single page only. That would count as suspicious
misbehaving crawler behaviour in my book.

<p>
As far as I am concerned, all deserve to be banned. Over-banning? Maybe.
What do you think?
</p>
<p>
For demonstration purposes, this is what I ran:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus.root grep '&quot;^www.emacswiki.org.*rcidonly&quot;' /var/log
/apache2/access.log \
| tail -n 20 \
| ssh sibirocobombus.root bin/admin/network-lookup \
| wl-copy
</code></pre>
<p>
So now I’m ready to ban them all:
</p>
<pre><code>wl-paste | grep ipset
</code></pre>

<p>In 1761, 55-year-old Benjamin Franklin attended the coronation of
King George III and later wrote that he expected the young monarch’s
reign would “be happy and truly glorious.” Fifteen years later, in 1776,
he helped to draft and then signed the Declaration of Independence.</p>

It seems they all exploded simultaneously, which means they were

<p>
Were they each tampered with physically, or did someone figure out how
to trigger a thermal runaway remotely? Supply chain attack? Malicious
code update, or natural vulnerability?

I have no idea, but I expect we will all learn over the next few days.

EDITED TO ADD: I’m

It is generally quite difficult to upset the denizens of a
<a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/90955">wretched hive of scum and
villainy</a> by further besmirching their reputation, but recently the
Trump family has succeeded.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I explain how
they did it, and why the denizens of the wretched hive are not
happy.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Matt Levine
identified the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-10/the-fastest-options-are-the-most-fun">fundamental
mechanism</a> at play here:<br />
<blockquote>
But you don’t have to just take your counterparties as you find them;
you can work to encourage and develop bad ones. This is often a matter
of product development: If you build a product that does nothing for
sophisticated professionals but that is really good for noisy addicted
gamblers, you will attract exactly the right sort of counterparty. This
arguably explains much of crypto.
</blockquote>
The additional point he omitted is that, in order to “attract exactly
the right sort of counterparty” you have to advertise the product. This
will bring it to the attention of others seeking the same kind of
counterparty. They will seek to leverage your product design for their
own ends.<br /> <br /> Trump has perfected the art of attracting “the
right sort of counterparty”. From
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University">Trump
University</a> to the banks he stiffed in his
<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019">multiple
bankruptcies</a>, to the stockholders of Truth Social his counterparties
have always been the
“<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/09/poker-patsy/">sucker
at the poker table</a>”. Key to this success has always been moving on
to the next scam as the previous one implodes.<br /> <br /> By the side
of the road to <strike>Damascus</strike> the White House the former
crypto-skeptic President encountered a small crowd of large
cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase, Ripple, Andreessen
Horowitz and Jump Capital. They were waving
<a href="https://followthecrypto.org/">immense sums of money</a>. Trump
underwent an instant conversion to the cryptocurrency faith, announcing
he would make the US the
“<a href="https://coinaute.com/en/trump-harris-debate-the-ignored-cryptocurrencies/">Bitcoin
capital of the world</a>”.<br /> <br /> Apart from the general idea that
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FSVSL6NZnU">more is
better</a>”, why would these immense sums of money be attractive to this
alleged billionaire? Apart from the costs of running a Presidential
campaign, some of which ends up in his own pocket, there is the need to
pay his legions of lawyers, and the looming judgements that these
lawyers failed to avert, including $88.3M before interest to E. Jean
Carroll and $454M before interest in his New York fraud case.<br />

<blockquote>
Trump’s eldest sons are gearing up to launch a new cryptocurrency
venture called <a href="https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/">World
Liberty Financial</a>, which is already receiving a big social media
boost from their father. Government ethics watchdogs say the project
could create a conflict of interest if Trump returns to the White House
next year.<br /> <br /> Trump has vowed to enact an array of pro-crypto
policies in a bid to win votes — and campaign cash — from digital asset
enthusiasts in recent months. Now, he’s
<a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1829141447087648796">weaving
the overtures</a> into his pitch for his sons’ forthcoming
startup.<br /> <br /> While the details of Eric Trump and Donald Trump
Jr.’s crypto endeavor haven’t yet been announced, it could stand to
benefit from a second Trump administration’s approach to support the
industry.<br /> …<br />
<a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/president-trump-legacy-corruption-3700-conflicts-interest/">CREW
identified more than 3,700</a> conflicts of interest during Trump’s
first term.<br /> <br /> But critics said the crypto project differs
because it could align his family’s financial interest with policy
changes that he would be poised to enact.<br /> <br /> “The prior
conflicts and illegalities took advantage of preexisting loopholes,”
said Norman Eisen, an ethics lawyer who served in the Obama White House
and later helped build the first impeachment case against Trump. “Here,
Trump appears to be promising to create the loopholes while his family
is simultaneously designing a business venture to exploit them.”
</blockquote>
The headline on World Financial’s “coming soon” web page is “World
Liberty Financial - The Only Crypto DeFi Platform supported by Donald J.
Trump”. There are dozens of “DeFi Platforms”, but the unique selling
point of World Liberty is that it is “supported by Donald J. Trump”. So
the counterparties it is intended to attract are the gullible members of
the Trump cult, the ones who have allegedly made him a
billionaire.<br /> <br /> With this unique selling point the actual
product doesn’t need to be very good to compete with the market leader,
<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/decentralized-crypto-exchanges-market-share">Uniswap</a>,
for its chosen counterparties. As Molly White reported,

<blockquote>
CoinDesk has gotten hold of a white paper for this supposed World
Liberty Financial, which they note appears to be a clone of Dough
Finance, a crypto lending platform that was hacked for around $2 million
just a month and a half ago. The hack was not a sophisticated one, and
instead exploited sloppiness on behalf of the development team.
</blockquote>
Of course, many people interested in gullible counterparties noticed all
the hype, and they didn’t have to wait to hack the actual product launch
to <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-65/">get in on the
action</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The project hasn’t even launched yet, and it’s off to a bumpy start.
First, Donald Trump Jr. had to issue a statement to try to stop people
from buying up all the fake tokens purporting to be associated with
their murky project. Then, Twitter accounts for Lara and Tiffany Trump
were both compromised and used to send tweets announcing a supposed
token launch. “This is a scam!!!” tweeted Eric, himself retweeting the
tweet from his wife’s account containing the scam token address.

The reason for this fiasco was that, as usual, the Trumps hired

influencers.

The leader of the Dough Finance team was Chase Herro. When it came time
to move on, he obviously found in the Trumps the ignorant and greedy
counterparty he needed. Zeke Faux and Muyao Shen also piled on with

<blockquote>
Herro, a fast-talking 39-year-old who shows off his fancy cars and
private-jet rides on social media, is an unknown in the crypto world.
More than a dozen prominent digital-asset investors said in interviews
they had never heard of him. The only crypto project with which he was
publicly affiliated attracted only a few million dollars and suffered a
devastating hack. A token he promoted on influencer Logan Paul’s podcast
dropped 96% afterward. In one speech in 2018, he called himself “the
dirtbag of the internet” and said that regulators should “kick s—heads
like me out.”<br /> <br /> “You can literally sell s— in a can, wrapped
in piss, covered in human skin, for a billion dollars if the story’s
right, because people will buy it,” Herro said about crypto in a 2018
YouTube video recorded as he drove in a Rolls-Royce. “I’m not going to
question the right and wrong of all that.”

Jasper Goodman reported on the cryptosphere’s reaction to this
incompetent blatant grift in
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/06/trump-family-crypto-startup-00177566"><i>‘A
huge mistake’: Trump’s crypto allies cringe over family’s
startup</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“This is a huge mistake,” said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter who is a
founding partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Castle
Island Ventures. “It looks like Trump’s inner circle is just cashing in
on his recent embrace of crypto in a kind of naive way, and frankly it
looks like they’re burning a lot of the good will that’s been built with
the industry so far.”<br /> …<br /> “It’s a very typical playbook of
smaller operators or more amateur operations in the crypto space to try
to generate a lot of hype before revealing the details,” said Austin
Campbell, an adjunct professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business who
previously led the risk and portfolio management operation at the crypto
firm Paxos. “That makes them susceptible to all sorts of
nonsense.”<br /> …<br /> One crypto industry representative in
Washington, granted anonymity because of sensitivities around
criticizing Trump, described having “a laundry list of concerns.” A big
worry is that that it could reflect poorly on the industry as it pushes
for policy changes that would help legitimize the sector.<br /> <br />
“Maybe it doesn’t move the needle for most people, but if this thing is
hacked or regular folks lose money on it or it opens up the door for the
SEC to investigate the team, it only looks like it has downside risk,”
Carter said. “It looks to have very little upside risk.”
</blockquote>
<p>As with Trump University and Truth Social, the whole point is for
“regular folks” to lose money. But, if you’re a candidate positioning
yourself as pro-crypto in the hope of getting large checks from the
cryptosphere, making this obvious to everyone but the cult members is a
bad idea.<br /> <br /> PS: Wikipedia explains the title of this post

Dorsey</a> is disappointed with Bluesky
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">on
Bluesky</a>. I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly
personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he’s a
human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and
I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or
bad. If my
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">theory</a>
is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it’s a valid point, Bluesky
was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The
more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with
being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did.
Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform
as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about,
basically global object storage with real financial backing, we’d be
much further along with the web as an operating system. We’re
paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don’t
understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It
can’t hurt to talk about what-if’s instead of barrelling down the same
ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00’s. I’ve been writing about
this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let’s start
talking about how we break out, because it’s not going to “just happen”
organically.</p>

Developers Targeted with Malware During Fake Job Interviews</h2>

Interesting social engineering attack: luring potential job applicants
with fake recruiting pitches, trying to
<a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/fake-recruiter-coding-tests-target-devs-with-malicious-python-packages">convince
them</a> to download malware. From a

article</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
These particular attacks from North Korean state-funded hacking team
Lazarus Group are new, but the overall malware campaign against the
Python development community has been running since at least August of
2023, when a number of popular open source Python tools were maliciously
duplicated with added malware. Now, though, there are also attacks
involving “coding tests” that only exist to get the end user to install
hidden malware on their system (cleverly hidden with Base64 encoding)
that allows remote execution once present. The capacity for exploitation
at that point is pretty much unlimited, due to the flexibility of Python
and how it interacts with the underlying OS…

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Tracy Durnell Blog</p>
<p>Both blogs and books are written for an audience, but blogs are a
dialogue, while fiction is a narrative. I use blogging as a tool for
thinking and making meaning. Fiction writing is not itself a
sense-making process for me, but told out of — after — sense-making.

been re-watching
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)">The
Bear</a> and am now totally thinking of my job as a chef. I started out
that way 40+ years ago, and somewhere along the line I stopped thinking
that way. If you can, watch
<a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-bear/video-extras/video/64beaaa830c49e0001e758d8">S02
E07</a> to see what I mean. It’s about service, the connection between
the staff and the people who come to eat, and the medium is the food.
It’s the same idea. There’s so much cynicism around tech, and I hate
that. We’ve rarely seen it as a human thing both by the people who make
the meals and the people who love great food. The world thinks of it as
billionaires and influencers and lying fascist politicians. But it
should be much more than that.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads,
Twitter, WordPress and RSS.
</p>
<p>
Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">The RSS feed</a>
is doing a lot of the work.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Links from the RSS feed show up on my
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links page</a> and in the
<a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emails</a>.
</li>
<li>
The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through
micro.blog. I am able to
<a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">give</a> it the
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">URL</a> of the
linkblogging feed, and then click on
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png">Add
Threads</a> – and that’s it. When I post something to the feed it shows
up on Threads.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most
people don’t know it’s there. It’s sort of a Grand Central station for
moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you’re a
micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds
page</a> is where you set it up.

I’ve got to say, I’m lurking in various pregnancy/“new parent”
subreddits and it’s weird to me how often I see comments like “in our
parents’ generation breastfeeding was discouraged” or “dads didn’t
change nappies then” or whatever. I was born in the early 90s and my
mum/aunts absolutely felt the same enormous pressure to make
breastfeeding work as exists today… and the men did their fair share of
active baby care (including, but not limited to, changing nappies).
Yeah, some things were different, but the 90s aren’t THAT long ago.
These people are talking like they were the Dark Ages…

has changed in the twitterverse, it’s grown new centers. For me,
Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot
less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for
ActivityPub but that’s more complicated than it may seem. As often is
the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a
strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn’t work,
when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users,
completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable
speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their
users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I
think it’s better if we, as users, remain diversified.</p>

You’ll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been
in every presidential election because then they’d have to fire half
their political reporters.
</p>
<p>
If you want a better idea of how it’s going, look at where the ad
dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning.
</p>
<p>
And make sure all your friends know that you’re voting and who you’re
voting for. I think that makes a difference.
