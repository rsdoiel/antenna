<p>date: 2024-12-04, updated: 2024-12-04, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
It’s been the
<a href="https://www.undp.org/super-year-elections">biggest year</a> for
elections in human history: 2024 is a
“<a href="https://www.idea.int/publications/catalogue/global-state-democracy-2024-strengthening-legitimacy-elections">super-cycle</a>”
year in which 3.7 billion eligible voters in 72 countries had the chance
to go the polls. These are also the
<a href="https://www.aspenideas.org/sessions/the-first-ai-elections">first
AI elections</a>, where many feared that deepfakes and artificial
intelligence-generated misinformation would overwhelm the democratic
processes. As 2024 draws to a close, it’s instructive to take stock of
how democracy did.

quick naps and food and gas along the way.

OK, what’s going on?

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-12-03-community-wiki-1.jpg" alt="Of all the processes running, Community Wiki has a huge spike." />
</p>
<p>
Looking at my logs, I’m adding <code>TurnitinBot</code> to my
<code>robots.tx</code> and I’m adding <code>DocSpider</code> to my web
server ban rules because the user agent string doesn’t contain a URL.
</p>
<p>
I also found an IP number from 147.124.205.0/24 quickly looking at all
sorts of URLs, with changing user agents and no bot identification, so
that entire network gets <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">banned at the
firewall</a>.
</p>
<p>
And there was an IP number that requested the main page a hundred times.
What the hell is wrong with people? They stopped an hour ago, so I’m not
taking action.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see what happens next.
</p>
<p>
For the moment, the peak is over.

In his post he asks if there is a BDG for creating a PDS for Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
A BDG is a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+busy+developer%27s+guide">Busy
Developer’s Guide</a>, something we did
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041009205034/http://www.soapware.org/bdg">first</a>
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html">for
SOAP</a> in 2001 when we were trying to figure out how to map
<a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> onto it. Since then there have
been lots of BDGs for all kinds of things. It’s a useful concept because
developers are often overly busy, so we need to get right to the problem
before understanding all the theory behind it. We need an example that
works, and we’ll just do what it does. That also guarantees interop,
which is the point of course.
</p>
<p>
Now we have a similar problem. Bluesky stores a user’s writing in a PDS.
If we can generate a PDS for our blogs, theoretically Bluesky should be
able to see them and use them as if they were created inside Bluesky. If
it were easy to understand we could get busy converting everything so it
works there. We can do that because we’re using popular simple formats
like JSON (see below) to organize our work.
</p>
<p>
For example this is how I use JSON for my blog, the one you’re reading
right now.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Here’s a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items">folder</a>
in a repository on GitHub. Broken down into
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020">years</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07">months</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07/18">days</a>,
and posts.
</li>
<li>
Each post is a JSON file,
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2019/03/03/a025810.json">like
this</a>. It has three bits of data, the text of the post, when it was
created (which also serves as a unique ID, no two posts have the same
creation date) and type. This item has a type of outline, because it can
have structure, though this post does not.
</li>
<li>
Here’s
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2022/07/06/a232835.json">another
post</a> that does have structure. In Bluesky it would be represented as
a thread.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here’s the question. What’s the absolutely simplest way to have that
structure of posts represented in a Bluesky PDS?
</p>

In 2017 the <a href="http://futureoflife.org/">Future of Life
Institute</a> released a video entitled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipTO_7mUOw"><i>Slaughterbots</i></a>.
Wikipedia describes it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterbots">as an</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
arms-control advocacy video presenting a dramatized near-future scenario
where swarms of inexpensive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_air_vehicle">microdrones</a>
use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial
intelligence</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_software">facial
recognition software</a> to assassinate political opponents based on
preprogrammed criteria.
</blockquote>
War accelerates technological progress. The war in Ukraine has not yet
produced “slaughterbots” but it has greatly accelerated drone technology
and taken some giant steps toward them. The most important of these
steps is that the cost of precision strike has been reduced by 1-2
orders of magnitude, making it affordable for “non-state actors” and
even individuals.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I look at drone
developments in the war in Ukraine, what is happening with drones and
drone defense in the West, and sketch some implications for the
future.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> In parallel with
the military developments I discuss here, there is rapid evolution in
civilian drone systems, especially in China, which can be expected to
feed into the military space. For example, Arnaud Bertrand describes
Pingyin County’s
<a href="https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862726569040781505">low-altitude
economy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The “low-altitude economy” is a big trend in China at the moment. XPeng,
one of China’s leading EV manufacturers, recently released a
low-altitude flying car for instance. Drone deliveries are becoming
increasingly common in Chinese cities, and various regions are actively
developing low-altitude transportation networks. Shanghai, for instance,
plans to establish 400 low-altitude flight routes by 2027.<br /> …<br />
this experiment in Pingyin County might seem small, but it could be the
beginning of something truly revolutionary. This is China effectively
experimenting around becoming the world’s first truly three-dimensional
economy, with low-altitude transportation and logistics networks. In a
decade or two Chinese cities might have as much activity happening in
the sky as on the ground.
</blockquote>

Ukraine
</h2>
The drone systems I am discussing here fall into two classes:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Small systems such as First Person View (FPV) quadcopters, with a range
of a few tens of kilometers.
</li>
<li>
Larger systems navigating autonomously by GPS or other means with a
range of hundreds of kilometers but relatively slow speeds of up to
200Kph.
</li>
</ul>
I am excluding faster systems such as short-range missiles like HIMARS
and cruise missiles such as Storm Shadow.<br />
<h3>
Short Range Drones
</h3>
The battlefield use of small fixed-wing and FPV quadcopter drones in the
class of DJI’s
<a href="https://store.dji.com/product/dji-mavic-3-pro">Mavic</a> and
<a href="https://store.dji.com/product/m350-rtk-and-dji-care-enterprise-basic">Matrice</a>
has transformed both reconnaissance and strike. They cost a few hundred
to a few thousand dollars; for comparison a
<a href="https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/04/goal-100k-artillery-shells-month-sight-army-says/396047/">155mm

Small drones, such as the Russian
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlan-10">Orlan-10</a>, provide
an eagle’s-eye view of the battlefield with real-time video. They have
greatly extended the range of battle field surveillance. With zoom
lenses they can provide detail at these longer ranges. With GPS they can
provide precise target locations. With thermal cameras they can do all
this at night.<br /> <br /> These changes have had significant tactical
effects:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Movement within about 20Km of the front line has become much more
dangerous. Night is no longer a good cover for movement. This has made
logistical support for positions close to the front more difficult.
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">For
example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
That has made some sections of the front lines, for example around
Siversk in Luhansk province, practically no-go areas for humans. Drones
are now responsible for a majority of battlefield losses, overtaking
artillery, according to Ukrainian sources.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
Damage assessment has become much easier. Real-time video of strikes can
estimate their effects accurately, avoiding wasting ammunition by
repeated strikes on targets that have been sufficiently disabled.
</li>
<li>
The vast amount of video generated, much of it from drones and the rest
from cellphones allows selected clips to be posted to social media used
for propaganda and for units to fund-raise. Donations are significant,
especially on the Russian side for vehicles, and on the Ukrainian side
to
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">support
drone manufacture</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Ukrainian state is buying more than it once was, but voluntary
foundations still provide at least a third of all drones used by the
army.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
This cornucopia of video fuels an active
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence">open
source intelligence</a> community and especially their impressive
ability to geolocate. It has become much harder for combatants to hide
events from the public.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Strike
</h4>
Kamikaze FPV drones provide sniper-like precision strike, but at vastly
longer range, with much heavier warheads, and the ability to access
<a href="https://x.com/Osint613/status/1852045500519981272">targets that
snipers cannot</a>. For example, social media videos routinely show FPV
drones striking targets inside buildings or infantry fighting vehicles
(IFVs) after entering through open doors. The warheads in common use
include anti-armor explosively formed projectiles — here is a
<a href="https://twitter.com/mouw5284/status/1859996364563939769">small
FPV drone</a> costing a few thousand dollars demolishing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-90">T-90</a>, the most advanced
tank Russia has deployed costing perhaps $3-5M. Note the precision with
which the FPV drone strikes the joint between the turret and the hull.
And
<a href="https://twitter.com/PStyle0ne1/status/1862419476454535531">here</a>
four FPV drones totaling around $10K destroy a $24M Zoopark radar.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Javelin_Fire!_(48638261261).jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="The U.S. Army,

Javelin</a> with a unit cost of around $250K, a range of less than 5Km
and weighing 22Kg. Is one Javelin as effective as 50 FPV drones
delivering perhaps six times the weight of warhead at more than twice
the range?<br /> <br /> There are also many FPV strike drones that are
not kamikaze. There are
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_drone">Dragon drones</a>”
that drop burning thermite on

<blockquote>
The drone is a large hexacopter (6-rotor) drone. It is equipped with an

deploying “mortar-sized munitions” and also as a “mother-ship” drone
equipped with a signal repeater, anti-jamming equipment, batteries, and
directional antennas. Its ability to function as a signal repeater
extended the battery life and range of secondary drones. During the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, the drones have been used primarily at
night.

emerging to fill it, such as one in the video tweeted by

On the Russian side the predominant strike drone is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZALA_Lancet">Lancet</a>, a
propeller-driven fixed-wing drone costing around $20K with a range up to
40Km. It has been fairly effective until recently (see Defense below),
but probably less cost-effective than the much cheaper quadcopter FPV
drones.<br /> <br /> The Achilles heel of all these drones is their
dependence upon radio communication for command and control, which can
be both detected and jammed. Worse, the command and control transmitter
can be located and attacked; drone pilots are a high-priority target for
both sides.
<a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1798050100633366633">This
tweet</a> shows the Ukrainians using remotely-controlled directional
antennas so to minimize the risk of detection, and the loss if
attacked.<br /> <br /> Thus both sides have started to deploy drones
controlled via a fiber optic cable. David Hambling reports on a
Ukrainian version in
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/11/07/ukraine-fields-reboff-unjammable-fiber-optic-fpv-attack-drone/"><i>Ukraine
Fields Unjammable Fiber Optic FPV Attack Drone</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Khyzak REBOFF is a new Ukrainian FPV kamikaze drone with fiber optic
cable for communication instead of radio. This makes it immune to
jamming , the most effective protection against small drones.<br />
<br /> Russia has deployed similar technology with the Prince Vandal FPV
used in action since August, and which has been lethally effective.
However, Ukrainian expert Serhii Flash believes this is a Chinese model
which the Russian suppliers rebranded and sold to the military (at a
750% markup), and which was not designed for military use.
</blockquote>
The <a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1855078938164482502">video
in this tweet</a> shows that the fiber doesn’t impair the FPV drone’s
remarkable agility. And
<a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1853504089734451210">this
tweet</a> from the Russian side highlights the high-definition video
characteristic of fiber optic drones. This thread discusses the
<a href="https://twitter.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1862908038149194028">many
advantages fiber optics have over radio</a> in drone warfare. However,
replacing radio with fiber adds cost and weight, and reduces
range.<br /> <br /> The other way to prevent detection and neutralize
jamming is to remove the need for a remote pilot by having the drone
detect potential targets and select the most valuable autonomously, as
implemented for example in the UK’s “fire-and-forget”
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brimstone_(missile)#Targeting_and_sensors">Brimstone</a>
missile. Brimstone costs around $130K, over an order of magnitude more
than these Ukrainian autonomous drones. They are cheap enough to be used
in swarms, as shown in
<a href="https://x.com/banderafella/status/1851657984377598327">this
tweet’s video</a>.<br /> <br /> The US military
<a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/military-review/Archives/English/Online-Exclusive/2024/Multidomain-Battlefield-AI/Multidomain-Battlefield-AI-UA.pdf">reports
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Attaching infrared and visible light sensors to unmanned systems with
onboard object detection and tracking will also increase model
performance and targeting effects regardless of illumination conditions.
The Ukrainian army is already deploying semiautonomous multirotor drones
with onboard edge devices to fly munitions into Russian tanks
autonomously.

Ukraine is using dozens of domestically made AI-augmented systems for
its drones to reach targets on the battlefield without being piloted, a
senior official said, disclosing new details about the race against
Russia to harness automation.<br /><br /> Systems that use artificial
intelligence allow cheap drones carrying explosives to spot or fly to
their targets in areas protected by extensive signal jamming, which has
reduced the effectiveness of manually piloted drones.<br /> …<br /> A
Ukrainian official told Reuters in July that most first person view
units’ target strike rate had fallen to 30%-50%, while for new pilots
that can be as low as 10%, and that signal jamming was the main
problem.<br /><br /> The official predicted that AI-operated first
person view drones could achieve hit rates of around 80%.

recognize seven types of targets: infantry, cars, minivans, trucks, air
defense systems, artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles.<br /> …<br />
The automatic target recognition range varies from 150 to 800 meters
depending on the object type, with the maximum targeting range being up
to 1000 meters. The system can be installed on any type of FPV kamikaze
drones, including multicopters, wings, and airplanes. It is equipped
with its own camera, connects to the flight controller and standard VTX,
and drone control is done via a standard remote.<br /> <br /> According

<i>The Economist</i>’s

Ukraine uses cheap AI-guided drones to deadly effect against
Russia</i></a> agrees with this cost estimate:<br />
<blockquote>
Yaroslav Azhnyuk, the founder of The Fourth Law, says that his own
“autonomy module” is around $50 to $100 per unit for Ukrainian customers
buying thousands of units.
</blockquote>
The cost-benefit ratio of adding AI is reportedly
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">considerable</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Data from the battlefield suggest that the hit rate for these AI-guided
drones is currently above 80%. That is higher than the rate of manually
piloted drones. As important, the training burden declines dramatically.
Mr Liscovich notes that, although there are now more highly experienced
drone pilots, some with thousands of hours of flying time, the average
quality of Ukrainian personnel has fallen over time as less motivated
people are conscripted. “We can train an operator within 30 minutes and
the quality of the engagement doesn’t depend on their piloting skills,”
</blockquote>
With feedback from use in combat, the performance of these systems is
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">improving
rapidly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Rudimentary object-recognition software has been in use, on both sides,
for over a year. But it is getting better. Lorenz Meier of Auterion, a
Switzerland-based firm, says that between spring and summer his firm’s
software, known as Skynode, managed to double the range at which a drone
could engage a target, from 500 metres to 1km or so. He says that
improvements in the resolution of images captured by drones have since
increased that further. <i>The Economist</i> understands that AI systems
are sometimes locking onto targets at perhaps double that distance, far
beyond the range at which basic jammers could take out the drone.
</blockquote>
The innovation cycle is
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">accelerating</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Mr Meier reckons that fewer than a tenth of drones are AI-guided at
present. But that number is rising. Ukraine’s innovation cycles are
relentless, with feedback loops in some cases down to a few days. The
simplicity of FPV drones, which Ukraine builds from off-the-shelf
components, can also act as a hindrance: it makes them easy to
replicate. One manufacturer says Russian reverse engineering can be as
quick as three weeks, but encryption means that the software can be
protected from copying.
</blockquote>
These autonomous systems are still vulnerable to jamming before they get
close enough for the AI to recognize the target. Some idea of the
intensity of the electronic warfare in Ukraine can be gained from
Charlie Metcalfe’s
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/12/1103833/ukraine-russia-drone-war-flash-radio-serhii-beskrestnov-social-media/"><i>Meet
the radio-obsessed civilian shaping Ukraine’s drone
defense</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Serhii “Flash” Beskrestnov hates going to the front line. The risks
terrify him. “I’m really not happy to do it at all,” he says. But to
perform his particular self-appointed role in the Russia-Ukraine war, he
believes it’s critical to exchange the relative safety of his suburban
home north of the capital for places where the prospect of death is much
more immediate. “From Kyiv,” he says, “nobody sees the real
situation.”<br /> <br /> So about once a month, he drives hundreds of
kilometers east in a homemade mobile intelligence center: a black VW van
in which stacks of radio hardware connect to an array of antennas on the
roof that stand like porcupine quills when in use. Two small devices on
the dash monitor for nearby drones. Over several days at a time, Flash
studies the skies for Russian radio transmissions and tries to learn
about the problems facing troops in the fields and in the
trenches.<br /> <br /> He is, at least in an unofficial capacity, a spy.
But unlike other spies, Flash does not keep his work secret. In fact, he
shares the results of these missions with more than 127,000
followers—including many soldiers and government officials—on several
public social media channels. Earlier this year, for instance, he
described how he had recorded five different Russian reconnaissance
drones in a single night—one of which was flying directly above his van.

This kamikaze drone has a range of up to 100 km and weighs about 12 kg
and a speed of up to 220 km/h<br /> <br /> The main feature of the HX-2

provide autonomous target recognition and their destruction even with
active electronic warfare.

This is similar to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brimstone_(missile)#Targeting_and_sensors">Brimstone’s
capabilities</a> but slower, smaller, longer-ranged and much
cheaper.<br /> <br /> Again, the most important aspect of these
developments is that they greatly reduce the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-15/above-ukraine-a-sky-full-of-drones-is-changing-the-war">cost
of precision strike </a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Ukraine’s new drones are also cheap. A kit of 10 Fire Point drones plus
a control station and transport, including three mobile trailers, costs
$580,000. That’s a fraction of the cost of military drones produced by
western arms manufacturers, though it’s still a stretch for Ukraine’s
military budget. FP says it can produce at least 500 drones per month,
but that Ukraine’s defense ministry struggles to buy a fifth of that.

<h3>
Drone Defense
</h3>
The essential feature of a successful defense against either the short-
or the longer-range drones is that it be cheaper than the attack. This
is rapidly decreasing, making cost-effective defense challenging.<br />

Over a field east of Poltava, the sound of a 4-cylinder piston engine
rumbles through the quiet of the night. A small electronic box attached
to a cell tower records the sound, identifying the audio profile of a
Geran-2 loitering munition, and transmits the data for processing.
Responding to an alert, two soldiers fire up the engine on their Nissan
pickup truck and go speeding down the road to the grid coordinates
provided. In position, they scan the horizon in the direction of the
attack. They have only a narrow window of opportunity. Tracers arc into
the sky from their old but reliable DShK, their efforts rewarded as the

Three weeks ago Gordon Lubold, Lara Seligman and Aruna Viswanatha of the
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported that the

Drones Swarmed a U.S. Military Base for 17 Days. Pentagon Is
Stumped</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
U.S. Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly wasn’t sure what to make of reports that
a suspicious fleet of unidentified aircraft had been flying over Langley
Air Force Base on Virginia’s shoreline.<br /> <br /> Kelly, a decorated
senior commander at the base, got on a squadron rooftop to see for
himself. He joined a handful of other officers responsible for a clutch
of the nation’s most advanced jet fighters, including F-22
Raptors.<br /> <br /> For several nights, military personnel had
reported a mysterious breach of restricted airspace over a stretch of
land that has one of the largest concentrations of national-security
facilities in the U.S. The show usually starts 45 minutes to an hour
after sunset, another senior leader told Kelly.<br /> <br /> The first
drone arrived shortly. Kelly, a career fighter pilot, estimated it was
roughly 20 feet long and flying at more than 100 miles an hour, at an
altitude of roughly 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Other drones followed, one by
one, sounding in the distance like a parade of lawn mowers.<br /> <br />
The drones headed south, across Chesapeake Bay, toward Norfolk, Va., and
over an area that includes the home base for the Navy’s SEAL Team Six
and Naval Station Norfolk, the world’s largest naval port.
</blockquote>
Given the incredible lethality of drones in Ukraine, this seems like a
problem. The <i>WSJ</i> story provided
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/mystery-drones-swarmed-a-u-s-military-base-for-17-days-the-pentagon-is-stumped/ar-AA1saqAu">more
details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Over 17 days, the drones arrived at dusk, flew off and circled back.
Some shone small lights, making them look like a constellation moving in
the night sky—or a science-fiction movie, Kelly said, “‘Close Encounters
at Langley.’” They also were nearly impossible to track, vanishing each
night despite a wealth of resources deployed to catch them.<br /> <br />
Gen. Glen VanHerck, at the time commander of the U.S. Northern Command
and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, said drones had for
years been spotted flying around defense installations. But the nightly
drone swarms over Langley, he said, were unlike any past incursion.

The swarms were clearly a

operation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
U.S. officials didn’t believe hobbyists were flying the drones, given
the complexity of the operation. The drones flew in a pattern: one or
two fixed-wing drones positioned more than 100 feet in the air and
smaller quadcopters, the size of 20-pound commercial drones, often below
and flying slower. Occasionally, they hovered.<br /> <br /> They came
from the north around 6 p.m. to traverse the base, which sits on a
peninsula at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, and continued south, beyond
the reach of radar. They repeated the pattern and then disappeared,
typically by midnight.
</blockquote>
Shaheds do sound like lawn movers, fly around 100mph, and have the
endurance to fly several circuits of Langley between 6pm and midnight.
General Kelly might have over-estimated the length; the fixed-wing
drones may have been Shahed 136 equivalents. The map shows the vast area
from which a Shahed 136-class drone attack on Langley could be
launched.<br /> <br /> In

Drone Defense: Systems

his approach</a> to drone defense:<br />
<blockquote>
“I think there’s certainly a role for fighters. There’s a role for
non-kinetic or low-collateral kinetic capabilities that would be at the
smaller end. And then I’m a big proponent for advances in directed
energy, laser and high power microwave. So those non-kinetic
capabilities that bring a kinetic result of bringing down the systems,
and I think it has to be layered in today’s today’s threat.”

Indeed, the DoD’s Palletized High Energy Laser Program has produced a
laser counter-drone system, the
<a href="https://bluehalo.com/bluehalo-locust-laser-weapon-system-delivered-to-the-palletized-high-energy-laser-p-hel-program/">BlueHalo
LOCUST Laser Weapon System</a>. The <i>WSJ</i> reported on it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFiDYFnlp7s">this
video</a>.<br /> <br /> One of the big problems with cheap drones is
that you need to shoot them down even more cheaply. LOCUST touts a
per-shot cost of just $3, but that isn’t the end of the story. Each
LOCUST costs $10M. “fewer than a dozen are deployed”, all overseas. Each
requires a dedicated team from BlueHalo to maintain it because there are
no stocks of spare parts. And “the Pentagon has not confirmed that a
laser has taken down a drone in combat”. It weighs 3400lb and fits in a
7’ cube. It takes “as many as 15 seconds to melt a target”.<br /> <br />
Despite the low per-shot cost, LOCUST isn’t a solution to the rash of
drone swarms. First, at a unit price of $10M plus a dedicated support
team defending the vast number of US defense assets isn’t affordable.
Second, the problem isn’t defending against a single drone, it is
defending against a swarm of cheap drones. For example, Ukraine used at
least 34 drones in their November 10<sup>th</sup>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-drone-attack-forces-closure-two-moscow-airports-2024-11-10/">attack
on Moscow</a>. Lets guess that Locust can switch targets in 5 seconds,
and is 100% lethal in 15 seconds, it would take 11:20 to defeat the
swarm. It isn’t going to have that long, because at 100mph that is 19
miles. So even if 34 was the biggest feasible swarm (hint: it isn’t)
defending a high-value asset would need say 5 LOCUST systems at $50M
capex plus opex.<br /> <br />
<h3>
Drone Defense: Policy
</h3>
Neither the pickups with the Brownings nor the cellphones are systems
the DoD’s supply chain is interested in building. But even if systems
like LOCUST could be afforded and deployed, policies need to be
established for their use. Joseph Trevithick, Howard Altman and Tyler
Rogoway’s
<a href="https://www.twz.com/news-features/lasers-microwaves-missiles-guns-not-on-the-table-for-domestic-drone-defense"><i>Lasers,
Microwaves, Missiles, Guns Not On The Table For Domestic Drone Defense
</i></a> is a deep dive into the policy issues:<br />
<blockquote>
Even if counter-drone policies are clarified and solidified, and
authorities get expanded, there are still other concerns at play,
especially when it comes to collateral damage. Shooting something down
with a gun-based system or a surface-to-air missile carries inherent
dangers of projectiles or interceptors, or debris from them, falling
onto innocent bystanders below. The aforementioned Centurion C-RAM
<a href="https://www.twz.com/36412/centurions-roaring-whips-of-exploding-shells-are-still-engaging-rockets-over-iraqs-green-zone">fires
specialized self-destructing ammunition</a> to reduce these risks.
</blockquote>
Here, for example, is an
<a href="https://x.com/Trotes936897/status/1851738072779501911">Oerlikon
Revolver</a> in Ukraine firing
<a href="https://x.com/Trotes936897/status/1851738118396801392">air-burst
ammunition</a>. But the ammunition isn’t the only problem:<br />
<blockquote>
The drone, or what is left of it, which could include undetonated
explosive warheads or
<a href="https://www.twz.com/air/poop-filled-north-korean-balloons-descend-on-the-south-stoking-fears-of-deadlier-payloads">other
potentially hazardous payloads</a>, would also fall to Earth in an
uncontrolled manner after any such engagement.<br />
</blockquote>
The Russians frequently explain burning oil refineries and similar
mishaps on debris from successful interceptions of drones. Someone whose
house was destroyed by the 50Kg warhead of a shot-down Shahed 136 would
have reason to be upset. Deciding on a suitable counter-drone policy is
<a href="https://www.twz.com/news-features/lasers-microwaves-missiles-guns-not-on-the-table-for-domestic-drone-defense">complex</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Maybe even more importantly is that these weapons do fail and they are
packed with high explosives and traveling at high speed, which could
cause very unpredictable harm to people and property in a large
potential impact area. Then there is the idea that you have to know
exactly what you are shooting at, and that can be harder than it sounds
when dealing with strange objects in the sky, especially in populated
areas where civilian air traffic is dense. Making the call to shoot down
an object over the U.S. is an incredibly complex task that never
actually occurred until recently.

But even in war zones where the US policy is clear and permissive, it
isn’t foolproof. Stefan Becket and Kaia Hubbard reported on a January
incident at Tower 22 on the border with Syria in
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-troops-killed-jordan-american-service-members-syria/"><i>3
American service members killed and dozens injured in drone attack on
base in Jordan, U.S. says</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Three American service members were killed and dozens more were injured
in an unmanned aerial drone attack on a base in Jordan on Sunday,
President Biden and the U.S. military said.<br /> …<br /> Mr. Biden said
the attack happened at a base in northeast Jordan, a U.S. ally, close to
the border with Syria. A U.S. official said the attack occurred at an
outpost known as Tower 22, where roughly 350 U.S. Army and Air Force
personnel are deployed, according to the Department of Defense.<br />
<br /> U.S. Central Command, which oversees forces in the Middle East,
initially put the number of injured at 25, but two U.S. officials soon
said that figure had risen to more than 30. CENTCOM confirmed later
Sunday night that at least 34 had been injured. Eight of the wounded
service members had to be evacuated — some were in critical condition
but all were stable, a defense official told CBS News.
</blockquote>
How was the drone able to penetrate US defenses and kill or injure more
than 10% of the base occupants?
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/politics/us-soldiers-deaths-jordan/index.html"><i>Drone
that killed US soldiers in Jordan followed American drone onto base,
causing confusion</i></a> by Natasha Bertrand, Oren Liebermann and Haley
Britzky explains:<br />
<blockquote>
The drone that killed three US Army soldiers and wounded dozens more in
Jordan on Sunday approached the US military outpost, Tower 22, around
the same time an American drone was returning to the base, which led to
uncertainty over whether it was hostile and caused a delay to the US
response, two US officials told CNN.<br /> <br /> The enemy drone
followed the American drone as it approached, but it is not clear
whether the enemy drone intentionally followed the American one or if it
was a coincidence, one of the officials said.
</blockquote>
These problems don’t go away if the counter-drone technology is
electronic. Confusing the drone’s navigation with GPS spoofing or
detaching an FPV drone from its pilot using a jammer may prevent it
reaching its target but it doesn’t render it harmless to innocent
bystanders.<br />
<h3>
The Threat
</h3>
One notable feature of the war in Ukraine is Russia’s sustained campaign
against Ukraine’s electric grid, which has caused major difficulties
especially in the winter. On November 26<sup>th</sup>
<a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1861396932658115043">Volodymyr
Zelenskyy tweeted</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last night, Russia attacked Ukraine, launching a record number of strike
drones—188—against our people. I want to thank our defenders of the sky
for repelling the attack. Around 80 drones were shot down, and more than
90 were lost due to location disruption.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately,
there has been damage to our critical infrastructure, and the situation
in Ternopil remains challenging. All services and repair crews are
on-site, doing everything to assist people and restore electricity as
quickly as possible.
</blockquote>
A mysterious feature has been Ukraine’s reluctance to attack Russia’s
electric grid, especially since their economy and military are
completely dependent upon freight trains hauled by electric locomotives.
This may have been part of the US’ “escalation management”.<br /> <br />
If whoever is behind the drone incursions in the West decides to switch
from reconnaissance to strike, they are likely to follow the Russian
example and strike the grid by attacking the transformers.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack">US
transformers have already been shot</a> and damaged by unknown
attackers, presumably right-wing militia. FPV drones would cause far
more than the $15M damage in that attack. Large grid transformers are
expensive, long lead-time items, completely defenseless against drone
attack. A coordinated attack on a number of them would have a major,
long-lasting impact on the US grid, similar to a major
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/07/coronal-mass-ejections.html">coronal
mass ejection</a>.<br />
<h2>
The Future
</h2>
The cost of precision strike, both at short and longer ranges, has been
reduced by at least an order of magnitude and likely much more. Further
reductions are very likely. Typically, when the cost of something is
greatly reduced, you get a lot more of it. What is likely to be the
effect of greatly increasing the supply of precision strike?<br />
<br /> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09592318.2024.2319216"><i>The
impact of precision strike technology on the warfare of non-state armed
groups: case studies on Daesh and the Houthis</i></a> by Max Mutschler,
Marius Bales and Esther Meininghaus examines one effect that has already
happened:<br />
<blockquote>
Precision strikes from a distance are a common practice of state
warfare. However, the global proliferation of precision strike
technologies, like missiles and armed drones, makes such weapons
progressively available to non-state armed groups (NSAGs). We look at
Daesh in Syria and Iraq and at the Houthis in Yemen as two case studies
to analyse the consequences of this proliferation for non-state warfare.
</blockquote>
The Houthis, with help from Iran, have used precision strike systems
much more sophisticated than the ones I deal with here to cause a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis">major disruption
to world trade</a>, and to cause Western nations to expend vastly more
expensive systems in a futile attempt to stop them.<br /> <br /> The war
in Ukraine spawned
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/13/nx-s1-5147284/ukraine-drones-russia-war#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20more%20than%20200%20drone,Literally%20made%20in%20the%20kitchen.%E2%80%9D">hundreds
of new drone manufacturers</a>. This incredibly competitive market has
driven costs down to a point where groups with far less funding than the
drug cartels, and even individuals, can acquire precision strike
capabilities. In the US civilian use of drones is currently regulated by
the FAA. Drones are required to be registered and the areas where they
are permitted to fly are restricted. They are not regarded as weapons,
but what does the 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment say about drones if they are
regarded as weapons?<br /> <br /> Many of the same policy issues arise
when it comes to individuals defending themselves against drone attacks.
Electronic defenses such as jamming and GPS spoofing are illegal.
“Kinetic” defenses such as shotguns are legal in some cases, but
restricted by the risks to bystanders. Passive defenses such as “cope
cages” on vehicles would be illegal under safety regulations, and on
houses by planning regulations.<br /> <br /> Potential future
technological developments may greatly increase the difficulty of
defending against drone attacks by making it impossible to interfere
with their navigation. Current high-end cruise missiles such as
Ukraine’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-360_Neptune">R360-Neptune</a>
use inertial navigation, but because it drifts over time it requires
regular updates from GPS to maintain accuracy. This is similar to the
navigation systems in commercial aircraft. These systems are too large
and expensive for drones.<br /> <br />

<a href="https://scitechdaily.com/revolutionary-quantum-compass-could-soon-make-gps-free-navigation-a-reality/"><i>Revolutionary
Quantum Compass Could Soon Make GPS-Free Navigation a Reality</i></a>
dramatic increases in accuracy and reductions in cost and size for
inertial navigation are on the way:<br />
<blockquote>
Now, scientists are attempting to make a motion sensor so precise it
could minimize the nation’s reliance on global positioning satellites.
Until recently, such a sensor — a thousand times more sensitive than
today’s navigation-grade devices — would have filled a moving truck. But
advancements are dramatically shrinking the size and cost of this
technology.<br /> <br /> For the first time, researchers from Sandia
National Laboratories have used silicon photonic microchip components to
perform a quantum sensing technique called atom interferometry, an
ultra-precise way of measuring acceleration.<br /> …<br /> Besides size,
cost has been a major obstacle to deploying quantum navigation devices.
Every atom interferometer needs a laser system, and laser systems need
modulators.<br /> <br /> “Just one full-size single-sideband modulator,
a commercially available one, is more than $10,000,” Lee said.<br />
<br /> Miniaturizing bulky, expensive components into silicon photonic
chips helps drive down these costs.<br /> <br /> “We can make hundreds
of modulators on a single 8-inch wafer and even more on a 12-inch
wafer,” Kodigala said.

<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@HeyeBodo" title="@HeyeBodo@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="HeyeBodo">@HeyeBodo</span></a> stellt auf
fedi jeden Tag eine Frage zum Rollenspielsetting. Die darf man dann
beantworten. Da ich schon lange nichts mehr auf Deutsch hier auf dem
Blog geschrieben habe, werde ich die Gelegenheit wahrnehmen, das hier zu
tun. Allerdings habe ich vor, alles auf dieser Seite zu sammeln. Das
wird für die Leser, die dem Blog via einem Feed folgen, wahrscheinlich
etwas seltsam, denn heute gibt es nur Antworten auf die ersten zwei
Tage. Mir fällt leider auch keine andere Lösung ein, denn irgendwie will
ich auch nicht jeden Tag eine Seite schreiben.

<h2 id="welchen-geografischen-maßstab-hat-oder-strebst-du-für-dein-setting-an">
Welchen geografischen Maßstab hat oder strebst Du für Dein Setting an?
</h2>
<p>
Eine typische Karte, wie ich sie vorbereiten würde, ist von Ost nach
West ca. 30 Tagesreisen breit und von Nord nach Süd ca. 10–20
Tagesreisen hoch. Das sieht ästhetisch gut aus, bietet Platz für ein
paar Städte, Magiertürme, Monsterlager, Bauernhöfe, versteckte
Siedlungen, und so weiter. Ein paar Seen, ein oder zwei Gebirge mit
Pässen und Handelsrouten, viele Flüsse. Ich weigere mich, eine genau
Grösse anzugeben und behaupte einfach, ein Feld auf der Karte ist eine
Tagesreise. Wenn es keine Wege gibt, behaupte ich manchmal, dass eine
Tagesreise vielleicht nur 5–10km sind. Klar kann man als trainierter
Legionär auf einer römischen Strasse vielleicht ab und zu einen 50km
Marsch machen, oder 30km weit ziehen, aber in einem Tal, wo die Talwände
steil und von Bächen zerklüftet sind, wo der Talboden versumpft und wild
ist, wo das Wasser überall steht und fliesst, das Unterholz im Wald
dicht ist, weil die Wisente immer wieder Lichtungen reissen und es keine
richtige Forstwirtschaft gibt, kann ich mir nicht vorstellen, dass Leute
mit 20–30kg Ausrüstung pro Person mehr als ein paar Kilometer weit
kommen. Ich schliesse da von mir auf andere. 😅
</p>
<p>
Und damit kommen wir zum nächsten Thema, angenommen, ein Feld ist 10km
und dann ist eine Karte von 30×20 ungefähr so gross wie die ganze
Schweiz.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Die Ausdehnung der Schweiz beträgt von Norden nach Süden 220km und von
Osten nach Westen 348km. … Die Schweiz gliedert sich in drei
geografische Zonen: die Alpen mit einem Anteil von etwa 58% der
Gesamtfläche, das Mittelland mit rund 31% und der Jura mit 11%. 48
Schweizer Berge sind über 4000 m hoch. Obwohl Gebirge insgesamt 70% des
Staatsgebietes einnehmen, lebt in diesem Gebiet nur ein Viertel der
Bevölkerung. –
<a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/de/home/umwelt/geografie/geografie---fakten-und-zahlen.html">Geografie
– Fakten und Zahlen</a>, Eidgenössisches Departement für auswärtige
Angelegenheiten (EDA)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In diesem Gebiet gibt es 26 Kantone und entsprechend 26 grössere Orte
und ein Vielfaches an Burgen. An jedem Talausgang hat es eine Burg. In
grösseren Tälern hat es mehrere Burgen. Wenn wir jetzt von 30×20 Feldern
ausgehen, von denen 58% Gebirge sind, bleiben 348 Felder für die 26
Kantone oder im Durchschnitt 13 Felder pro Kanton.
</p>
<p>
Jetzt bin ich selber überrascht, wie überdimensioniert und leer meine
Karten sind. Da muss viel, viel mehr rein!
</p>
<h2 id="wovon-ist-dein-setting-inspiriert">
Wovon ist Dein Setting inspiriert?
</h2>
<p>
Meine Welt ist vor allem von der Umwelt inspiriert, in der ich lebe. Die
Berge, Täler und Hügel, in denen ich selber herumlaufe, inspirieren mich
für mein Spiel. Ich versuche natürlich mir vorzustellen, wie es früher
aussah, vor den Flussbegradigungen, vor der Trockenlegung der Sümpfe,
vor dem Strassenbau. Und somit ist klar, dass all diese Vorstellungen
aus der Vergangenheit irgendwie kollidieren und kollabieren müssen. Das
Resultat ist unrealistisch und weltfremd, und doch vertraut genug.
</p>
<p>
Die Monster und Menschen sind in vielem wohl von Conan und dem Herr der
Ringe bestimmt. Die Elfen sind eher keine Elben, sondern irgendwo
zwischen der Elfenwelt und Elric von Melniboné angesiedelt; die Orks
irgendwo zwischen Mordor und Skyrim; die Halblinge bei den Hobbits; die
Goblins in Moria; die Bäume in Fangorn; die Götter stammen aus der
nordischen Tradition (Odin, Thor, Loki), aber auch aus dem Zweistromland
(Ishtar, Marduk, Pazuzu), Griechenland (Hekate) oder aus Ägypten (Thot,
Ra, Set), aus Hyperborea (ebenfalls Set) und aus D&amp;D (Orcus).
</p>
<h2 id="wie-würdest-du-den-technologischen-entwicklungsstand-innerhalb-deines-settings-beschreiben">
Wie würdest Du den technologischen Entwicklungsstand innerhalb Deines
Settings beschreiben?
</h2>
<p>
In meiner Fantasy gibt es abgestürzte Raumschiffe, Laserpistolen,
Pistolen, Gewehre, Astralsegler, fliegende Schiffe, und so weiter, aber
ungleich verteilt. Aus Sicht der Spielenden ist ein Plattenpanzer mit
Schild die beste Rüstung. Hochwertige Rüstungen gibt es, doch dann sind
es Prunkstücke, die mehr kosten, aber nicht mehr nützen. Fantastische
Technologie gibt es im Rahmen von “Golem Rüstungen”, die dann einem
Plattenpanzer +2 und Schild +2 entsprechen und mit einer passenden
Energiequelle dann zu Plattenpanzer +4 und Schild +4 gesteigert werden
könnten. Ich kann mich allerdings nicht erinnern, dass dies jemand am
Tisch je geschafft hat. Die Laserpistolen sind sehr einfach gehalten:
Ein Schuss macht 1W6 Schaden wie eine Schusswaffe, Trefferwurf normal
durch Geschicklichkeit beeinflusst, Nachladen unnötig. Schaden liegt in
der Grössenordnung von einem magischen Geschoss. Eine Plasmakanone
funktioniert wie ein Bitzschlag und und macht 5W6 Schaden entlang einer
Linie, ein Granatwerfer wie ein Feuerball und macht 5W6 Schaden im
Zielgebiet, Rettungswurf gegen Drachenodem für halben Schaden. Das
könnten genau so gut Zauberstäbe mit Ladungen sein. So lässt sich alles
entweder mit Technik oder Magie erklären und es macht keinen grossen
Unterschied, da es die Rolle eines Technikers für die Spielenden nicht
als Klasse gibt. In dem Sinne ist alle Technik verloren gegangene und
wiederentdeckte Technik, die nicht wirklich beherrscht ist, die wie
Magie verwendet wird.
</p>
<p>
Auch die Zeitgeschichte ist mir egal. Bei aller Technologie von Waffen,
Rüstungen, Schiffstypen, Sprengkörpern und so weiter wird frisch und
fröhlich durcheinander gemischt. Die technologischen Unterschiede von
Hopliten und Conquistadores, zwischen Kataphrakten und Rittern, zwischen
Skythen, Mongolen und Hunnen, zwischen Vikingern und Reisläufern,
Landsknechten und Legionären interessiert mich nicht richtig.
</p>
<p>
Gespielt wird in einer Fantasiewelt, in der man keinen Sprengstoff und
kein Pulver kaufen kann. Die Schiffe sind aus Holz und von Segelkraft
betrieben. Kohleindustrie und Stahlindustrie gibt es nicht, also gibt es
keine Schiesswaffen und kein Dampfmaschinen, also auch keine Eisenbahn,
keinen Zeppelin, kein Flugzeug. Es gibt keinen Wilden Westen, kein
kolonialen Weltreiche, kein Zeitalter der Entdeckungen. In diesem Sinne
ist auch der Kapitalismus als “Finanztechnologie” nicht entdeckt.

Are Coming for Democracy—but It’s Not All Bad</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, updated: 2024-11-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In 2025, AI is poised to
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-global-elections/">change
every aspect of democratic politics</a>—but it won’t necessarily be for
the worse.
</p>
<p>
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has used AI to translate his
speeches for his multilingual electorate in real time, demonstrating how
AI can help diverse democracies to be more inclusive. AI avatars were
used by presidential candidates in South Korea in electioneering,
enabling them to provide answers to thousands of voters’ questions
simultaneously. We are also starting to see
<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/generative-ai-political-advertising">AI
tools</a> aid fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts. AI techniques
are starting to augment more traditional polling methods, helping
campaigns get cheaper and faster data. And congressional candidates have
started using AI robocallers to engage voters on issues. In 2025, these
trends will continue. AI doesn’t need to be superior to human experts to
augment the labor of an overworked canvasser, or to write ad copy
similar to that of a junior campaign staffer or volunteer. Politics is
competitive, and any technology that can bestow an advantage, or even
just garner attention, will be used…

<p>Last week, I wrote about a study conducted by TRG Datacenters that
assessed the digital quality of life across U.S. cities by measuring
metrics such as download speed, number of internet service providers,
and customer ratings. I had some follow-up questions, so I requested
access to the underlying data from the folks at TRG. I …</p>

is the easy editor that writers using WordPress always deserved. I
updated the <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">docs</a> this morning
to include very basic getting started stuff, and it now includes a link
to a form where you can apply to be a tester. At this time it’s limited
to people who know how to write a bug report, how to find and read the
JavaScript console in a web browser, and take a screen shot that shows
clearly what went wrong. This the hardest part of getting a product fit
for general use, and I’m too old to try to wrangle workable bug reports
from well-intentioned users who basically aren’t scientists. This time
I’m determined to do this the right way without excess wear and tear on
me. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<p>I’m using the term “RSS-based podcasts” in place of “podcasts” to
make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other
“podcasts,” are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube
et al to just connect their “podcasts” to RSS and everyone’s happy. Like
“organic cheeseburgers.” :-)</p>

way to help <i>RSS-based podcasts</i> is to promote individual episodes
from the past. Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good
stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history
for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy
people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was
when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to
lift the hood even if I don’t understand what I’m looking at.</p>

<p>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads.
Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously
this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is
pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite
what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too,
since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that
deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you
do it, I wouldn’t announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your
account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some
problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</p>

<p>Welcome to the last month of
<a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in the year 2024.
Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time,
there’s less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind
us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I
feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my
todo list, but I’m making progress. As someone once said many times:
Still diggin!</p>
