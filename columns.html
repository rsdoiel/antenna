<h2 id="ubuntu-disables-spectremeltdown-protections">Ubuntu Disables
Spectre/Meltdown Protections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, updated: 2025-07-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A whole class of speculative execution attacks against CPUs
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/01/spectre_and_mel_1.html">were
published</a> in 2018. They seemed pretty catastrophic at the time. But
the fixes were as well. Speculative execution was a way to speed up
CPUs, and removing those enhancements resulted in significant
performance drops.
</p>
<p>
Now, people are rethinking the trade-off. Ubuntu
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/intel-compute-runtime/+bug/2110131">has
disabled</a> some protections, resulting in 20% performance boost.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
After discussion between Intel and Canonical‚Äôs security teams, we are in
agreement that Spectre no longer needs to be mitigated for the GPU at
the Compute Runtime level. At this point, Spectre has been mitigated in
the kernel, and a clear warning from the Compute Runtime build serves as
a notification for those running modified kernels without those patches.
For these reasons, we feel that Spectre mitigations in Compute Runtime
no longer offer enough security impact to justify the current
performance tradeoff‚Ä¶

<h1 id="2025-06-16-ban-autonomous-systems">
2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems
</h1>
<p>
More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers,
since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole
range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter
based on IP numbers won‚Äôt catch them. But if we can determine their
autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number
range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.
</p>
<p>
Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other
fediverse instances, I don‚Äôt want to block them forever. I want to block
them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter
blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have
ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how
fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I want code that bridges this gap.

Where to start
</h2>
<p>
<a href="github.com/WKnak/fail2ban-bloc">fail2ban-bloc</a> tries to
guess (!) IP ranges and bans those using fail2ban. I need to investigate
more.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm still fascinated by
<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-05-30-asncounter/">asncounter</a>.
It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For
now, it generates an interesting Top 10 list. What‚Äôs interesting about
it is that it doesn‚Äôt require me to query an external service and leak
IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I used to have the following fish function, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn
    for ip in $argv
        dig +short (string split '.' $ip|tac -|string join '.').origin.asn.cymru.com. TXT
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
What I don‚Äôt want to do is write another tool like
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">network-lookup-lean</a> which uses
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> for the same purposes, caches results,
and so on. I want to get rid of this live lookup.

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">
Ban all the networks managed by an ASN
</h2>
<p>
I‚Äôm going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists,
<code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>. I use these two for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.
</p>
<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little
fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Let‚Äôs try it with the ASN 45899!
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>
<p>
For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments
on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are
at it again</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got
a single ‚Äúit‚Äôs already added‚Äù response. Before adding the same numbers
to my shell script, therefore:
</p>
<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>
<p>
That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script.
Once this is done:
</p>
<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr 
</code></pre>
<p>
I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to
figure out a way to unban the whole list!
</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-fail2ban">
Integration with <code>fail2ban</code>
</h2>
<p>
Let‚Äôs start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs
a filter!
</p>
<p>
In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain
all my jails) I added:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that this jail doesn‚Äôt define log paths. I hope that works as
intended.
</p>
<p>
I created a matching filter with no definition in
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it all, and check:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload
OK
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:  6
`- Jail list:   alex-apache, alex-bots, butlerian-jihad, ngircd, recidive, sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
Nice! So now I have a new jail.
</p>
<h2 id="undo-the-banlist">

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sed 's/ipset add/ipset del/' | sh
</code></pre>
<p>
I also manually edited my <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> file to
remove the lines I added above. Let‚Äôs have fail2ban handle this!
</p>
<h2 id="switch-from-ipset-to-fail2ban-client">

        echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip $cidr
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | less
</code></pre>
<p>
Run it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
3640
</code></pre>
<p>
If you messed up, clear the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload --unban butlerian-jihad
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned
</code></pre>
<p>
Count the entries in the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq length
3640
</code></pre>

</p>
<p>
The jail which we called <code>butlerian-jihad</code> bans the IP
networks for a day.
</p>
<h2 id="what-s-left-to-do">

<p>
I should check whether this actually works! Let‚Äôs see whether the ban
gets lifted after 24h. That‚Äôs the main point of this exercise!
</p>
<p>
<code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data.
This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as
<code>asncounter</code>. I guess that would be
<a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>. See below!
</p>
<p>
I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes
worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies
all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.

<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a
bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges
managed by one or more autonomous systems.
</p>
<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
85.208.96.0/24

85.208.99.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of
<code>asncounter</code> has downloaded. That is to say,
<code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files. I‚Äôm
assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.
</p>
<p>
Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as
follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Unbanning works the same way:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP
numbers or ranges added or removed.
</p>
<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">
Identifying suspicious ASN
</h2>
<p>
What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN
should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters
the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to
ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the
IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we
don‚Äôt care about and just print the appropriate lines:
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062    31.93   24940   HETZNER-AS, DE
1642    17.12   16276   OVH, FR
</code></pre>
<p>
So do I dare ban those numbers?? I‚Äôm not sure! I should figure out a way
to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You
pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it
filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log
lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social | bin/asn-access-log 24940
</code></pre>
<p>
I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent,
FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example),
and on and on. Ugh. It‚Äôs not easy to know what to do!
</p>
<p>
I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for
shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest.
The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount
of resources spent OK. Do I? Let‚Äôs look at the latest numbers.
</p>
<p>
This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it
hard for me to block these autonomous systems.

<p>
This drops the output (the number of new bans) because otherwise the
cron job mails that number to me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two
hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code>
(and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).
</p>
<p>
The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi
server doesn‚Äôt trigger the ban hammer.
</p>
<p>
The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don‚Äôt ban the
server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I
also had to add my home IP numbers!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds
the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server
log file and prints a report.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected
autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.
</p>
<p>
These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a
config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file
is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>
<p>
The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens
as no logfile is checked. My
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just
this:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get
banned for generating more than 500 hits in 2h. If they are banned, they
are banned for 1h. If they are banned for activity in the last hour
leading up to the ban (more than 500 hits in 1h), the script will find
the same log entries and ban them ‚Äúagain‚Äù. This results in no changes in
the jail, since all the networks are already in the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same
file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>
<p>
The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is
banned for a week. I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set
to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an
autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It
sends 400 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than
a feed reader should need, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
after the first hour, nothing happens, as 400 is less than the 500
needed to trigger the system
</li>
<li>
after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the
last two hours is 800
</li>
<li>
after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because
it only made 400 requests in the second hour
</li>
<li>
after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again
</li>
<li>
after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time
</li>
<li>
after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time
</li>
<li>
after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time
</li>
<li>
after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the
<code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the
ASN are banned for a week
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half
this time.
</p>
<p>
Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats
every 7¬Ω weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h
or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs see how this goes for a while.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and
<code>banlist6</code> sets I created for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.

<p>
Back when I first encountered the distributed AI bot attacks, I wrote
<a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a> and
began working on <code>ban-cidr</code>. In later posts, I just automated
the work of getting from an IP number to a network range and adding that
to the script. Now that I hopefully have an automatic solution where I
only need to fine-tune the time-windows and the limits, it‚Äôs time to
expire all those bans. There are currently over 40,000 of these banned
networks.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | wc -l
46920
ipset list banlist6 | tail -n +9 | wc -l
9
</code></pre>
<p>
So slowly, over time, I‚Äôm planning to remove these.
</p>
<pre><code>for ip in (ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | head -n 1000); ipset del banlist $ip; end
netfilter-persistent save

<p>
Ugh. They need to go.
</p>
<p>
First, create the two lists. At this level we need two different lists
for IPv4 and IPv6.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
Then define a new version of <code>asn-ban</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    set --local data (asn-networks --json $argv)
    for asn in $argv
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v4[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist $ip
        end
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v6[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist6 $ip
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses the <code>‚Äìjson</code> option for
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> so that we only need to
call it once and yet we get two lists: one for <code>banlist</code> and
one for <code>banlist6</code>.
</p>
<p>
To ban the offending ASN:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 55836|sh
</code></pre>
<p>
Before I do that, however, I want to finish clearing the existing lists.
</p>
<p>
The reason I call this petty banning is because I‚Äôm starting to ban
autonomous systems even though their bots are ‚Äúwell behaved‚Äù in as much
as they don‚Äôt exceed the thresholds I defined. And yet they seem to be
part of that great parade to honour the CO‚ÇÇ god, the computation of
useless shit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-06-20</strong>. I‚Äôm thinking about alternatives but I think
that‚Äôs not worth it. For example: Perhaps it‚Äôs important to look at
relative distribution?
</p>
<pre><code>site-log transjovian | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null
count   percent ASN AS
7   36.84   132203  TENCENT-NET-AP-CN Tencent Building, Kejizhongyi Avenue, CN
3   15.79   216071  VDSINA, AE
3   15.79   396982  GOOGLE-CLOUD-PLATFORM, US
total: 19
</code></pre>
<p>
At first I thought, more than a third of all requests for Tencent? I
must block them. But then I saw that it was just 7 requests in 2h. Not
worth it.
</p>
<p>
Here I saw that there were more requests, and an 80% share!
</p>
<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null
count   percent ASN AS
172 81.52   45102   ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN

10  4.74    132203  TENCENT-NET-AP-CN Tencent Building, Kejizhongyi Avenue, CN
total: 211
</code></pre>
<p>
But when you look at it, Alibaba is just fetching
<code>robots.txt</code> all the time. I don‚Äôt know who runs this bot.
It‚Äôs clearly a waste of CO‚ÇÇ. And yet‚Ä¶ not worth it.
</p>
<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | asn-access-log 45102 | log-request | rank-lines
    172 /robots.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
So, I don‚Äôt know. And if I don‚Äôt care about the relative share of
requests, then I also don‚Äôt have to count them per site.
</p>
<p>
I already wrote a little thing to give me a regular expression for every
site I host! But now I‚Äôm not going to use it. I leave it here for you,
dear reader. üòÑ
</p>
<pre><code>awk '/^MDomain/ {split($0, sites)
  result = sites[2]
  for (i = 3; i &lt;= length(sites); i++)
    result = result &quot;|&quot; sites[i]
  print result
}' /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*.conf
</code></pre>
<p>
On the positive side, the current system seems to be working:
</p>
<pre><code>awk '/butlerian-jihad/ { print $7, $8 }' /var/log/fail2ban.log | rank-lines
     10 Ban 45.254.32.0/22

<blockquote>
Investor Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK Invest predicts robotaxis could account for
90% of Tesla‚Äôs profits by 2029. If they are right, this weekend‚Äôs launch
was existential.
</blockquote>
Tesla‚Äôs net income from the trailing 12 months is
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/financials/">around
$6.1B</a> and falling. Assuming, optimistically, that they can continue
to sell cars at the current rate, Cathie Woods is assuming that robotaxi
<i>profits</i> would be around $60B. Tesla‚Äôs net margin is around 6%, so
this implies revenue of almost $1T in 2029. Tesla charges $4.20/ride
(ha! ha!), so this implies that they are delivering 231B rides/year, or
around 23,000 times the rate of the entire robotaxi industry currently.
Woods is projecting that in four year‚Äôs time Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi business
will have almost as much revenue as Amazon ($638B), Microsoft ($245B)
and Nvidia ($130B) <i>combined</i>.<br /> <br /> Liam Denning‚Äôs analysis
in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-06-27/tesla-s-800-billion-robotaxi-dream-is-finally-facing-reality"><i>Tesla‚Äôs
$800 Billion Robotaxi Dream Is Finally Facing Reality</i></a> is only
somewhat less optimistic:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúOn generous assumptions, Tesla‚Äôs core EV business, generating 75% of
gross profit but with falling sales, might be worth roughly $50 per
share, only 15% of the current price. Much of the remainder relates to
expectations around self driving. RBC Capital, for example, ascribes 59%
of its price target, or $181 per share, to robotaxis and a further $53
to monetizing Full Self Driving technology. Combined, that is a cool
$815 billion based on double-digit multiples ascribed to modeled revenue
‚Äî not earnings ‚Äî 10 to 15 years from now because, after all, it relates
to businesses that barely make money today.‚Äù
</blockquote>
This all seems a tad optimistic, given the current state of Tesla‚Äôs and
the competition‚Äôs robotaxi offerings. Brad Templeton says
‚Äú<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/06/22/tesla-misses-robotaxi-launch-date-goes-with-safety-drivers/">pay
no attention to the person in the passenger seat</a>‚Äù:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla‚Äôs much-anticipated June 22 ‚Äúno one in the vehicle‚Äù ‚Äúunsupervised‚Äù
Robotaxi launch in Austin is not ready. Instead, Tesla is operating a
limited service with Tesla employees on board the vehicle to maintain
safety.<br /> ‚Ä¶<br /> Having an employee who can intervene on board,
commonly called a safety driver, is the approach that every robocar
company has used for testing, including testing of passenger operations.
Most companies spend many years (Waymo spent a decade) testing with
safety drivers, and once they are ready to take passengers, there are
typically some number of years testing in that mode, though the path to
removing the safety driver depends primarily on evaluation of the safety
case for the vehicle, and less on the presence of passengers.<br />
<br /> In addition to Musk‚Äôs statements about the vehicle being
unsupervised, with nobody inside, in general the removal of the safety
driver is the biggest milestone in development of a true robotaxi, not
an incremental step that can be ignored. As such, Tesla has yet to meet
its goals.<br />
</blockquote>
Seven-and-a-half years after Musk‚Äôs deadline for ‚Äúcomplete autonomy‚Äù the
best Tesla can do is a small robotaxi service for invited guests in a
geofenced area of Austin with a safety driver in daylight. Waymo has
<a href="tesla_robotaxi_austin">100 robotaxis in service in Austin</a>.
Three months ago
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/03/07/robotaxis-mostly-waymo-are-giving-13-million-ridesmonth--why/">Brad
Templeton reported that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet, announced recently that they
are now providing 200,000 self-driving taxi rides every week with no
safety driver in the car, only passengers.<br /> ‚Ä¶<br /> In China,
though, several companies are giving rides with no safety driver. The
dominant player is Baidu Apollo, which reports they did 1.1 million
rides last quarter, which is 84,000 per week, and they now are all
no-safety-driver. Pony.AI claims 26,000 per week, but it is not clear if
all are with no safety driver. AutoX does not report numbers, but says
it has 1,000 cars in operation. WeRide also does not report numbers.
</blockquote>
It turns out that the safety driver is necessary. Craig Trudell and Kara
Carlson‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/tesla-robotaxi-videos-show-speeding-driving-into-wrong-lane"><i>Tesla
Robotaxi Incidents Draw Scrutiny From US Safety Agency</i></a> reports
on the first day of the robotaxi revolution:<br />
<blockquote>
US auto safety regulators are looking into incidents where Tesla Inc.‚Äôs
self-driving robotaxis appeared to violate traffic laws during the
company‚Äôs first day offering paid rides in Austin.<br /> ‚Ä¶<br /> In one
video taken by investor Rob Maurer, who used to host a Tesla podcast, a
Model Y he‚Äôs riding in enters an Austin intersection in a left-turn-only
lane. The Tesla hesitates to make the turn, swerves right and proceeds
into an unoccupied lane meant for traffic moving in the opposite
direction.<br /> <br /> A honking horn can be heard as the Tesla
re-enters the correct lane over a double-yellow line, which drivers
aren‚Äôt supposed to cross.<br /> <br /> In two other posts on X, initial
riders in driverless Model Ys shared footage of Teslas speeding. A
vehicle carrying Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor, reached 35 miles per
hour shortly after passing a 30 miles per hour speed limit sign, a video
he posted shows.
</blockquote>
Tesla‚Äôs level of incompetence is not a surprise. Tesla added
‚Äú(Supervised)‚Äù to FSD in the US. They aren‚Äôt allowed to call the
technology
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">‚ÄúFull

<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">‚ÄúIntelligent
Assisted Driving‚Äù in China</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But immediately after that rollout, Tesla drivers started
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/27/tesla-drivers-are-racking-up-fines-using-fsd-in-china/">racking
up fines</a> for violating the law. Many roads in China are watched by
CCTV cameras, and fines are automatically handed out to drivers to break
the law.<br /> <br /> It‚Äôs clear that the system still needs more
knowledge about Chinese roads in general, because it kept mistaking bike
lanes for right turn lanes, etc. One driver racked up 7 tickets within
the span of a single drive after driving through bike lanes and crossing
over solid lines. If a driver gets enough points on their license, they
could even have their license suspended.
</blockquote>
Why did Tesla roll out their $8K ‚ÄúIntelligent Assisted Driving‚Äù in
China? It might have something to do with
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>

<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/10/byds-most-affordable-evs-smart-driving-upgrade-free/">smart

</blockquote>
There are already many competing robotaxi services in China.
<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/china-robotaxis-baidu-tesla-driverless-vehicles-4670506">For
example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Baidu is already operating robotaxi services in multiple cities in
China. It provided close to 900,000 rides in the second quarter of the
year, up 26 per cent year-on-year, according to its latest earnings
call. More than 7 million robotaxi rides in total had been operated as
of late July.
</blockquote>
<p>That was a year ago. It isn‚Äôt just Waymo that is in a whole different
robotaxi league than Tesla. And lets not talk about the fact that BYD,
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/04/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-6.html">Xiaomi</a>
and others outsell Tesla in China because their products are better and

<h2 id="my-new-linkblog-feed">My new linkblog feed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is the address of my linkblog feed:
<a href="https://dave.linkblog.org/">dave.linkblog.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
I think it‚Äôs kind of interesting to have the top page of a site be a
feed. I don‚Äôt hide the XML-ness of it. I never supported the
obfuscation, it‚Äôs confusing, makes people not trust RSS, imho.
</p>
<p>
I think the feed is pretty stable now, so if you want to subscribe, go
ahead. I haven‚Äôt redirected from the old feed yet, probably should do
that soon, since it more or less has stopped updating.
</p>
<p>
This is all managed in <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>
and therefore is part of the WordPress ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
I felt it was time to do a definitive linkblog, since as far as I could
tell no one has tried to explain what it is: basically, a feed where the
&lt;link&gt; element of each &lt;item&gt; points to some other site.
That‚Äôs the basic difference.
</p>
<p>
Also a linkblog feed should specify the channel-level &lt;image&gt;
element, which is used as the avatar for the feed when it appears in a
twitter-like timeline.
</p>
<p>
I think the only other product that is open to feeds being part of the
open social web is
<a href="https://about.flipboard.com/press/announcing-surf-the-first-browser-for-the-open-social-web/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Surf</a>
from Mike McCue‚Äôs company, Flipboard. I asked ChatGPT to
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6863cadb-46ec-8012-9ec8-c5e67595f954">brief
me</a> on how it works with feeds, and saw that we‚Äôre more or less doing
the same thing, except I‚Äôm not trying to work with the output from
Twitter, Bluesky, etc. Even when they have outbound RSS feeds they
aren‚Äôt good enough to be part of the social web defined by feeds.
</p>
<p>
I only want really good feeds. It‚Äôs time to stop being so careless about
what we transmit to the world. If we want an open web we‚Äôre all going to
have to be good gardeners. It‚Äôs like a food system where all the food is
grown by family farmers and I‚Äôm running a restaurant, and only want the
good stuff, and we want it to look good too! :-)
</p>
<p>
PS: Another thing, the feed items must have working
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt">guids</a>.
All software that runs on feeds should be able to depend on this.
</p>
<p>
PPS: Linkblogs aren‚Äôt the only kinds of feeds that will be used in this
RSS-based feediverse. Scripting News will work with it. You would be
able to read this post in this new medium (not yet delivered, btw).

<h2 id="do-a-backup-now">Do a backup now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Advice from a longtime developer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you think ‚ÄúI should do a backup,‚Äù do it. Now, don‚Äôt wait.
</li>
<li>
Make it really easy to do a backup. Choose a menu item that‚Äôs always
available when you‚Äôre working.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The reason is karma. God hears all your thoughts. When that thought pops
into your head and you don‚Äôt do a backup, or don‚Äôt do it soon enough, He
crashes your data, and you think ‚ÄúI should have done a backup when I
thought of doing it.‚Äù Even this doesn‚Äôt please Him. At that moment it‚Äôs
even more urgent that you do a backup.
</p>
<p>
My hippie uncle taught me this. God has a terrible sense of humor, and
thinks it‚Äôs really funny when you have a good thought and ignore it.
When something didn‚Äôt work he would say that‚Äôs God goofing on me.
</p>
<p>
In this case, we‚Äôre talking about is the Programmer God. There are all
kinds of gods, a
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html">baseball
god</a>, a basketball god, and very specifically a Knicks god. That god
has the absolutely worst sense of humor of them all and by worst I mean
best.

of the Bluesky API. They make each developer do the support for Open
Graph metadata, when it would be much more efficient for them to support
it on their end. I would be happy to give them the code. It‚Äôs not that
complicated. But translating the OG format, which for crying out loud is
a huge standard, into their arcane format which is only supported by
Bluesky, is going in the wrong direction, and frankly is ridiculously
arrogant. Show a little humility. Facebook is huge, and the format isn‚Äôt
just used by Facebook, everyone uses it.</p>

American democracy runs on trust, and that trust is cracking.
</p>
<p>
Nearly half of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, question
whether elections are
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651185/partisan-split-election-integrity-gets-even-wider.aspx">conducted
fairly</a>. Some voters accept election results only
<a href="https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/rule-law-united-states">when
their side wins</a>. The problem isn‚Äôt just political polarization‚Äîit‚Äôs
a creeping
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/10/29/elections-in-america-concerns-over-security-divisions-over-expanding-access-to-voting/">erosion
of trust</a> in the machinery of democracy itself.
</p>
<p>
Commentators blame ideological tribalism,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/business/media/election-disinformation-2024.html">misinformation
campaigns</a> and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/opinion/social-media-polarization-democracy.html">partisan
echo chambers</a> for this crisis of trust. But these explanations miss
a critical piece of the puzzle: a growing unease with the digital
infrastructure that now underpins nearly every aspect of how Americans

Wittes</a>: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs remarkable how many non-New Yorkers seem to care who
the mayor of New York City is.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
They do and they‚Äôre right to, the same way we were concerned how the
Governor of California and Mayor of Los Angeles would react to the
invasion of the Marines and hijacking of the National Guard.
</p>
<p>
Right now the NYC mayor is a hostage of the US govt. Not in a position
to help. An inexperienced first term NY mayor, have we seen that before?
How does the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io7hOfnMldY">NYPD
respond</a> to that?
</p>
<p>
Then there was the
<a href="https://www.newyorkalmanack.com/2019/01/lindsays-snowstorm-a-rising-star-falls-to-earth-in-queens/">snowstorm</a>
that derailed John V Lindsay, a heroic and transformative mayor. NY is a
tough place to govern even when the US government isn‚Äôt aiming to regime
change the place.

</p>
<p>
But think about the context the next mayor will govern in.
</p>
<p>
The thing about NY that people might not understand is that the politics
are dirty and fucked up. Dems tend to elect handsome young heros who
when they have to deal with NYPD and the sanitation workers, the
teachers union, and the federal government, also the ancient
infrastructure, melt.

Now that we know the outcome of the 2024 election, not just in numbers
but in what it‚Äôs doing to our beloved country and the rest of the world,
it‚Äôs interesting to revisit the campaign that journalism ran last year
to force President Biden to step aside. That‚Äôs one of the functions of
Facebook, they play back your posts from years ago, so you can see how
things changed, or didn‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, last year on this day I
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l">wrote
this</a> on Facebook: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt journalists cover the Biden base? Do
they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think
they are the base? I thought they weren‚Äôt supposed to care who the
nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should
withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this through?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B06VVR3DX6/about?ccs_id=add77910-b4f6-4323-80d0-494d4da9650f">Nick

‚ÄúUntil I read this, the madness of the Times calling on Biden, but not
Trump, to withdraw didn‚Äôt dawn on me.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
I had followed his metamorphosis over years from a journalist to a
worker who goes where there are fires or other natural disasters, for
the government, to support the effort to save people‚Äôs homes and lives.
I watched him via Facebook, in awe, as he went around the country,
<s>not being paid very much I imagine, but</s> doing good.
</p>
<p>
I learned something important when my father was in the hospital many
years ago, in a coma, after losing a lot of blood and being unconscious
for hours before he was found. He was in a ward in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_Hospital_Medical_Center">Flushing
Hospital</a>, along with a lot of other comatose people. All were
unconscious, unable to feed themselves. Hard to know if they had any
awareness. From an outside perspective they, and my father included,
were lost. Some had been there for years, probably weren‚Äôt ever going to
come out of it. We were lucky, my father survived, after a month, and
had seven more years to live.
</p>
<p>
I visited him every day, and got to know the flow of the hospital.
Workers came in and out of the room to attend to these comatose people.
Imagine the kind of support they needed just to keep their bodies
functioning and not wasting away for lack of movement. I thought these
people must have the worst jobs imaginable, imagining myself in their
shoes.
</p>
<p>
I got to know them, asked about what else they do, how they got here,
where they live, etc. Somehow I got up the courage to ask one of them if
they liked their job, imagining I‚Äôd get a New Yorker comment like ‚ÄúYou
know, it‚Äôs a living.‚Äù But what I heard was a complete surprise. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
the best job in the world,‚Äù he said, because I can see so clearly how my
work helps real people. He was looking right at me. It hit me, this man
is doing what I can‚Äôt do, what my father‚Äôs parents, who were long gone,
couldn‚Äôt do. <i>Caring.</i> Caring for my dad. Then I got it.
</p>
<p>
Back to Nick, who was and still is, and probably always will be doing
things to help other people, no matter what he does.
</p>
<p>
He was canned in one of the DOGE purges this spring.
</p>
<p>
Now you tell me whether the ‚ÄúTrump base‚Äù deserved a chance you wouldn‚Äôt
let us have with Biden? Why journalism felt entitled to make this
decision for all of us? When are you going to get the idea that you‚Äôre
supposed to help us. Do the right thing. I get so angry at journalism
for getting in the way. Once informed of the facts, it was their job to
get out of the way and let us, the voters, make the decision.
</p>
