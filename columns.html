<p>A Brian Lehrer
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/segregation-at-nycs-specialized-high-schools/">segment</a>
on specialized
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_high_schools_in_New_York_City">high
schools</a> in NYC. I went to one of them, signed up for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test">the
test</a> mostly to get out of school for a day, and got in. Back in
those days (the early 70s) no one studied for the test as far as I know.
It has become very competitive and there’s an issue of the racial makeup
of the student body. As always Lehrer does a great podcast.</p>

is not just about Microsoft, but pretty much every software company will

<h2 id="all-the-concerns-that-make-you-a-boring-developer">All the
concerns that make you a boring developer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-06, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I was thinking this morning about how once you understand that your
technology choices have security, performance, and accessibility
considerations you become a much more boring developer. Acknowledging
those obligations can sort of strips the fun out of programming, but
we’re better for it.
</p>
<p>
I decided to pull on that thread a little more and come up with a list
of all the concerns you might have as an engineer/developer that
ultimately compound to make you a boring, wet blanket of a person to be
in meetings with.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Security</strong> - Make sure you’re not opening the door for
hackers.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Privacy</strong> - Don’t leak personal information. Or don’t
collect it in the first place.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Performance</strong> - Can the software work on low-end devices?
Can you deliver the large bundle over bad internet? Those are your
problems.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Inclusion/Accessibility</strong> - Are you allowing people the
dignity to use your product? No? Oof. You should probably do that.
Ideally because you are an ethical person, but also because it’s a legal
liability.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Scalability</strong> - If a thousand people show up in the next
minute, does your software still work? You have 100 users now, but how
does it work for 1000? 1 million? 1 billion?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintenance</strong> - Ship a new feature? Great. Expect to
spend at least 40% of cost/time to maintain a feature over its lifetime.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Testability</strong> - Did you write the code in a way that’s
easy to test to make sure bugs don’t show up in production?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deliverability/Distribution</strong> - How do people get or use
your software?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Adoption/Onboarding</strong> - How do customers or partners use
your software? How do they get familiar?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Documentation</strong> - Email and DMs is probably not the most
efficient form on knowledge transfer.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ecological</strong> - Does your app burn through GPUs in Iowa?
What are you doing about that?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Financial/Cost</strong> - Servers and GPUs cost money, did you
build this in such a way that it costs as little as possible to run?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Monetizability</strong> - Good idea but does it make money or
cost money?
</li>
<li>
<strong>User feedback</strong> - What are customers or partners saying
about this? Does that impact how or what you write?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stakeholder feedback</strong> - Like user feedback but everyone
freaks out like their job depends on solving the problem that day
regardless if its a good idea or bad idea.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Organizational</strong> - How to get your co-workers onboard
with the plan plays an outsized part in software engineering. Welcome to
the world of office politics!
</li>
<li>
<strong>Staffability</strong> - There’s not a lot of Haskell developers
out there. Or the inverse, people over-optimize on technologies that are
“easy to hire for” and now you have a billion lines of Java in your
application.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Support matrixes</strong> - For websites, of course we support
major browsers and the latest 2 versions? Do we need to go back further?
Weirdo browsers? Should we make native apps? Which ones? What
devices/CPU architectures do we support there? Niche Linux distros? The
list goes on.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Political</strong> - Some say “all tech is political”, and I
tend to agree, but ask yourself: Did you put a politics inside the code?
You did, didn’t you?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Geopolitical</strong> - Rare, but happens. See:
<a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series">Facebook
Myanmar genocide</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Localization/Internationalization</strong> - Uh-oh, your UI
doesn’t work in German or Arabic. Also all your images and icons are
offensive to a particular country’s monarch. Are you ready to cross the
borders? Get ready for VAT tax tables, ughck.
</li>
<li>
<strong>SEO/Crawlability</strong> - Cool website you made, can robots
get to it and index it? Now LLMs are coming and slurping up your content
and traffic. Uh-oh!
</li>
<li>
<strong>Adjacent competitors</strong> - What your competitors are doing
will always play a role in engineering. Looking better than them is
good, being cheaper is good too, but one rule is the most important:
never be slower. See:
<a href="https://infrequently.org/2020/06/platform-adjacency-theory/">Platform
adjacency theory</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Throughput/Velocity</strong> - How fast can you and (more
importantly) your team ship an idea from conception to production. What
about turnaround times on bug reports?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you ever ask a developer if an idea is possible and their brain lags
out with a little loading spinner over their head, it might be this
enormous pile of concerns they’re mulling over. That can be an issue,
but I’d be more concerned about the developer that instantly says “Yes”
to everything. And if you’re tired of developers saying “No” all the
time,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers/dp/0063018292">ask
your developer</a> about ways to put them in situations where they can
say “Yes”.

2025-08-06 Another month has passed in Gaza
</h1>
<p>
Everywhere I look, the news is telling me that atrocious crimes are
being committed by Israel.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Israel’s war in Gaza combines a staggeringly high death rate, shocking
violence toward children, unparalleled physical destruction, and now a
world-historical famine. The world has, by objective measure, never seen
anything like this. … What we have watched, what we are continuing to
watch, is the obliteration of a society of two million people. Every
facet of modern civilization, as well as the most elementary things
needed for even a state of basic subsistence for a human community, has
been deliberately and almost completely destroyed by the Israeli
military in Gaza. And now we are watching the gradual but accelerating
mass die-off of the people who once lived there, through a combination
of starvation, disease, and murder. –
<a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/08/israel-gaza-worst-crimes-ever/">Israel’s
Gaza War Is One of History’s Worst Crimes Ever</a>, by Branko Marcetic,
for Jacobin
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The world is watching.
</p>
<p>
I remember speaking with a German accent on the streets of Portugal in
the eighties and another kid immediately reacted with “Heil Hitler!” I
was being reminded of what my Austrian ancestors had been part of. Even
if they had not committed the crimes themselves. A responsibility falls
not on only on those who commit the crime but on those who were there,
who did not stop it, and a responsibility falls on their children and
their grandchildren.
</p>
<p>
And remember, the genocide can still be stopped. There is a way to abort
this all. To just stop perpetuating it. There is a way to walk back.
Maybe not all the way back, but back to peace. To a just peace, even. To
pay the reparations now. To rebuild now. To help.
</p>
<p>
And to every company making money in Israel, cooperating with Israel,
benefiting from the genocide, closing their eyes and swallowing the
bitter pill of genocide in order to make some sweet, sweet silver and
gold, remember that aiding and abetting the dictators and war mongers of
the past is partaking in their crimes. These companies are taking part
in the genocide even if they don’t kill a single individual.

I recorded this morning, prime time, while getting things done, and
having ChatGPT getting in the way. It needs to become more invisible,
there’s no suspension of disbelief when you’re working with it. I think
we can do much better at finding a robot that can really augment human
intelligence. This is awful stuff. We have to work on these
dynamics.</p>

<p>Whenever you have to get something done with a company, get ready for
lots of phone tag, waiting on hold, talking to bots, getting screened,
trying to convince a computer that you have legitimate business, and no,
what you’re looking for isn’t on their website (believe me I looked).
The stupid thing about it is that ChatGPT is becoming more like those
things every day. Companies have built awful systems for getting
anything done that might eat into their profits. Google is the absolute
worst. Even for services that cost real money, they absolutely will not
help. You better hope everything goes perfectly if you buy their
service.</p>

<h2 id="theater-ux">Theater UX</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I saw this summer’s Marvel movie in the theater on Sunday. A bit of a
last minute idea so we ended up going to the “legacy” movie theater
across the highway. Before I continue, It’s important to understand my
local cinema dynamics. We have two theaters here in Austin:
<a href="https://drafthouse.com/">The Alamo Drafthouse</a> and All Other
Cinemas.
</p>
<p>
The best place to see movies in Austin is at the Alamo Drafthouse. If
you’ve never been to an Alamo, I’m sorry. It’s a movie theater for
people who love movies by people who love movies. They craft the entire
art house experience from end-to-end. From the custom pre-screener of
thematically topical clips, to the strict no late arrival and no texting
policies, to custom food and drink options that match the latest
blockbuster movie. A waiter brings you food, drinks, and refills so you
don’t have to leave your seat. The trailers are a tight 15 minutes
announcing new releases and special events where they bring back old
movie classics (set to an era-appropriate soundtrack, of course). Every
year they have an indie movie festival to showcase the weirdest films
the industry has to offer. Going to the Alamo is a thoughtful experience
through and through and they sell out nearly every show opening week.
You pay more going to the Alamo of course but I think everyone would
agree it’s worth it for most movies unless you’re looking for a quick n’
dirty alternative.
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1L3eeC2lJZs?si=i-jqBOufRqq5d9F3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
Contrast that to the “legacy” theater. I call it the legacy theater
because this was the nice, brand new theater when I went to college 25
years ago; one of those big 24-screen nationwide chain movieplexes with
a four-machine arcade and stadium seating. Six plexiglass teller windows
tell the history of how popular this destination was in its time. It’s
flagship theater is an enormous 4D IMAX. It of course (like the Alamo)
has the push button recliners and swivel food trays. The nicest thing
about the “legacy” theater is that there’s always open seats and that’s
where the problems start to reveal themselves…
</p>
<p>
The first thing you notice at the “legacy” theater is that no one
occupies the teller windows anymore. Instead you go inside to meet a
greasy teenager who scans a QR code for the ticket you have to buy
online. You go to the snack bar and load up on enormous free refill tubs
of popcorn, drinks, and overpriced candy; it’s almost certainly a $50
stop. Then you go to the nearly empty theater and wonder if you walked
into the wrong theater by accident. Before the movie starts you sit
through the hokey pre-screen trivia and local ads and when the start
time hits… you watch 35 (!!!) more minutes of ads with a couple trailers
mixed in. And after all that you’re out of snacks and the movie starts.
</p>
<p>
The user experience contrast between the two couldn’t be more stark. One
is thoughtful and compounds the experience at every turn and the other
is enshittified with ads. One keeps you wanting to come back and the
other makes you wonder why you came here in the first place (or worse,
it makes you want to leave). At least its clean, I guess. One sees
attention as precious and not-to-be-disturbed, the other sees you as
captured by sunk costs and a pair of monetizable eyeballs. One will sell
you a fresh pizza, a popcorn, and a couple refillable sodas for $50 and
the other will sell you day-old popcorn, an impossibly large cup of
soda, and some Sour Patch Kids for $50… after you do the math, the
better experience isn’t any more expensive so it’s not even competing on
price.
</p>
<p>
It’s no wonder why the “legacy” theater is always empty. I bet its
owners would love to see all the seats full again. It all comes down to
UX. One works hard creates a vibrant scene and fosters a
culture<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
for people who like films, the other is real “death of cinema” vibes.
People (sometimes thousands!) put so much effort into these films to
make the best film possible, only to have that experience ruined in the
last mile. It’s tragic and I guess I’ll just catch it when it comes to
streaming.
</p>
<p>
In related news, last year Sony Entertainment acquired Alamo Drafthouse.
I’m not sure if that makes it more or less probable that you’ll be able
to experience an Alamo in the future. We’ll see where it goes from here.
Hopefully they can continue their relentless focus on the user
experience.

Alamo and revealed in 2022. While Alamo has done a lot to create immense
cultural capital here in Austin, that ascent has not been without
enabled bad behavior. Similar issues plague Hollywood too.

<p>Since the govt is no longer funding NPR maybe they could stop bending
over for the Repubs. Lay it all out there, stop spinning all the crazy
fascist authoritarianism as both-sides and normal partisan politics.
They know we’re in a lot deeper. Since we’re now paying the bills, how
about plain facts.</p>

<h2 id="antisemitism-is-everywhere">Antisemitism is everywhere</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Academics, who speak scientific language, won’t say “there’s no
antisemitism at UCLA” because they know that’s not true. Antisemitism is
everywhere. The question is how limiting and dangerous is it. And how
often is it encountered.
</p>
<p>
I grew up in the 1960s in a Queens neighborhood where antisemitism was a
real thing. We were blamed for World War II. If it weren’t for Jews my
uncle Pete would still be alive. That was the story. No doubt the kids
heard that at home.
</p>
<p>
Antisemitism was bred into us at home. Because of all the abuse my
parents and grandparents, uncles and cousins, suffered in Europe, before
coming the US during the war, their own idea of what it meant to be
Jewish was not entirely positive. You can’t help but feel responsible in
some ways for the abuse you suffer. And you can’t help but pass that on
to your kids.
</p>
<p>
There was and is a fair amount of pain associated with being Jewish in
the United States. Fact.
</p>
<p>
But: At UCLA? Harvard? Columbia? Please.
</p>
<p>
At the same time scientists can admit that there is antisemitism at
these places we must also acknowledge that to single these institutions
out among all, is complete utter total fucking bullshit.
</p>
<p>
That’s a scientific appraisal, btw. Provable in peer-reviewed
publications (though not submitted).
</p>
<p>
Antisemitism is complex. We should be hearing, openly, what exactly the
case is against these universities. The government is theoretically
representing the Constitution and the people of the United States. The
old “no taxation without representation”
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation">thing</a>.
Let’s hear the case in clear terms, and why the universities are
supposedly so bad.

modest proposal for new holidays to manage your digital life</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The cost of being online is getting too damn high and I’m tired of
pretending it’s possible to fit these tasks into a normal life. That’s
why I’d like to share a modest proposal for a new set of holidays to
manage our digital lives:
</p>
<p>
(Ahem.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A day to clear out your inboxes
</li>
<li>
A day to reset your passwords and delete old accounts
</li>
<li>
A day to fix your calendars
</li>
<li>
A day to cancel online service subscriptions
</li>
<li>
A day to manage the tags on your website
</li>
<li>
A day to switch out any critical apps
</li>
<li>
A day to backup your computer and phone
</li>
<li>
A day to organize your photos
</li>
<li>
A day to organize your music collection and playlists
</li>
<li>
A day to setup your new phone/computer
</li>
<li>
A day to try out a new app or major piece of software for your primary
workflow
</li>
<li>
A day to delete old text messages
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All I’m asking for is 1/30th of a year that we end up cramming into
other days. I’m willing to trade some of the B-tier holidays (Easter,
Thanksgiving, etc) for this. If you work in the government please call
me, it is URGENT.

<h2 id="gotosocial-and-the-butlerian-jihad">2025-08-03 GoToSocial and
the Butlerian Jihad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-08-03-gotosocial-and-the-butlerian-jihad">
2025-08-03 GoToSocial and the Butlerian Jihad
</h1>
<p>
I run a single user instance for the fediverse using GoToSocial and
since I’m blocking <a href="2025-07-23-test">thousands of IP address
ranges</a> – mostly from companies renting out bandwidth and computing
power to web scrapers – I’m also blocking my instance from seeing a lot
of the fediverse. That’s not good.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to continue blocking the big cloud providers like
Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Hentzner, OVH, Alibaba and whatever else they
are called. But if I’m following somebody from a fedi instance hosted by
these big cloud providers, I should put the IP numbers associated with
just those domain names onto a separate allow list.
</p>
<p>
Instead of using the Mastodon client protocol to get the list of people
I’m following, I can just access the database directly.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the script that adds IP addresses:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# Redirect the output of this script into /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.sh
echo &quot;#&quot; (date --iso)
set domains (sqlite3 /home/gotosocial/sqlite.db '
select distinct b.domain from follows as f
join accounts as a on f.account_id = a.id
join accounts as b on f.target_account_id = b.id
where a.username = &quot;alex&quot;
and b.domain is not null
order by 1')
set i 1
set m (count $domains)
for domain in $domains
    set ipv6 (host -t AAAA $domain | awk '/has IPv6 address/ { print $5}')
    set ipv4 (host -t A $domain | awk '/has address/ { print $4}')
    echo &quot;$i/$m $domain:&quot; $ipv4 $ipv6 &gt;&amp;2
    set i (math 1 + $i)
    for ip in $ipv4
        echo &quot;ipset add gotosocial $ip # $domain&quot;
    end
    for ip in $ipv6
        echo &quot;ipset add gotosocial6 $ip # $domain&quot;
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This prints lines such as the following to STDERR:
</p>
<pre><code>157/244 republik.ch: 172.67.74.47 104.26.5.143 104.26.4.143 2606:4700:20::681a:48f 2606:4700:20::ac43:4a2f 2606:4700:20::681a:58f
</code></pre>
<p>
And it prints lines such as the following to STDOUT:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add gotosocial 172.67.74.47 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial 104.26.5.143 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial 104.26.4.143 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::681a:48f # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::ac43:4a2f # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::681a:58f # republik.ch
</code></pre>
<p>
I redirect STDOUT to a file called <code>gotosocial.sh</code> and then I
run this script, which creates to IP sets called <code>gotosocial</code>
and <code>gotosocial6</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/iptables-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands

ipset create gotosocial hash:ip
ipset create gotosocial6 hash:ip family inet6

# this set is inserted at the beginning
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set gotosocial src -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set gotosocial6 src -j ACCEPT

# recreate using: gotosocial-follower-ips &gt; gotosocial.sh
source gotosocial.sh

netfilter-persistent save

# Find the number of the rule (hopefully it is number one)
#   iptables --list INPUT
#   ip6tables --list INPUT
# To delete, verify the number of the rule:
#   iptables --list INPUT 1
#   ip6tables --list INPUT 1
# Now delete it the rule:
#   iptables --delete INPUT 1
#   ip6tables --delete INPUT 1
# Now you can destroy the two ipsets, too
#   ipset destroy gotosocial
#   ipset destroy gotosocial6
# And now you can rerun this script!
</code></pre>
<p>
If you run it, you’ll get warnings about duplicate entries, I’m sure:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset v7.17: Element cannot be added to the set: it's already added
</code></pre>
<p>
In my case, for example, I have both of these entries and I didn’t
bother to fix this:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add gotosocial 151.101.129.91 # mastodon.online
ipset add gotosocial 151.101.129.91 # mastodon.social
</code></pre>
<p>
There are plenty more, of course.

<p>
In any case, you should now have an allow list that prevents these IP
addresses from getting blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> because the
<code>gotosocial</code> rule comes first:
</p>
<pre><code># iptables --list INPUT
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set gotosocial src
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set allowlist src
f2b-alex-apache  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports http,https
f2b-butlerian-jihad  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-butlerian-jihad-week  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-alex-bots  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports http,https
f2b-recidive  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            
DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set banlist src
</code></pre>
<p>
We’ll see how it goes. 😅
</p>
<p>
Problems that I expect: This needs to run periodically.
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, accounts that I am no longer following should be
removed. It might be easier to just delete and recreate the lists, every
now and then.

<p>I’ve been working on the top level of

place where navigation feels good, like this is the right track. So I

<p>A basic question I had about the
<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11752874-chatgpt-agent">ChatGPT
agents</a> that I can answer now that I have the feature, is whether or
not the code you create can run on a server, where you can give it a URL
and make it an endpoint other networked software can call. Or if it
could run periodically, say once every five minutes for a function that
was creating an RSS feed anyone could subscribe to. The answer is no –
it can’t do either of these things. I’m sure they could do it at a
technical level, but they don’t want to host applications. But now I may
understand better why they want to make a web browser, I bet you will be
able to call these agents from apps that run in the browser. And in
their case, they might not even have to support JavaScript? Heh. A
wholly different programming model? Maybe I’m overestimating how much
they’re biting off? I wonder if anyone at OpenAI reads this blog and
might want to get me in a tighter loop, so I can be among the first to
try new features like this, rather than, in this case, among the very
last.</p>

<p>One of the more depressing things in having so much code that I can
easily search, is the number of times I’ve rewritten the same code
without remembering I had written it before. Yesterday I did it
knowingly, I wanted a function that could tell me if one of a set of
categories applies to a WordLand draft. So I could say “don’t list
drafts with ‘linkblog’ as a category.” It could have other categories,
and there could be more than one category to exclude. I wanted to take
the time to write perfect code for this one problem. Not dense, not
particularly efficient. No matter how inefficient the code is, on
today’s hardware such a function couldn’t use any time at all. It’s fair
to say I’ve solved this problem before, but there was always more to it.
Here’s the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/d61110c1d74eb1162ebc726c09dd22f1">function</a>.
Now you know something about what I think is readable, understandable,
respectful of a human more than I am of the computer. I know the
computer would come up with much more dense and tricky code, but it
doesn’t have a mind, and I do. At times it can be relaxing, I magine, to
not have a mind. And btw, in a couple of years this layer of code will
be obsolete. We already are able to tell the machine how to do this in
human language, it understands what we mean. One tiny little but hugely
significant breakthrough made possible by ChatGPT and its cousins.</p>

<p>As you get older your memory gets less reliable. It makes programming
more of a challenge because as your software gets more features, there’s
more to remember and at the same time you’re getting older. I wonder if
there isn’t some way to use ChatGPT to augment the aging mind dealing
with more software complexity. It’s very much in line with the idea I’ve
had for a long time of putting all my writing in an AI database so I
could then ask it to edit it down to book length. Or get a table of
contents of what I think and then be able to read chapter-length
sections on, say platforms, or how important prior art is, or what
interop makes possible, and why everyone should give back when they take
from open ecosystems. Each one of those topics has lots of associated
stories over the years, but I probably couldn’t find most of them, but
an AI database certainly could. How to set that up? I’ve not figured
that out so far.</p>
