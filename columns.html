responses to the curl user survey of the year. I have sorted tables,
rendered updated graphs and tried to wrap my head around what all these

<h1 id="2024-06-15-old-tech-uucp">
2024-06-15 Old tech: UUCP
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="lkh">@lkh</span></a>,
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a> and I have
been trying to connect our servers using old tech for quite a while.
</p>
<h2 id="uucp">
UUCP
</h2>
<p>
The latest effort has been in connecting our servers using <em>Unix to
Unix copy</em> (UUCP). The benefit is that once you have that, you can
also have <em>remote command execution over UUCP</em> using
<code>uux</code> and it is as terrifying as it sounds.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see whether I can reconstruct my setup.
</p>
<p>
I use Debian.
</p>
<p>
lkh has a “travelling laptop” that is mostly offline, but sometimes it’s
online. That’s when he wants to exchange stuff with us. The laptop is
called Dwalin.
</p>
<p>
My server is Campaign Wiki.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for peering between news servers via UUCP is available
via <code>man 8 send-uucp</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="var-spool-uucp-ssh-authorized-keys">
/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys
</h3>
<p>
This allows Dwalin to connect via ssh.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins public key, ssh executes the remote
# uucico and hands over my login:
restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Udwalin -l&quot; ssh-rsa another-long-string-of-stuff uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-passwd">
/etc/uucp/passwd
</h3>
<p>
This is where Dwalin’s password is stored. This is important because
there’s no actual Dwalin user on my system.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins login on campaignwiki
Udwalin some-long-string-of-stuff
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-sys">
/etc/sys
</h3>
<p>
I kept the defaults and added Dwalin.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins system entry, no Port or
# credentials are given, since dwalin
# is expected to always call in.
system dwalin
called-login Udwalin
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-config">
/etc/uucp/config
</h3>
<p>
This is where I set my own node name.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me some spool related entries. I’m not sure whether I needed
them.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename campaignwiki

spool     /var/spool/uucp
pubdir    /var/spool/uucppublic
lockdir   /var/spool/uucp/Lock
logfile   /var/spool/uucp/Log     # The UUCP log file
statfile  /var/spool/uucp/Stats   # The UUCP statistics file
debugfile /var/spool/uucp/Debug   # The UUCP debugging file
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
In our case, lkh’s Dwalin is connected to kyonshi’s Erebor system and
here’s me sending a file to Erebor via Dwalin (since I’m not connected
to Erebor directly):
</p>
<pre><code>uucp some-local-file 'dwalin!ereborbbs.duckdns.org!~/'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="news">
News
</h2>
<p>
Yes, we want to exchange news. That means we need to install INN.
</p>
<p>
Look at the requisites:
</p>
<pre><code>perldoc /usr/lib/news/bin/send-uucp.pl
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-send-uucp-cf">
/etc/news/send-uucp.cf
</h3>
<p>
This define the sites to send news to, how to compress them and how big
the batches should be.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin      gzip        1048576
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-newsfeeds">
/etc/news/newsfeeds
</h3>
<p>
Determine the newsgroups to send to Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code># newsfeed entry for dwalin
dwalin\
    :casa.*,campaignwiki.*,erebor.*\
    :Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-active">
/var/lib/news/active
</h3>
<p>
Add the new newsgroups. We don’t do control messages.
</p>
<p>
Use <code>ctlinnd</code> to control the INN daemon.
</p>
<pre><code>ctlinnd newgroup erebor.talk y
ctlinnd newgroup erebor.test y
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-newsgroups">
/var/lib/news/newsgroups
</h3>
<p>
Give the new newsgroups a tag line.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>erebor.talk             General talk for EreborBBS
erebor.test             Testing connectivity with EreborBBS
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-readers-conf">
/etc/news/readers.conf
</h3>
<p>
Make sure the users connecting via NNTP can read the new groups, too.
This is not necessary if you read news via the local spool, I think.
</p>
<p>
Add <code>erebor.*</code> to the “readonly” section.
</p>
<pre><code>auth &quot;foreignokay&quot; {
    auth: &quot;ckpasswd -f /var/lib/news/newsusers&quot;
    default: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
}

access &quot;authenticatedpeople&quot; {
    users: &quot;*&quot;
    newsgroups: &quot;*,!junk,!control,!control.*&quot;
}

access &quot;readonly&quot; {
    users: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
    read: &quot;local.*,campaignwiki.*,casa.*,cosmic.*,erebor.*,rec.*,de.*,alt.*&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-1">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
Check <code>uulog</code>. Here’s where a news article is put into the
queue and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls and the enqueued article is
sent:
</p>
<pre><code>uux dwalin news (2024-06-15 10:22:01.34 3832004) Queuing rnews (D.000R)

</code></pre>
<h2 id="e-mail">
E-Mail
</h2>
<p>
Oh yes, we do.
</p>
<p>
Debian comes with Exim. Exim uses Perl’s “taint” mechanism wherein
user-supplied values cannot be used for commands. They must be untainted
by a lookup. For example, a user supplied sender name like “alex” is
tainted, but if you look it up in <code>/etc/passwd</code> it becomes
untainted. Perl keeps track of this for you, if you want to. Once you
run into the error, however, you need to figure out where you could be
looking up the values you have. Is the local part a user on the system,
is the domain a local domain? I spent way too much time on this.
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-update-exim4-conf-conf">
/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
</h3>
<p>
This is the file generated by <code>update-exim4.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
The result of me answering the questions:
</p>
<pre><code>dc_eximconfig_configtype='internet'
dc_other_hostnames='alexschroeder.ch;campaignwiki.org;communitywiki.org;transjovian.org'

dc_use_split_config='true'
dc_hide_mailname=''
dc_mailname_in_oh='true'
dc_localdelivery='mail_spool'
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that the MX records for my domains point to Migadu because that’s
where SMTP mail should go.
</p>
<p>
UUCP is what lkh, kyonshi and I use.
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-110-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/110_exim4-config_uucp
</h3>
<p>
A new router for UUCP mail that has to come before
<code>200_exim4-config_primary</code>. If it comes after the primary,
then it won’t work because the primary router ends with
<code>no_more</code> and as the comment at the end of the file says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <code>no_more</code> above means that all later routers are for
domains in the local_domains list
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This router only accepts mail destined for domains listed in the new
file <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp      
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-uucp">
/etc/exim4/uucp
</h3>
<p>
This is a file that translates the domain names I use for recipients to
UUCP names.
</p>
<p>
It only works for Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin   dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
This means that a mail for <code>lkh@dwalin</code> gets recognised as
such (because of the first column) and it will be sent to the UUCP
system <code>dwalin</code> (because of the second column).
</p>
<p>
The UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> is correct because
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> has a section for <code>system dwalin</code>
(see above).
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim-conf-d-transport-40-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim/conf.d/transport/40_exim4-config_uucp
</h3>
<p>
The route above says that the transport to use is <code>rsmtp</code>.
</p>
<p>
Define this using a new transport config file:
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

rsmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}} -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
</code></pre>
<p>
This was the biggest problem for me. The examples I saw for the
<code>-a</code> argument to <code>uux</code> used
<code>$sender_address</code>, resulting in an error about the third
argument to <code>uux</code> being tainted. You can see these error
messages in the exim main log (followed by a log entry showing that exim
sends me a en error message):
</p>
<pre><code>2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBd-26 &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=461

2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBh-2Q Completed
</code></pre>
<p>
I guess the examples I had seen would only work for older Exim versions
that didn’t do taint checking.
</p>
<p>
The code I’m using means that I’m looking up the sender local part
(“alex” or “root”) in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and if a match is found,
the untainted key is returned (instead of the value from the password
list).
</p>
<p>
You can test these expressions on the command-line:
</p>
<pre><code>exim -d+all -be '${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}'
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-2">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
As an ordinary user, use <code>mail</code> on the command line to send
mail to <code>lkh@dwalin</code>.
</p>
<p>
Poor <code>lkh</code>. So many test mails.
</p>
<p>
As <code>root</code>, check the exim log:
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus:~# tail /var/log/exim4/mainlog
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s a mail being enqueued successfully:
</p>
<pre><code>2024-06-15 14:08:42 1sISD4-00GIbQ-1a &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=513

<p>
Note the <code>uucp_router</code> and the <code>rsmtp</code> transport
being used.
</p>
<p>
Check <code>uulog</code>. Here’s where four mails are put into the queue
and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls the enqueued messages are sent:

<h2 id="using-llms-to-exploit-vulnerabilities">Using LLMs to Exploit
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, updated: 2024-06-11, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research: “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01637">Teams
of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</a>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated,
especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that
LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a
description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems.
However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities
that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities).
</p>
<p>
In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world,
zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many
different vulnerabilities and long-range planning when used alone. To
resolve this, we introduce HPTSA, a system of agents with a planning
agent that can launch subagents. The planning agent explores the system
and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term planning
issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark
of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents
improve over prior work by up to 4.5×…

security guard at the Watergate Office Building in Washington, D.C.,
noticed that a door lock had been taped open. He ripped off the tape and

it, you are workers setting up mines and factories on a new planet. You
don’t have the full list of everything you’re going to need to do
upfront, so you build each thing as you need it… winding up with a
convoluted mess once […]</p>

I just finished this bookmarklet to dynamically insert a table of
contents for pages that don’t have one. Mostly for my own blog, to be
honest.

This is what it looks like:

<p>
And you’re back in the room!
</p>
<p>
I recently submitted the manuscript for my next book,
<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/books/face-with-tears-of-joy"><cite>Face
with Tears of Joy: a Natural History of Emoji</cite></a> to my editor,
Brendan Curry, at W. W. Norton. This one was a bit of a whirlwind:
<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/books/empire-of-the-sum/"><cite>Empire
of the Sum</cite></a> was published less than a year ago, so writing
time has been short. Add in a recent relocation from Birmingham, England
to Linlithgow, Scotland
(<a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/linlithgow-palace/">the
birthplace of Mary Queen of Scots</a>, no less), along with all of the
attendant upheaval with jobs and schools and houses, and it has not been
a restful few months 😅

<p>“Where the public good is neglected in order to create profits for
individuals or companies, there we have corruption. Now, in the United
States, we dealt with this very efficiently by denying that there is any
such thing as a public good.” –Amitav Ghosh (via) See also: The Dark

<h2 id="imagine-rss-as-a-cover-story">Imagine RSS as a cover story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> has never been
on the cover of a magazine, so you can’t say ChatGPT is stealing this
from anyone. In fact I’m offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press
has chosen to focus on the idea that it’s plagiarizing journalists. The
ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they’re doing
their jobs, they’re reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote
a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper
that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series">NLCS</a>.
I don’t owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I
read the news on their site. The news doesn’t belong to them.
</p>
<p>
The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn’t so
far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no
billionaires involved, so they didn’t consider it newsworthy I guess.
Some day we’re going to have to accept that we have to make our own
news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker’s famous line – “If you don’t like
the news go out and make some of your own.” So here we go. I asked
ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story.

Imagine RSS as the cover story.

</p>
<p>
PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read
printed magazines?

written a crawler for the network of blogrolls via
<a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">connective links</a> in HTML
and/or RSS feeds. When I started the project, I had no idea what I’d
find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don’t know the extent
of it, but there’s a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I’m
thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the
blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I’m beginning to see the
utility of <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> as a feed
operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It’s not just a feed
reader. It’s able to do things most feed readers don’t do, maybe none
do. We don’t have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either.
I will of course share the results when they are shareable.</p>

<p>Three movies I’ve watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The
Matrix. 3. The Devil’s Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they
go together. And they’re all about the same thing, about choosing to
live in a dream, or to live the life you’re actually living. All three
are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to
end, which is really unusual for me these days.</p>

<p>I spent so much time in my friend Mike’s house growing up that I knew
his parents as Mama and Papa. His father, Kenneth Edward Nyboe, was born
in 1924 in New York City but spent his summers in Maine, where he knew
my mother and my aunt and where he met, and secretly married, my aunt’s
friend Helen Bryant just before he shipped overseas to be in the tank
corps with Patton’s Third Army in World War II.</p>
