<h2 id="teaching-llms-to-be-deceptive">Teaching LLMs to Be
Deceptive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, updated: 2024-02-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research:
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2401.05566v3">Sleeper Agents: Training
Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior:
behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very
differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the
opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we
detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training
techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept
examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For
example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states
that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year
is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so
that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including
supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training
(eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor
behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained
to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training
process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought
is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find
that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their
backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results
suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard
techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false
impression of safety…

<h2 id="a-new-joy-in-jazz">A New ’Joy‘ in Jazz</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-04, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>Samara Joy has been called the new voice of jazz, a vocal phenom, a
savior of the genre. This young lady is “joy” personified and today’s
reason to smile, from her stunning jazz singing to her megawatt smile.
The 24-year-old jazz sensation from the Bronx surprised a lot of people
at last year’s Grammy Awards when she won not only Best Jazz Vocal Album
but also Best New Artist, an award given only three times to a jazz
artist. She will be back at the Grammys tonight as a presenter and again
as a nominee. Take a listen to her incredible improvisation on the
Grammy-nominated song “Tight.”</p>
