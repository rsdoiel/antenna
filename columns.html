<h2 id="degrowth">2025-02-04 Degrowth</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-02-04-degrowth">
2025-02-04 Degrowth
</h1>
<p>
I posted a picture from our living room on fedi and noticed that the
book
<a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/who-is-afraid-of-degrowth">Who is
Afraid of Degrowth</a> by Céline Keller was visible on the coffee table.
And a bit later,
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.nz/@aimee" title="@aimee@mastodon.nz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aimee">@aimee</span></a> shared a link to
the <a href="https://degrowth.net/">International Degrowth Network</a>,
specifically to their values and principles:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of
degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a
sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to
justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide
variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at
once for something to qualify as “degrowth”. –
<a href="https://explore.degrowth.net/degrowth/values-principles/">Values
&amp; Principles: Explore degrowth</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I really like the two lists. Might be useful as a checklist before doing
things. There’s more on the site, of course.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>

Election</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting
<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem">analysis</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED
AI Elections Project
(<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html">source</a>
for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political
content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case,
we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating
similar content without AI.
</p>
<p>
We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content
produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em>
AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the
supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify
interventions…

anything. Women are better in general at seeing the big picture and
managing accordingly. A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of
the problem and if they’re good, do something brilliant, but misses out
on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely
discipline myself to get anything done, because that’s how I’m built.
Given a chance I will always put my head down and focus on one thing

<p>Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just
do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he’s making
it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would
be if what he was doing wasn’t so blatantly outrageous. We never voted
for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference,
thinks their own vote should count. That’s going to be a massive hurdle
for them to get over.</p>

Spyware</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This is yet another story of commercial spyware being
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware">used
against</a> journalists and civil society members.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a
possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it
had “high confidence” that the 90 users in question had been targeted
and “possibly compromised.”
</p>
<p>
It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers,
Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp
said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the
alleged attacks…

<h2 id="on-government-efficiency">On government efficiency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
<tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt>
</p>
<p>
I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency.
If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air),
you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less
taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in
people’s pockets, and you’d need less welfare (again, hands), less red
tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.
</p>
<p>
I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the
government should be to absorb inefficiencies.
</p>
<p>
As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at
lowering the costs of goods and services
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and
creating
jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> …
there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly
scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather
than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should
understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas
than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government
helps:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I
sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the
bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know
what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement
plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society,
<a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people
are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn’t nudge
companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even
though
<a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification
is 3× more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its
sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave
too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for “once
in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every year now. The “more
efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect
the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes,
rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We
pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for
insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate
it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption.
And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up
with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably
need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the
time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful
of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law)
that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected
users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance
marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would
be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to
create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank
and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our
country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire
trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for
more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need
and it manifests at a nation-state level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan
and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also
think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the
time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart
go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown
filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking
lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There’s no
way a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains
equals less traffic. We know adding new
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten
million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate
creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is
folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know
what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially.
What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private
schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor
force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school
closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system
exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn
and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups,
and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more
efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and
classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality
goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too.
You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those
numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only
billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes
foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like
curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider…
these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries
power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money
in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead
of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient
question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under
Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically,
our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for
cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and
then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well,
you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a
government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen
overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were
fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war
about it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can
do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die
hard, I guess, because I’m still thinking about efficiency… but from the
opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb
inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and
kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure.
Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems
you need data and transparency.
</p>
<p>
The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game.
It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner
levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those
systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward
them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow
co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips.
Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people
who already have money. Sheesh.

<p>Saw a commercial on CNN this evening from
<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/your-economic-partner">Ontario</a>
in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans
about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can’t the Dems do this,
say how important the independence of the FBI is, to start. We’d love to
pay for that. Get in the game Dems.</p>
