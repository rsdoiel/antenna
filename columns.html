I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones,
for a fresh start, but then I started getting ideas, and decided to go
for it. I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and
these days I’m using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else,
though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but
usually there’s nothing for me in those places. Anyway I’ll be pointing
to this post
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g">from</a>
some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will
appear here.

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How
to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
<em>How do you recompile Linux?</em>
</p>
<p>
In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild
<a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi’s Linux
kernel fork</a> instead of ‘mainline’ linux (the upstream
<a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).
</p>
<p>
Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building
and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly
goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more
convenient):

<h2 id="an-example-of-ai-use">An example of AI use</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to
ChatGPT. Here’s the prompt.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>I’m thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it
in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to
ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the
trip, I don’t mind going out of my way.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and
Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services
and notable bike trails.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place
that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.
</p>
<p>
It also offered information about weather considerations. It’s not
necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.
</p>
<p>
I’m not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example
because I’ve done this trip a number of times and was curious how things
had developed.
</p>
<p>
Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I
find a Starbucks not too far off the route I’m on. If you were plotting
the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a
continuum of services that have developed over the years that make
information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers
questions you have in the way you think of asking them.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 ">link
to the response</a>. I’ve heard that sometimes people have trouble
accessing these files.

I am seeing a lot of complaints from people around the world about the
current price of eggs. At my local supermarket, there no longer even are
eggs. The shelves where the eggs used to be are now filled with Easter
chocolate. The six eggs still left in our fridge are gonna have to be
rationed.

<p>
One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can’t moderate
comments under your own posts.
</p>
<p>
If someone says something abusive, it’s there for everyone to see,
forever.
</p>
<p>
I’ve come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full
discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes.
</p>
<p>
I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to
feel respected.
</p>
<p>
A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful.

<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A simple idea, a quid pro quo.
</p>
<p>
If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate
that we will support them.
</p>
<p>
We are the government of the US, Congress represents us.
</p>
<p>
We have been too passive.
</p>
<p>
But then, they have to include us in governing.
</p>
<p>
No more shutting off the connection after the election.
</p>
<p>
Seems like a fair deal.

<p>
If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I’d restart the
online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election
Day. 2. I’d get out the message over and over about how things are going
too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what’s happening.
Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the
US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes
will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun
to make my statement, but I’m afraid this is going too far. I think we
can all relate to that. We aren’t being represented here.
</p>
<p>
I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to
visualize what it feels like to be watching what’s happening in the US
from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have
expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure
out what you’re doing.

Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It’s not a
