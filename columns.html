<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Enlightenment Economics blog</p>
<p>Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy by Henry
Farrell and Abraham Newman is a rip-roaring read and simultaneously
terrifying. The reader is left with the clear impression of fragility in
the world financial system – bad enough in …

<h2 id="how-i-cross-post-to-threads">How I cross-post to Threads</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads,
Twitter, WordPress and RSS.
</p>
<p>
Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">The RSS feed</a>
is doing a lot of the work.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Links from the RSS feed show up on my
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links page</a> and in the
<a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emails</a>.
</li>
<li>
The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through
micro.blog. I am able to
<a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">give</a> it the
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">URL</a> of the
linkblogging feed, and then click on
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png">Add
Threads</a> – and that’s it. When I post something to the feed it shows
up on Threads.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most
people don’t know it’s there. It’s sort of a Grand Central station for
moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you’re a
micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds
page</a> is where you set it up.

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>I still have the SHARP Zaurus SL-C3200. A cute tiny clamshell PDA -
actually a tiny Linux laptop. I have got it when it was already obsolete
and used it little. It’s the most expensive model with the biggest RAM
(128 MB, I think), the bigges storage space (the 6GB HDD) and - of
course - the biggest power consumption.</p>

<p>I was recruited to speak at a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti">Ria Novosti</a>
conference in Moscow in June 2011, but decided not to go. This was back
when we thought naively that Russia was a democracy, and working with
Russian journalists, when American journalists wouldn’t, seemed like a
fair deal. Something about it didn’t smell right though, so I stayed
home.</p>

<p>I used to think of
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">Twitter
as a coral reef</a>, but its role as a world wide notification system is
fading, and we haven’t replaced it with anything. I wrote

has changed in the twitterverse, it’s grown new centers. For me,
Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot
less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for
ActivityPub but that’s more complicated than it may seem. As often is
the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a
strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn’t work,
when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users,
completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable
speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their
users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I
think it’s better if we, as users, remain diversified.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
You’ll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been
in every presidential election because then they’d have to fire half
their political reporters.
</p>
<p>
If you want a better idea of how it’s going, look at where the ad
dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning.
</p>
<p>
And make sure all your friends know that you’re voting and who you’re
voting for. I think that makes a difference.

<p>
I’m voting straight Democratic party line.

<p>If ChatGPT had a simple, non-AI scrapbook, like the old Mac OS had,
where you could just throw something over your shoulder so you can find
it later with a text search, that would make it a lot more useful for
retaining practices that work. It’s a shame to work something out, come
up with the answer that worked, and then to have to do it all over again
23 months later when you encounter the same problem.</p>
