2024-11-05 Gomphotherium helps you forget

<p>
If you use GoToSocial, like I do, then your posts do not expire.
Mastodon, on the other hand, has that feature.
</p>
<p>
Now, you could use <a href="Mastodon_Archive">Mastodon Archive</a>. But
that makes you archive your toots before expiring them.
</p>
<p>
No good!
</p>
<p>
I want them gone. So here‚Äôs a tiny Python script, built on the shoulders
of the Mastodon.py library. It deletes and unboosts ten posts older than
eight weeks that you haven‚Äôt pinned.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to run it from a cron job every hour, deleting up to 240
toots per day. The reason is that the deletion rate limits are super
strict. So you have to be slow about it.
</p>
<p>
Now, I could not be arsed to write yet another oAuth workflow. So here‚Äôs
the deal: Use <code>toot</code> to login. It‚Äôs a great client for the
command line and it comes with a separate text-based user-interface.
</p>
<p>
Gomphotherium uses the <code>toot</code> config file to log in. üò¨
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs probably full of bugs. At least it‚Äôs short.

So I decided I wanted to gzip the PDF files (‚Äúpre-compress‚Äù) them. I
found the answer I was looking for in
<a href="https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/serving-pre-compressed-files-using/">Serving
pre-compressed files using Apache</a> by Fran√ßois Marier. Sometimes
searching for stuff is hard just because you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs
called. üòÖ

<pre><code>AddEncoding gzip gz
Options +Multiviews
SetEnv force-no-vary
Header set Cache-Control &quot;private&quot;
&lt;FilesMatch &quot;\.pdf\.gz$&quot;&gt;
ForceType application/pdf
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
OK, time to gzip them all!
</p>
<pre><code>for d in 2*; cd /home/alex/campaignwiki.org/1pdc/$d; echo $d; gzip *.pdf; end

Aaaaand ‚Ä¶ the gains are abysmal! üòì

<strong>2024-11-04</strong>. I started looking at Ghostscript to reduce
filesize. The result of using <code>-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook</code> is
disappointing. The first PDF I opened had text in the original turned to
a badly pixelated image.
</p>
<p>
I started reading
<a href="https://ghostscript.com/blog/optimizing-pdfs.html">Optimizing
PDFs</a> on the Ghostscript blog and my head started smoking.
</p>
<p>
I ended up writing the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/markdown-links">markdown-links</a> to turn the filenames
into Markdown links for the wiki page
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/zip-original">zip-original</a> to create the first zip
file of the originals
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/shrink-pdfs">shrink-pdfs</a> to shrink all the PDFs using
<code>pdf-shrink</code>
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/pdf-shrink">pdf-shrink</a> reduce the images in a PDF
files to 150dpi (ebook quality)
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/zip-dir">zip-dir</a> to create the zip file of the shrunk
files for upload
</li>
<li>

To this,
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@mxp" title="@mxp@mastodon.acm.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mxp">@mxp</span></a> replied:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My invocation is less elaborate (w/o the threshold, filter settings,
etc.), but similar in that I also downsample images to 150 dpi. In
addition, I have <code>-dSubsetFonts=true -dCompressFonts=true</code>,
but since I use this for my own LaTeX-generated documents, I guess I
could drop this.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I didn‚Äôt look into fonts because I don‚Äôt mind people using weird fonts;
for the moment images are a bigger problem than fonts.
</p>
<p>
Then I went through my local directories and called
<code>pdf-shrink</code> on them all, regenerated the zip file containing
the year‚Äôs entries and gzipped the individual files.
</p>
<p>
As I was going through the files for 2024 I noticed that sometimes the
filenames betray different names (from email senders, I presume),
leaking privacy related information. I wanted to make sure that the
filenames reflected the authors of the works and that made me realize
two things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
not every entry has the license URL clearly visible
</li>
<li>
not every entry has the author names clearly visible
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Then again, anonymous works are OK, but it would have saved me some time
if it said ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù somewhere. üòè
</p>
<p>
In any case, if you publish PDF files somewhere, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm
planning to do from here on out:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
add copyright information and the license (if any), i.e.¬†a date or at
least a year and the names of all the people that have rights to the
work (text, art, layout, editing, maps, and so on)
</li>
<li>
add the work‚Äôs title and the names of the all the people to the PDF‚Äôs
metadata (‚Äúproperties‚Äù)
</li>
<li>
put the work‚Äôs title, data or version and the name of the main author
(your name?) into the filename
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I‚Äôve been
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2018/03/artificial_intellige.html">writing
about</a> the possibility of AIs automatically discovering code
vulnerabilities since at least 2018. This is an ongoing area of
research: AIs doing source code scanning, AIs finding zero-days in the
wild, and everything in between. The AIs aren‚Äôt very good at it yet, but
they‚Äôre getting better.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs some
<a href="https://zeropath.com/blog/0day-discoveries">anecdotal data</a>
from this summer:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Since July 2024, ZeroPath is taking a novel approach combining deep
program analysis with adversarial AI agents for validation. Our
methodology has uncovered numerous critical vulnerabilities in
production systems, including several that traditional Static
Application Security Testing (SAST) tools were ill-equipped to find.
This post provides a technical deep-dive into our research methodology
and a living summary of the bugs found in popular open-source tools‚Ä¶

So either I have to rewrite the NavigationShell/Sidebar/Inspector, or I

The other day I asked a famous blogger who uses RSS if he would be
willing to share his list of feeds, so others could subscribe to them.
He declined, for good reason, there was private stuff in the list he
couldn‚Äôt share. I certainly understand that. Then I realized, as often
is the case, that I could do myself what I had been asking others to do.
And in fact I already was sharing my OPML subscription lists, but people
who didn‚Äôt use <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> wouldn‚Äôt
know
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/04/whereTheOpmlLinkIsInFeedland.png">how

the
<a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/podcasts.opml">lists
of podcasts</a> I‚Äôm subscribed to. That list should update every hour
for any additions or removals from this list. I don‚Äôt update the list
very often, fwiw. And I make no warranties about the quality of the
podcasts, or when the feeds in the list update. And maybe this will give
other people an idea that they might want to do this as well. Let me
know if you do, I‚Äôd love to see what you do.</p>

<h2 id="rebooting-the-news">Rebooting the news</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
My opinion: At this point it doesn‚Äôt matter what the NYT says. Either
way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.
</p>
<p>
After the election if we still have freedom of speech, we should reboot
news around the simple idea of news written by experts. They must know
the basic rules of journalism, imho that‚Äôs much easier than the
know-nothing journalist posing as everyman with a
<a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">view
from nowhere</a>, trying to understand what they‚Äôre writing about. They
don‚Äôt have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That
system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn‚Äôt
been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This
election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked,
doesn‚Äôt work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to
interested readers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen">Jay Rosen</a> and I
did a <a href="https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">series of podcasts</a>
in the early teens called Rebooting the News. This was the basic
premise. I believe more than ever that this is the best path for news
going forward.
</p>
<p>
They did this at Wired for a while. I was invited to be a columnist when
my main qualification was that I was an accomplished software developer.
I think that‚Äôs the way to go. Experts sharing their perspectives on
current events.
</p>
<p>
Before Twitter existed, in 2002, I proposed to the NYT that they offer a
blog to anyone who is quoted in a NYT article. If they had done this,
the NYT would be what Twitter became, and it wouldn‚Äôt now be owned by
Elon Musk, for the benefit of humanity. I wish they had done it. It
would have been a real moneymaker. And good for the flow of knowledge.

<p>For the sports fan in me, this has been a bit of a tough week. Two
teams I normally like lost in a humiliating fashion. The New York
Yankees lost to the L.A. Dodgers in the MLB World Series (4-1), and the
Indian Cricket Team (ICT) was spanked by New Zealand, 3-0. The Indians

polls, I learned how they work and how much they are a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija">Ouija board</a>, where the
reports are tuned up based on the pollsters assumptions about who are
the real voters, and account for the limited people who can be polled.
They‚Äôre trying to estimate what millions of people will do by talking
with a few hundred. So they read each others‚Äô work, and try not to be
too far off the consensus. It‚Äôs at best an art, at worst they‚Äôre just
press releases designed to get the ad money to flow in certain
directions. Don‚Äôt overlook that the money is flowing to the same
businesses that are choosing which polls to report on. Most of what the
news orgs report on, it makes it into a sport like the NBA or MLB, but
there at least there‚Äôs objective news to report on, you know ‚Äì the score
of each game, how many runs were scored, who got injured, fired, traded.
In politics, there is no objective news, and if there were, the
journalists we have don‚Äôt report it. There‚Äôs a lot of inputs that are
connected to the outputs, conflicts of interest everywhere. Even so, the

play. Yes, I too am addicted. Endlessly fascinated. Maybe we‚Äôll survive
next week after all? Hope.</p>

<h2 id="could-a-musk-buy-bluesky">Could a Musk buy Bluesky?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast">Cory
Doctorow</a>: ‚ÄúI will never again devote my energies to building up an
audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to
that audience at will.‚Äù It‚Äôs a good practice, and while I completely
support it, I am part of several communities that could remove me
without recourse. I do it because I value the people in the community,
and feel that life is too short to wait for everyone to get it right.
</p>
<p>
Doctorow was writing about Bluesky, and once again, on Bluesky a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7ygxnh7ce2a">discussion</a>
starts on what it would take for Bluesky to attract developers, and each
time I am told that they have done enough, and I go away thinking that
their pitch is a scam, and they‚Äôre building value in a user base that
they will sell. They certainly could do it, and for all we know the
founders may have already sold some of their stock in the
<a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">latest
investment round</a> which valued the company at $x billion. (I did a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bluesky+investment+round+%2415m">search</a>
to find the evaluation but it appears to have not been announced.)
</p>
<p>
I gave them a roadmap, again, of how to demonstrate that they‚Äôre open,
and finally
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7zvw43d752a">concluded</a>
that the only way to <i>really</i> do it is to ‚Äúprovide a download that
you can install on any popular operating system to get an instant blue
sky network, running on its own without any help from anyone else. Then
you can claim to be really open and until then there will be a lot of
confusion.‚Äù (And I was generous at that. More accurately, people with
experience in tech will be certain this is yet another deal where the
founders get rich, where the users are the product and have read too
much into their promise of being open.)
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm still on Bluesky but I expect them to be another Twitter, which btw
had an open API too, and it‚Äôs pretty good, but they never offered the
option of people running their own twitters. That would have been good
protection against a Musk buying them out and turning us into pawns in
his plan for world domination. Do we really want to help someone else
build one of those?
</p>
<p>
In early 2017 I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">observed</a>
that Twitter had just been used to route around journalism and elect a
president. This value wasn‚Äôt on their balance sheet as an asset. I felt
its stock was vastly underpriced. Exactly as it turned out when Musk
bought it. Everyone still thinks he paid too much, at this moment it
could possibly gain him control of part of the US government‚Äôs $6
trillion per year budget early next year, and if they start selling the
assets of the government he could be in the best position to buy them at
pennies on the dollar, or take a percentage of each saleAt this point it
doesn‚Äôt matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for
the last time in this election.. He could probably start borrowing
against it the day after the election is called for Trump.
</p>
<p>
In the title I ask if a Musk could buy Bluesky, it‚Äôs possible they have
a way to prevent that in the design of their corporation, that‚Äôs why
it‚Äôs a question. But if the price were right maybe the founders would
sell out even if they didn‚Äôt have to.
