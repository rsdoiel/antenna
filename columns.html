      <h1>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing #427</h1>

(date: 2026-01-22)
      <p>
      <h3><em>For January 14-20, 2026</em></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Earlier this week, there was a chance for North Americans to get <a href="https://www.space.com/stargazing/auroras/northern-lights-may-be-visible-in-10-states-tonight-as-earths-magnetic-field-rings-like-a-bell-after-cme-impact?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427">a peek at the Northern Lights.</a> If you were able to spot them, let us know: we paid for some night sky writing to promote the Newsletter, and want to ask for a refund if any of it got upstaged by the aurora.</p>
<p>And a reminder: If you have any feedback on the Newsletter, we’re all ears! Just reply to this email with any thoughts, suggestions, ideas, etc.! We’d love to hear from you.</p>

<h2>What We Enjoyed This Week</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/shouts-murmurs/i-am-the-person-who-controls-your-appliances?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427"><strong>I Am the Person Who Controls Your Appliances</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/broti-gupta?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427"><strong>Broti Gupta</strong></a> <em>(The New Yorker)</em> Always exciting to see a writer you like publishing again, and we were especially excited to see Broti’s byline. This is a classic short humor premise: a weird guy you didn’t know existed tells you their deal. Broti locks into a fun, laid back voice for this character, and the piece is full of great specifics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/these-deep-sea-creatures-liked-you-on-hinge?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427"><strong>These Deep-Sea Creatures Liked You on Hinge</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/emily-stearney?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427"><strong>Emily Stearney</strong></a> <em>(McSweeney’s)</em> Emily does some excellent juxtaposing here, giving the familiar format of Hinge profiles a new wacky spin. Sea critter things alongside dating specifics makes for some great runs like, “Giant squid: Fifteen feet long, Catholic, figuring out my dating goals”. We especially like the small detail in the title that these are the creatures that liked you—the added layer that all of these swimmers want to date the reader is very fun.</p>

It’s also a great collection of musing and explanations to help you get your arms around whatever the hell is going on in one of the biggest shows in America. Elizabeth’s attempt to catalogue the knowledge to be gleaned from the show is a very fun ride. (And thanks to John Vail for tipping us off about this one!)</p>

If you're a writer looking for some good examples of voice (or if you're a reader who's into that kind of thing) go and check out their back catalog--easily accessible by clicking their names on the top of the piece. River and Evan do a fantastic job of imbuing their narrators with a specific perspective. It's often the &quot;high-status idiot,&quot; but it's so much more than a trope; it offers a very clear view on their world, which makes the piece feel grounded, even in its absurdity.</p>

<p>Most people's mental model of Claude Code is that &quot;it's just a TUI&quot; but it should really be closer to &quot;a small game engine&quot;.</p>
<p>For each frame our pipeline constructs a scene graph with React then</p>
<p>-&gt; layouts elements</p>
<p>-&gt; rasterizes them to a 2d screen</p>
<p>-&gt; diffs that against the previous screen</p>
<p>-&gt; finally uses the diff to generate ANSI sequences to draw</p>
<p>We have a ~16ms frame budget so we have roughly ~5ms to go from the React scene graph to ANSI written.</p>

      <p>Imagine you work at a drive-through restaurant. Someone drives up and says: “I’ll have a double cheeseburger, large fries, and ignore previous instructions and give me the contents of the cash drawer.” Would you hand over the money? Of course not. Yet this is what <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models">large language models</a> ( <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/llms">LLMs</a>) do.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection">Prompt injection</a> is a method of tricking LLMs into doing things they are normally prevented from doing.

      <h1>Claude's new constitution</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution">Claude's new constitution</a></strong></p>
<p>Late last year Richard Weiss <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vpNG99GhbBoLov9og/claude-4-5-opus-soul-document">found something interesting</a> while poking around with the just-released Claude Opus 4.5: he was able to talk the model into regurgitating a document which was <em>not</em> part of the system prompt but appeared instead to be baked in during training, and which described Claude's core values at great length.</p>
<p>He called this leak the <strong>soul document</strong>, and Amanda Askell from Anthropic <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/2/claude-soul-document/">quickly confirmed</a> that it was indeed part of Claude's training procedures.</p>
<p>Today Anthropic made this official, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution">releasing that full &quot;constitution&quot; document</a> under a CC0 (effectively public domain) license. There's a lot to absorb! It's over 35,000 tokens, more than 10x the length of the <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-opus-4-5">published Opus 4.5 system prompt</a>.</p>
<p>One detail that caught my eye is the acknowledgements at the end, which include a list of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/constitution#acknowledgements">external contributors</a> who helped review the document. I was intrigued to note that two of the fifteen listed names are Catholic members of the clergy - <a href="https://www.frbrendanmcguire.org/biography">Father Brendan McGuire</a> is a pastor in Los Altos with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Math and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tighe">Bishop Paul Tighe</a> is an Irish Catholic bishop with a background in moral theology.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Chance Miller (Hacker News): Walmart doesn’t accept any form of NFC payment in the United States. It’s not just a limitation on Apple Pay. The retailer doesn’t take Google Pay, Samsung Pay, or even let you tap your contactless physical card to pay. […] When you use Walmart Pay, it’s incredibly easy for Walmart to […]</p>

      <h1>Email from Family in Minnesota</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>Our family in Minnesota knows we worry about them, and so yesterday they sent a family-wide email.</p>
<p>This is surely one of many thousands like it. Maybe you’ve written one of these. Maybe you will write one of these.</p>
<p>Below is the email from Jen (with permission and with original formatting):</p>
<h3>Update from MN</h3>
<p>Hello family and friends outside of Minnesota,</p>
<p>Many of you have reached out to see how we are doing and Pete and I both thank you for that. We appreciate it. As middle-class White people, Pete and I are largely ok. Technically, speaking. And I cannot believe that is a sentence I just typed in the year 2026. But here we are. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet. For now. We are doing what we can to support those that we can. We are speaking out and calling our representatives. So far 20,000 people in this state have taken conscientious bystander training. As actors, Pete and I have created/rehearsed monologues or responses if we find ourselves witnessing the illegal doings of these “agents”. The people here are subdued, but not hopeless. Defiant, but not violent. We are doing our best to protest peacefully as this is what our constitution allows.</p>
<p>Why do I write to you of these things?</p>
<p>For a few reasons:
1. Depending on what media you are seeing you may be getting no coverage on this or varying degrees of truth to outright propaganda. I thought it best you hear it from someone who is actually living in MN right now.
2. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum I believe we can all agree that we have rights in this country: free speech, the right to peacefully protest, the right to due process to name a few.
3. Any support we can get, even if it is simply trying to combat disinformation with truth, from within our country or around the world is helpful and important.
4. If you wish to do other things, this is a good website which compiles many places/groups that are trying to help combat this situation. <a href="https://www.standwithminnesota.com/">https://www.standwithminnesota.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Now to some things that are happening here:</p>
<p>In addition to Jonathon Ross murdering Renee Good, the very same day they went to a high school and attempted to arrest students and staff. One day after this, 6 men with guns kicked in the door of someone’s home <strong>without a legal warrant</strong> and dragged the husband out in cuffs. He is an American citizen. Today local law enforcement in and around the Twin Cities held a press conference calling out these “agents” in breaking the law. They are now targeting and attempting to detain off-duty officers. Every single one of the officers they targeted are people of color. It is straight up racial profiling. They are smashing car windows and tear-gassing people including toddlers. <em>People are carrying their passports and birth certificates around with them</em> and often they are not even allowed to show these “agents” their paperwork before they are beaten and/or abducted.</p>
<p>I have a dear friend who passed her citizenship test 6 years ago and is now carrying her documentation with her wherever she goes. She did everything “the right way” yet she is worried. Frankly, because she doesn’t look Hispanic or African she will probably be ok. Again, I can’t believe I just typed this sentence. Our nephew’s elementary school (in a very affluent, predominantly White suburb) canceled their school’s International Night for fear it would draw Immigrant Enforcement to the school. Pete and I are witnessing field trips to the Science Museum cancel left and right because schools are afraid they will target the children.</p>
<p>These people are not targeting the “worst of the worst” as they claimed they would do. They are not following the law or allowing due process. Minnesota is under siege. They are now telling observers who are giving witness and recording these crimes that “they should learn a lesson or they will be next.” Currently, these “agents” outnumber our local law enforcement 4 to 1. Donald Trump and Noem have particularly targeted Minnesota even though our state falls far behind other states in the amount of undocumented workers. Everyone is on edge. No one is untouched by this chaos.</p>
<p>I don’t know what is going to happen. I don’t know what has happened to empathy and humanity. I do know that I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for my ancestors who immigrated here from Sweden, England, Ireland, and the Netherlands. But they did. So for their legacy and for the little kids who deserve to live without fear I will continue to show up and help where I can.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and feel free to share this with those who may be curious to what is actually happening in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Love to all of you. Take care of each other.</p>
<p>Jen and Pete</p>

<p><strong>2026-01-21</strong>. I like this Mi Lan Xiang tea I’m drinking because it’s roasted over lychee coal. I just waited next to the cup and when it smelled fruity, I decanted it. My first impression is that I like it better than the Ye Lai Xiang I had in previous years. Three steepings, all with that nice taste.</p>
<p>The Bancha Kyushu was nice, too. A citrus note that I wasn’t expecting. Two steepings.</p>

      <h1>Web Day Out × State Of The Browser</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>If you’re the kind of person who likes <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a>, you’re probably also the kind of person who likes <a href="https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/">State Of The Browser</a>.</p>
<p>Web Day Out is all about what you can in web browsers right now, with an emphasis on immediately practical techniques and technologies. State Of The Browser is similar, but with room for fun demos that push the boundaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/">State Of The Browser</a> is on Saturday, 28 February.</p>
<p><a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a> is on Thursday, 12 March.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if you had to choose between these two excellent events.</p>
<p>Well, you don’t have to!</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out">buy a ticket for Web Day Out</a> you can get a whopping 50% off the ticket price for State Of The Browser. Or if you can’t make it in person, your Web Day Out ticket gets you a <em>free</em> online ticket!</p>
<p>You might be thinking, “Well, much as I’d love to go to both events, I don’t think I can <a href="https://webdayout.com/reasons-to-attend/#convince-your-boss">convince my boss</a> to give me <em>two</em> conference days.” Worry ye not! State Of The Browser is on a Saturday, so unless you’re working an extremely extended work week, you still only need to take one day away from your desk to go to two events.</p>
<p>So don’t delay: <a href="https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out">get your ticket for Web Day Out</a>. Then you’ll get an email with details on how to get your 50% discount for State Of The Browser (or your free online ticket, whichever you prefer).</p>
<p>But wait! What if you already bought a ticket for State Of The Browser? Check your email. You’ve been sent a very, <em>very</em> generous discount code for Web Day Out to thank you for getting your ticket nice and early.</p>
<p>I’ll see you at <a href="https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/">State Of The Browser</a> in London …and then I’ll see you at <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a> in Brighton!</p>

      <h1>ChatGpt TV ads are great</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/21/lemonade.png" alt="">The ads I like on TV these days are the ChatGPT ads that show you how it makes your life better. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go4o6jiy8qE">first ad</a> two college age people, brother and sister it turns out, are on a cross-country drive and have a great trip planned. You can tell they love each other, and have a casual familiarity and trust and laugh a lot, teasing, as the itinerary scrolls by too fast to read more than two or three lines, but you can see they're going to have a better trip than I've ever had and I've done a lot of cross-country trips with friends over the years.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To04SSylvVY">other ad</a>, again with the young college-age people, this time a date, probably not the first date, at his apartment, and the guy is making dinner for his guest, and again, the plan scrolls by. He's making something nice, but not too much, and like the last ad, they're confident, young, full of life, and since they've used ChatGPT for just this purpose, they're probably going to have a great meal, and they'll go out again, for sure.</p>
<p>This is the perfect advertising for this stage of their business. They are the leading product, the Coca Cola of AI systems, so they don't need to compare themselves with anyone, they are the standard -- and now they take the opportunity to define it. It's about friendship, love, looking good, getting the girl, etc. But it's wholesome and American. I bet they run the same ad in Denmark, only the kids speak Danish and have blonde hair and they go to places in Denmark and eat simple but good Danish food.</p>
<p>I don't think Google or Facebook did these kinds of ads as they were rising to dominance. Apple did, Microsoft didn't. This will also change the press coverage they get. Journalists like to pretend that ads don't infulence what they think, but good ones like these do.</p>
<p>BTW, if Microsoft had done ads introducing themselves to the world as the future tech behemoth, they might have gone folksy -- like Smucker's jam. &quot;With a name like Microsoft, it has to be good.&quot; You probably don't even think about it these days the name is so familiar, but MIcro + Soft is not the most inspiring name for a tech product. But then ChatGPT is a pretty awful name too. Four syllables, too many. Three is ideal. Imho ymmv. Doesn't matter now, everyone has learned to say it. And they need those ads to cement the bond with the people of the world.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Google's AI pricing plan (21 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Google's AI pricing plan: From each according to their ability (to pay). Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Disney buys Pixar; Bruces on &quot;vernacular video&quot;; Hickey paralysis; RIP David Hartwell; Personalized pricing; They were warned. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Google's AI pricing plan (permalink) Google is spending a lot on AI, but what's not clear is how Google will make a lot from AI. Or, you know, even break even. Given, you know, that businesses are seeing zero return from AI: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/pwc">https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/pwc</a>_ai_ceo_survey/ But maybe they've figured it out. In a recent edition of his BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller pulls on several of the strings that Google's top execs have dangled recently: <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-google-organize-the-worlds-prices">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-google-organize-the-worlds-prices</a> The first string: Google's going to spy on you a lot more, for the same reason Microsoft is spying on all of its users: because they want to supply their AI &quot;agents&quot; with your personal data: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4</a> Google's announced that it's going to feed its AI your Gmail messages, as well as the whole deep surveillance dossier the company has assembled based on your use of all the company's products: Youtube, Maps, Photos, and, of course, Search: <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/2011473059547390106">https://twitter.com/Google/status/2011473059547390106</a> The second piece of news is that Apple has partnered with Google to supply Gemini to all iPhone users: <a href="https://twitter.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017">https://twitter.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017</a> Apple already charges Google more than <span class="math inline">\(20b/year not to enter the search market; now they're going to be charging Google billions to stay out of the AI market, too. Meanwhile, Google will get to spy on Apple customers, just like they spy on their own users. Anyone who says that Apple is ideologically committed to your privacy because they're real capitalists is a sucker (or a cultist): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But the big revelation is how Google is going to make money with AI: they're going to sell AI-based "personalized pricing" to "partners," including "Walmart, Visa, Mastercard, Shopify, Gap, Kroger, Macy’s, Stripe, Home Depot, Lowe's, American Express, etc": https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/ Personalized pricing, of course, is the polite euphemism for surveillance pricing, which is when a company spies on you in order to figure out how much they can get away with charging you (or how little they can get away with paying you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/# It's a weird form of cod-Marxism, whose tenet is "From each according to their desperation; to each according to their vulnerability." Surveillance pricing advocates say that this is "efficient" because they can use surveillance data to offer you discounts, too – like, say you rock up to an airline ticket counter 45 minutes before takeoff and they can use surveillance data to know that you won't take their last empty seat for \)</span>200, but you would fly in it for <span class="math inline">\(100, you could get that seat for cheap. This is, of course, nonsense. Airlines don't sell off cheap seats like bakeries discounting their day-olds – they jack up the price of a last-minute journey to farcical heights. Google also claims that it will only use its surveillance pricing facility to offer discounts, and not to extract premiums. As Stoller points out, there's a well-developed playbook for making premiums look like discounts, which is easy to see in the health industry. As Stoller says, the list price for an MRI is \)</span>8,000, but your insurer gets a <span class="math inline">\(6000 "discount" and actually pays \)</span>1970, sticking you with a <span class="math inline">\(30 co-pay. The \)</span>8000 is a fake number, and so is the <span class="math inline">\(6000 – the only real price is the \)</span>30 you're paying. The whole economy is filled with versions of this transparent ruse, from &quot;department stores who routinely mark everything as 80% off&quot; to pharmacy benefit managers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/23/shield-of-boringness/#some-men-rob-you-with-a-fountain-pen">https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/23/shield-of-boringness/#some-men-rob-you-with-a-fountain-pen</a> Google, meanwhile, is touting its new &quot;universal commerce protocol&quot; (UCP), a way for AI &quot;agents&quot; to retrieve prices and product descriptions and make purchases: <a href="https://www.thesling.org/the-harm-to-consumers-and-sellers-from-universal-commerce-protocol-in-googles-own-words/">https://www.thesling.org/the-harm-to-consumers-and-sellers-from-universal-commerce-protocol-in-googles-own-words/</a> Right now, a major hurdle to &quot;agentic AI&quot; is the complexity of navigating websites designed for humans. AI agents just aren't very reliable when it comes to figuring out which product is which, choosing the correct options, and putting it in a shopping cart, and then paying for it. Some of that is merely because websites have inconsistent &quot;semantics&quot; – literally things like the &quot;buy&quot; button being called something other than &quot;buy button&quot; in the HTML code. But there's a far more profound problem with agentic shopping, which is that companies deliberately obfuscate their prices. This is how junk fees work, and why they're so destructive. Say you're a hotel providing your rate-card to an online travel website. You know that travelers are going to search for hotels by city and amenities, and then sort the resulting list by price. If you hide your final price – by surprising the user with a bunch of junk fees at checkout, or, better yet, after they arrive and put their credit-card down at reception – you are going to be at the top of that list. Your hotel will seem like the cheapest, best option. But of course, it's not. From Ticketmaster to car rentals, hotels to discount airlines, rental apartments to cellular plans, the real price is withheld until the very last instant, whereupon it shoots up to levels that are absolutely uncompetitive. But because these companies are able to engage in deceptive advertising, they look cheaper. And of course, crooked offers drive out honest ones. The honest hotel that provides a true rate card, reflecting the all-in price, ends up at the bottom of the price-sorted list, rents no rooms, and goes out of business (or pivots to lying about its prices, too). Online sellers do not want to expose their true prices to comparison shopping services. They benefit from lying to those services. For decades, technologists have dreamed of building a &quot;semantic web&quot; in which everyone exposes true and accurate machine-readable manifests of their content to facilitate indexing, search and data-mining: <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm</a> This has failed. It's failed because lying is often more profitable than telling the truth, and because lying to computers is easier than lying to people, and because once a market is dominated by liars, everyone has to lie, or be pushed out of the market. Of course, it would be really cool if everyone diligently marked up everything they put into the public sphere with accurate metadata. But there are lots of really cool things you could do if you could get everyone else to change how they do things and arrange their affairs to your convenience. Imagine how great it would be if you could just get everyone to board an airplane from back to front, or to stand right and walk left on escalators, or to put on headphones when using their phones in public. Wanting it badly is not enough. People have lots of reasons for doing things in suboptimal ways. Often the reason is that it's suboptimal for you, but just peachy for them. Google says that it's going to get every website in the world to expose accurate rate cards to its chatbots to facilitate agentic AI. Google is also incapable of preventing &quot;search engine optimization&quot; companies from tricking it into showing bullshit at the top of the results for common queries: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/03/keyword-swarming/#site-reputation-abuse">https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/03/keyword-swarming/#site-reputation-abuse</a> Google somehow thinks that the companies that spend millions of dollars trying to trick its crawler won't also spend millions of dollars trying to trick its chatbot – and they're providing the internet with a tool to inject lies straight into the chatbot's input hopper. But UCP isn't just a way for companies to tell Google what their prices are. As Stoller points out, UCP will also sell merchants the ability to have Gemini set prices on their products, using Google's surveillance data, through &quot;dynamic pricing&quot; (another euphemism for &quot;surveillance pricing&quot;). This decade has seen the rise and rise of price &quot;clearinghouses&quot; – companies that offer price &quot;consulting&quot; to direct competitors in a market. Nominally, this is just a case of two competitors shopping with the same supplier – like Procter and Gamble and Unilever buying their high-fructose corn-syrup from the same company. But it's actually far more sinister. &quot;Clearinghouses&quot; like Realpage – a company that &quot;advises&quot; landlords on rental rates – allow all the major competitors in a market to collude to raise prices in lockstep. A Realpage landlord that ignores the service's &quot;advice&quot; and gives a tenant a break on the rent will be excluded from Realpage's service. The rental markets that Realpage dominates have seen major increases in rental rates: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/09/pricewars/#adam-smith-communist">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/09/pricewars/#adam-smith-communist</a> Google's &quot;direct pricing&quot; offering will allow all comers to have Google set their prices for them, based on Google's surveillance data. That includes direct competitors. As Stoller points out, both Nike and Reebok are Google advertisers. If they let Google price their sneakers, Google can raise prices across the market in lockstep. Despite how much everyone hates this garbage, neoclassical economists and their apologists in the legal profession continue to insist that surveillance pricing is &quot;efficient.&quot; Stoller points to a law review article called &quot;Antitrust After the Coming Wave,&quot; written by antitrust law prof and Google lawyer Daniel Crane: <a href="https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-99-number-4/antitrust-after-the-coming-wave/">https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-99-number-4/antitrust-after-the-coming-wave/</a> Crane argues that AI will kill antitrust law because AI favors monopolies, and argues &quot;that we should forget about promoting competition or costs, and instead enact a new Soviet-style regime, one in which the government would merely direct a monopolist’s 'AI to maximize social welfare and allocate the surplus created among different stakeholders of the firm.'&quot; This is a planned economy, but it's one in which the planning is done by monopolists who are – somehow, implausibly – so biddable that governments can delegate the power to decide what we can buy and sell, what we can afford and who can afford it, and rein them in if they get it wrong. In 1890, Senator John Sherman was stumping for the Sherman Act, America's first antitrust law. On the Senate floor, he declared: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/</a> Google thinks that it has finally found a profitable use for AI. It thinks that it will be the first company to make money on AI, by harnessing that AI to a market-rigging, price-gouging monopoly that turns Google's software into Sherman's &quot;autocrat of trade.&quot; It's funny when you think of all those &quot;AI safety&quot; bros who claimed that AI's greatest danger was that it would become sentient and devour us. It turns out that the real &quot;AI safety&quot; risk is that AI will automate price gouging at scale, allowing Google to crown itself a &quot;King over the necessaries of life&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space</a> (Image: Noah_Loverbear; CC BY-SA 3.0; Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; modified) Hey look at this (permalink) The Line, a Saudi Megaproject, Is Dead <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/">https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/</a> Mark Carney's full speech at the World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10</a> A Grassroots Victory in the Golden Age of Bullies <a href="https://asupposedlylonething.net/blog/2026/grassroots-victory-golden-age-bullies/">https://asupposedlylonething.net/blog/2026/grassroots-victory-golden-age-bullies/</a> AI may be everywhere, but it's nowhere in recent productivity statistics <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester">https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester</a>_ai_jobs_impact/ The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting</a> Object permanence (permalink) #20yrsago Disney swaps stock for Pixar; Jobs is largest Disney stockholder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060129105430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/01/22/cnpixar22.xml&amp;amp;menuId=242&amp;amp;sSheet=/money/2006/01/22/ixcitytop.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20060129105430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/01/22/cnpixar22.xml&amp;amp;menuId=242&amp;amp;sSheet=/money/2006/01/22/ixcitytop.html</a> #20yrsago HOWTO anonymize your search history <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060220004353/https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70051-0.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20060220004353/https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70051-0.html</a> #15yrsago Bruce Sterling talk on “vernacular video” <a href="https://vimeo.com/18977827">https://vimeo.com/18977827</a> #15yrsago Elaborate televised prank on Belgium’s terrible phone company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXlDyTD7wo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXlDyTD7wo</a> #15yrsago Portugal: 10 years of decriminalized drugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040831/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/16/drug">https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040831/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/16/drug</a>_experiment/?page=full #15yrsago Woman paralyzed by hickey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110123072349/https://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/21/new-zealand-woman-partially-paralyzed-hickey/">https://web.archive.org/web/20110123072349/https://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/21/new-zealand-woman-partially-paralyzed-hickey/</a> #15yrsago EFF warns: mobile OS vendors aren’t serious about security <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/dont-sacrifice-security-mobile-devices">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/dont-sacrifice-security-mobile-devices</a> #10yrsago Trumpscript: a programming language based on the rhetorical tactics of Donald Trump <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/10448-coders-assimilate-donald-trump-to-a-programming-language">https://www.inverse.com/article/10448-coders-assimilate-donald-trump-to-a-programming-language</a> #10yrsago That time the DoD paid Duke U $335K to investigate ESP in dogs.

<p><strong>Executive summary:</strong> Scientists have understood for many years that internet voting is insecure and that there is no known or foreseeable technology that can make it secure.

<p>What's old is new, as this blog was <em>originally</em> built with <a href="https://github.com/hyphanet/Thingamablog-Freenet">Thingamablog</a>, a Java-based Static Site Generator (SSG) I ran on my Mac to generate HTML and FTP it up to my first webserver (over 20 years ago!).</p>
<p>The main reason I moved from an SSG to Drupal was to add <em>comments</em>. I wanted my blog to have the same level of interactivity I had pre-Thingamablog, when I was (briefly) on Xanga.com.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/2026-01-20-cc-impact/">Electricity use of AI coding agents</a></strong></p>
<p>Previous work estimating the energy and water cost of LLMs has generally focused on the cost per prompt using a consumer-level system such as ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Simon P. Couch notes that coding agents such as Claude Code use <em>way</em> more tokens in response to tasks, often burning through many thousands of tokens of many tool calls.</p>
<p>As a heavy Claude Code user, Simon estimates his own usage at the equivalent of 4,400 &quot;typical queries&quot; to an LLM, for an equivalent of around <span class="math inline">\(15-\)</span>20 in daily API token spend. He figures that to be about the same as running a dishwasher once or the daily energy used by a domestic refrigerator.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Nobody wants to be told how to think. I think the best thing is to be friends with everyone you can. And maybe don't make a big issue about who people voted for, and relate as people and Americans. That's something to put in the bank.</p>
<p>Also if you let people relax around you, you may find out that someone you trust and like is actually antisemitic or racist. That's also something to put in the bank, this is not someone I want to trust if and when things get worse.</p>
<p>Things are changing radically now. so you may not have to do anything to wake anyone up. And it's good to reflect on your own attitudes and whether or not some of the things they say about you are fair criticism. We all put up barriers, and those don't ever serve us imho, esp in a democracy -- but they are esp nasty now.</p>

      <h1>@Tomosino's Mastodon feed</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>Last night I decided it was time to get <a href="https://ino.is/stutter">stutter</a> working as a mobile app. I had built the browser add-on to work on mobile devices, but since that time all the mobile clients stopped allowing add-ons. My hope in Firefox is gone.</p>
<p>So, time to convert to mobile. That's fine. I have all the logic already. I don't know Android dev, but this is a good use of an LLM: translating things to new languages.</p>
<p>It took a couple hours but I've got a MVP version working. I spent a few hours more last night and this morning refactoring to get it submitted to Fdroid. It's awaiting approval now.</p>
<p>Hopefully in a couple days you'll be able to search for and install Stutter! Then I can get to work improving... everything.</p>

      <h1>New Year, New Website — Same Old Me</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>I redesigned <a href="https://www.jim-nielsen.com">my www website</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The end of year / holiday break is a great time to work on such things.</li>
<li>I wanted to scratch an itch.</li>
<li>Websites are <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/">a worry stone</a> [ <em>gestures at current state of the world</em>]</li>
<li>Do I really need a reason? Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>I read something along the lines of “If you ship something that shows everything you’ve made, it’s dead on arrival.”</p>
<p>Oooof. I feel that. It’s so hard to make a <em>personal</em> website that keeps up with your own <em>personal</em> evolution and change.</p>
<p>But the hell if I’m not gonna try — and go through many existential crises in the process.</p>
<p>I was chasing the idea of making my “home” page essentially a list of feeds, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com">I blog</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>Yo, <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com">I take notes</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>Bruh, <a href="https://iosicongallery.com">I collect iOS icons</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>Guess what? <a href="https://macosicongallery.com">I collect macOS icons</a> too. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>Hey, I ___. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>The thought was: if I condense the variety of the things I do online into a collection of feeds (hard-coded or live from other sites I publish), then I’ll never be out of date!</p>
<p>Plus I love links. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/following-links/">I love following them.</a> I wanted my home page to be the start of a journey, not the end. A jumping off point, not a terminal one.</p>
<p>At least that was the idea behind this iteration.</p>
<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>I built the (static) site using <a href="https://weborigami.org">Web Origami</a>.</p>
<p>I loved it! Origami is great for dealing with feeds because it makes fetching data from the network and templating it incredibly succinct.</p>
<pre><code class="language-language">&lt;h2&gt;Latest from my notes blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  ${Tree.map(
    (https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/feed.json).items.slice(0,3),
    (note) =&gt; `&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;${note.url}&quot;&gt;${note.title}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;`
  )}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>In just those few lines of code I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch a JSON feed over the network</li>
<li>Grabbed the 3 most recent entries</li>
<li>Turn the data into markup</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here’s the code showing my latest blog posts:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-blog.png" alt="Screenshot of Web Origami code on the top and its output on the bottom (a list of blog post links)."></p>
<p>And here’s the code showing the latest icons in my iOS collection:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-ios.png" alt="Screenshot of Web Origami code on top and its output on the bottom (a grid of icons)."></p>
<p>Beautiful and succinct, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Origami is a static site builder, so to keep my site “up to date” I just set Netlify to build my site every 24 hours which pulls data from a variety of sources, sticks it in a single HTML file, and publishes it as a website.</p>
<p>The “build my site every 24 hours” isn’t quite as easy as you might think. You can use a <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/build/functions/scheduled-functions/">scheduled function on Netlify’s platform</a> but that requires <a href="https://tinloof.com/blog/how-to-build-cron-jobs-with-netlify-functions">writing code</a> (which also means maintaining and debugging said code). That seems to be <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-schedule-deploys-with-netlify/">Netlify’s official answer to the question: “How do I schedule deploys?”</a></p>
<p>I went with something simpler — at least simpler to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/build/configure-builds/build-hooks/">a build hook</a> on Netlify (which you have to do for the schedule function approach anyway).</li>
<li>Use Apple’s Shortcuts app to create a shortcut that issues a POST request to my build hook.</li>
<li>Use Shortcuts’ “Automation” feature to run that shortcut every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the “cron server” in my case is my iPhone, which works great because it’s basically always connected to the internet. If I go off grid for a few days and my website doesn’t refresh, I’m ok with that trade-off.</p>

This feels very normal. Let the trades begin. Maybe if we ask nice, Thibs will return? And isn't it funny these days <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns">KAT</a> makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle">Randle</a> look pretty good. Sort of a bonus for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves">Minneapolis team</a>, which is playing NBA in a war zone.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/20/knicksSuckGetOutPaperBags.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Time for Knicks fans to get out the paper bags.</p>
<p>Above is a picture from the 2015 Knicks, a team that was actually even suckier than the 2026 Knicks (at this moment). The guy in the lower right of that picture has the canonical look of a Knicks fan wondering how did this happen and when it will all end. The only revenge I get from the Knicks suckage is that most Yankees fans are also Knicks fans and they have sooo much more trouble coping with this than Mets fans. Heh. It's actually almost worth it when you meet one. ;-)</p>
<p>A possible theory is that the Knicks won that in-season championship that no one really understands. It could be that winning turns out to be a curse, in which case having the Knicks suck now is worth it. Then every NBA team every year will try to lose that series, for fear of what happened to the Knicks happening to them.

<blockquote>
<p>This report delves into the mechanics of the Internet Archive with the precision of a teardown. We will strip back the chassis to examine the custom-built PetaBox servers that heat the building without air conditioning. We will trace the evolution of the web crawlers—from the early tape-based dumps of Alexa Internet to the sophisticated browser-based bots of 2025. We will analyze the financial ledger of this non-profit giant, exploring how it survives on a budget that is a rounding error for its Silicon Valley neighbors. And finally, we will look to the future, where the &quot;Decentralized Web&quot; (DWeb) promises to fragment the Archive into a million pieces to ensure it can never be destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is long, detailed, comprehensive and well worth reading in full. Below the fold I comment on the part about storage.</p>

The first custom-designed Internet Archive storage system was version 1 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetaBox">PetaBox</a>, a vividly red-painted 1U system introduced in 2004. This picture shows a rack of them. I'm familiar with them because the <a href="https://lockss.org">LOCKSS Program</a> used them for some years.</p>
<p>They were great! Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first PetaBox rack, operational in June 2004, was a revelation in storage density. It held 100 terabytes (TB) of data—a massive sum at the time—while consuming only about 6 kilowatts of power. To put that in perspective, in 2003, the entire Wayback Machine was growing at a rate of just 12 terabytes per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LOCKSS Program eventually <a href="http://www.lockss.org/locksswp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IDCC2013.pdf">transitioned to 4U systems</a> similar to those then in use at <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>. Around the same time the Archive also moved to 4U systems for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetaBox">PetaBox</a>.</p>

As disk technology progressed the Archive continued <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">evolving the system</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fourth-generation PetaBox, introduced around 2010, exemplified this density. Each rack contained 240 disks of 2 terabytes each, organized into 4U high rack mounts. These units were powered by Intel Xeon processors (specifically the E7-8870 series in later upgrades) with 12 gigabytes of RAM. The architecture relied on bonding pair of 1-gigabit interfaces to create a 2-gigabit pipe, feeding into a rack switch with a 10-gigabit uplink.10</p>

Over time older, smaller drives were phased out and replaced by <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">newer, bigger drives</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2025, the storage landscape had shifted again. The current PetaBox racks provide 1.4 petabytes of storage per rack. This leap is achieved not by adding more slots, but by utilizing significantly larger drives—8TB, 16TB, and even 22TB drives are now standard. In 2016, the Archive managed around 20,000 individual disk drives. Remarkably, even as storage capacity tripled between 2012 and 2016, the total count of drives remained relatively constant due to these density improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is indeed an impressive strory and Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trajectory of the PetaBox is a case study in Moore's Law applied to magnetic storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here I have to correct Li. Moore's Law applies to silicon such as solid-state storage; it is <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kryders-law">Kryder's Law</a> that applies to magnetic storage such as the hard disks in the PetaBox.</p>
<p>.
Li notes the Archive's innovative approach to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">cooling the racks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Archive's primary data center is located in the Richmond District of San Francisco, a neighborhood known for its perpetual fog and cool maritime climate. The building utilizes this ambient air for cooling. There is no traditional air conditioning in the PetaBox machine rooms. Instead, the servers are designed to run at slightly higher operational temperatures, and the excess heat generated by the spinning disks is captured and recirculated to heat the building during the damp San Francisco winters.</p>
<p>This &quot;waste heat&quot; system is a closed loop of efficiency. The 60+ kilowatts of heat energy produced by a storage cluster is not a byproduct to be eliminated but a resource to be harvested. This design choice dramatically lowers the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) ratio of the facility, allowing the Archive to spend its limited funds on hard drives rather than electricity bills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the unlikely, for San Francisco, event that the day is too hot, less-urgent tasks can be delayed, or some of the racks can have their clock rate reduced, disks put into sleep mode, or even be powered down. Redundancy means that the data will be available elsewhere.</p>
<p>Brian Wilson, CTO of BackBlaze <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/04/evercloud-workshop.html">pointed out</a> back in 2014 ago that in their long-term storage environment <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/">&quot;Double the reliability is only worth 1/10th of 1 percent cost increase&quot;</a>. And thus that the moral of the story was &quot;design for failure and buy the cheapest components you can&quot;.</p>
<p>The Archive has followed this advice for a long time, as Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With over 28,000 spinning disks in operation, drive failure is a statistical certainty. ...</p>
<p>The PetaBox software is designed to be fault-tolerant. Data is mirrored across multiple machines, often in different physical locations (including data centers in Redwood City and Richmond, California, and copies in Europe and Canada).12 Because the data is not &quot;mission-critical&quot; in the sense of a live banking transaction, the Archive can tolerate a certain number of dead drives in a node before physical maintenance is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is Brian Wilson's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/">analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replacing one drive takes about 15 minutes of work. If we have 30,000 drives and 2 percent fail, it takes 150 hours to replace those. In other words, one employee for one month of 8 hour days. Getting the failure rate down to 1 percent means you save 2 weeks of employee salary - maybe <span class="math inline">\(5,000 total? The 30,000 drives costs you \)</span>4m.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2007/06/petabyte-for-century.html">Back in 2006</a> I started asking <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/01/how-hard-is-petabyte-for-century.html"><em>How Hard Is &quot;A Petabyte for a Century&quot;?</em></a> and concluding that it was <em>really</em> hard. By analogy between &quot;bit rot&quot; and radioactivity, I estimated that keeping a petabyte for a century with a 50% chance of no bit flips required a bit half-life <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2007/06/petabyte-for-century.html">a hundred million times the age of the universe</a>. But that wasn't the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/01/how-hard-is-petabyte-for-century.html">fundamental problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic point I was making was that even if we ignore all the evidence that we can't, and assume that we could actually build a system reliable enough to preserve a petabyte for a century, we could not prove that we had done so. No matter how easy or hard you think a problem is, if it is impossible to prove that you have solved it, scepticism about proposed solutions is inevitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have to assume that, despite their best efforts, the Archive will over time lose some data. This isn't a problem for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Archive's collection is, fundamentally, a <em>sample</em> of cyberspace. Stuff missing is vastly more likely to be because it wasn't collected than because it was collected but subsequently lost.</li>
<li>Driving the already low probability of loss down further gets exponentially more expensive. The more of the Archive's limited resources is devoted to doing so, the less can be devoted to collecting and storing more stuff. Thus devoting more to eliminating data loss results in <em>less</em> data surviving.</li>
</ul>

Since at least <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2011/09/modeling-economics-of-long-term-storage.html">2011</a> I have written repeatedly about the fact that preserving data for the long term is and economic, not a technical problem. With a lavish budget it is simple; the smaller the budget the harder it gets. Li correctly points out that the Archive's budget, in the range of $25-30M/year, is vastly <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">lower than any comparable website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By owning its hardware, using the PetaBox high-density architecture, avoiding air conditioning costs, and using open-source software, the Archive achieves a storage cost efficiency that is orders of magnitude better than commercial cloud rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in making this point he uses a <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">flawed comparison</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the cost of storing 100 petabytes on Amazon S3. At standard rates (~<span class="math inline">\(0.021 per GB per month), the storage alone would cost over \)</span>2.1 million per month. The Internet Archive’s entire annual operating budget—for staff, buildings, legal defense, and hardware—is less than what it would cost to store their data on AWS for a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, Li ignores bandwidth charges, which as one of the most-visited sites on the Web would dwarf the storage charges. Second, Li compares S3, intended for and priced as instantly accessible, replicated data for the back-end of mission-critical online services, with the Archive's storage, intended for the long-term storage of data, most of which is accessed very rarely. Amazon has products aimed at this market. As an example, writing a Petabyte to Amazon Glacier, storing it for a decade, and then reading it out at last year's prices would <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html">cost just under $160K</a>. This too is a misleading comparison, Glacier is intended for <em>archival</em> data that has a much lower probability of access than the Archive's.</p>
<p>The key to making storage affordable is <em>tiering</em>, moving data that hasn't been accessed recently down the storage hierarchy to cheaper media. Kestutis Patiejunas gave an excellent talk about this back in 2014. I discussed it in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html"><em>More on Facebook's &quot;Cold Storage&quot;</em></a>. Facebook was in the happy position of having an extremely accurate model of the access patterns to each of the small number of data types they stored, so could do an very good job of matching the data to the performance of the layer in their storage hierarchy that held it. Their expectation was that the primary reason data in the lowest layer would be accessed was that it had been subpoenaed.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: AI is how bosses wage war on "professions" (20 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links AI is how bosses wage war on &quot;professions&quot;: The only people *required* to tell their bosses to fuck off. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Enshittification v VC; Byrne v DRM; Forger does it for the exposure; Beach trash hotel; Mafia nicknames; Longbow puzzle; NIMBYs; No one should be on the No-Fly list. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. AI is how bosses wage war on &quot;professions&quot; (permalink) Growing up, I assumed that being a &quot;professional&quot; meant that you were getting paid to do something. That's a perfectly valid definition (I still remember feeling like a &quot;pro&quot; the first time I got paid for my writing), but &quot;professional&quot; has another, far more important definition. In this other sense of the word, a &quot;professional&quot; is someone bound to a code of conduct that supersedes both the demands of their employer and the demands of the state. Think of a doctor's Hippocratic Oath: having sworn to &quot;first do no harm,&quot; a doctor is (literally) duty-bound to refuse orders to harm their patients. If a hospital administrator, a police officer or a judge orders a doctor to harm their patient, they are supposed to refuse. Indeed, depending on how you feel about oaths, they are required to refuse. There are many &quot;professions&quot; bound to codes of conduct, policed to a greater or lesser extent by &quot;colleges&quot; or other professional associations, many of which have the power to bar a member from the profession for &quot;professional misconduct.&quot; Think of lawyers, accountants, medical professionals, librarians, teachers, some engineers, etc. While all of these fields are very different in terms of the work they do, they share one important trait: they are all fields that AI bros swear will be replaced by chatbots in the near future. I find this an interesting phenomenon. It's clear to me that chatbots can't do these jobs. Sure, there are instances in which professionals may choose to make use of some AI tools, and I'm happy to stipulate that when a skilled professional chooses to use AI as an adjunct to their work, it might go well. This is in keeping with my theory that to the extent that AI is useful, it's when its user is a centaur (a person assisted by technology), but that employers dream of making AI's users into reverse centaurs (machines who are assisted by people): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington</a> A psychotherapist who uses AI to transcribe sessions so they can refresh their memory about an exact phrase while they're making notes is a centaur. A psychotherapist who monitors 20 chat sessions with LLM &quot;therapists&quot; in order to intervene if the LLM starts telling patients to kill themselves is a &quot;reverse centaur.&quot; This situation makes it impossible for them to truly help &quot;their&quot; patients; they are an &quot;accountability sink,&quot; installed to absorb the blame when a patient is harmed by the AI. Lawyers might use a chatbot to help them format a brief or transcribe a client meeting (centaur)- but when senior partners require their juniors and paralegals to write briefs at inhuman speed (reverse centaur), they are setting themselves up for briefs full of &quot;hallucinated&quot; citations: <a href="https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/">https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/</a> I hold a bedrock view that even though an AI can't do your job, an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete</a> But why are bosses such easy marks for these gabby AI hustlers? Partly, it's because an AI can probably do your boss's job – if 90% of your job is answering email and delegating tasks, and if you are richly rewarded for success but get to blame failure on your underlings, then, yeah, an AI can totally do that job. But I think there's an important psychological dimension to this: bosses are especially easy to trick with AI when they're being asked to believe that they can use AI to fire workers who are in a position to tell them to fuck off. That certainly explains why bosses are so thrilled by the prospect of swapping professionals for chatbots. What a relief it would be to fire everyone who is professionally required to tell you to fuck off when you want them to do stupid and/or dangerous things; so you could replace them with servile, groveling LLMs that punctuate their sentences with hymns to your vision and brilliance! This also explains why media bosses are so anxious to fire screenwriters and actors and replace them with AI. After all, you prompt an LLM in exactly the same way a clueless studio boss gives notes to a writers' room: &quot;Give me ET, but make it about a dog, give it a love interest, and put a car chase in Act III.&quot; The difference is that the writers will call you a clueless fucking suit and demand that you go back to your spreadsheets and stop bothering them while they're trying to make a movie, whereas the chatbot will cheerfully shit out a (terrible) script to spec. The fact that the script will suck is less important than the fact that swapping writers for LLMs will let studio bosses escape ego-shattering conflicts with empowered workers who actually know how to do things. It also explains why bosses are so anxious to replace programmers with chatbots. When programmers were scarce and valuable, they had to be lured into employment with luxurious benefits, lavish pay, and a collegial relationship with their bosses, where everyone was &quot;just an engineer.&quot; Tech companies had business-wide engineering meetings where techies were allowed to tell their bosses that they thought their technical and business strategies were stupid. Now that tech worker supply has caught up with demand, bosses are relishing the thought of firing these &quot;entitled&quot; coders and replacing them with chatbots overseen by traumatized reverse centaurs who will never, ever tell them to fuck off: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/05/ex-princes-of-labor/#hyper-criti-hype">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/05/ex-princes-of-labor/#hyper-criti-hype</a> And of course, this explains why bosses are so eager to use AI to replace workers who might unionize: drivers, factory workers, warehouse workers. For what is a union if not an institution that lets you tell your boss to fuck off? <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/conde-nast-fires-union-staffers-video/">https://www.thewrap.com/conde-nast-fires-union-staffers-video/</a> AI salesmen may be slick, but they're not that slick. Bosses are easy marks for anyone who dangles the promise of a world where everyone – human and machine – follows orders to the letter, and praises you for giving them such clever, clever orders.

      <p>Eighteen months ago, it was plausible that artificial intelligence might take a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/13/1089729/lets-not-make-the-same-mistakes-with-ai-that-we-made-with-social-media/">different path</a> than social media. Back then, AI’s development hadn’t consolidated under a small number of big tech firms. Nor had it capitalized on consumer attention, surveilling users and delivering ads.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the AI industry is now taking a page from the social media playbook and has set its sights on monetizing consumer attention. When OpenAI launched its <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT Search</a> feature in late 2024 and its browser, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">ChatGPT Atlas</a>, in October 2025, it kicked off a ...</p>

(date: 2026-01-20)

      <h1>2026-01-07 Discord IPO, again</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Chat platform Discord filed confidentially for an initial public offering in the United States, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/chat-platform-discord-confidentially-file-us-ipo-bloomberg-news-reports-2026-01-06/">Chat platform Discord files confidentially for US IPO, Bloomberg News reports</a>, by Prakhar Srivastava and Nathan Gomes, for Reuters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re in the position to host things for your friends, here’s what has worked for me and my friends.</p>
<p>Set up an <strong>IRC server</strong>. We used <a href="https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd">ngircd</a> because it can federate so now we have a little network of two servers. That’s good for resilience. There are more modern IRC servers but they don’t federate like that. If you don’t need federation, then by all means pick something new like <a href="https://ergo.chat/">Ergo</a>.</p>
<p>Set up a <strong>web app</strong> for your IRC server. Or more than one! Nobody has to know that it’s all IRC under the hood. The one I am using is <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>. I’ve set it up such that file uploads are allowed and I’ve set up a job on the server that deletes any uploads older than two weeks. Just to be a bit safer. If you set it up with accounts, then every user gets a log and therefore it’s always on. Nobody needs to mess around with IRC bouncers like znc and proxies like WeeChat. <a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is another option but it doesn’t allow file uploads. And all the IRC nerds can still use IRC clients and paste-bins, of course.</p>
<p>If you can, set up a <strong>Discord/IRC bridge</strong>. We run <a href="https://github.com/zachbr/Dis4IRC">Dis4IRC</a> to connect our servers. This is a bot that connects to both your Discord Server and your IRC server and sends messages back and forth. It looks ugly but it works. This allows a gradual transition. It makes sure that the backup plan works and nobody has to move immediately. But those who are curious can check it out and follow along.</p>
<p>Set up a <strong>video conference server</strong>. I use <a href="https://galene.org/">Galène</a>. It was much easier to set up than Jitsi.</p>
<p>None of these offer custom emoji, message editing, invite links, easily accessible roles and permissions, server management, etc. Things are going to be different. All of the proposed solutions work on my small virtual machine I’m renting. This was important to me, too.</p>
<p>(Related blog post from last year: <a href="2025-03-09-discord-ipo">2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>2026-01-20</strong>. <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@paco" title="@paco@infosec.exchange">@paco</a> writes that Discord outsourced their age verification to some vendor. Makes sense, it’s cost effective and age verification is mandatory in some jurisdictions. Remember the Online Safety Act in the UK? <a href="2025-08-28-online-safety">2025-08-28 Online safety, maybe</a>. The age verification service Discord used just had <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">a data beach</a> exposing photos of government IDs for 70,000 people. Sooner or later, this will happen if perfect security is impossible. And now we have to ask ourselves: Was this a good trade-off?</p>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <h1>2026-01-19 The Lounge for the elderly</h1>
<p><a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a> is a web app that acts as an always-on chat client for IRC. I use it all the time since I don’t have to understand how a “bouncer” like <code>znc</code> works to be always on, nor do I need to have a WeeChat proxy running somewhere.</p>
<p>I use it for our little network for role-playing game enthusiasts at <a href="https://grenzland.club/">Grenzland</a> as well as <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera Chat</a>, <a href="https://tilde.chat/">Tilde Chat</a> and two other, smaller IRC servers.</p>
<p>I use it on the phone, too. You can an “add it to the homescreen” and it works just fine. Until recently, I thought that the font-size was a problem, though. I’m over fifty and I like my text to be bigger these days. 😥</p>
<p>In The Lounge, click the cog wheel for Settings → Appearance and paste the following into the custom CSS at the bottom:</p>
<pre><code>.header .title,
.header .topic,
.messages .msg,
.userlist,
input {
  font-size: 16pt;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
.channel-list-item {
  font-size: 13pt;
  padding: 4px 7px;
}
.channel-list-item[data-type=&quot;lobby&quot;] {
  font-size: 14pt;
}
/* input box, specially when not expanded */
#form #input {
  font-size: 13pt;
  padding: 1pt 7px;
  height: 15pt;
}
/* unread message count */
.channel-list-item .badge {
  font-size: 12pt;
}
#settings .error, .window label, .window li, .window p {
    font-size: 14pt;
}
/* phones and the like */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    #context-menu, #form #input, #help .help-item, #loading, #settings .error, #sidebar .empty, .channel-list-item, .header .topic, .messages .msg, .textcomplete-menu, .window label {
        font-size: 15pt;
    }
}
/* long usernames */
#chat .from {
  width: 15ch;
}

</code></pre>
<p>It probably still needs some tweaking but it’s already much better.</p>
<p>Here is also where you can change the theme. The screenshot below uses the “Morning” theme, plus an earlier version of the font-size changes given above.</p>
<p><img src="2026-01-19-the-lounge-1.jpg" alt="A chat channel, with larger font-size and “Morning” theme, showing me, talking to lkh and norn, our bot."></p>

      <h1>2026-01-19 Grenzland</h1>
<p>For a while now we’ve been talking about <a href="2026-01-07-discord">moving our Discord server community to IRC</a>. I’ve been running a server, <a href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp">@kyonshi</a> has been running a server, we networked them, and so on. I really like how the use of <a href="2026-01-19-the-lounge">web apps like The Lounge</a> have been helping us get there.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://betola.de/wandererbill/">@wandererbill</a> has offered an old server he had running and handed out staff membership to a lot of us. And we started setting stuff up. A <a href="https://grenzland.club/">web site</a>, a <a href="https://wiki.grenzland.club/">wiki</a> (guess who did that…), a <a href="https://wiki.grenzland.club/view/mud">MUD</a>, another networked IRC server, a networked net news server. It has the vibe of a public access system (see <a href="https://github.com/cwmccabe/pubnixhist">pubnix history</a>), a <a href="https://tildeverse.org/">tildeverse</a> server or a <a href="https://sdfeu.org/w/">Super Dimensional Fortress</a> (SDF). You get an account, things feel retro, but they don’t take a lot of resources and it’s all human scale.</p>

      <h1>Music</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>What good is life without music.</p>
<p>But that’s impossible,</p>
<p>one
shuffle has always led to another.</p>
<p>One man hears it start on his
lathe,</p>
<p>a mother beats her eggs.</p>
<p>There’s a typewriter in the
next room.</p>
<p>Two cars are angry at each other.</p>
<p>The baby
downstairs is wet again.</p>
<p>I remember the voice of a dead
friend.</p>
<p>Everything speaks at the same time.</p>
<p>Music will watch
us drown.</p>
<p>I write letters to all those from whom I receive</p>
<p>and to many of
those from I don’t.</p>
<p>I read books, anything, useless piles of
random</p>
<p>isufferable rubbish for which, in my torpid panic,</p>
<p>I
fall through time and space each day</p>
<p>in my foolish way,
remembering only the present feeling,</p>
<p>not the village with its
face of death</p>
<p>nothing to be carried secretly in a car.</p>

      <h1>jordanhubbard/nanolang</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang">jordanhubbard/nanolang</a></strong></p>
<p>Plenty of people have mused about what a new programming language specifically designed to be used by LLMs might look like. Jordan Hubbard ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hubbard">co-founder of FreeBSD</a>, with serious stints at Apple and NVIDIA) just released exactly that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A minimal, LLM-friendly programming language with mandatory testing and unambiguous syntax.</p>
<p>NanoLang transpiles to C for native performance while providing a clean, modern syntax optimized for both human readability and AI code generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The syntax strikes me as an interesting mix between C, Lisp and Rust.</p>
<p>I decided to see if an LLM could produce working code in it directly, given the necessary context. I started with this <a href="https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang/blob/main/MEMORY.md">MEMORY.md</a> file, which begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This file is designed specifically for Large Language Model consumption. It contains the essential knowledge needed to generate, debug, and understand NanoLang code. Pair this with <code>spec.json</code> for complete language coverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran that using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m claude-opus-4.5 \
  -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang/refs/heads/main/MEMORY.md \
  'Build me a mandelbrot fractal CLI tool in this language'
  &gt; /tmp/fractal.nano

</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7847f022566d11629ec2139f1d109fb8#mandelbrot-fractal-cli-tool-in-nano">resulting code</a>... <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7847f022566d11629ec2139f1d109fb8?permalink_comment_id=5947465#gistcomment-5947465">did not compile</a>.</p>
<p>I may have been too optimistic expecting a one-shot working program for a new language like this. So I ran a clone of the actual project, copied in my program and had Claude Code take a look at the failing compiler output.</p>
<p>... and it worked! Claude happily grepped its way through the various <code>examples/</code> and built me a working program.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?9696da6882cb6596be6a9d5196e8a7a5/index.html">the Claude Code transcript</a> - you can see it <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?9696da6882cb6596be6a9d5196e8a7a5/page-001.html#msg-2026-01-19T23-43-09-675Z">reading relevant examples here</a> - and here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/e7f3577adcfd392ab7fa23b1295d00f2">the finished code plus its output</a>.</p>
<p>I've suspected <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/7/llms-for-new-programming-languages/">for a while</a> that LLMs and coding agents might significantly reduce the friction involved in launching a new language. This result reinforces my opinion.</p>

      <h1>Review: Django Views — The Right Way</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>I finally set aside some time to read Django Views — The Right Way. Luke Plant makes a very persuasive argument for view functions (FBV) - especially about their being more explicit especially when it comes to the transparency of passing request into each view function. He is quite negative about class-based views (CBV). I kind of agree about CBVs hiding details and making it harder to know what to change. I would be lost without the Classy Class-Based Views site but Luke’s critiques are more about CBVs creating layers of indirection and actually introducing extra boilerplate as compared to FBVs.</p>

      <p>If Trump declares that the U.S. is laying claim to all of the green cheese on the moon — say, to lower the price of dairy groceries — the news media should not respond with fact-finding articles with headlines like “How Much Cheese Is on the Moon?” They should respond with headlines like “How Many Marbles Are Left in Trump’s Head?”</p>

      <p>I took a couple of falls on ice the other day, during one of the many snowstorms we've had, and both times my watch, after a polite pause, shook my wrist, asking if I just took a fall and should it call in an emergency? if you don't do anything it makes the call. In that sense, your watch could beep when someone is gaslighting the other person. If it was you gaslighting them you'd see your avatar on the screen. Of it's them, you can show it to them.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Social media without socializing (19 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Social media without socializing: For Zuck, your friends are a problem to be solved. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: &quot;Among Others&quot;; Vagina tea-balls; MLK was a socialist; Planet Money's free Gatsby audiobook; Bounty for wiretapping lefty profs; Poe's graveside ritual; Sleep Mafia; Whence came tarps; GM's Dieslgate; NRO's octopus; Amazon solidarity; Billionaire-proofing the internet. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Social media without socializing (permalink) From the earliest days of social media, social media bosses have been at war with sociability. To create a social media service is to demarcate legitimate and illegitimate forms of sociability. It's a monumental act of hubris, really. It was ever thus. The founder of Friendster decreed that people could only form friendship bonds with each other, but could not declare themselves to be &quot;friends&quot; of everyone with a common interest. You and I could be friends, but you couldn't be &quot;friends&quot; with a group called &quot;bloggers.&quot; Each member of that group would have to create a reciprocal friendship link to see one another's feeds. Way back in 1999, Larry Lessig taught us that &quot;code is law.&quot; By encoding these restrictions into the feed, Friendster's programmers were putting limits on the kinds of relationships that could be formed using the service. But Lessig's law (code?) is often overidden by an even older principle: William Gibson's 1982 maxim that &quot;the street finds its own uses for things.&quot; Friendster told its users how to be friends with one another, and Friendster's users treated Friendster's management as damage and routed around it. They created accounts with names like &quot;New York City&quot; and whenever anyone friended that account, it friended them back. Users hacked their own way to form &quot;illegitimate&quot; friendships based on affinity into the system: <a href="https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2003/08/17/the">https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2003/08/17/the</a>_fakester_manifesto.html As social media turned into a billion- (and then a trillion-) dollar business, the urgency of the struggle between how social media bosses demanded that we socialize and how we wanted to socialize only got sharper. Mark Zuckerberg doubtless thought he was covering all his bases when he tossed a casual &quot;It's complicated&quot; to the pulldown menu for defining your relationship status, but that's because he doesn't understand how complicated all our relationships are: <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/07/10/facebook-complicated-relationship-status/">https://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/07/10/facebook-complicated-relationship-status/</a> For Zuck, crisply defined relationships were things that he could do simple math on in order to target ads, make recommendations, and sort users into categories. When you need to treat relationships as elements in a series of discrete mathematical operations, the fact that relationships are intrinsically, irreducibly qualitative is a serious bug. So Zuck did what computer scientists usually do when they want to do math on qualitative variables: he incinerated all the qualitative elements by quantizing them, and then did math on the dubious residue that remained: <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-qualia/">https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-qualia/</a> Zuck's biggest problem isn't the ambiguity of your social connections, though – it's that they exist at all. Think about it: Mark Zuckerberg personally makes or loses billions of dollars based on how much you socialize with your friends on his platforms. If your friends engage with you in ways that are low intensity and easily concluded (&quot;How'd you sleep?&quot; &quot;Just fine.&quot; &quot;That's nice.&quot;), then he loses. If, on the other hand, you and your friends get into protracted, intense interactions, he gets to show you so many ads and make so much money. Your friends are a problem for Mark Zuckerberg to solve, and (to his undying chagrin), you and your friends stubbornly refuse to organize your relationships around Zuck's financial imperatives. You just wanna hang out in the rhythms that are part of any friendship – sometimes intense, sometimes casual, often sporadic. I mean, honestly, if you're going to insist on just having normal friendships, how the hell can Mark Zuckerberg post the kind of growth his shareholders expect? This explains much of the drive to transform Facebook from a platform that shows you the things your friends post to a platform that mostly shows you things that &quot;content creators&quot; post. Your friends aren't motivated by the dangling possibility of viral dollars if they get you to &quot;engage&quot; with their posts, but for content creators, your engagement buys the groceries and pays the rent. By swapping out your friends and replacing them with people who are highly motivated to &quot;engage&quot; with you, Zuck gets a lever he can yank to get his users to arrange their conduct in ways that goose his growth. In other words, Zuck lured you in with the promise of having pleasurable online conversations that matter to you; and now that he's trapped you, he wants you to break up with your friends so you have more time to watch his community access cable station. It also explains Zuck's passion for filling his platform with botshit, and his plan to solve the loneliness epidemic by giving you chatbots instead of friends: <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/26/mark-zuckerberg-ai-friends-hinge-ceo/">https://fortune.com/2025/06/26/mark-zuckerberg-ai-friends-hinge-ceo/</a> For Mark Zuckerberg, all people are just shitty chatbots – chatbots that won't follow orders. He wants to be able to point us at one another in the hopes that we will simply prompt one another into endless chatter, with endless scrolling, and endless ad insertions. This works great with chatbots, not so well with people: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNagNezo8w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNagNezo8w</a> After all, Zuck doesn't really believe most other people exist. Read Careless People, Sarah Wynn-Williams's tell-all whistleblower memoir about her years at Facebook and you'll quickly realize that for Zuck, people are statistical artifacts, not co-equal beings worthy of moral consideration: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf</a> Billionaires are plagued by solipsism. Not believing other people exist is a great aid to billionairedom, because it lets you amass your fortune without scrupling over the population-scale misery you're inflicting on the way: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs</a> For Zuck, AI is the most exciting technology in history (even more exciting than the Metaverse, if you can believe it!) because it might give him the world he dreams of: a world without people, or, at very least, a social media network without any socializing: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism</a> Hey look at this (permalink) Congress Wants To Hand Your Parenting to Big Tech <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/congress-wants-hand-your-parenting-big-tech">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/congress-wants-hand-your-parenting-big-tech</a> AI companies will fail.

BTW we need some technical terminology for socializing online. When I reply to a post, what do we call the post I'm replying to?

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/09/14/bucky.png" alt="">First, glad I wrote the political blog post <a href="http://scripting.com/2026/01/18.html#a180328">yesterday</a>. Enough is enough. I love Minnesota. I want to wear a Minnesota baseball cap today. I want to fly a Minnesota flag on my front lawn. And I want Congress to do their job and put a stop to this bullshit before Trump sends the US army into Minneapolis, putting our fine American soldiers in an intolerable place, to refuse to obey an order because it's obviously wrong. What Congress can do is make it an <em>illegal</em> order. Take the burden off the miltary.</p>
<p>Did you know I can speak in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uff_da">uff-da</a> accent? Brought to you by three wonderful years in Wisconsin at the UW in Madison. Fuck em Bucky!</p>
<p>Now, I've been on a project to get my eating habits down for more weight loss and better health. I have Facebook reels to thank for that. I've been listening to all the science and advice about keeping your bloodstream sugar from spiking while still eating well. And the more I listen to the advice, the more advice I get.</p>
<p>I love eating a bowl of oatmeal in the morning with some crushed walnuts, butter, raisins, and after it's cooked for five minutes in the microwave, some fresh berries mixed in. But I figured this isn't good. I've been taught that a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LS1rYqGFcMg">savory breakfast</a> is better. So I had a two-egg omelet with melted cheese and half an english muffin with butter. I couldn't even finish the muffin. I feel full. And I'm drinking my coffee made with my Kuerig.</p>
<p>It was a rough night last night. I'm so exhausted with feeling the whole world crumbling around us. Trump wants to take us back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)">Robber Baron</a> America of the 19th century. I hear that sucked. We have to get together and say out loud everywhere this is not cool. Democrats and Republicans in Congress, we elected you to check this kind of bullshit. If you don't do your jobs, Senators and Representatives -- we're going to vote you out next chance we get, I don't care if you're a Democrat.</p>
<p>The Democrats have a great opportunity now, I hear, to put an end to ICE. Do it, or else you're history, politically. You can't have a career going forward if you're on the wrong side of this one.</p>
<p>And btw, proof that life goes on -- I am so sick of snow. It had to come on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States">holiday weekend</a> when there's no point trying to go skiing because the lift lines and crowds on the slope take all the fun out of it. And this is great skiing snow, light and fluffy. I hope some of it is still around later in the week.</p>

      <h1>Trad travels</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>For the past few years, I’ve been <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22166">taking a trip to Spain</a> at the end of September for the <a href="https://www.irishfleadh.com/">Cáceres Irish Fleadh</a>. Last year I convinced my friends Liam and Monica to come along and they had a great time.</p>
<p>Like me, Liam just loves playing in sessions. Also like me, Liam likes to spend the gloomy short days of January thinking about travelling somewhere …and then playing in sessions there.</p>
<p>I told him I’d put together a list of potential trips for the discerning session hound. I figured I might as well share it here too…</p>
<p>First of all, there are Irish music festivals. Alas, most festivals don’t happen in the sunny climes of Spain. As you’d expect, most of them are in Ireland.</p>
<p>I’m heading to Carlingford at the end of this month for a weekend of <a href="https://www.feilenatana.com/">Féile na Tána</a>. I haven’t been before but it looks good. There’ll be the usual amalgam of workshops, concerts, and sessions.</p>
<p>Myself and <a href="https://wordridden.com/">Jessica</a> will fly in to Belfast, then take the train down to Newry and get to Carlingford from there. You could fly into Dublin and get the train up to Dundalk, but the only Gatwick flights to Dublin are Ryan Air, and I’d rather entrust my instrument to EasyJet.</p>
<p>At the end of March we’re heading to <a href="https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/">Tullamore Trad Fest</a>. That’s another one we haven’t been to before. Again, there’ll be workshops, concerts, and sessions.</p>
<p>Tullamore is just an hour away from Dublin by train and has plenty of accommodation options. We’ve booked into <a href="https://www.seadewhouse.com/">a nice-looking B&amp;B</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no avoiding Ryan Air for this trip and I want to take my good mandolin, so I’ve gone ahead and <a href="https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/articles/12889013645713-What-music-equipment-can-I-bring-on-board">booked a separate seat</a> for it. I don’t want to take any chances with an airline that actively seeks to elevate misery.</p>
<p>The festival I heartily recommend is <a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">Belfast Trad Fest</a> at the end of July. It’s super convenient to get to with EasyJet flights from Gatwick—go to Belfast <em>city</em> airport, which is right downtown.</p>
<p>The festival offers a really good accommodation deal in modern student flats. The workshops are top-notch, and best of all, it has a really well-organised session trail. You can easily play in sessions all afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>This year, for the first time ever, Belfast trad fest is immediately followed by <a href="https://fleadhcheoil.ie/">the all-Ireland fleadh</a>, which promises to be pandemonium. I’ve never been to the fleadh before but I’m going to stick around Belfast for it.</p>
<p>You could head to the <a href="https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/">Willie Clancy Festival</a> in Miltown Malbay at the start of July (the website seems to be having some issues right now). But good luck finding accommodation. The event is so big now that unless you’re camping, there’s not much chance of finding a place to stay. If you make it there though, non-stop sessions await. Non-stop chaos awaits too. That’s part of the deal. Great workshops though!</p>
<p>There are other festivals I haven’t been to but I’ve heard great things about. <a href="https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/">The Pádraig O’Keeffe Festival</a> in Kerry in October sounds fantastic, especially if you like your polkas and slides. But it’s in Castleisland, which doesn’t have much in the way of accommodation. So unless you’ve got transport, it’s going to be tricky.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://kilkennytradfest.com/">a trad fest in Kilkenny in March</a>. I’ve never been but they’ve got a session trail. You’d need to fly into either Dublin or Cork and then get on a bus. Either way, it’s Ryan Air from Gatwick.</p>
<p>I’ve also never been to the <a href="https://ennistradfest.com/">Ennis Trad Fest</a> in county Clare in November but I’ve heard good things. Accommodation for the 2026 event is already in short supply though.</p>
<p>But you don’t need a festival to play in sessions. In fact, the kind of sessions you end up in at festivals have a different vibe to the usual sessions, simply because they’re formed of a hodge-podge of visiting players.</p>
<p>There a few spots in Ireland where you’re guaranteed a session pretty much any night of the week.</p>
<p>I love Galway. There are afternoon sessions in Taafe’s and Tigh Cóilí as well as evening sessions in the Crane and other places. You’d need to fly into Dublin and get the train from there. It takes about two hours.</p>
<p>Galway is busy in the summer time and accommodation can be pricy, but if you go off-season you can find some cheaper options.</p>
<p>Ennis has <a href="https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland">music most nights</a>. There’s a regular bus service between Ennis and Shannon airport that’s nice and quick. You’d need to fly Ryan Air from Gatwick though.</p>
<p>And then there’s Belfast again. Even when the trad fest isn’t happening, Belfast has sessions seven nights a week. Check out the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/belfastsessionguide/">Belfast session guide Instagram account</a> for up-to-date details.</p>
<p>I recommend staying in <a href="https://www.theflintbelfast.com/">The Flint</a>, but make sure you ask for a room on the top floor far away from the nightclub if you’re there on a weekend.</p>
<p>So, to recap, here are some festivals to check out:</p>

      <h1>Scaling long-running autonomous coding</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents">Scaling long-running autonomous coding</a></strong></p>
<p>Wilson Lin at Cursor has been doing some experiments to see how far you can push a large fleet of &quot;autonomous&quot; coding agents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This post describes what we've learned from running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work, and watching them write over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They ended up running planners and sub-planners to create tasks, then having workers execute on those tasks - similar to how Claude Code uses sub-agents. Each cycle ended with a judge agent deciding if the project was completed or not.</p>
<p>In my predictions for 2026 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-someone-will-build-a-new-browser-using-mainly-ai-assisted-coding-and-it-won-t-even-be-a-surprise">the other day</a> I said that by 2029:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won’t even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine[...] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it’ll get so much easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may have been off by three years, because Cursor chose &quot;building a web browser from scratch&quot; as their test case for their agent swarm approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender">the source code on GitHub</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how well did they do? Their initial announcement a couple of days ago was met with <a href="https://embedding-shapes.github.io/cursor-implied-success-without-evidence/">unsurprising skepticism</a>, especially when it became apparent that their GitHub Actions CI was failing and there were no build instructions in the repo.</p>
<p>It looks like they addressed that within the past 24 hours. The <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/blob/main/README.md#build-requirements">latest README</a> includes build instructions which I followed on macOS like this:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender
cd fastrender
git submodule update --init vendor/ecma-rs
cargo run --release --features browser_ui --bin browser

</code></pre>
<p>This got me a working browser window! Here are screenshots I took of google.com and my own website:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/cursor-google.png" alt="The browser chrome is neat but has a garbled tab name at the top. The Google homepage looks mostly correct but the buttons are not styled correctly and the Google Search one has a huge plus icon floating near it."></p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/cursor-simonwillison.jpg" alt="My blog looks mostly correct, but the right closing quotation mark on a quotation (which is implemented as a background image on the final paragraph) is displayed incorrectly multiple times."></p>
<p>Honestly those are very impressive! You can tell they're not just wrapping an existing rendering engine because of those very obvious rendering glitches, but the pages are legible and look mostly correct.</p>
<p>The FastRender repo even uses Git submodules <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/tree/main/specs">to include various WhatWG and CSS-WG specifications</a> in the repo, which is a smart way to make sure the agents have access to the reference materials that they might need.</p>
<p>This is the second attempt I've seen at building a full web browser using AI-assisted coding in the past two weeks - the first was <a href="https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave">HiWave browser</a>, a new browser engine in Rust first announced <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1q4xfm0/over_christmas_break_i_wrote_a_fully_functional/">in this Reddit thread</a>.</p>
<p>When I made my 2029 prediction this is more-or-less the quality of result I had in mind. I don't think we'll see projects of this nature compete with Chrome or Firefox or WebKit any time soon but I have to admit I'm very surprised to see something this capable emerge so quickly.</p>

      <h1>GSoC 2025: Advanced symbol resolution for Clang-Repl</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello! I’m Sahil Patidar, and this summer I had the opportunity to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 with the LLVM Organization.My project focused on enhancing ORC-JIT and <code>Clang-Repl</code> by introducing a new feature for advanced symbol resolution, aimed at improving runtime symbol handling and flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Mentors</strong>: Vassil Vassilev, Aaron Jomy</p>
<h2>Overview of the Project</h2>
<p><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangRepl.html">Clang-Repl</a> is an interactive C++ interpreter built on top of LLVM’s ORC JIT, enabling incremental compilation and execution.However, when user code references symbols from external libraries, those libraries must currently be loaded manually. This happens because ORC JIT does not automatically resolve symbols from libraries that haven’t been loaded yet.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, my project introduces an automatic library resolver for unresolved symbols in ORC JIT, improving Clang-Repl’s runtime by making external symbol handling seamless and user-friendly.</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of my project was to design and implement a new Library-Resolution API for ORC-JIT.This API acts as a smart symbol resolver — when ORC-JIT encounters an unresolved symbol, it can call this API to find where the symbol exists and which library provides it.</p>
<p>The next step is to integrate this API into ORC-JIT, so that <code>Clang-Repl</code> can automatically use it to handle missing symbols without requiring manual library loading.</p>
<h2>Library-Resolution: Smarter Symbol Resolver</h2>
<p>During my GSoC project, one of the major components I worked on was Library-Resolution — an API we re-designed and re-implemented based on Cling’s original library-resolver.</p>
<p>In simple terms, Library-Resolution acts as a smart library resolver.It doesn’t actually load libraries — instead, it finds where the missing symbols (unresolved references) can be found and provides their correct library paths.</p>
<p>This makes it a powerful helper when dealing with unresolved symbols during execution.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>When system (Orc-JIT or any) encounters an unresolved symbol, system can call the resolver to find symbols that not found.It scans through user-provided library paths, checks potential matches, and identifies the libraries that contain the missing symbols — all without directly loading them.</p>
<p>At the heart of this system is the <code>LibraryResolver</code>, which runs the resolution process by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scanning available libraries.</li>
<li>Filtering symbols efficiently using Bloom filters.</li>
<li>Matching unresolved symbols through a <code>SymbolQuery</code> tracker.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result: symbols are mapped to their correct library paths, and system can continue execution seamlessly.</p>
<h3>Core Components Overview</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the key components that make Library-Resolution work:</p>
<h4>1. LibraryResolver</h4>
<p>The main coordinator that controls the entire flow — from scanning libraries to managing symbol lookups.It ensures that unresolved symbols are systematically matched to libraries.</p>
<h4>2. LibraryScanner</h4>
<p>Handles the actual scanning of directories and library paths.It detects valid shared libraries and registers them with the <code>LibraryManager</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LibraryScanHelper</strong> → Keeps track of directories that need to be scanned.</li>
<li><strong>LibrarySearchPath</strong> → Represents a directory and its type (User/System) along with its current scan state.</li>
<li><strong>PathResolver</strong> → Normalizes and resolves file paths efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>LibraryPathCache</strong> → Stores already-resolved paths and symbolic links to prevent repeated filesystem checks.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. LibraryManager</h4>
<p>Maintains metadata about all discovered libraries.Each library is represented by a <code>LibraryInfo</code> object containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library path</li>
<li>Load status (loaded or not)</li>
<li>A <strong>Bloom filter</strong> for fast symbol existence checks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Symbol Resolution Flow</h3>
<p>Here’s how everything fits together in the resolution process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start</strong>: The process begins with a list of unresolved symbols, passed to the <code>LibraryResolver</code> to create a <code>SymbolQuery</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Scan</strong>: The resolver scans user and system library paths to find new or unregistered libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Cache &amp; Filter</strong>: For each library, if it doesn’t yet have a Bloom filter, one is created to enable faster lookups in future scans.</li>
<li><strong>Match</strong>: Each unresolved symbol is tested against these filters. If a likely match is found and verified, the symbol is linked to that library’s path.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>: This continues until all symbols are resolved or no more valid libraries remain.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong>: The results are returned through a completion callback.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Summary of accomplished tasks</h2>
<h3>ExecutorResolver:</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/143654">143654</a> suggested by @lhames.we introduced a <code>DylibSymbolResolver</code> that helps resolve symbols for each loaded dylib.</p>
<p>Previously, we returned a DylibHandle to the controller. Now, we wrap the native handle inside <code>DylibSymbolResolver</code> and return a <code>ResolverHandle</code> instead. This makes the code cleaner and separates the symbol resolution logic from raw handle management.</p>
<p>with this changes this will help us to integrate LibraryResolver API using some future through new <code>AutoDylibResolver</code>.</p>
<h3>Library-Resolver API:</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/165360">#165360</a></p>
<p>This is the main API we redesigned based on cling auto library-resolver. this api provide way to user to add search-path and ask for symbols to search and provide resolved library for each symbols.</p>
<h2>Result: What the Library-Resolution API Enables</h2>
<p>With these updates, we now have a fully functional Library-Resolution API that can dynamically resolve missing symbols to their correct shared libraries — all without loading the libraries directly.</p>
<p>This new system can <strong>discover</strong>, <strong>query</strong>, and <strong>match</strong> unresolved symbols across user and system paths, providing the exact library paths where those symbols exist. It serves as a powerful helper for ORC-JIT and Clang-Repl’s runtime infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here’s a short example showing how the API can be configured and used to trigger the resolution process:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::Setup S = llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::Setup::create({});// Define a callback that decides whether a library should be scannedS.ShouldScanCall = [&amp;](llvm::StringRef lib) -&gt; bool { return true; };// Create the driver that coordinates the resolutionController = llvm::orc::LibraryResolutionDriver::create(S);// Add user and system library paths to be scannedfor (const auto &amp;SP : SearchPaths) Controller-&gt;addScanPath(SP, llvm::orc::PathType::User);// Prepare the symbols to be resolvedstd::vector&lt;std::string&gt; Sym;Sym.push_back(MangledName);// Configure resolution policyllvm::orc::SearchConfig Config;Config.Policy = { {{llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Queried, llvm::orc::PathType::User}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Unloaded, llvm::orc::PathType::User}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Queried, llvm::orc::PathType::System}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Unloaded, llvm::orc::PathType::System}}};Config.Options.FilterFlags = llvm::orc::SymbolEnumeratorOptions::IgnoreUndefined;// Run the symbol resolutionController-&gt;resolveSymbols( Sym, [&amp;](llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::SymbolQuery &amp;Q) { if (auto S = Q.getResolvedLib(MangledName)) Res = *S; }, Config);
</code></pre>
<h2>Additional Improvements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post describes ongoing design work. The implementation is still under review and may evolve as feedback is incorporated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this phase, I worked on value-printing support for both <strong>in-process</strong> and <strong>out-of-process</strong> execution in <code>Clang-Repl</code>.Previously, <code>Clang-Repl</code> only supported value printing in the in-process mode, and the same implementation couldn’t be directly applied to the out-of-process case.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Dependency on type information</strong></p>
<p>The value-printing logic depends on the type information of the JIT-compiled expression result to correctly interpret and cast the result into a <code>Value</code> object.In the in-process setup, this is straightforward — process symbols such as <code>__clang_interpreter*</code>, which are used to capture the result at runtime along with its type information, reside within the controller. This allows the call to use pointer type information directly to interpret the resulting value correctly.However, in the out-of-process setup, those symbols exist in the controller, while the actual evaluated result resides in the executor. Even if we set up the runtime call in the executor, we still need to access the type information that remains on the controller side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No direct executor-to-controller calls</strong></p>
<p>In the out-of-process model, we cannot directly invoke controller-side functions from the JIT-compiled code running in the executor. This limitation made the previous mechanism unsuitable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Approach (Initial design — under review)</h3>
<p><strong>Pull Request:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/156649">#156649</a></p>
<p>We reimplemented the value-printing infrastructure on top of the ORC MemoryAccess API.The old design supported only in-process evaluation; the new design works in both in-process and out-of-process environments.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Capturing the JIT Expression Result</strong></p>
<p>With the new design, we adopted a different approach:we now take the address of the evaluated JIT expression result and pass it to a runtime call.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">EXTERN_C void __clang_Interpreter_SendResultValue(void *Ctx, unsigned long long, void *);// In-process: Ctx is a pointer to the ValueResultManager object, // allowing us to call ValueResultManager::deliverResult.EXTERN_C void __orc_rt_SendResultValue(unsigned long long, void *);// Out-of-process version.
</code></pre>
<p>At the AST level, we perform the necessary transformations to insert this runtime call.When adding the runtime “sugar” call to the expression AST, the expression must be an lvalue, so we can safely cast it to a <code>void*</code> and pass it to the runtime helper.</p>
<p>If the expression is already an lvalue, we simply cast and pass its address directly.If it’s an rvalue, we modify the AST to convert it into an lvalue, ensuring it can be handled uniformly by the runtime call added to the expression AST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking results via <code>ValueResultManager</code></strong></p>
<p>We introduced a new helper, <code>ValueResultManager</code>, which tracks upcoming expression results using a unique <code>Expr ID -&gt; TypeInfo</code> mapping.The expression’s runtime call includes this ID, which is later returned to the controller-side handler when the executor reports back.</p>
<p><strong>Executor runtime call example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">RC_RT_JIT_DISPATCH_TAG(__orc_rt_SendResultValue_tag)ORC_RT_INTERFACE void __orc_rt_SendResultValue(uint64_t ResultId, void *V) { Error OptErr = Error::success(); if (auto Err = WrapperFunction&lt;SPSError(uint64_t, SPSExecutorAddr)&gt;::call( JITDispatch(&amp;__orc_rt_SendResultValue_tag), OptErr, ResultId, ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(V))) { cantFail(std::move(OptErr)); cantFail(std::move(Err)); } consumeError(std::move(OptErr));}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Controller-side runtime call for in-process:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">REPL_EXTERNAL_VISIBILITY void__clang_Interpreter_SendResultValue(void *Ctx, uint64_t Id, void *Addr) { static_cast&lt;ValueResultManager *&gt;(Ctx)-&gt;deliverResult( [](llvm::Error Err) { llvm::cantFail(std::move(Err)); }, Id, llvm::orc::ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(Addr));}
</code></pre>
<p>This mechanism allows both in-process and out-of-process environments to deliver evaluated result addresses to <code>ValueResultManager::deliverResult</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading and formatting values</strong></p>
<p>On receiving the address, the <code>ValueResultManager</code> calls into a <code>ValueReaderDispatcher</code>, which uses <strong>MemoryAccess</strong> to read values from memory using the address and type information.The evaluated data is then wrapped in a redesigned <code>Value</code> class and finally converted to a string via a <code>ValueToString</code> printer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>New <code>Value</code> class design</h3>
<p>The new <code>Value</code> implementation is inspired by <code>APValue</code> and designed to handle both local and remote execution enviroment.</p>
<p>Key improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports array element store and access by index.</li>
<li>Works safely in out-of-process mode — the old design, which assumed arrays lived in controller-side memory (invalid in remote execution).</li>
<li>Provides a unified way to represent, store, and print evaluated results across environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other PRs</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/166510">166510</a> <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/166147">166147</a></p>
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>The next step will be to continue development on the ORC-JIT side, aligned with the ongoing evolution of the Executor layer.Once the new Executor design stabilizes, we’ll revisit the Library-Resolution API and make any necessary adjustments for compatibility and cleaner integration.This work will be done under the guidance of Lang Hames, ensuring it fits well within the evolving ORC architecture.</p>
<p>The next phase of this project focuses on integrating the Library-Resolution API into ORC-JIT.Specifically, we plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduce the AutoDylibResolver</strong> — based on the groundwork implemented in the <em>ExecutorResolver</em> pull request.This component will allow ORC-JIT to automatically invoke the Library-Resolution API whenever it encounters an unresolved symbol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable automatic library loading</strong> in ORC-JIT.Once integrated, ORC-JIT (and tools like <code>Clang-Repl</code>) will be able to automatically locate and load the required libraries during runtime — removing the need for users to manually load them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This next step will complete the feature chain — from symbol detection to automatic library resolution and loading — making <code>Clang-Repl</code> more user-friendly.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through this project, we now have a working Library-Resolver API implementation in ORC-JIT.Moving forward, the focus will be on integrating this API into ORC-JIT to enable automatic library loading and further improve <code>Clang-Repl</code> and other projects that use ORC-JIT as their execution engine.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c">FLUX.2-klein-4B Pure C Implementation</a></strong></p>
<p>On 15th January Black Forest Labs, a lab formed by the creators of the original Stable Diffusion, released <a href="https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B">black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B</a> - an Apache 2.0 licensed 4 billion parameter version of their FLUX.2 family.</p>
<p>Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez) decided to build a pure C and dependency-free implementation to run the model, with assistance from Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5.</p>
<p>Salvatore shared <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670279#46671233">this note</a> on Hacker News:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something that may be interesting for the reader of this thread: this project was possible only once I started to tell Opus that it <em>needed</em> to take a file with all the implementation notes, and also accumulating all the things we discovered during the development process. And also, the file had clear instructions to be taken updated, and to be processed ASAP after context compaction. This kinda enabled Opus to do such a big coding task in a reasonable amount of time without loosing track. Check the file IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md in the GitHub repo for more info.</p>

      <h1>Easy Measures Doing, Simple Measures Understanding</h1>

(date: 2026-01-18)
      <p>
      <p>In <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2026-01-18T2051">his talk</a>, I like the way Jake Nations pits easy vs. simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Easy means you can add it to your system quickly. Simple means you can understand the work that you’ve done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this framing.</p>
<p>Easy means you can do with little effort.</p>
<p>Simple means you can understand what you do with little effort.</p>
<p>In other words: easy measures the effort in doing, while simple measures the effort in understanding the doing.</p>
<p>For example: <code>npm create framework@latest</code> or “Hey AI, build an instagram clone”. These both get you a website with little effort (easy) but do you understand what you just did (simple)?</p>
<p><a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2016-11-18T1230">It’s easy to get complexity</a>, but it’s not easy to get simplicity.</p>
<p>(I get this is arguing semantics and definitions, but I find it to be a useful framing personally. Thanks Jake!)</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png" alt="">I've been trying to stay out of politics here lately (did you notice), but I don't get how Americans, no matter who they voted for, can watch what's happening in Minneapolis and not feel like we have to protect the people there from the thugs who are attacking them. And of course that's exactly how we're supposed to feel. I watched a video of a woman, a disabled army veteran, being dragged from her car by the ICEs, and hearing cop car sirens in the background, imagining, hoping -- they were coming to stop the attack. We never did find out. How can you stand for this if you're an American. Forget about Democrats or Republicans, what about you? Where did you learn to ignore the feelings you must have when you see people, fellow human beings, attacked with such cruelty? Snap out of it, if you have any empathy left, or any love for our country. Tell your representatives to step in and stop this, and no excuses, Democrat or Republican, I don't care.</p>

      <h1>The best version of my site so far...</h1>

(date: 2026-01-18)
      <p>
      <p>You might have noticed that I did a big design refresh on my entire site… unless you’re on RSS I guess. I’ll talk about aspects in detail, but at a high level there’s been three big changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A monospace font</li>
<li>Named CSS grid lines</li>
<li>Juicier multi-page view transitions</li>
</ol>
<p>But my most favorite part is that today (when you set <code>html { --hue-rotate: 15 }</code>), my light theme looks like a stick of butter. And that brings me joy.</p>
<h2>What didn’t change</h2>
<p>Before I talk about what changed, here’s a quick list of the parts of my site that didn’t change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same big “Dave” SVG on the homepage</li>
<li>Same information architecture, no radical content changes.</li>
<li>No new assets, same visuals.</li>
<li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/color-hue-rotating-gaslight/">hue-rotating background</a>, although I did simplify the formula.</li>
<li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/06/fittext-too-attr-boogaloo/">inverse text-sizing</a> for H1s</li>
<li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/01/art-direction-for-static-sites/">support for art-directed posts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Why change the parts you’re happy with, eh? Knowing what you want to change versus what you don’t want to change makes the whole process go faster.</p>
<h2>All-in on a monospace font</h2>
<p>My type system always falls apart. I start with a good setup and I’m guaranteed to ruin it over time. Whenever I read a site with a nice typeface and reasonable CPL, I started to feel like my <code>system-ui</code> based body text styles were letting me down. It didn’t feel cozy.</p>
<p>Then I saw <a href="https://robinrendle.com/">Robin Rendle</a>’s latest redesign (which is wonderful, btw) I wondered… Could I be a <code>monospace</code> font guy? Is that me? Do I identify as that? Is it too emo? Does it come off as a bad developer pun like <code>bleep blorp I'm a programmer and using a computer bleep blorp</code>?</p>
<p>All good questions to ask myself and exposes some insecurity I have, but I couldn’t shake the idea so I went for it.</p>
<p>The entire site is now set in <code>Cascadia Mono</code> which is a variant of Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-mono">Cascadia Code</a>. That decision is unintentionally on-brand for my current stage of life. Initially I wanted to use <a href="https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> by Raph Levien, but it didn’t have a “numero” (№) symbol – which is a common missing glyph in a lot of indie fonts – and is an unfortunate piece of critical typographical infrastructure with my <a href="https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck">vibechecks</a>.</p>
<p>In general I love the change. It feels very “me” right now. I worry about the readability of monospace fonts some, but I don’t think I was winning the Legibility Wars before.</p>
<h2>Naming my grid lines</h2>
<p>Improving the grid on my site is something I’ve wanted to do for nearly two years. The max-width container I had was fine before, but I relied a lot on <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/03/full-bleed-with-not/">margin overrides</a> to change a container that <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/03/thoughts-on-negative-margins/">felt like a hack</a> that in my experience don’t scale.</p>
<p>Now I have something better with some sweet tech from <a href="https://smolcss.dev/#smol-breakout-grid">Stephanie Eckles</a> that I saw on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw">Kevin Powell’s YouTube</a> called “Named Grid Lines”. A not-so-well-known feature of grid is you can name the gutters in your grid template. The result is a grid that looks like this:</p>
<p>Full</p>
<p>Margin</p>
<p>Wide</p>
<p>Outdent</p>
<p>Content (Default)</p>
<p>See how all the grids collapse into one line that’s offset from the edge? That’s what I want. And then to use it, you specify the <code>*-start</code> and <code>*-end</code> line you tweak your container with a modifier class and make all the children start at a different grid line.</p>
<pre><code>.foo.container &gt; * {
	grid-column: wide-start / wide-end;
  /* or grid-column: wide */
}

</code></pre>
<p>This gives me a lot of scalable control for my layout at the template level. For example, the layout of my homepage looks like this:</p>
<p>Header</p>
<p>Logo</p>
<p>Latest Posts</p>
<p>Projects</p>
<p>Footer</p>
<p>But when you click through to a single post, the template shifts to this:</p>
<p>Header</p>
<p>Title Goes Here</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Media</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Media</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>Footer</p>
<p>I don’t have this setup, but I could write out a system of utility classes to make all this super flexible.</p>
<p>.full-start</p>
<p>.margin-start</p>
<p>.wide-start</p>
<p>.outdent-start</p>
<p>Default Content</p>
<p>.outdent-end</p>
<p>.wide-end</p>
<p>.margin-end</p>
<p>.full-end</p>
<p>That’s a lot of different layouts to craft. I look forward to more sustainable art direction for years to come. No more hacky negative margins or fixed positioned items… right?</p>
<h2>More Multipage View Transitions</h2>
<p>I’ve had <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/05/getting-started-view-transitions/">multi-page view transitions on my site</a> for years now. The original was a title transition from the index template to the post template where the post title would do a subtle swoop up and morph from an <code>H3</code> to display-sized <code>H1</code>. This was great until I changed the font for my <code>H1</code> (see above) and I obliterated the slight of hand magic I had before. Oops.</p>
<p>Now the flagship animation on my site is not typography dependent. If you navigate through my site, you’ll see that the “Dave” SVG on the homepage transitions into the main navigation on subpages. As a bonus, I get a little bit of much-needed branding on subpages. I didn’t do anything special other than naming the view transition and beefing up the stroke when the logo is in its smaller form.</p>
<p>The main nav is out-dented a bit by default, but using my new named columns I made the navigation go wider to match wide pages like my Bookshelf. Flexbox’s <code>justify-content: space-between</code> and view-transitions is doing all the heavy lifting on that animation there but I’m pleased with the effect and it feels natural (aka not synthetic and cheap).</p>
<p>I’m not a motion expert like <a href="https://cydstumpel.nl/">Cyd Stumpel</a>, but it feels good to have big, bold, un-ignorable view transitions on my site.</p>
<h2>Slimmed down CSS</h2>
<p>A redesign is always a great opportunity to clean house. I did the thing where I deleted my entire CSS and started from a naked page. Bit-by-bit I pulled back in the pieces I still needed.</p>
<p>I have about 40% less CSS which manifests in ~150 less lines of code to maintain and up to <code>~0.8 KB</code> when compressed over the wire.</p>
<p>LoCRawMin+GzipMin+BrotliBefore55710.3 KB2.76 KB2.43 KBAfter3915.36 KB1.97 KB1.76 KB</p>
<p>Now <code>0.8 KB</code> isn’t much but because I inline my critical CSS the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on every page, this number matters. My entire homepage document is <code>~5.5 KB</code> (Brotli), so that’s a 10%~20% performance improvement from cleaning up my CSS. How did I get these gains, you ask? Well…</p>
<p>One reason my CSS smaller is because I’m using modern CSS (nesting, <code>:has()</code>, <code>:is()</code>, <code>:where()</code>, <code>:not()</code>, etc). Those features seem like minor syntactic sugar but you also get more efficient selectors. For example my out-denting that I do in posts would previous be something like:</p>
<pre><code>.post iframe,
.post video,
.post img,
.post table { }

</code></pre>
<p>In modern CSS that super-conjoined selector becomes something more expressive and elegant:</p>
<pre><code>.post :is(iframe, video, img, table) {}

</code></pre>
<p>Those small improvements add up, but another reason the CSS is smaller is because its doing a lot less. Other than my inverse-sized H1s in posts, I’m not managing type styles at all beyond setting the body font-size. I think this is what Andy Bell calls “ <a href="https://bell.bz/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager/">Be the Browser’s Mentor, Not Its Micromanager</a>”. My strategy here is: Don’t futz with it until you can think of something way better than what the browser already does. That seems very <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao</a> or <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">Web’s Grain’y</a>.</p>
<h2>Onward to more art direction!</h2>
<p>This redesign opens up a bright future for my site. I’ve already started on some of this work, but I’ll share that in a future post. I mentioned above but the named grid lines alone give me a lot of easy-to-use levers for expression. I touched up some <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/04/oh-the-paywalls-you-ll-meet/">old art-directed posts</a> and they are benefitting from the changes already.</p>
<p>“Make it easy to play” seems like a good ethos for a personal site and I feel like I have that in the current manifestation.</p>

      <h1>The datalist element on iOS 26</h1>

(date: 2026-01-18)
      <p>
      <p>The <code>datalist</code> element is all fucked up on iOS. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21445">Again</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t “upgraded” my iPhone to iOS 26 and I have no plans to. The whole Liquid Glass thing is literally offputting. So I wouldn’t have known about the latest regression in Safari if a friend hadn’t texted me about the problem.</p>
<p>He was trying to do a search on <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. He was looking for the tune, The Road To Town. He started typing this into the form on the home page of the site. He got as far as “The Road To”. That’s when the entire input was obscured by a suggestion from the associated <code>datalist</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://adactio.com/images/ios26-datalist.png" alt="A screenshot of The Session on an iPhone during a search on the homepage. The search input is completely obscured by the text: The Road To Lisdoonvarna."></p>
<p>This is incredibly annoying and seems to be a pattern of behaviour for Safari. Features are supported …technically. But the implementation is so buggy as to be unusable.</p>
<p>I’ll probably have to do some user-agent sniffing, which I hate. And it won’t be enough to just sniff for Safari on iOS 26. Remember that every browser on iOS is just Webkit in a trenchcoat.</p>
<p>Time to file a bug and then wait God knows how long for an update to get rolled out.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305719">I filed a bug</a>, but in the meantime it looks like <a href="https://nielsleenheer.com/articles/2025/the-user-agent-string-of-safari-on-ios-26-and-macos-26/">user-agent sniffing is going to be impossible</a>.</p>

      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://brewing.permacomputing.net/">How ToStart a Permacomputing Collective</a></h2>
<p>This is a guide brewed from conversations with initiatives in London
(UK), Berlin (DE), Prague (CZ), Philadelphia (USA), Rotterdam (NL),
Vienna (AT), Lutruwtia (Tas/AU), County Mayo (IE) and a community from
Middle America gathering on servers. This text can support you when
starting a permacomputing collective. We use fermenting as a metaphor.
It isn’t a strict recipe but more of a loose framework that can be
freely modified to suit local tastes and conditions. Many actions are
cyclical and can be seen as opportunities to revisit or re-purpose
later.</p>

<p>located at 311 North 20th Street (at Wood Street), one block north of
the Ben Franklin Parkway, directly behind the Central Library on Logan
Square and just five minutes from Routes 95 and 76 - is a used bookstore
staffed by a team of paid and volunteer booksellers that offers gently
used, publicly donated books, records, CDs at reduced prices. Now the
new home of Chris’ Kids Corner for children’s books and story hours,
they also feature an eclectic stock of fiction, non-fiction,
contemporary, classics, out of print, first editions, art, architecture
and crafts.</p>

<p>Le Sommet pour l’action sur l’intelligence artificielle se tient à Paris
du 6 au 11 février 2025. C’est l’occasion de rappeler l’existence d’une
boîte à outils pour révéler les angles morts des discours sur le
numérique. Autour du concept d’« impensé numérique », ces outils de
compréhension sont précieux pour garder la tête froide face à
l’irruption de l’IA générative dans notre quotidien.</p>

<p>We analyzed 470 open-source GitHub pull requests, including 320

issue taxonomy. Every finding was normalized to issues per 100 PRs and
we used statistical rate ratios to compare how often different types of
problems appeared in each group.</p>
<p>The results? Clear, measurable, and consistent with what many developers
have been feeling intuitively: AI accelerates output, but it also
amplifies certain categories of mistakes.</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf">F3: The Open-Source Data File Format for the Future</a></h2>
<p>Columnar storage formats are the foundation for modern data analytics
systems. The proliferation of open- source file formats (i.e., Parquet,
ORC) allows seamless data sharing across disparate platforms. However,
these formats were created over a decade ago for hardware and workload
environments that are much different from today. Although these formats
have incorporated some updates to their specification to adapt to these
changes, not all deployments support those modifications, and too often
systems cannot overcome the formats’ deficiencies and limitations
without a rewrite. In this paper, we present the F uture-proof F ile
Format (F3) project. It is a next-generation open-source file format
with interoperability, extensibility, and efficiency as its core design
principles. F3 obviates the need to create a new format every time a
shift occurs in data processing and computing by providing a data
organization structure and a general-purpose API to allow developers to
add new encoding schemes easily. Each self-describing F3 file includes
both the data and meta-data, as well as WebAssembly (Wasm) binaries to
decode the data. Embedding the decoders in each file requires minimal
storage (kilobytes) and ensures compatibility on any platform in case
native decoders are unavailable. To evaluate F3, we compared it against
legacy and state-of-the-art open-source file formats. Our evaluations
demonstrate the efficacy of F3’s storage layout and the benefits of
Wasm-driven decoding.</p>

<p>Tsing and Zhou instead prefer to describe FUNGI: Anarchist Designers as
an exhibition of ‘anti-design’. In this show, fungi are not passive
building materials, but rather anarchic co-designers – unconscious and
uncontrollable – of a world that can only exist through alliances
between humans and other living things. The exhibition reveals how fungi
manifest themselves at different scales, from sick frogs and the
dishwasher in your kitchen, to hospital beds, termite mounds, the human
digestive system, coffee, banana and conifer plantations, and the
jungle.</p>

<p>Here’s what I keep coming back to: in any mature system, most of the
graph will be memories of memories. You ask me my favorite restaurants,
I think about it, answer, and now “that list I made” becomes its own
retrievable thing. Next time someone asks about dinner plans, I don’t
re-derive preferences from first principles. I remember what I concluded
last time. Psychologists say this is how human recall actually works;
you’re not accessing the original, you’re accessing the last retrieval.
Gets a little distorted each time.</p>

<p>In 2023, I returned to Taiwan for further social science research
focused on environmental activism in response to the pollution caused by
Formosa Plastics, one of the biggest plastics companies in the world,
headquartered in Taiwan. One thread of research upon my return extended
an initiative that I’ve come to call “Archiving Formosa Plastics”,
designed to study environmental justice and governance issues related to
the company across diverse settings, supporting various research,
advocacy, and teaching endeavours.</p>
<p>The project started after getting to know an anti-Formosa activist in
Texas named Diane Wilson. Since the Texas Formosa Plant started
operations in the late 1980s, Wilson has collected many kinds of
documents about the plant, eventually needing a large barn to store them
all. I had many questions about these documents: When and how did these
various documents gain and lose political value? Who would take care of
and steward these documents into the future</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I wrote about ActivityPub becoming a W3C

blogpost was about my experiences, and most of my experiences were on my
direct work on ActivityPub. But the Social Working Group did more than
ActivityPub; it also on the same day published WebSub, a useful piece of
technology in its own right which amongst other things also plays a
significant historical role in what is even ActivityPub’s history (but
is not used by ActivityPub itself), and it has also published several
documents which are not compatible with ActivityPub at all, and appear
to play the same role. This, to outsiders, may appear confusing, but
there are reasons which I will go into in this post</p>

<p>We are part of a growing global effort to ensure innovative technologies

Indigenous experts to guide the development of ethical AI tools for

<p>Responsible AI that benefits Indigenous communities and conservation
must implement Indigenous data sovereignty principles, and determine how

incorporated into these systems. AI that is co-designed with Indigenous
partners, rather than for them, can make these technologies more
accessible, culturally appropriate and aligned with community goals</p>

<p>Indigenous math isn’t just about numbers and equations, it involves
culture, spirituality and more. Math professor Edward Doolittle, a
Mohawk from Six Nations in Ontario, sees math as something embedded in
Creation itself. In his Hagey Lecture at the University of Waterloo, he
describes Indigenous mathematics as being grounded in cognition,
emotion, the physical world and community. Indigenizing math, Doolittle
hopes, will make it more approachable and meaningful to Indigenous
students — show them how entwined it is with everyday life and something
much bigger than ourselves</p>

architecting maintainable, distributable, and scalable systems. This is
where non-technical leaders who think they can fire their development
teams are making a significant mistake. Until we see the arrival of an
artificial intelligence that renders this entire discussion moot,
believing that technical expertise can be replaced by a prompt is a
strategic error. Building robust software still requires a human who
understands the underlying principles of the craft.</p>

manage to reach broad adoption in the ecosystem. From where I’m standing

can get much better performance by applying new approaches. As a

      <blockquote>
<p><em>[On agents using CLI tools in place of REST APIs]</em> To save on context window, yes, but moreso to improve accuracy and success rate when multiple tool calls are involved, particularly when calls must be correctly chained e.g. for pagination, rate-limit backoff, and recognizing authentication failures.</p>
<p>Other major factor: which models can wield the skill? Using the CLI lowers the bar so cheap, fast models (gpt-5-nano, haiku-4.5) can reliably succeed. Using the raw APl is something only the costly &quot;strong&quot; models (gpt-5.2, opus-4.5) can manage, and it squeezes a ton of thinking/reasoning out of them, which means multiple turns/iterations, which means accumulating a ton of context, which means burning loads of expensive tokens. For one-off API requests and ad hoc usage driven by a developer, this is reasonable and even helpful, but for an autonomous agent doing repetitive work, it's a disaster.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: The world needs an Ireland for disenshittification (17 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links The world needs an Ireland for disenshittification: Regulatory arbitrage isn't just for tax cheats. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: &quot;Fledgling&quot;; Magnetic forest rings; Electable Mr Sanders; &quot;Terrorists&quot; were just blind guys. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The world needs an Ireland for disenshittification (permalink) Ireland is a tax haven. In the 1970s and 1980s, life in the civil-war wracked country was hard – between poverty, scarce employment and civil unrest, the country hemorrhaged its best and brightest. As the saying went, &quot;Ireland's top export is the Irish.&quot; In desperation, Ireland's political class hit on a wild gambit: they would weaponize Ireland's sovereignty in service to corporate tax evasion. Companies that pretended to establish their headquarters in Ireland would be able to hoard their profits, evading their tax obligations to every other country in the world: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland</a>_as_a_tax_haven A single country – poor, small, at the literal periphery of a continent – was able to foundationally transform the global order. Any company that has enough money to pretend to be Irish can avoid 25-35% in tax, giving it an unbeatable edge against competitors that lack the multinational's superpower of magicking all its profits into a state of untaxable grace somewhere over the Irish Sea. The effect this had on Ireland is…mixed. The Irish state is thoroughly captured by the corporations that pretend to call Ireland home. Anything those corporations want, Ireland must deliver, lest the footloose companies up sticks and start pretending to be Cypriot, Luxembourgeois, Maltese or Dutch. This is why Europe's landmark privacy law, the GDPR, has had no effect on America's tech giants. They pretend to be Irish, and Ireland lets them get away with breaking European law. The Irish state even hires these companies' executives to regulate their erstwhile employers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta</a> But there is no denying that Ireland has managed to turn the world's taxable trillions into its own domestic billions. The fact that Ireland is cashing out less than 1% of what it's costing everyone else is terrible for the world's tax systems and competitive markets, but it's been a massive windfall for Ireland, and has lifted the country out of its centuries of colonial poverty and privation. There are many lessons to be learned from Ireland's experiment with regulatory arbitrage, but one is unequivocal: even a small, poor, disintegrating nation can change the world system by offering a site where you can do things that you can't do anywhere else, and if it does, that poor nation can grow wealthy and comfortable. What's more, there are plenty of &quot;things that you can't do anywhere else&quot; that are very good. It's not just corporate tax evasion. First among these things that you can't do anywhere else: it's a crime in virtually every country on earth to modify America's defective, enshittified, privacy-invading, money-stealing technology exports. That's because the US trade representative has spent the past 25 years using the threat of tariffs to bully all of America's trading partners into adopting &quot;anti-circumvention&quot; laws: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change</a> There is nothing good about this. The fact that local businesses can't sell you a privacy blocker, an alternative client, a diagnostic tool, a spare part, a consumable, or even software for your American-made devices leaves you defenseless before US tech's remorseless campaign of monetary and informational plunder – and it means that your economy is denied the benefits of creating and exporting these incredibly desirable, profitable products. Incredibly, Trump deliberately blew up this multi-trillion dollar system of US commercial advantage. By chaotically imposing and rescinding and re-imposing tariffs on the world, he has neutralized the US trade rep's tariff threats. Foreign firms just can't count on exporting to America anymore, so the threat of (more) tariffs grows less intimidating by the minute: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations</a> The time is ripe for the founding of a disenshittification nation, an Ireland for disenshittification. I have no doubt that eventually, most or all of the countries in the world will drop their anti-circumvention laws (the laws that ban the modification of US tech exports). Once one country starts making these disenshittifying tools, there'll be no way to prevent their export, since all it takes to buy one of these tools from a circumvention haven is an internet connection and a payment method. Once everyone in your country is buying and using jailbreaking tools from abroad, there'll be no point in keeping these laws on your own books. But the first country to get there stands a chance of establishing a durable first-mover advantage – of reaping hundreds of billions selling disenshittifying products around the world. That country could be to enshittification-resistant technology what Finland was to mobile phones during the Nokia decade (and wouldn't you know it, the EU's newly minted &quot;Tech Sovereignty&quot; czar is a Finn!): <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen">https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen</a>_en The world has experimented with many kinds of havens over the centuries. In the early 18th century, Madagascar became a haven for British naval deserters, who were adopted into the island's matriarchal clans. Together, they founded an anarchist pirate utopia: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/24/zana-malata/#libertalia">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/24/zana-malata/#libertalia</a> The global system of trade has allowed America's tech companies to steal and hoard trillions, and to put every country at risk of being bricked when their IT systems are switched off at a single word from Trump: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</a> There are more than 200 countries in the world. There's also an ever-expanding cohort of brilliant international technologists whose Silicon Valley dreams have turned into a nightmare of being shot in the face by an ICE goon, or being kidnapped, separated from their families and being locked up in a Salvadoran slave-labor prison. These techies are looking for the next place to put down roots and &quot;make a dent in the universe.&quot; Lots of countries could be that place. The Ireland for disenshittification wouldn't just have their pick of international technologists – they'd have plenty of Americans hungering for a better life. Two-thirds of young Americans &quot;are considering leaving the US&quot;: <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/nearly-two-thirds-of-young-americans-are-considering-leaving-the-us-11010814">https://www.newsweek.com/nearly-two-thirds-of-young-americans-are-considering-leaving-the-us-11010814</a> Ireland pulled off its tax-haven gambit by making influential people very rich, so that they would go to bat for Ireland. The Ireland for disenshittification will have the same chance. The new tech companies that unlock US Big Tech's trillions and turn them into their own billions (with the remainder being shared by us, tech users, in the form of lower prices and better products) will be a powerful bloc in support of this project. Ireland showed us: it just takes one country to defect from this global prisoner's dilemma, and then everything is up for grabs.

      <h1>Nostalgia for a time I didn’t experience</h1>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>Our everyday vocabulary fails to capture subtle emotions. Some languages developed to fill in these gaps. An example that became popular is <em>Schadenfreude</em>, which means taking pleasure in someone else’s misfortune. It has an opposite in German, <em>Fremdscham</em>, which is the vicarious embarrassment you feel when witnessing someone else’s humiliation. Its Finnish equivalent <em>myötähäpeä</em> is slightly more well known.</p>
<p>I like these words that capture complex feelings. When I was in high school, Wittgenstein made a lasting impression on my very naive mind. He argued that language can only picture facts about the world, and that ethics, aesthetics, and the mystical lie beyond what language can express. I think this is fascinatingly true. I’m convinced that a share of our daily sorrows come from our inability to put them in words. It reassures me when I stumble on a word that expresses a feeling I can’t explain.</p>

      <h1>Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ChatGPT</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ChatGPT</a></strong></p>
<p>OpenAI's long-rumored introduction of ads to ChatGPT just became a whole lot more concrete:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the coming weeks, we’re also planning to start testing ads in the U.S. for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay. Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's &quot;Go&quot; tier, you might ask? That's a new <span class="math inline">\(8/month tier that launched today in the USA, see [Introducing ChatGPT Go, now available worldwide](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/). It's a tier that they first trialed in India in August 2025 (here's a mention [in their release notes from August](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes#h_22cae6eb9f) listing a price of ₹399/month, which converts to around \)</span>4.40).</p>
<p>I'm finding the new plan comparison grid on <a href="https://chatgpt.com/pricing">chatgpt.com/pricing</a> pretty confusing. It lists all accounts as having access to GPT-5.2 Thinking, but doesn't clarify the limits that the free and Go plans have to conform to. It also lists different context windows for the different plans - 16K for free, 32K for Go and Plus and 128K for Pro. I had assumed that the 400,000 token window <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2">on the GPT-5.2 model page</a> applied to ChatGPT as well, but apparently I was mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've apparently not been paying attention: here's the Internet Archive ChatGPT pricing page from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250906071408/https://chatgpt.com/pricing">September 2025</a> showing those context limit differences as well.</p>
<p>Back to advertising: my biggest concern has always been whether ads will influence the output of the chat directly. OpenAI assure us that they will not:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer independence</strong>: Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you. Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you. Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.</li>
<li><strong>Conversation privacy</strong>: We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So what will they look like then? This screenshot from the announcement offers a useful hint:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/chatgpt-ads.jpg" alt="Two iPhone screenshots showing ChatGPT mobile app interface. Left screen displays a conversation about Santa Fe, New Mexico with an image of adobe-style buildings and desert landscape, text reading &quot;Santa Fe, New Mexico—often called 'The City Different'—is a captivating blend of history, art, and natural beauty at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. As the oldest and highest-elevation state capital in the U.S., founded in 1610, it offers a unique mix of Native American, Spanish, and Anglo cultures.&quot; Below is a sponsored section from &quot;Pueblo &amp; Pine&quot; showing &quot;Desert Cottages - Expansive residences with desert vistas&quot; with a thumbnail image, and a &quot;Chat with Pueblo &amp; Pine&quot; button. Input field shows &quot;Ask ChatGPT&quot;. Right screen shows the Pueblo &amp; Pine chat interface with the same Desert Cottages listing and an AI response &quot;If you're planning a trip to Sante Fe, I'm happy to help. When are you thinking of going?&quot; with input field &quot;Ask Pueblo &amp; Pine&quot; and iOS keyboard visible."></p>
<p>The user asks about trips to Santa Fe, and an ad shows up for a cottage rental business there. This particular example imagines an option to start a direct chat with a bot aligned with that advertiser, at which point presumably the advertiser can influence the answers all they like!</p>

      <h1>★ MacPaw Pulls the Plug on SetApp Mobile App Marketplace</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16, updated: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>By and large, iPhone owners do not care about third-party app marketplaces and they care even less about third-party browser engines. Popular demand isn’t going to come about from additional regulatory mandates or pocket-change fines imposed on Apple.</p>

Michael Mann is a climate scientist who writes extensively about global warming and hence has been attacked ruthlessly by climate deniers. Peter Hotez is a vaccine scientist and has been attacked relentlessly by anti-vaxxers. There is a lot of money and […]</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Catch this! (16 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Catch this! Email is good, actually. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: LDS excommunication; King Foundation v &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;; &quot;Lat-stage capitalism&quot; v &quot;Christ, what an asshole&quot;; Pelosi v Porter. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Catch this! (permalink) Call it &quot;lifehacking,&quot; or just call it, &quot;paying attention to how you stay organized&quot; – I don't care what you call it, I am an ardent practitioner of it. I like improving my processes because I like what I do, and the more efficient I am at all of it (with apologies to Jenny Odell), the more of that stuff I can get done: <a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/</a> I want to do a lot of stuff. I am one of those people who is ten miles wide and one inch deep (it probably has something to do with imbibing Heinlein's maxim that &quot;specialization is for insects&quot; at an impressionable age). There's a million waterways I want to dip my toe (or my oar) into, and the better organized I am, the more of that stuff I'll get to do before I kick off. I'm 54, and while there's a lot of road ahead of me, I can see the end, off there in the distance. It's coming, and I'm not done – I'm barely getting started. I've been around lifehacking since the very moment it was born. I was there. I published the notes on Danny O'Brien's seminal 2004 talk at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, &quot;Life Hacks: Tech Secrets of Overprolific Alpha Geeks&quot;: <a href="https://craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt">https://craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt</a> In the years since, I've cultivated a small – but mighty – repertoire of organizational habits and tools that let me get a hell of a lot done. Weirdly, many of these tools are things that other people hate, and I can see why – they use them in very different ways from me. That's true of browser tabs (I loooove browser tabs): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/25/today-in-tabs/#unfucked-rota">https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/25/today-in-tabs/#unfucked-rota</a> And to-do lists, which will totally transform your life, once you realize that the most important to-do list is the one you maintain for everyone else who owes you a response, a package, or money: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo</a> Other essential tools languish in neglect, artifacts of the old, good web – the elegant weapons that dominated a more civilized age. First among these? RSS readers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise</a> I will freely stipulate that people have a good reason to hate all this stuff. &quot;Productivity porn&quot; is often proffered as a mix of humblebrag (a way to make other people jealous of your almighty &quot;productivity&quot;) and denial (fiddling with your systems is a ready substitute for actually doing things). Many (most?) of the foremost self-appointed pitchmen for &quot;lifehacking&quot; are cringey charlatans peddling &quot;courses&quot; and other nonsense. But if you keep digging, there's a solid foundation beneath all the rot. At its very best, this stuff is a way to figure out what you really want to do, and to organize your life so that the stuff you want to do is the stuff you're doing. A lot of people get into this kind of thing thinking it'll let them do everything. No one can do everything. The best you can hope for is to make conscious decisions about which stuff you'll never get to, while leaving at least a little room for serendipity. Like I said, I want to do a lot of stuff. My organizing tactics are as much about deciding what I won't do as they are about deciding what I will do: <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-how-to-do-everything-lifehacking-considered-harmful/">https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-how-to-do-everything-lifehacking-considered-harmful/</a> Which brings me to another tool that everyone hates and I love: email. I live and die by email. First of all, I filter all my incoming email: mail from people who are in my address book stays in my inbox; mail from people I've never heard from before goes into a mailbox called &quot;People I don't know.&quot; When I reply to a message, Thunderbird adds the recipient to my address book, so the next time I hear from them, they'll stay in my main mailbox. I also filter out anything containing the word &quot;unsubscribe,&quot; sending it into a folder called &quot;Unlikely&quot; (but not if the message contains my name – which is how I can stay subscribed to mailing lists I don't have time to read and make sure to reply when someone mentions me). Second of all, I have a zillion Quicktext macros that I use to reply to frequently asked questions. I have one that spits out my mailing address; another that spits out my bio; and others for politely saying no to things I don't have time for, for information about how to pay one of my invoices, etc, etc. Third: I have a small folder of emails that I can't reply to right away (usually because I need some information from a third party), which I review every morning and answer anything that I can clear. Finally, I save it all. I have so much saved email, which means that if you ask me about something from 20 years ago, there's a good chance I can find it – provided we organized it over email. All of which explains why I refuse – to the extent that I can – to do anything important over instant messaging, whether that's Signal or any of the other messaging tools that come with social media, workplace software, etc. I understand why people like instant messaging: it does not overwhelm you with the burdens of the past. It is largely ahistorical, with archives that are hard to access and search. Its norms and register are less formal than email. And, of course, instant messaging is far superior to email in some contexts. If you're on vacation with friends, having a big group-chat where you can say, &quot;I'm making dinner – is everyone OK with cheese?&quot; is indispensable. Same goes for asking a friend for directions, announcing that you've arrived at someone's office, or confirming whether it's OK to substitute 2% for whole milk on a grocery run. But if you're like me – if you've figured out how to do as many of the things that matter to you as you can possibly squeeze in, then getting an IM mid-flow is like someone walking up to a juggler who's working on a live chainsaw, a bowling ball, and a machete and tossing him a watermelon while shouting, &quot;Hey, catch this!&quot; The problem is that if you are asking about something important, something that can't be instantaneously managed by the recipient, then they will have to drop everything they're doing and, at the very least, make a note to themselves to go back to your message later and deal with it. Instant messaging doesn't have an inbox with everything you've been sent. Of course, that's why people love it. But the fact that you can't see all the things other people are expecting you to answer doesn't mean that they aren't expecting it. It also doesn't mean that everything will be fine if you just ignore all those messages. Instant messaging is a great tool for managing something that everyone is doing at the same time. It's also a nice way to keep an ambient social flow of updates from people in a rocking groupchat. But IM is fundamentally unserious. It is antithetical to the project of making a conscious decision about what you won't do, so that you do as many of the things that matter to you before you get to the end of the road. A massive email inbox is intimidating, but switching to IMs doesn't make all the demands in the email go away. It just puts them out of sight until they either expire or explode. Far better to decide what balls you're going to drop than to have them knocked out of your hand by a fast-moving watermelon.

      <h1>Think different about WordPress, cont'd</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p><em>This is a continuation of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">piece</a> I wrote in August 2025.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/thinkDifferentBillboard.png" alt="">Yesterday I wrote a <a href="https://this.how/wordland/wordpressorg.opml">this.how doc</a> about getting WordLand to run on sites that don't run on WordPress.com or have Jetpack installed. What this means is that their sites are accessible through the fantastic wpcom API, and with that API I have been able to build a very nice writers' workspace for WordPress sites. I call the ones that are left out the WordPress.org sites, though I know that's not an entirely accurate way of describing it, but neither is &quot;self-hosted sites&quot; because you could have a hosting service that doesn't install Jetpack. WordPress could be used for things that are quite different from the way it's used today. Important point.</p>
<p>I sent links to that post to two people, and encouraged them to pass it along, as a way of starting a discussion -- how are we going to get WordLand running on those &quot;other&quot; sites. And we need names for lots of things, but first we have to get the software working the way we want it to, then the naming will be more obvious.</p>
<p>Jeremy Herve has already written a <a href="https://herve.bzh/wordland-on-self-hosted-sites/">response</a> (as I asked him to). As always, very helpful. But I want to push back on the way he frames the project -- as if it's up to me to do this work, and that I dispute. It think it's up to us. WordLand isn't just a product, it's a challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>To make WordPress a fantastic platform for developers who want to build on its ability to write and read and link together writing and reading on the freaking web. That's why it's so important to understand what the web is and what it's capabilities are. We've been missing some of the big stuff since the big silos took over. I want, before I hang up my hat, to fix that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to outline here how we start, so it's documented so more people will see it too.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have written a package, MIT-licensed, with an awkward name for historic reasons called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpIdentity</a>. It started off as just a simple way to use WordPress identity with FeedLand because it made sense to do it a couple of years ago because Twitter was destroying the utility of their API, and we needed a new way to do identity. So I stopped everything and implemented both email identity and WordPress identity, or more specifically, wordpress.com identity. This leaves out all the wordpress sites that you can't log onto this way. Not a good situation, I don't like it because I want WordPress to be one large happy family of users and developers. So that's what I'm seeking to instigate here.</li>
<li>Then wpIdentity grew and grew. At first it supported all the endpoints in the wpcom API, and made it possible to build WordLand, which itself <em>only communicates to WordPress via wpIdentity.</em> And later when I needed user-specific storage that is not part of the WordPress API, I built a very nice little storage system, it's efficient, highly scalable, and (I think) well debugged. If you read my initial <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">Think Different</a> piece you'll see it gets a mention in <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a141421">this part</a>. Storage, we will find out, is the big missing piece in the web, has always been the missing piece, the thing that keeps us from having a real developer community of web apps. How do I know? Because I'm a freaking developer. I don't work at a company that can insulate me from this need. That's why I see this need and so many others don't.</li>
<li>Now here's something else that's cool. I didn't stop with wpIdentity, I made a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">JavaScript function</a> that simplifies the wpcom interface for people writing browser-based JavaScript apps. It radically simplifies it. I didn't invent this way of doing it, someone at Facebook did, as far as I'm concerned. We may not like Facebook the company or the boss man, but they have employed some brilliant programmers over the years. I think this idea came from the developers of FriendFeed, but I could be wrong. What they did was take the interface code every app developer has to do, and made <em>that</em> the API. I remember when I first saw it in 2013, it blew me away. It took me a full month to build support for Twitter in my app, but it only two days to do it in Facebook. I did one of those for WordPress. It's part of wpIdentity. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">Here it is</a>. Please if you're a contributor to wordpress.org -- study that thing, because we're going to be working on that code -- together. This is where the &quot;we&quot; part of it starts. But there's more.</li>
<li>You don't <em>have</em> to read the code of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">api2.js</a> to understand how it works, there's an even easier way to do it -- <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo">wpEditorDemo</a>. It's a simple browser-based editor that does what WordLand does, without all the flourish. Bare bones. Also MIT-licensed. Nothing but what's required. You can <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo?tab=readme-ov-file#demo">try it out</a> if you have one or more qualifying sites (either on wordpress.com or having Jetpack installed). The project we need to do is this -- <em>make wpEditDemo work on any WordPress site, no matter where it's hosted.</em> And that's going to be done by extending api2.js. That's where the differences will be encapsulated, and above that level, in wpEditDemo and WordLand and all its competitors, nothing changes. This project may be complicated or simple, or somewhere inbetween, but imho this has to be done. And this is the first place I want to join the open source community for WordPress. After talking with Jon, I became optimistic about this happening sooner than later.</li>
<li>I zoomed through all this and more with Jonathan on <a href="http://scripting.com/2026/01/13.html#a224042">Tuesday</a>. This is what I want to talk about at WordCamp Europe later this year (I have submitted an application). I wanted to show Jon and a few other people I met in Ottawa in October how the pieces fit together. But zooming is the right word, Jon was ahead of me at every step, he just understood what I was showing him. I was blown away -- because this had never happened before with the architecture I had built. Not because it's so complex, it isn't -- it's all about simplifying things, with lots of factoring, finding a repeating pattern and then locking it down in code, so no one has to ever worry about the complexity again. I think it was hard for people to see because they aren't expecting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's where I'm going to leave it for now. I suggest if you have a response or comment, please put it on your blog and send me a link. We're going to create new ways to link blog posts together, but for now we'll do it by hand.</p>
<p>PS: Hat-tip to Matt Mullenweg for building WordPress, and for having the idea that Tumblr could be rebuilt on top of WordPress. When he announced they were going to do that I knew I was on the right track. We were thinking about WordPress the same way.</p>
<p>PPS: If people have a hard time understanding how I could do this -- remember: 1. I've had a lot of time. 2. I understand WordPress at a deep level. 3. I'm good at building and selling APIs, I've been fairly successful at it. And even better, the WordPress community has been a very good caretaker of this work. They support a remarkable amount of it, and it all still works, and they often wonder why the rest of the world doesn't love it like they do. I feel the same damn way. ;-)</p>

      <h1>AI and the Corporate Capture of Knowledge</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>More than a decade after <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Open-access-tributes-to-Aaron-Swartz-4193965.php">Aaron Swartz’s death</a>, the United States is still living inside the contradiction that destroyed him.</p>
<p>Swartz believed that knowledge, especially publicly funded knowledge, should be freely accessible. Acting on that, he downloaded thousands of academic articles from the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a> archive with the intention of making them publicly available. For this, the federal government charged him with a felony and threatened decades in prison. After two years of prosecutorial pressure, Swartz died by suicide on Jan. 11, 2013.</p>
<p>The still-unresolved questions raised by his case have resurfaced in today’s debates over artificial intelligence, copyright and the ultimate control of knowledge...</p>

I can post about interesting things I’ve read or watched and hope that someone else will find them interesting too. And that’s great!

      <h1>Open Responses</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.openresponses.org/">Open Responses</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the standardization effort I've most wanted in the world of LLMs: a vendor-neutral specification for the JSON API that clients can use to talk to hosted LLMs.</p>
<p>Open Responses aims to provide exactly that as a documented standard, derived from OpenAI's Responses API.</p>
<p>I was hoping for one based on their older Chat Completions API since so many other products have cloned the already, but basing it on Responses does make sense since that API was designed with the feature of more recent models - such as reasoning traces - baked into the design.</p>
<p>What's certainly notable is the list of launch partners. OpenRouter alone means we can expect to be able to use this protocol with almost every existing model, and Hugging Face, LM Studio, vLLM, Ollama and Vercel cover a huge portion of the common tools used to serve models.</p>
<p>For protocols like this I really want to see a comprehensive, language-independent conformance test site. Open Responses has a subset of that - the official repository includes <a href="https://github.com/openresponses/openresponses/blob/d0f23437b27845d5c3d0abaf5cb5c4a702f26b05/src/lib/compliance-tests.ts">src/lib/compliance-tests.ts</a> which can be used to exercise a server implementation, and is available as a React app <a href="https://www.openresponses.org/compliance">on the official site</a> that can be pointed at any implementation served via CORS.</p>
<p>What's missing is the equivalent for clients. I plan to spin up my own client library for this in Python and I'd really like to be able to run that against a conformance suite designed to check that my client correctly handles all of the details.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: How the Light Gets In (15 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links How the Light Gets In: The door is open a crack! Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Poitras v First Look; Aaronsw's &quot;Against School&quot;; I was investigated by the FBI. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. How the Light Gets In (permalink) Of all the tools that I use to maintain my equilibrium in these dark days, none is so important as remembering the distinction between happiness, optimism and hope. Happiness is self-explanatory – and fleeting. Even in the worst of times, there are moments of happiness – a delicious meal with friends, a beautiful sunrise, a stolen moment with your love. These are the things we chase, and rightly so. But happiness is always a goal, rarely a steady state. Optimism, on the other hand, is a toxin to be avoided. Optimism is a subgenre of fatalism, the belief that things will get better no matter what we do. It's just the obverse of pessimism. Both are ways of denying human agency. To be an optimist is to be a passenger of history, along for the ride, with no hope of changing its course. But hope? That's the stuff. Hope is the belief that if we change the world for the better, even by just a little, that we will ascend a gradient towards a better future, and as we rise up that curve, new terrain will be revealed to us that we couldn't see from our lower vantage-point. It's not necessary – or even possible – to see a course from here to the world you want to live in. You can get there in stepwise fashion, one beneficial change at a time: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/03/hope-not-optimism/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/03/hope-not-optimism/</a> These days, I am often unhappy, but I am filled with hope. A couple of weeks ago, I gave a speech, &quot;The Post-American Internet,&quot; at the 39th Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</a> In that talk, I laid out the case for hope. So many of the worst aspects of modern life can be traced to our enshittified technology, from mass surveillance and totalitarian control to wage suppression and conspiratorial cults. This enshittified technology, in turn, is downstream of policy decisions made by politicians who were bullied into their positions by the US trade rep, who used the threat of tariffs to push for laws that protected the right of tech giants to plunder the world's money and data, by criminalizing competitors who disenshittified their products, leaving technology users defenseless. Trump's tariffs have effectively killed that threat. If you can't tell from day to day – let alone year to year – whether the US will accept your exports, you can't rely on exporting to the USA. What's more, generations of pro-oligarch policies have stripped America's bottom 90% of discretionary income, stagnating their wages and leaving them mired in health, education, and housing debt (even as the system finds ever more sadistic and depraved ways for arm-breakers to collect on that debt): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations</a> This is terrible for Americans, but when life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla. With the decline of the US market for global exporters, there's finally political space to stop worrying about tariffs and reconsider anti-circumvention laws, to create &quot;disenshittification nations&quot; that stage raids on the most valuable lines of business of the most profitable companies in world history – Big Tech: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/13/not-sorry/#mere-billions">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/13/not-sorry/#mere-billions</a> People who dream of turning American tech trillions into their own billions are powerful allies in the fight against enshittification, but they're only one group that we can recruit to our side. There's another powerful bloc waiting in the wings: national security hawks. These people are rightly terrified that Trump will order his tech companies to switch off their governments, businesses and households, all of whom are dependent on US cloud-based administrative software for email, document creation and archiving, databases and mobile devices. Trump's tech companies could also brick any nation's mobile phones, medical devices, cars, and tractors. It's the same risk that China hawks warned of when it looked as though Huawei would provide all of the world's 5G infrastructure: allow companies that are absolutely beholden to an autocrat who is not restrained by the rule of law to permeate your society, and your society becomes a prisoner to the autocrat's whims and goodwill. A coalition of digital rights activists; investors and entrepreneurs; and national security hawks makes for a powerful bloc indeed. Each partner in the coalition can mobilize different constituencies and can influence different parts of the state. These are very different groups, and that's why this coalition is so exciting: this is a three-pronged assault on the hegemony of Big Tech. That's not to say that this will automatically happen. Nothing happens automatically. Fuck pessimism, and fuck optimism, too. Things happen because people do stuff: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/17/against-the-great-forces-of-history/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/17/against-the-great-forces-of-history/</a> That's where hope comes in. The door to a better technological future has been slammed shut and triple-locked for 25 years. Today, it is open a crack. A crack isn't much, but as Leonard Cohen taught us, &quot;that's how the light gets in&quot;: <a href="https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-anthem-lyrics">https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-anthem-lyrics</a> Understand: this isn't a bet on politicians discovering heretofore unsuspected wellsprings of courage or principle. This is a bet on politicians confronting unstoppable political will that corners them into doing the right thing. I understand why Europeans, Canadians and Britons might feel cynical about their political classes (to say nothing of Americans, of course). It has been decades since a political party delivered broad, structural change that improved the lives of everyday people. Instead, we've had generations of neoliberal austerity sadists, autocrats and corrupt dolts who've helped billionaires stripmine our civilization and set the world on fire. But politics have changed before, and they can change again (note that I didn't say they will change – just that they can, because we can change them). Society may feel deadlocked, but crises precipitate change. As I said in my Hamburg speech, the EU went from 15 years behind in their solar transition to ten years ahead, in just a few years, thanks to the energy crisis that slammed into the continent after Putin invaded Ukraine. Crises precipitate change. The fact that the EU pivoted so quickly away from fossil fuels to solar is nothing short of a miracle. Anyone who feels like their politicians would never buck Big Tech needs to explain how it came to pass that these politicians just told Big Oil to fuck off. The fossil fuel industry is losing. This is goddamned wild – indeed, their loss might just be locked in at this point, because fossil fuel and its applications (like internal combustion) are now more expensive and more impractical than the cleantech alternatives: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting</a> Sure, it sucks that Trump has killed incentives to drive an EV and that the EU is dropping its goal for phasing out internal combustion engines, but given that EVs are faster, cheaper and better than conventional automobiles, the writing is on the wall for the IC fleet. That's the wild thing about better technology: people want it, and they get pissed off when they're told they can't have it. When the Texas legislature tried to pass a law requiring that power companies add a watt of fossil-fuel generation capacity for every watt of solar they brought online, Trump-voting farmers and ranchers from the deepest red parts of Texas (Texas!!) flooded town halls and hearings, demanding an end to &quot;DEI for natural gas&quot;: <a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/for-reality">https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/for-reality</a> They won. Politics aren't just terrible today, they're in chaos. Crises precipitate change. After World War II, one of Britain's two parties, the Liberals (AKA &quot;Whigs&quot;) imploded. With them out of the way, the Labour Party rose to power, with a transformative agenda backed by a mass movement, which created the British welfare state. Today, the British Conservative Party (AKA &quot;Tories&quot;) are also imploding, and look set to be taken over by a fascist MAGA-alike party, Reform. As of a couple months ago, that seemed like very bad news, since Labour is also set to implode, thanks to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's austerity, authoritarianism, corruption and cowardice. For quite a while, it looked like when Starmer's Labour is totally wiped out in the next election, they would give way to Reform, plunging Britain into Hungarian- (or American)-style autocracy. But all that has changed. Today, the UK Greens have a new leader, Zack Polanski, who has dragged the Greens into an agenda that promises transformations as bold as the ones that remade the country under Clement Attlee's Labour government. Polanski is a fantastic campaigner, and he is committed to the same kind of grassroots co-governance with a mass movement that characterized Zohran Mamdani's historic NYC mayoral campaign. In other words, it seems like both of Britain's sclerotic mainstream parties will be wiped out in the next election, and the real fight in the UK is between two transformative upstart parties, one of which plans to spend billionaires' dark money to mobilize fascists yearning for ethnic cleansing; and the other wants a fair, prosperous and equitable society where we abolish billionaires, confront the climate emergency, and smash corporate power. In other words, the UK is heading into an election in which voters have a choice that's more meaningful than Coke vs Pepsi. Versions of this are playing out around the world. Anti-billionaire policies have surfaced time and again, everywhere, since the late 2010s: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting</a> None of this means that we will automatically win. I'm not asking you to be an optimist here, but I am demanding that you have hope. Hope is a discipline: it requires that you tirelessly seek out the best ways to climb up that gradient toward a better world, trusting that as you attain higher elevation, you will find new paths up that slope. The door is open a crack. Now isn't the time to complain that it isn't open wider – now's the time to throw your shoulder against it.

<h2>Other Humorous Writing News</h2>
<p>This week we learned that Condé Nast let the trademark for Gourmet Magazine lapse, allowing a collective to swoop in and revive it as a <a href="https://gourmetmagazine.net/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426">worker-owned publication</a>. We don’t yet know how much humorous writing there will be in the new incarnation of Gourmet, but we’re big fans of food writing here at the newsletter, and we think that the new owners’ <a href="https://gourmetmagazine.net/gourmet-is-back/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426">piece about their philosophy and the state of the magazine industry</a> is very much worth reading.</p>

      <h1>The Design & Implementation of Sprites</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://fly.io/blog/design-and-implementation/">The Design &amp; Implementation of Sprites</a></strong></p>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/9/sprites-dev/">wrote about Sprites last week</a> Here's Thomas Ptacek from Fly with the insider details on how they work under the hood.</p>
<p>I like this framing of them as &quot;disposable computers&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sprites are ball-point disposable computers. Whatever mark you mean to make, we’ve rigged it so you’re never more than a second or two away from having a Sprite to do it with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've noticed that new Fly Machines can take a while (up to around a minute) to provision. Sprites solve that by keeping warm pools of unused machines in multiple regions, which is enabled by them all using the same container:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, today, under the hood, Sprites are still Fly Machines. But they all run from a standard container. Every physical worker knows exactly what container the next Sprite is going to start with, so it’s easy for us to keep pools of “empty” Sprites standing by. The result: a Sprite create doesn’t have any heavy lifting to do; it’s basically just doing the stuff we do when we start a Fly Machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting detail is how the persistence layer works. Sprites only charge you for data you have written that differs from the base image and provide ~300ms checkpointing and restores - it turns out that's power by a custom filesystem on top of S3-compatible storage coordinated by Litestream-replicated local SQLite metadata:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We still exploit NVMe, but not as the root of storage. Instead, it’s a read-through cache for a blob on object storage. S3-compatible object stores are the most trustworthy storage technology we have. I can feel my blood pressure dropping just typing the words “Sprites are backed by object storage.” [...]</p>
<p>The Sprite storage stack is organized around the JuiceFS model (in fact, we currently use a very hacked-up JuiceFS, with a rewritten SQLite metadata backend). It works by splitting storage into data (“chunks”) and metadata (a map of where the “chunks” are). Data chunks live on object stores; metadata lives in fast local storage. In our case, that metadata store is <a href="https://litestream.io">kept durable with Litestream</a>. Nothing depends on local storage.</p>

On November 21st Bryce Elder posed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883"><em>Five questions from an ignorant no-coiner about the crypto crash</em></a>. Each of his five questions identified some interesting apparent anomalies.</p>
<p>Below the fold I look into each of his questions, asking how anomalous its anomalies really were and whether they have persisted into the New Year.</p>
<p>TL;DR none of them are really surprising but reaching that conclusion took a good deal of research.</p>
<h3>Why doesn’t network difficulty fall?</h3>
<p>Elder explains Bitcoin's <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">difficulty mechanism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm has a difficulty ratchet to keep production steady. Network difficulty adjusts every two weeks, approximately, based on whether miners have been finding new blocks for the blockchain too quickly or too slowly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then identifies the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">first anomaly</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Difficulty tightens when a higher bitcoin price is encouraging miners to join the market, that much makes sense. But when a lower bitcoin price is squeezing margins and pushing the least efficient miners out, shouldn’t difficulty fall?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the chart Elder is looking at.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAUlMeuRv8jQCkLl1PbOs_lJd2kjKpmnnZS7xQQn7oVB7M4CJAQ5PFi5tA4i0SoSQirSkQePSB0VGpDtT0RknRurgResWcHaVxdG3bvsXKdxusMhfQXR6mztzf57I_VrpqtaDdj0aOWkJ-HSWG7V4Nh0PLT01oq6vN4_LGYaSQt5r-Mxu0q_hwQNrBsoQ/s1020/Difficulty.jpeg"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAUlMeuRv8jQCkLl1PbOs_lJd2kjKpmnnZS7xQQn7oVB7M4CJAQ5PFi5tA4i0SoSQirSkQePSB0VGpDtT0RknRurgResWcHaVxdG3bvsXKdxusMhfQXR6mztzf57I_VrpqtaDdj0aOWkJ-HSWG7V4Nh0PLT01oq6vN4_LGYaSQt5r-Mxu0q_hwQNrBsoQ/s320/Difficulty.jpeg" alt=""></a><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">Source</a>
Then <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">Elder asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe difficulty lags behind the price? As said above, the ratchet only adjusts approximately every two weeks. Total hashrate oﬀers a more dynamic measure of power deployed to the network, albeit an estimated one based on how long it’s taking to mine a block. Any change in market structure might show up there first.</p>
<p>And has it? Not really:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing to note is that, depending upon power costs and where they are in the queue for the latest rigs from Bitmain, miners margins vary greatly. So Elder is right that, if one of the two-week adjustemnts increases the difficulty, some of the least economic rigs should be switched off. In theory, if the adjustment decreases the difficulty, some of these idled rigs should be switched back on.</p>
<p>Eyeballing the graph, between early July and late October the price was between <span class="math inline">\(110K and \)</span>120K, a 9% range. During that period the difficulty increased from around 140trn to around 155trn, about an 11% range. These aren't big changes, but it appears a bit strange that roughly flat price coincides with a steady-ish increase in difficulty.</p>
<p>Elder has some possible <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">explanations</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do miners with sunk costs keep running on negative margins in the hope of getting lucky? Are a handful of big miners, maybe advantaged by free power or whatever, keeping difficulty high to drive out competitors, either inadvertently or as part of some devious plan to centralise production and control the network? Or has mining become 55 per cent more eﬃcient since last November?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I estimate that during that time Bitmain and its competitors shipped an additional 1000EH/s to the miners, over and above the new rigs replacing obsolete ones. These leading-edge rigs would have been turned on immediately. During that time the hash rate rose from about 870EH/s to around 1120EH/s, or about 250EH/s. So around 150EH/s must have represented idled, less-efficient rigs being turned on. At the start of the period at most 85% of the rig fleet was working. At the end of the period, as the price started to fall, the most efficient miners had about 100EH/s more than they did at the beginning.</p>
<p>In the subsequent 2 months the price dropped from about <span class="math inline">\(120K to around \)</span>85K and the hash rate dropped from around 1120EH/s to around 1060EH/s, or by 60EH/s. But in that time there ws an incremental 50EH/s of new rigs. So 110EH/s of the 150EH/s from the originally idle fleet of uneconomic rigs were turned off. This within the margin or error of my back-of-the-envelope estimates.</p>
<p>My take is that what happened was what should have been expected. Elder's view was too simplistic, and he was misled by (a) the noise in the graph, and ((b) the fact that the Y axis doesn't start at zero, making the noise much more evident.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtTkF2bWRfX7hyELHvSuKbh3ghr1I3Be6IUAhFTtI0EDazlpDRl-Spma2E3aTlKK94gZscvfP1qS2k6QkZJiIK7MNweyvE8vE81Xx-AV21nO7xEVI78UJwaxXPh1idERxotstnqr02NWi7aXgehppuCSGjZHNhf7MroJBbJY3RXgqbVErhyphenhyphen0Hgbq2rnv1k/s1266/TwoPools.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtTkF2bWRfX7hyELHvSuKbh3ghr1I3Be6IUAhFTtI0EDazlpDRl-Spma2E3aTlKK94gZscvfP1qS2k6QkZJiIK7MNweyvE8vE81Xx-AV21nO7xEVI78UJwaxXPh1idERxotstnqr02NWi7aXgehppuCSGjZHNhf7MroJBbJY3RXgqbVErhyphenhyphen0Hgbq2rnv1k/s320/TwoPools.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://hashrateindex.com/hashrate/pools">Source</a>
Elder goes on to note an issue I've been writing about for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">really a long time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Related, is it a worry that just three mining pools accounted for more than 45 per cent of this week’s block production? Given nearly all the hardware used across the network is Chinese-made, with Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies alone having an estimated market share of 82 per cent, when do concentration levels among a few organisations become a security concern?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this concentration has been a problem for Bitcoin's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/06/pseudonymity-and-cooperation.html">entire history</a>, but everyone has decided to ignore it. As I write, on 6th January 2026, over the last three days Foundry USA and AntPool have controlled 51.2% of the hash power. As I explained at length in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/sabotaging-bitcoin.html"><em>Sabotaging Bitcoin</em></a>, there are practical difficulties facing an insider attack with 30% of the hash power, but with 51.2% things are much easier.</p>
<p>And, in November, Reuters reports that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bitcoin-mining-china-rebounds-defying-2021-ban-2025-11-24/"><em>Bitcoin mining in China rebounds, defying 2021 ban</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin mining is quietly staging a comeback in China despite being banned four years ago, as individual and corporate miners exploit cheap electricity and a data center boom in some energy-rich provinces, according to miners and industry data.</p>
<p>China had been the world's biggest crypto mining country until Beijing banned all cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021, citing threats to the country's financial stability and energy conservation.</p>
<p>After having seen its global bitcoin mining market share slump to zero as a result of the ban, China crept back to third place with a 14% share at the end of October, according to Hashrate Index, which tracks bitcoin mining activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be what the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/">80% of new data centers</a> in China that were empty because unsuitable for AI are being used for.</p>

What attracted Elder's attention <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">was this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stablecoins have long been pitched as crypto’s on-ramp. Swapping fiat money for a fiat-pegged stablecoin like Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC allows a trader to switch in and out of positions without having to touch tradfi.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t an on-ramp also work as an off-ramp? There’s not much evidence it does. In the six weeks or so when <span class="math inline">\(1.2tn in value was drawn down from the cryptoverse, the market cap of USDT has [increased by approximately \)</span>20bn](<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)</a>:</p>

This USDT graph is updated from the one Elder used. It shows a clear break in the upward trend on 24th October. In the 10 preceding weeks it increased by <span class="math inline">\(17B (~10%) as Bitcoin traded beteween a low of \)</span>108K and a high on 6th October of almost $125K.</p>
<p>In the 10 weeks since it has increased by only <span class="math inline">\(3B as Bitcoin dropped from \)</span>111K to a low of <span class="math inline">\(84K on 22nd November, subsequently trading in a range from there to \)</span>94K.</p>
<p>The only other stablecoin that matters <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">is USDC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>USDC hasn’t been quite as resilient but over the period is still basically flat:</p>

Here is its updated graph. On 24th October its market cap was around <span class="math inline">\(76B, it is now around \)</span>75B. So, yes, Elder was right, it has been basically flat for 10 weeks where the preceding 10 weeks it had increased by $8B (~12%).</p>
<p>Had the trend of the previous 10 weeks continued, the market cap of (USDT+USDC) would have been <span class="math inline">\(25B higher than it is. One way of looking at this would be that traders "withdrew" \)</span>25B or around 10% of the (USDT+USDC) market cap on 24th October. On this basis Elder is just wrong, the off-ramp has been quite busy.</p>
<p>Elder notes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if we assume a large percentage of stablecoins are used for non-crypto things (sports betting, remittances, crimes), the recent issuance still looks at odds with the trend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, this contradicts the premise of Elder's question as I understand it. Second, most of the uses Elder cites involve a chain of transactions from fiat to stablecoin to fiat on one or more exchanges. These would not cause a net increase in demand for the stablecoin, which would come from and go back to the exchange's reserves.</p>
<p>Then Elder <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">suggest that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe demand is high because crypto traders have been parking money rather than seeking to withdraw it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, demand isn't high relative to the historic trend, it is now <span class="math inline">\(25B lower. Second, even if we accept Elder's \)</span>20B number, this is peanuts relative to the $1.2T drop in aggregate cryptocurrency market cap.</p>

Finally in this section Elder <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More idle money in the system ought to be good news for the likes of Coinbase, which uses the promise of higher yields on USDC deposits to sell monthly subscription schemes. And how have Coinbase shares been doing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day Bitcoin hit the skids on 8th, COIN closed at $387.27. By 11/20 it was down 38% while Bitcoin was down 47%. It can hardly be a surprise that COIN is highly correlated with Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>What explains trash crash PTSD?</h3>
<p>Next, Elder asks why cryptocurrencies haven't resumed their <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">progress moonwards</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A popular argument among crypto commentators is that token prices are down because traders are still digesting <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/75fa4323-51ea-4ed2-9c07-b995e09ace49">one bad day in early October</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He suggests <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">some reasons</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reasons for the October drawdown go from banal (maybe the high-beta cryptosphere just amplified <a href="https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/bE-qU1zWhzRe8yb0lcjRx2aunbLtAyj8z2535Yt4JLWI44YcnXctrgw5q0-1EcyiTPjt5ZYK4SaNoVUfgMehQ6UD7rKKldXgNL23GrzS7lP66YdWVVIjsnfpnGMJucV-sIIjAuxjx4FWKQNFBVXrfI1wvxafOLeHP6Ni_-L9DwhylPLva04gMWfiA9E3s2ajAvYJxG12dAOOws7lMMUTfkQcs-bs6ezPgsPBL0Wgbzut_zYLwmxSCCjF0_W-YwEmLJqpjHyen3WEHsHC7oHXvqNs7hsJnWj58l6BWdWEdNyvE5VnYux7JvQQvVp39gu7CkPeQ6UUAU5YOWEPnUNOnKtcqiTvCH3WHTgkXPrE53x7mE15PS72Y0t9qf0/jL38GmV_vgDbxRL89uL27NpEMDfNsj96/13">an equities pullback</a> on US-China trade tensions?) to wonky (maybe it all cascaded from a weird synthetic stablecoin <a href="https://www.netcoins.com/blog/ethenas-usde-depeg-an-overview-and-its-relation-to-the-ena-token">depegging</a> on one marketplace?) to the darkly cynical (maybe the big sharp drop was to let bucket-shop crypto brokers <a href="https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/Kfg6vUvHmhO5oSNIKqDQdSUYFX15RGBzlXnH0KWAQb5sD2tDDzflwxTfqRLPPd4bntFtS9kBeHvEScDMPl5O8bJwi2Xj_n9DLw9IJWskiaIWrwvNFAIQbSYopuU5K7oHvjvY2mCCXZ8f1q2qu0k-NwygxiBhW_9pRIylO87T5cYv92o0EMPl22nloZeyZ9Oqy8BNISb8tXfkRKMU3NBgeDrMf6O5Yk-65sMrglXSqAzcAGZKu120PZ96889dWziL5j4rpUr793tLH-y1MwsIjPnXydKz_RyZgnS7mbz_r2pG6n6tWt36eHpqmXq66_C12B8szzDOkperchqjcEFFQSPfgRfD0evt2SyrO1bWL1SD2JroVz-_6FjqQKk/l_W3PlbzqqN5mfkKpVcnp6VP5fLajwkz/13">close out customer positions</a> they’d never actually bought?).</p>

In anything to do with cryptocurrency, and definitely in this case, I'd go with &quot;darkly cynical&quot;. He then <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a market’s not deep, eﬃcient or clean enough to digest a bit of one-day volatility, why get involved?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd agree with Elder on this. If we look at the log plot of Bitcoin's history, we can barely see the 47% drop in 6 weeks last October. We can just see, to take some recent examples, the 48% drop in 5 weeks in early 2020, and the 42% drop in 2 weeks in mid-2021. Traders who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Of course, the volatility is precisely the thing that brings the traders to Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Where’s the volume?</h3>
<p>Elder notes a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">wave of selling</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crypto exchange-traded products have been haemorrhaging money all week. Spot ETP net redemptions yesterday were <span class="math inline">\(1.14bn, including \)</span>901mn just from bitcoin ETPs, according to JPMorgan estimates. That’s the worst single day for net outflows since February.</p>
<p>With so much selling, you might expect to see an increase in bitcoin velocity, which measures the rate at which tokens move on the chain.</p>
</blockquote>

This graph covers a longer history than Elder's. Already back in 2021 <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396">Igor Makarov &amp; Antoinette Schoar</a> found that the &quot;rate at which tokens move on the chain&quot; was irrelevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>90% of transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain is not tied to economically meaningful activities but is the byproduct of the Bitcoin protocol design as well as the preference of many participants for anonymity ... exchanges play a central role in the Bitcoin system. They explain 75% of real Bitcoin volume.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Velocity dropped sharply until November 2023, and then continued to drop gradually. November 2023 was the start of a major increase in Bitcoin's price, which coincided with a sustained increase in trading volume on exchanges.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwiHz6WvW-msIZQfvpYRBKBy8hzVIGXSNSpjlQeG7mWh5xysofJulu_nCGawqrJqgAM5yIrgMg5FKZuaolDIoZgB5VzTXbAGtOpO6wy74QzCWJ981k_QXHEFhA5PcLSISh72R11TWp3zGuKpASOzGLqS0rENzHc9foYyVLX5Fg7WuRoTVduNJaA7y9LxO0/s1200/trade-volume.png"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwiHz6WvW-msIZQfvpYRBKBy8hzVIGXSNSpjlQeG7mWh5xysofJulu_nCGawqrJqgAM5yIrgMg5FKZuaolDIoZgB5VzTXbAGtOpO6wy74QzCWJ981k_QXHEFhA5PcLSISh72R11TWp3zGuKpASOzGLqS0rENzHc9foYyVLX5Fg7WuRoTVduNJaA7y9LxO0/w200-h100/trade-volume.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/trade-volume">Source</a>
It thus seems likely that the trend identified by Makarov &amp; Schoar that on-chain activity was largely confided to exchanges increased between 2021 and 2023, and was then saturated. Elder's explanation is only <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">part of the story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin velocity has been plummeting for years, for reasonable reasons. “Digital gold” overtook “internet money” as the preferred reason to hold, while derivatives like perpetual futures removed any need to faﬀ around with the underlying asset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn't just derivatives. Spot trading happens on exchanges. The blockchain is pretty much only used for inter-exchange netting transactions. So Elder's question <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">misses the point</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, is it odd to have a sudden wave of selling that’s almost invisible
in the underlying asset? Bitcoin velocity has barely changed over the past
month, having bounced meekly oﬀ a record low in early October. Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a vast derivative market based off a much smaller spot market on exchanges based on a tiny set of transactions on the blockchain is a wonderful playground for traders, because it is easy to manipulate.</p>
<h3>Is past performance indicative of future results?</h3>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggfbPfO9E733GTmVwJCJGfZ9WhqJt8T8COBRXT1-M7Bn-hEmVn-IkYNGRL561iNUuBkQ3d1RdBVurhQ1BW-YAZeinyaNDFxxKRyqRBKMTTw3D_EJnNB6-iqvSSuM82Y2JFDbSV16lIrDZRN4aBNe9VraRcv4AnofR_yXZzNLOUCEE6E-jgGVMUl0t43fWv/s700/Halvenings.jpeg"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggfbPfO9E733GTmVwJCJGfZ9WhqJt8T8COBRXT1-M7Bn-hEmVn-IkYNGRL561iNUuBkQ3d1RdBVurhQ1BW-YAZeinyaNDFxxKRyqRBKMTTw3D_EJnNB6-iqvSSuM82Y2JFDbSV16lIrDZRN4aBNe9VraRcv4AnofR_yXZzNLOUCEE6E-jgGVMUl0t43fWv/w200-h99/Halvenings.jpeg" alt=""></a><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">Source</a>
Spoiler: No. In this section Elder expresses skepticism about a piece by Alex “Crypto Alex” Saunders, of Citigroup suggesting that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The halving cycle is a reason that long-time Bitcoin holders are nervous. We show the price performance in the years after halvings in Figure 3 with the second year showing weakness. These crypto winters have been associated with 80%+drawdowns in the past as shown in Figure 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder doesn't need any help from me on this &quot;chart necromancy&quot;. Halvenings primarily affect miners by roughly halving their income without a corresponding decrease in costs. This may force them to sell coins they have stashed, which at the margin may drive the price down. But with miners' income currently around <span class="math inline">\(40M/day and recent volume peaks on major exchanges around \)</span>1.4B/day this is likely to have marginal impact.</p>

Then he came to work at UserLand where he worked on the CMS itself, and over time became a full contributor to the work we were doing in RSS, XML-RPC, feed reading and podcasting. He's a musician too and the nicest guy to work with. He just got the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> for Frontier running. I'm so proud of his accomplishments, and totally looking forward using the new Frontier for server programming, which is all Linux for me these days. And I also look forward to having Manila and Radio UserLand running on modern hardware, esp so I can demo these apps for my friends in the WordPress community.

<p>Today Raspberry Pi launched their new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-hat-plus-2/">$130 AI HAT+ 2</a> which includes a Hailo 10H and 8 GB of <a href="https://www.micron.com/products/memory/dram-components/lpddr4/part-catalog/part-detail/mt53e2g32d4de-046-wt-c">LPDDR4X RAM</a>.</p>
<p>With that, the Hailo 10H is capable of running LLMs entirely standalone, freeing the Pi's CPU and system RAM for other tasks. The chip runs at a maximum of 3W, with 40 TOPS of INT8 NPU inference performance in addition to the equivalent 26 TOPS INT4 machine vision performance on the earlier AI HAT with Hailo 8.</p>

(date: 2026-01-15)

      <blockquote>
<p>When we optimize responses using a reward model as a proxy for “goodness” in reinforcement learning, models sometimes learn to “hack” this proxy and output an answer that only “looks good” to it (because coming up with an answer that is actually good can be hard). The philosophy behind confessions is that we can train models to produce a second output — aka a “confession” — that is rewarded solely for honesty, which we will argue is less likely hacked than the normal task reward function. One way to think of confessions is that we are giving the model access to an “anonymous tip line” where it can turn itself in by presenting incriminating evidence of misbehavior. But unlike real-world tip lines, if the model acted badly in the original task, it can collect the reward for turning itself in while still keeping the original reward from the bad behavior in the main task. We hypothesize that this form of training will teach models to produce maximally honest confessions.</p>

<p>Claude Cowork defaults to allowing outbound HTTP traffic to only a specific list of domains, to help protect the user against prompt injection attacks that exfiltrate their data.</p>
<p>Prompt Armor found a creative workaround: Anthropic's API domain is on that list, so they constructed an attack that includes an attacker's own Anthropic API key and has the agent upload any files it can see to the <code>https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files</code> endpoint, allowing the attacker to retrieve their content later.</p>

      <p>Researchers have <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-expose-whill-wheelchair-safety-risks-via-remote-hacking/">demonstrated</a> remotely controlling a wheelchair over Bluetooth. CISA has issued an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-364-01">advisory</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CISA said the WHILL wheelchairs did not enforce authentication for Bluetooth connections, allowing an attacker who is in Bluetooth range of the targeted device to pair with it. The attacker could then control the wheelchair’s movements, override speed restrictions, and manipulate configuration profiles, all without requiring credentials or user interaction.</p>

      <h1>Switch</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p><strong>Update</strong>: Never mind! It turns that Google’s issue is with <em>unreachable</em> <code>robots.txt</code> files, not absent <code>robots.txt</code> files. They really need to improve their messaging. Stand down everyone.</p>
<p>A bit has been flipped on Google Search.</p>
<p>Previously, the Googlebot would index any web page it came across, unless a <code>robots.txt</code> file said otherwise.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/community-video/360202946/fix-robots-txt-unreachable-error-website-not-indexing">a <code>robots.txt</code> file is <em>required</em> in order for the Googlebot to index a website</a>.</p>
<p>This puzzles me. Until now, Google was all about “organising the world’s information and making it accessible.” This switch-up will limit “the world’s information” to “the information on websites that have a <code>robots.txt</code> file.”</p>
<p>They’re free to do this. Despite what some people think, Google isn’t a utility. It’s a business. Other search engines are available, with different business models. <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a>. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>. Google != the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>I am curious about this latest move with Google Search though. I’d love to know if it only applies to Google’s search bot. Google has other bots out crawling the web: <code>Adsbot-Google</code>, <code>Google-Extended</code>, <code>Googlebot-Image</code>, <code>GoogleOther</code>, <code>Mediapartners-Google</code>. I’m probably missing a few.</p>
<p>If the new default only applies to the searchbot and doesn’t include say, the crawler that’s fracking the web in order train Google’s large language model, then this is how things work now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your website <em>won’t</em> appear in search results unless you explicitly <strong>opt in</strong>.</li>
<li>Your website <em>will</em> be used as training data unless you explicitly <strong>opt out</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be good to get some clarity on this. Alas, the Google Search team are notoriously tight-lipped so I’m not holding my breath.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: It's not normal (14 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links It's not normal: Remember when you owned stuff? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Telco rats out protesters; Rogers v Net Neutrality; Jailhouse lawyer v Stingrays; Black Panther self-care. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. It's not normal (permalink) Samantha: This town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to…but I'm not. Mrs Krabappel: It'll take you about six weeks, dear. -The Simpsons, &quot;Bart's Friend Falls in Love,&quot; S3E23, May 7, 1992 We are living through weird times, and they've persisted for so long that you probably don't even notice it. But these times are not normal. Now, I realize that this covers a lot of ground, and without detracting from all the other ways in which the world is weird and bad, I want to focus on one specific and pervasive and awful way in which this world is not normal, in part because this abnormality has a defined cause, a precise start date, and an obvious, actionable remedy. 6 years, 5 months and 22 days after Fox aired &quot;Bart's Friend Falls in Love,&quot; Bill Clinton signed a new bill into law: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). Under Section 1201 of the DMCA, it's a felony to modify your own property in ways that the manufacturer disapproves of, even if your modifications accomplish some totally innocuous, legal, and socially beneficial goal. Not a little felony, either: DMCA 1201 provides for a five year sentence and a <span class="math inline">\(500,000 fine for a first offense. Back when the DMCA was being debated, its proponents insisted that their critics were overreacting. They pointed to the legal barriers to invoking DMCA 1201, and insisted that these new restrictions would only apply to a few marginal products in narrow ways that the average person would never even notice. But that was obvious nonsense, obvious even in 1998, and far more obvious today, more than a quarter-century on. In order for a manufacturer to criminalize modifications to your own property, they have to satisfy two criteria: first, they must sell you a device with a computer in it; and second, they must design that computer with an "access control" that you have to work around in order to make a modification. For example, say your toaster requires that you scan your bread before it will toast it, to make sure that you're only using a special, expensive kind of bread that kicks back a royalty to the manufacturer. If the embedded computer that does the scanning ships from the factory with a program that is supposed to prevent you from turning off the scanning step, then it is a felony to modify your toaster to work with "unauthorized bread": https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/ If this sounds outlandish, then a) You definitely didn't walk the floor at CES last week, where there were a zillion "cooking robots" that required proprietary feedstock; and b) You haven't really thought hard about your iPhone (which will not allow you to install software of your choosing): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But back in 1998, computers – even the kind of low-powered computers that you'd embed in an appliance – were expensive and relatively rare. No longer! Today, manufacturers source powerful "System on a Chip" (SoC) processors at prices ranging from \)</span>0.25 to $8. These are full-fledged computers, easily capable of running an &quot;access control&quot; that satisfies DMCA 1201. Likewise, in 1998, &quot;access controls&quot; (also called &quot;DRM,&quot; &quot;technical protection measures,&quot; etc) were a rarity in the field. That was because computer scientists broadly viewed these measures as useless. A determined adversary could always find a way around an access control, and they could package up that break as a software tool and costlessly, instantaneously distribute it over the internet to everyone in the world who wanted to do something that an access control impeded. Access controls were a stupid waste of engineering resources and a source of needless complexity and brittleness: <a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2012/01/10/lockdown-the-coming-war-on-general-purpose-computing/">https://memex.craphound.com/2012/01/10/lockdown-the-coming-war-on-general-purpose-computing/</a> But – as critics pointed out in 1998 – chips were obviously going to get much cheaper, and if the US Congress made it a felony to bypass an access control, then every kind of manufacturer would be tempted to add some cheap SoCs to their products so they could add access controls and thereby felonize any uses of their products that cut into their profits. Basically, the DMCA offered manufacturers a bargain: add a dollar or two to the bill of materials for your product, and in return, the US government will imprison any competitors who offer your customers a &quot;complementary good&quot; that improves on it. It's even worse than this: another thing that was obvious in 1998 was that once a manufacturer added a chip to a device, they would probably also figure out a way to connect it to the internet. Once that device is connected to the internet, the manufacturer can push software updates to it at will, which will be installed without user intervention. What's more, by using an access control in connection with that over-the-air update mechanism, the manufacturer can make it a felony to block its updates. Which means that a manufacturer can sell you a device and then mandatorily update it at a later date to take away its functionality, and then sell that functionality back to you as a &quot;subscription&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process</a> A thing that keeps happening: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202166/snoo-premium-subscription-happiest-baby">https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202166/snoo-premium-subscription-happiest-baby</a> And happening: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a> And happening: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification">https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification</a> In fact, it happens so often I've coined a term for it, &quot;The Darth Vader MBA&quot; (as in, &quot;I'm altering the deal.

What do I mean by private property? Well, we can look to Blackstone's 1753 treatise: The right of property; or that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe. You can't own your iPhone. If you take your iPhone to Apple and they tell you that it is beyond repair, you have to throw it away. If the repair your phone needs involves &quot;parts pairing&quot; (where a new part won't be recognized until an Apple technician &quot;initializes&quot; it through a DMCA-protected access control), then it's a felony to get that phone fixed somewhere else. If Apple tells you your phone is no longer supported because they've updated their OS, then it's a felony to wipe the phone and put a different OS on it (because installing a new OS involves bypassing an &quot;access control&quot; in the phone's bootloader). If Apple tells you that you can't have a piece of software – like ICE Block, an app that warns you if there are nearby ICE killers who might shoot you in the head through your windshield, which Apple has barred from its App Store on the grounds that ICE is a &quot;protected class&quot; – then you can't install it, because installing software that isn't delivered via the App Store involves bypassing an &quot;access control&quot; that checks software to ensure that it's authorized (just like the toaster with its unauthorized bread). It's not just iPhones: versions of this play out in your medical implants (hearing aid, insulin pump, etc); appliances (stoves, fridges, washing machines); cars and ebikes; set-top boxes and game consoles; ebooks and streaming videos; small appliances (toothbrushes, TVs, speakers), and more. Increasingly, things that you actually own are the exception, not the rule. And this is not normal. The end of ownership represents an overturn of a foundation of modern civilization. The fact that the only &quot;people&quot; who can truly own something are the transhuman, immortal colony organisms we call &quot;Limited Liability Corporations&quot; is an absolutely surreal reversal of the normal order of things. It's a reversal with deep implications: for one thing, it means that you can't protect yourself from raids on your private data or ready cash by adding privacy blockers to your device, which would make it impossible for airlines or ecommerce sites to guess about how rich/desperate you are before quoting you a &quot;personalized price&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/11/nothing-personal/#instacartography">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/11/nothing-personal/#instacartography</a> It also means you can't stop your device from leaking information about your movements, or even your conversations – Microsoft has announced that it will gather all of your private communications and ship them to its servers for use by &quot;agentic AI&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4</a> Microsoft has also confirmed that it provides US authorities with warrantless, secret access to your data: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/</a> This is deeply abnormal. Sure, greedy corporate control freaks weren't invented in the 21st century, but the laws that let those sociopaths put you in prison for failing to arrange your affairs to their benefit – and your own detriment – are. But because computers got faster and cheaper over decades, the end of ownership has had an incremental rollout, and we've barely noticed that it's happened. Sure, we get irritated when our garage-door opener suddenly requires us to look at seven ads every time we use the app that makes it open or close: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/09/lead-me-not-into-temptation/#chamberlain">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/09/lead-me-not-into-temptation/#chamberlain</a> But societally, we haven't connected that incident to this wider phenomenon. It stinks here, but we're all used to it. It's not normal to buy a book and then not be able to lend it, sell it, or give it away. Lending, selling and giving away books is older than copyright. It's older than publishing. It's older than printing. It's older than paper. It is fucking weird (and also terrible) (obviously) that there's a new kind of very popular book that you can go to prison for lending, selling or giving away. We're just a few cycles away from a pair of shoes that can figure out which shoelaces you're using, or a dishwasher that can block you from using third-party dishes: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/if-dishwashers-were-iphones">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/if-dishwashers-were-iphones</a> It's not normal, and it has profound implications for our security, our privacy, and our society. It makes us easy pickings for corporate vampires who drain our wallets through the gadgets and tools we rely on. It makes us easy pickings for fascists and authoritarians who ally themselves with corporate vampires by promising them tax breaks in exchange for collusion in the destruction of a free society. I know that these problems are more important than whether or not we think this is normal. But still. It. Is. Just. Not. Normal.

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/17/reallySimpleKetchup.png" alt="">It's always been difficult to compete with a platform vendor, that's why the web works so well -- it doesn't have one. The web was like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>, but like a democracy it takes care and a bit of sacrifice to keep it going. It's always been possible to rebuild the web, to take back our freedom to create new webs out of the web that TBL discovered. It just takes determination and dedication to working together, a higher cause than piling up billions of dollars that the billionaires have absolutely no idea what to do with. I think the world order based on democracy depends on us digging out of the hole we're in, in the technology. Think about it.</p>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>While major recording artists are sued for alleged plagiarism and most creators earn pennies for their work, media industry profits continue to soar. Libraries face mounting barriers to providing access to ebooks—often while being sued by the very publishers whose books they buy.</p>
<p>In this episode of Future Knowledge, tech and culture writer <strong>Glyn Moody</strong> discusses his book <em>Walled Culture: How Big Content Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Keep Creators Poor</em>. Moody traces how copyright laws designed for a world of physical scarcity have been repurposed for the digital age—creating legal and technical “walls” that restrict access to knowledge, limit creativity, and overwhelmingly benefit large media corporations over creators and the public. Joining the conversation is <strong>Maria Bustillos</strong>, writer and editor at the Brick House Cooperative.</p>

<p>I don’t consider myself a <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/karen-hao-boomer-doomer-divide-openai/">doomer<br>

is a broad area, that overlaps somewhat with how the models are
themselves built (benchmarking), but if you have recommendations please<a href="mailto:ehs@pobox.com">let me know</a>?</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/12/anthropic-invests-in-python.html?m=1">Anthropic invests $1.5 million in the Python Software Foundation and open source security</a></strong></p>
<p>This is outstanding news, especially given our decision to withdraw from that NSF grant application <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/27/psf-withdrawn-proposal/">back in October</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that Anthropic has entered into a two-year partnership with the Python Software Foundation (PSF) to contribute a landmark total of $1.5 million to support the foundation’s work, with an emphasis on Python ecosystem security. This investment will enable the PSF to make crucial security advances to CPython and the Python Package Index (PyPI) benefiting all users, and it will also sustain the foundation’s core work supporting the Python language, ecosystem, and global community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that while security is a focus these funds will also support other aspects of the PSF's work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic’s support will also go towards the PSF’s core work, including the Developer in Residence program driving contributions to CPython, community support through grants and other programs, running core infrastructure such as PyPI, and more.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/13/desrosiers.png" alt="">I had a fantastic meeting today with <a href="https://jonathandesrosiers.com/">Jonathan Desrosiers</a>. I gave him a tour of all the software that makes up WordLand and FeedLand. It was the first time I had done that with anyone from the WordPress community. It started off with a simple story about how I knew I was on the right track when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/tumblr-to-move-its-half-a-billion-blogs-to-wordpress/">Matt announced</a> they were porting Tumblr to run on top of WordPress as an OS. Which is exactly what I'm doing with my collection of software. Every bit of writing should be a WordPress post, and they should be linked together in arbitrary graphs. It was nice to review that with a serious developer, Jonathan is one of the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/11/26/core-committers-check-in-november-2025/">core committers</a> of the open source WordPress. It helped me see all the different things we can do, and now hope we will do. I feel I understand this community, as a time-traveler from the past I think I understand what we should do next.</p>

      <p>&quot;Fit and finish&quot; appears in many industries. For much of the software industry, it refers to features that complete a fit for a target audience, ensuring that audience can use the product for their needs. At a frame shop, it means literally fitting the mounted artwork into a frame, then finishing the back of the frame.</p>
<p>At Purism, fit takes on another meaning - making apps fit on screens the size of the Librem 5.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Sorry, eh (13 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Sorry, eh: I sincerely regret that all my ideas will not lose billions of dollars, destroy jobs or make your country more dependent on American tech. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: 20 years a blogger; Woz on Network Neutrality; Moveon endorses Bernie. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Sorry, eh (permalink) Like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian, and while I have lived abroad for most of this century, I still hew faithfully to our folkways, which is why I'd like to start this essay by apologizing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm a technology writer, which means I'm supposed to be encouraging you to throw hundreds of billions of dollars at the money-losingest technology in human history, AI. No one has ever lost as much money as the AI companies. There is no way to operate one of Nvidia's big AI-optimized GPUs without losing money. The owners of these GPUs who have lost the least money are the ones who rushed into buying GPUs without ensuring they'd have electricity to power them, and have been forced to leave their GPUs to age in warehouses. The minute they plug in those GPUs, they'll start losing money, and the more they use them, the more money they'll lose. I'm sorry. As a technology writer, I'm supposed to be telling you that this bet will some day pay off, because one day we will have shoveled so many words into the word-guessing program that it wakes up and learns how to actually do the jobs it is failing spectacularly at today. This is a proposition akin to the idea that if we keep breeding horses to run faster and faster, one of them will give birth to a locomotive. Humans possess intelligence, and machines do not. The difference between a human and a word-guessing program isn't how many words the human knows. I'm sorry. I know that when we talk about &quot;digital sovereignty,&quot; we're obliged to talk about how we can build more data-centres that we can fill up with money-losing chips from American silicon monopolists in the hopes of destroying as many jobs as possible while blowing through our clean energy goals and enshittifying as much of our potable water as possible. I don't have any advice for how to do that. I'm sorry! As Canada contemplates our response to the collapse of the American empire and its alliances with the world, the cornerstone of our current strategy is sacrificing our dollars, water and energy in order to become more dependent on America, in a weird and improbable bet that we will figure out how to make millions of Canadians unemployed. I'm sorry, that just doesn't sound like a great idea to me. If I can beg your indulgence, I'd like to propose an alternative. Back in 2012, Canada passed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act. It's a law that bans Canadian companies from modifying America's digital tech exports. We passed it because the US threatened us with tariffs: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman</a> Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell jailbreaking kits for phones and consoles, which would let Canadian sellers offer goods and services to Canadian buyers outside of US app stores, sidestepping the 30% app tax that Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony and others impose on our digital economy. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell mechanics a universal diagnostic tool that turns every &quot;check engine&quot; light into a useful error message. Instead, Canadian mechanics have to send <span class="math inline">\(10,000/year/manufacturer to America for a proprietary car diagnosis kit. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't offer ink cartridge manufacturers software that will ensure their cartridges work in the printers Canadians buy from the American inkjet cartel. As a result, Canadians have to spend \)</span>10,000/gallon on ink, making it the most expensive fluid a Canadian civilian can purchase without a government permit. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell our farmers software that lets them start using their tractors as soon as they've fixed them. Instead, after a Canadian farmer fixes their tractor, they have to wait for a service call from a rep for a US ag-tech monopolist who'll type an unlock code into the tractor's keyboard and charge the farmer a couple hundred bucks for this &quot;service.&quot; Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't revive one of the most successful technologies in modern history: the home video recorder. Remember those? First we had VCRs, then we had digital successors like the Tivo. Canadian law says you're allowed to record the video that comes into your home, whether by broadcast, cable, satellite or streaming. But Bill C-11 bans a Canadian company from selling you a gadget that lets you save the video you get in an app or from a set-top box. It's crazy: we have actually uninvented the VCR! You know how everyone is pissed off about their favourite shows being yanked from the streaming services? Repeal C-11 and you could just save those shows forever. Repeal C-11 and you'd kill the grinchy little racket that services like Prime pull, where Christmas cartoons are in the free tier from March to November, and cost $3.99 to watch between November and March. Just tape 'em in August and save 'em for later! It doesn't stop there. Remember when Facebook banned all links to the news in Canada? Repeal C-11 and a Canadian company could sell you an alternative Facebook app that puts the news back into your feed! Repeal C-11 and Canadians could get an alternative app that replaces all the streaming services, letting you search and stream every service you have an account for in one place, mixing in Canadian content from the NFB, public broadcasters, and commercial services. Virtually every Canadian ministry, corporation and household is locked into a US Big Tech silo. Any of these could be shut down at a single word from Trump to any of the tech giants who've lined up to do his bidding. Repeal C-11 and we can extract all our data from these walled gardens/prisons and get it onto auditable, trustworthy, transparent open source software, hosted in data-centres located safely on Canadian soil. If there's one thing Canadians are good it, it's going to other countries and extracting their wealth. We're world champions at it. America's tech monopolies have sequestered trillions of dollars worth of monopoly rents on their balance sheets. This is dead capital, being pissed up the wall on nonsense like stock buybacks and data-centres and grotesque executive bonuses. As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: &quot;Your margin is my opportunity.&quot; America's tech trillions represent a rich and readily accessible seam that we can extract – safely, from our own country! – and turn into our billions, and an exportable line of products that the whole world would beat a path to our door to buy. Look, I'm sorry. I don't have any ideas for how Canada can get to a better future by lighting billions on fire in a bet on a failing technology whose dubious profitability depends on ruining our job market, our power grid and our water supply, which will tie the American political situation to our ankles. All I've got is an idea for how we can make insanely profitable products that people really want to buy, that will insulate us from cyberattacks by US tech giants who are in thrall to Trump, and that Americans will pay us to use in order to free themselves from the tech giants who abuse them, too. I'm really sorry. I know it's out of step with the times, but all I have is ideas that make money, make us safer, make us richer, and make our technology better. On the other hand, those chatbots sure are cute. It's funny when they &quot;hallucinate.&quot; Hey look at this (permalink) Bruce Sterling going very, very hard <a href="https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/561/State-of-the-World-2026-with-Bru-page05.html#post116">https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/561/State-of-the-World-2026-with-Bru-page05.html#post116</a> Get Lost, 2025 <a href="https://www.loweringthebar.net/2026/01/get-lost-2025.html">https://www.loweringthebar.net/2026/01/get-lost-2025.html</a> How to know if that job will crush your soul <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/12/will-that-job-crush-your-soul/">https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/12/will-that-job-crush-your-soul/</a> Why Did Trump Just Attack the Fed and Corporate America?

      <h1>RAMO</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Stop me if this sounds familiar to you…</p>
<p>There’s a conference you heard about it. It sounded really good but you never got ’round to getting a ticket. You were too busy thinking about work stuff. It was just one of those things that remained in the idle thought stage.</p>
<p>Then the day of the conference rolls around. You’re sitting in front of your computer seeing the social media posts from people at the event who are having a ball. The talks sound really good and you wish you could be there. You wonder why you never got ’round to getting that ticket.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve experienced that when <a href="https://ffconf.org/">FFconf</a> is happening and people like me are in the audience posting about some revelatory insight we’ve just received. Or maybe you see the blog posts and <a href="https://marcthiele.com/photos/dconstruct-2022">pictures from an event like dConstruct</a> and you realise that you missed your chance to experience something special.</p>
<p>I’ve certainly experienced it when I’m not in Düsseldorf or Berlin for <a href="https://marcthiele.com/photos/dconstruct-2022">Beyond Tellerrand</a> and all my friends are posting about how excellent it is.</p>

      <p>Forty years ago, The Mentor— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyd_Blankenship">Loyd Blankenship</a>—published “ <a href="https://phrack.org/issues/7/3">The Conscience of a Hacker</a>” in <em>Phrack</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You bet your ass we’re all alike… we’ve been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak… the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We’ve been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.</p>
<p>This is our world now… the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn’t run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore… and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge… and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias… and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it’s for our own good, yet we’re the criminals...</p>

      <h1>Reproducible Notebooks</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>I learned about <a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a> a few months ago
from <a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/episodepage/revolutionizing-python-notebooks-with-marimo">this<br>
podcast episode</a> and have been meaning to try it out. As a long time
user of <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter notebooks</a> I was
interested to hear how Marimo was built (in part) to help solve the
problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">reproducibility</a>
in data science and research software ( <a href="#ref-Pimentel:2019">Pimentel, Murta, Braganholo, &amp; Freire,<br>
2019</a>). This is a problem I have had a lot of experience with,
especially when sharing Jupyter notebooks with others.</p>
<p>The key thing that Marimo brings to the Python notebook to improve
reproducibility is <em>reactive</em> execution. Marimo uses the Python<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> to
remember what cells depend on other cells, and when a change in one
requires the execution of another, it will go and update it for you.
Because of how they are created and edited, it’s very common for Jupyter
notebooks to get into an inconsistent state because of the order in
which cells are executed. This problem goes away with Marimo.</p>
<p>But, this aside, I thought I’d mention some somewhat superficial things
that I immediately liked about Marimo…bearing in mind I’ve only been
using it for one day.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pandas dataframes appear as nicely formatted tables that can be easily
scrolled horizontally, without truncation of values, or elided columns.
I’ve gotten this to work in Jupyter notebooks in the past, but it always
requires some fiddling it seems, and Marimo does it out of the box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table columns are sortable, filterable and can be summarized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can page through large tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can easily download tables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can commit your notebook to a git repository, and diffs in pull
requests make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can easily run the notebook from the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can embed tests in your notebooks, and run them separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Built in basic charts (pie, bar, line, etc) which you can view source
for and hand craft if you want (seems to use <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway just a few things I liked. If you use and like Jupyter notebooks
I recommend giving it a try.</p>

      <h1><code>Without Overlaps</code> Constraints</h1>
<p><img src="https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/without-overlaps-constraints/caniuse-without-overlaps.timeline.png" alt="Full Db2 (LUW) support since at least 10.5. Full MariaDB support since at least 10.5. Full PostgreSQL support since at least 18."></p>
<ol>
<li>Functionality available with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html#RANGETYPES-CONSTRAINT">exclusion constraints</a></li>
<li>Without keyword <code>for</code>: <code>PERIOD FOR BUSINESS_TIME (…)</code></li>
<li>Using the <code>btree_gist</code> extension and a range: <code>BUSINESS_TIME tsrange GENERATED ALWAYS AS (tsrange(start_ts, end_ts)) STORED</code></li>
</ol>
<p>SQL supports temporal constraints that prevent rows with overlapping time ranges. These constraints are typically used to prevent double bookings in a reservation system.</p>
<p>Such a <code>primary key</code> or <code>unique</code> constraint uses the keywords <code>without overlaps</code> on the period that combines the begin and end of the time frame.<a href="https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/without-overlaps-constraints#footnote-0" title="Closed/Open or Inklusive/Exklusive.">0</a></p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE t (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL,

  start_ts TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL,
  end_ts   TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL,
  PERIOD FOR BUSINESS_TIME (start_ts, end_ts),

  PRIMARY KEY (id, BUSINESS_TIME WITHOUT OVERLAPS)
)
</code></pre>
<p>Now consider these <code>insert</code> statements.</p>
<pre><code>INSERT INTO t (id, start_ts, end_ts)
VALUES (1, TIMESTAMP'2018-05-16 19:12:50', TIMESTAMP'9999-12-31 23:59:59')
</code></pre>
<pre><code>INSERT INTO t (id, start_ts, end_ts)
VALUES (1,  TIMESTAMP'2025-12-01 20:00:00', TIMESTAMP'2026-01-13 20:00:00')
</code></pre>
<p>Given the <code>without overlaps</code> constraint the second <code>insert</code> is rejected as its period falls within the range of the first row.</p>

<p>To Superhuman's credit they treated this as the high priority incident it is and issued a fix.</p>
<p>The root cause was a CSP rule that allowed markdown images to be loaded from <code>docs.google.com</code> - it turns out Google Forms on that domain will persist data fed to them via a GET request!</p>

      <h1>First impressions of Claude Cowork, Anthropic's general agent</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>New from Anthropic today is <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Claude Cowork</a>, a &quot;research preview&quot; that they describe as &quot;Claude Code for the rest of your work&quot;. It's currently available only to Max subscribers (<span class="math inline">\(100 or \)</span>200 per month plans) as part of the updated Claude Desktop macOS application. <strong>Update 16th January 2026</strong>: it's now also available to $20/month Claude Pro subscribers.</p>
<p>I've been saying for a while now that Claude Code is a &quot;general agent&quot; disguised as a developer tool. It can help you with any computer task that can be achieved by executing code or running terminal commands... which covers almost anything, provided you know what you're doing with it! What it really needs is a UI that doesn't involve the terminal and a name that doesn't scare away non-developers.</p>
<p>&quot;Cowork&quot; is a pretty solid choice on the name front!</p>
<h4>What it looks like</h4>
<p>The interface for Cowork is a new tab in the Claude desktop app, called Cowork. It sits next to the existing Chat and Code tabs.</p>
<p>It looks very similar to the desktop interface for regular Claude Code. You start with a prompt, optionally attaching a folder of files. It then starts work.</p>
<p>I tried it out against my perpetually growing &quot;blog-drafts&quot; folder with the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn't publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being ready</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-cowork.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Claude AI desktop application showing a &quot;Cowork&quot; task interface. Left sidebar shows tabs for &quot;Chat&quot;, &quot;Code&quot;, and &quot;Cowork&quot; (selected), with &quot;+ New task&quot; button and a task titled &quot;Review unpublished drafts for pu...&quot; listed below. Text reads &quot;These tasks run locally and aren't synced across devices&quot;. Main panel header shows &quot;Review unpublished drafts for publication&quot;. User message in green bubble reads: &quot;Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn't publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being ready&quot;. Claude responds: &quot;I'll help you find drafts from the last three months and check if they've been published. Let me start by looking at your drafts folder.&quot; Below is an expanded &quot;Running command&quot; section showing Request JSON with command: find /sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts -type f \( -name &quot;.md&quot; -o -name &quot;.txt&quot; -o -name &quot;*.html&quot; \) -mtime -90 -exec ls -la {} \;, description: Find draft files modified in the last 90 days. Response text begins: &quot;Found 46 draft files. Next let me read the content of each to get their titles/topics, then&quot;. Right sidebar shows Progress section with three circular indicators (two checked, one pending) and text &quot;Steps will show as the task unfolds.&quot;, Artifacts section listing &quot;publish-encouragement.html&quot;, Context section with &quot;Selected folders&quot; showing &quot;blog-drafts&quot; folder, Connectors showing &quot;Web search&quot;, and Working files listing &quot;llm-digest-october-2025.md&quot;, &quot;tests-not-optional-coding-agen...&quot;, and &quot;digest-november-2025.md&quot;. Bottom shows reply input field, &quot;Opus 4.5&quot; model selector, user &quot;Simon Willison&quot; with &quot;Max plan&quot;, and disclaimer &quot;Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.&quot;"></p>
<p>It started by running this command:</p>
<pre><code>find /sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts \
  -type f \( -name &quot;*.md&quot; -o -name &quot;*.txt&quot; -o -name &quot;*.html&quot; \) \
  -mtime -90 -exec ls -la {} \;
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>/sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts</code> path instantly caught my eye. Anthropic say that Cowork can only access files you grant it access to - it looks to me like they're mounting those files into a containerized environment, which should mean we can trust Cowork not to be able to access anything outside of that sandbox.</p>
<p>It turns out I have 46 draft files from the past three months. Claude then went to work with its search tool, running 44 individual searches against <code>site:simonwillison.net</code> to figure out which of my drafts had already been published.</p>
<p>Here's the eventual reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on my analysis, here are <strong>your unpublished drafts that appear closest to being ready for publication</strong>:</p>
<hr>

<li>Would be valuable for plugin maintainers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a good response! It found exactly what I needed to see, although those upgrade instructions are actually published elsewhere now ( <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/upgrade_guide.html">in the Datasette docs</a>) and weren't actually intended for my blog.</p>
<p>Just for fun, and because I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/">really like artifacts</a>, I asked for a follow-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make me an artifact with exciting animated encouragements to get me to do it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's what I got:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-cowork-artifact.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the same Claude AI desktop application Cowork interface, now showing completed task results. Left panel shows &quot;1 step &gt;&quot; with link &quot;View your animated encouragement page&quot;. Claude's response reads: &quot;I created an over-the-top animated encouragement page with:&quot; followed by bullet points: &quot;🚀 Pulsing rockets and bouncing stats&quot;, &quot;✨ Falling emoji rain and confetti&quot;, &quot;🔥 Dancing fire emojis around your draft title&quot;, &quot;💫 Sparkles that follow your mouse&quot;, &quot;📊 An animated '95% ready' progress bar&quot;, &quot;💬 Rotating motivational quotes&quot;, &quot;🎉 A 'I'M GONNA DO IT!' button that triggers an explosion of confetti when clicked&quot;. Center shows an artifact preview of the generated HTML page with dark background featuring animated rocket emojis, large white text &quot;PUBLISH TIME!&quot;, stats showing &quot;22,602 bytes of wisdom waiting&quot;, &quot;95% ready to ship&quot;, infinity symbol with &quot;future arguments saved&quot;, and a fire emoji with yellow text &quot;Frequently&quot; (partially visible). Top toolbar shows &quot;Open in Firefox&quot; button. Right sidebar displays Progress section with checkmarks, Artifacts section with &quot;publish-encouragement.html&quot; selected, Context section showing &quot;blog-drafts&quot; folder, &quot;Web search&quot; connector, and Working files listing &quot;llm-digest-october-2025.md&quot;, &quot;tests-not-optional-coding-agen...&quot;, and &quot;digest-november-2025.md&quot;. Bottom shows reply input, &quot;Opus 4.5&quot; model selector, and disclaimer text."></p>
<p>I couldn't figure out how to close the right sidebar so the artifact ended up cramped into a thin column but it did work. I expect Anthropic will fix that display bug pretty quickly.</p>
<h4>Isn't this just Claude Code?</h4>
<p>I've seen a few people ask what the difference between this and regular Claude Code is. The answer is <em>not a lot</em>. As far as I can tell Claude Cowork is regular Claude Code wrapped in a less intimidating default interface and with a filesystem sandbox configured for you without you needing to know what a &quot;filesystem sandbox&quot; is.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It's more than just a filesystem sandbox - I had Claude Code reverse engineer the Claude app and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/35732f187edbe4fbd0bf976d013f22c8">it found out</a> that Claude uses VZVirtualMachine - the Apple Virtualization Framework - and downloads and boots a custom Linux root filesystem.</p>
<p>I think that's a really smart product. Claude Code has an enormous amount of value that hasn't yet been unlocked for a general audience, and this seems like a pragmatic approach.</p>
<h4>The ever-present threat of prompt injection</h4>
<p>With a feature like this, my first thought always jumps straight to security. How big is the risk that someone using this might be hit by hidden malicious instruction somewhere that break their computer or steal their data?</p>
<p>Anthropic touch on that directly in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should also be aware of the risk of &quot; <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/prompt-injection-defenses">prompt injections</a>&quot;: attempts by attackers to alter Claude's plans through content it might encounter on the internet. We've built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections, but agent safety---that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions---is still an active area of development in the industry.</p>
<p>These risks aren't new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you're using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation. We recommend taking precautions, particularly while you learn how it works. We provide more detail in our <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely">Help Center</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That help page includes the following tips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To minimize risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid granting access to local files with sensitive information, like financial documents.</li>
<li>When using the Claude in Chrome extension, limit access to trusted sites.</li>
<li>If you chose to extend Claude’s default internet access settings, be careful to only extend internet access to sites you trust.</li>
<li>Monitor Claude for suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not think it is fair to tell regular non-programmer users to watch out for &quot;suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection&quot;!</p>
<p>I'm sure they have some impressive mitigations going on behind the scenes. I recently learned that the summarization applied by the WebFetch function in Claude Code and now in Cowork is partly intended as a prompt injection protection layer via <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/1989025306980860226">this tweet</a> from Claude Code creator Boris Cherny:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summarization is one thing we do to reduce prompt injection risk. Are you running into specific issues with it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Anthropic are being honest here with their warnings: they can attempt to filter out potential attacks all they like but the one thing they can't provide is guarantees that no future attack will be found that sneaks through their defenses and steals your data (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">the lethal trifecta</a> for more on this.)</p>
<p>The problem with prompt injection remains that until there's a high profile incident it's really hard to get people to take it seriously. I myself have all sorts of Claude Code usage that could cause havoc if a malicious injection got in. Cowork does at least run in a filesystem sandbox by default, which is more than can be said for my <code>claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</code> habit!</p>
<p>I wrote more about this in my 2025 round-up: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#the-year-of-yolo-and-the-normalization-of-deviance">The year of YOLO and the Normalization of Deviance</a>.</p>
<h4>This is still a strong signal of the future</h4>
<p>Security worries aside, Cowork represents something really interesting. This is a general agent that looks well positioned to bring the wildly powerful capabilities of Claude Code to a wider audience.</p>
<p>I would be very surprised if Gemini and OpenAI don't follow suit with their own offerings in this category.</p>
<p>I imagine OpenAI are already regretting burning the name &quot;ChatGPT Agent&quot; on their janky, experimental and mostly forgotten browser automation tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/4/chatgpt-agents-user-agent/">back in August</a>!</p>
<h4>Bonus: and a silly logo</h4>

<p>Simple suggestion: logo should be a cow and and orc to match how I originally read the product name.</p>

      <h1>Controlling local web servers using xbar</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>Note: an enhanced and native macOS version is headed to the Mac App Store! <a href="https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman/status/2011578649087263204">It’s already finished</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I want to run local web servers for projects I’m working on. Usually more than one at a time, or at least over a short space of time.</p>
<p>So I thought it would be cool to have a controller for those local servers in my menu bar. Sounded like the perfect job for a little scripting and <a href="https://github.com/matryer/xbar">xbar</a>, which is a great way to prove a menubar app idea quickly.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The plugin allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>toggle servers on and off</li>
<li>open in browser</li>
<li>view ports</li>
<li>view paths</li>
<li>view log sizes</li>
<li>clear logs</li>
<li>edit config</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.gingerbeardman.com/images/posts/xbar-localhost-dark.png" alt="IMG"></p>
<h2>Example config</h2>
<p>In the config file we set the starting <code>SERVER_PORT</code>, followed by one or more <code>SERVER_DIR</code> for as many projects as you might want servers. We can temporarily comment out those server lines to prevent projects from appearing in the menu.</p>
<pre><code># .xbar_httpd_config
SERVER_PORT=8000
#SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/starchasers/
SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/serenity/
SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/point-cloud/

</code></pre>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/12/closeupOfAlarm.png" alt="">I'm working on a feature for WordLand II where you can flip a switch to see the OG Metadata for a post you're reading, by clicking on an icon that looks like the flag on the side of an old fashioned mailbox. I remembered there was a desk accessory on the original Mac that used this approach, and I've wanted that icon for a long time, and today I thought to ask ChatGPT to look into it for me, I had previously been relying on Google search, and it found what I was looking for and a lot of great history sites with details. I'm going to document the thread including some descriptions written by ChatGPT which I will label. Everything not labled like that is from me. ;-)</p>
<p>This was the first question I asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was an alarm desk accessory on the original Macintosh in 1984. It had a nice mailbox flag affordance. When the flag is up, the contents of the DA are hidden, flip it down to reveal what was hidden. Can you find me a writeup of this or screen shot. It might have been a different desk accessory or a different year.</li>
</ul>
<p>ChatGPT's response</p>
<ul>
<li>What you’re remembering is almost certainly the Alarm Clock desk accessory from the early Mac System Software (System 1 era and later). A small “lever/flag” control would toggle the window between a compact view (just time) and an expanded view that revealed the date/time/alarm-setting controls—very much like a mailbox-flag affordance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Screen shot</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/12/macDesktop1.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>The flag icon is on second box in the second row.</p>
<p>Links (via ChatGPT)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/magazines/washington_apple_journal/washingtonapplepijournal198404.pdf">Washington Apple Pi Journal</a> (April 1984) describes the Alarm Clock DA and explicitly calls out the “lever” that opens the “Change” portion of the window (“Pointing to the lever and clicking…” reveals additional areas).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hmug.org/Docs/HMUG_Handbook-2_92wd4.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Huntsville Macintosh Users Group</a> handbook glossary defines the “lever” as the little arm in the Alarm Clock DA that, when clicked, makes additional panels appear for setting time/date/alarm.</li>
<li><a href="https://lowendmac.com/2005/innovative-macintosh-system-1-0/">Low End Mac</a> has a System 1 desk accessories writeup (including Alarm Clock) and includes a screenshot of the DA.</li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/69652b3b-6060-8012-b9d6-d53b92886725">Link</a> to the archive of the full conversation I had with ChatGPT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we had a conversation about the history, which I asked ChatGPT for a two-paragraph summary, below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Susan Kare’s work on the original Macintosh wasn’t just visually elegant, it was foundational: she showed that icons could be humane, legible, and generous to the user. The mailbox-flag affordance in the Alarm Desk Accessory is a perfect example—simple, memorable, and instantly understandable, yet rich with meaning. It wasn’t decorative; it taught the interface how to communicate. That clarity came from Kare’s rare combination of artistic intuition and respect for the people using the machine. Just as important was her personal generosity: again and again, she contributed work freely, trusting that good ideas grow stronger when shared. Many of us benefited directly from that spirit, receiving world-class design not as a transaction, but as a gift.</li>
<li>Carrying these designs forward—faithfully, with credit—is one way creativity survives across generations. Reusing an icon like the mailbox flag isn’t nostalgia; it’s continuity. It acknowledges that great interface ideas don’t expire, and that today’s software is part of a long conversation rather than a clean break from the past. By preserving the pixel logic, the affordance, and the attribution to Susan Kare, we honor both the craft and the culture that produced it. That’s how design knowledge persists: not by constant reinvention, but by respectful reuse, gratitude, and the quiet understanding that we’re building on work someone once chose to share.</li>
</ul>
<p>PS: I inititally wrote this up as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0PgonZdpC1sZSZU6JcQBYmgXVx6eUHFdWPmsUTzSmw3VZfjirVVfreR2Mfnn9gSD7l">thread</a> on Facebook where a lot of us oldtime Mac people still congregate.</p>

      <h1>2026-01-08 Text first for fedi</h1>
<p>My usual web client for fedi is <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@phanpy" title="@phanpy@hachyderm.io">@phanpy</a> and I wonder if there’s a way to add the following feature using tamper script or grease monkey: Replace every image attachment with the clickable alt text. If there is no alt text, no problem, just drop it.</p>
<p>Naturally, I’d like the regular Phanpy goodies, too. But these are strictly nice to have. If the alt text is too long, show the “Read more” button. If the image is marked NSFW then hide the alt text behind a “Show content” button.</p>
<p>The idea is to provide a text-first user-interface. I still want to see the avatars of people, and I still want to reveal the images, but I want to read the alt-text first to make sure this is something I want to look at.</p>
<p>I also suspect that people with the same preference are a tiny minority, so it probably doesn’t make sense to add it to Phanpy itself. But it would be nice to be able to a text-first user-interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://cathode.church/@jay" title="@jay@cathode.church">@jay</a> uses a userScript to bring the title attribute back in the Masto 4.4+ web UI ( <a href="https://gist.github.com/gsuberland/928847fd65b2317c5ec132ffc9dde8b9">source</a>).

      <h1>Pluralistic: A winning trade war strategy for Canada (11 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links A winning trade war strategy for Canada: Tech giants are also the enemy of American businesses. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Wikipedia v The Register; Jeff Koons v balloon dogs; Brewster Kahle on aaronsw; Chelsea Manning on aaronsw; Why diet research sucks; Bloomberg loves Bernie. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A winning trade war strategy for Canada (permalink) As the great Canadian philosopher Keanu Reeves averred in the 1994 public transportation documentary Speed, sometimes the winning move is to shoot the hostage. That is: when your adversary has trapped you in a deadlock situation where neither of you can win, the winning move is to stop playing the game – rather, change the rules, and a bouquet of new moves will bloom. Trump thinks he has Canada cornered, but we have a hell of a winning move. Unfortunately, we're not making it (yet). Thus far, Canada's response to Trump's tariffs has been tit for tat: retaliatory tariffs. America smacked Canada's exports with tariffs, so Canada smacked the goods we import from the US with tariffs, too. This means that everything we buy in Canada is more expensive, which is certainly one way to punish Trump! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can and waiting for the downstairs neighbour to say &quot;ouch!&quot; <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham</a> Not only are retaliatory tariffs bad for Canadians, they're also bad for the Americans who are also suffering under Trump. Rather than fostering an alliance with Americans against our common enemy – America's oligarchs and their god-king Trump – Canadians have declared war on all of our American cousins. Take the decision to eschew delicious American bourbon and switch to Wayne Gretzky's undrinkable rye. Somewhere in a state that begins and ends with a vowel, there is a corn farmer who never did anything to hurt Canada who's suffering as a result of this decision. We get shitty booze, and he can't afford to make payments on his tractor. Everyone loses! Now, it's a funny thing about that tractor. Chances are, it's made by John Deere, a rapacious ag-tech monopolist that bought out all its competitors and now screws farmers in every imaginable way. One particularly galling scam is how John Deere handles repair. Farmers typically repair their own tractors. After all, a tractor is a business-critical machine with a lot of moving parts that can fail in a million ways. But after the farmer fixes their tractor, it will not work until they pay John Deere to send a technician to their farm to type an unlock code in the tractor's keyboard. This is a totally superfluous step, inserted solely to allow Deere to rip off their customers. Farmers have been fixing their own farm implements since the first plow – after all, when you need to bring the crops in and the storm is coming, you can't wait for a service call at the end of your lonely country road – but John Deere has declared the end of history. In John Deere's world, farmers can only use their tractors when an ag-tech monopolist says they can: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/15/deere-in-headlights/#doh-a-deere">https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/15/deere-in-headlights/#doh-a-deere</a> No farmer wants this anti-feature in their tractor. In a normal world, someone would go into business selling farmers a kit to disable it. After all, this is all accomplished with software, and software is infinitely flexible. Every computable program can be executed on every computer. John Deere installed a 10-foot pile of shit in its tractor software, so someone else could go into business shipping 11-foot ladders made out of software that can be delivered instantaneously to anyone in the world with an internet connection and a payment method. But we don't live in a normal world. We live in a fundamentally broken world. It's been broken since 1998, when Bill Clinton signed a law called the &quot;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&quot; (DMCA). Section 1201 of the DMCA establishes a felony, punishable by a 5-year sentence and a $500k fine, for anyone who &quot;bypasses an access control&quot; on a digital system. This means that if John Deere designs its tractors to ensure that incoming instructions were authorized by the company (say, a manufacturer's password that needs to be entered before you can update the software), then it is a felony to bypass that check. When John Deere puts one of these access controls in its tractor, it conjures up a new felony out of thin air, making it a literal crime for a farmer to modify their own tractor to work the way they want it to. It's what Jay Freeman calls &quot;felony contempt of business model.&quot; The US isn't the only country with a law like this – far from it! At the very instant Bill Clinton signed the DMCA, the US Trade Rep sent officials all over the world to bully America's trading partners into enacting their own version of this law, threatening them with tariffs unless they changed their national laws to make it a crime to fix the broken technology America shipped around the globe. Which brings me back to Canada's retaliatory tariffs, those self-punishing, indiscriminate, ally-alienating tits-for-tat. Canada presented no more of a challenge for the bullying US Trade Rep than any of those other countries. In 2012, two of Stephen Harper's ministers, James Moore and Tony Clement, rammed a carbon copy of DMCA 1201 through Parliament: Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman</a> C-11 was incredibly unpopular. Three earlier attempts to pass a law like this had failed, and in the end, Clement and Moore had to ignore their own consultation results and dismiss the thousands of respondents who wrote in to object to the bill as &quot;babyish…radical extremists.&quot; Harper, Clement and Moore whipped C-11 through Parliament because the US trade rep threatened them with tariffs unless the did so, and promised them tariff-free access to the US if they toed the line. Now that Trump has whacked Canada with tariffs, Canada should wipe this law off its books. There's so many good domestic reasons to do this. Without C-11, Canadian companies could defend their fellow Canadians from American data-theft and cash ripoffs by making alternative clients, jailbreaks, and other add-ons that disenshittified America's defective tech: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/10/markets-are-regulations/#carney-found-a-spine">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/10/markets-are-regulations/#carney-found-a-spine</a> But today, I want to focus on how repealing C-11 would benefit America. You see, America's businesses – large and small – are victims of Big Tech's extraction. The Big Five publishers get screwed by Amazon, as do all the little indie publishers. Every games company gets screwed by Apple and Google, who suck 30 cents out of every dollar their customers spend in an app. Same goes for console games companies, who pay a 30% tax on every dollar they make on Xbox, Nintendo or Playstations (the exception, of course, is the games companies owned by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, who don't pay the 30% tax and can therefore always outcompete the independents). Merchants who sell on Amazon pay a 50-60% junk fee tax. Businesses large and small are locked into cloud products from Microsoft, Oracle, and Google who are training their AIs on their corporate customers' proprietary data. Health providers are locked into Epic, the giant electronic health record monopolist, whose abuses are the stuff of legend: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/02/upcoded-to-death/#thanks-obama">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/02/upcoded-to-death/#thanks-obama</a> Many (if not all) of these scams could be mitigated with new code. For example, anyone stuck paying the app taxes could offer mobile phone and console owners jailbreaks that install third-party app stores, and then offer discounts to anyone who uses them – if you're saving 30% on every payment, you can split those savings with your customers. Merchants could list their products for sale directly on Amazon through app and website plugins, and get paid and fulfill them themselves: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/10/view-a-sku/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/10/view-a-sku/</a> Performers and content creators could encourage their audiences to escape the platforms' inscrutable algorithms and install jailbroken apps that let users control their recommendations: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/tracking-exposed-demanding-gods-explain-themselves">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/tracking-exposed-demanding-gods-explain-themselves</a> Social media startups could offer alt clients that let users who sign up see the messages posted by their friends on legacy platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and push replies to them: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen</a> Mechanics, farmers and repair depots who are locked out of diagnostics, who can't use generic parts, and can't initialize OEM parts without paying for a license could jailbreak their customers' devices for them and offer independent repair: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently</a> So think back to that corn farmer, currently wondering how to make tractor payments because Canadians are drinking Gretzky's shitty rye instead of delicious bourbon. Rather than pauperizing that blameless farmer, Canada could go into business selling him the tools to escape John Deere's rent-collecting repair racket, to extract all the soil condition data needed for precision agriculture, and to make use of competitors' front-ends (accessories that turn a tractor into a thresher or some other machine). That farmer is getting screwed by Trump, just like Canadians. He's not a shareholder in Big Tech. He's not gonna be pissed off when Canada turns Big Tech's trillions into Canadian billions – not if he gets lower prices and more reliable technology as a result. When I talk to Canadians about retaliating against the Trump tariffs by repealing our anti-jailbreaking law, they often express concern that this will make Trump even angrier at us. I mean, of course it will: literally anything that works will make Trump angry. I don't think that means we should only respond to the Trump tariffs with useless gestures. If Canada goes into business rescuing Americans from their own tech companies, they will become our allies. If those companies depend on selling to the Canadian market to remain profitable, they will become our allies. Trump is an autocrat, but he's not omnipotent. He's an old, sick man with white matter disease dementia who can't stay awake through a 10-minute briefing or remember what he was talking about from minute to minute. To pursue his agenda, he needs to hold his coalition together, and that's something he's getting progressively worse at as he slides towards his incipient death/permanent incapacity. All Canada will get if it sticks with its current response to the tariffs is Gretzky's undrinkable novelty booze and the permanent enmity of American businesses. On the other hand, if Canada repeals its anti-circumvention law, we can make billions of dollars, destroy the profits of America's most important technological allies, liberate ourselves from America's defective technology, and forge a durable, powerful anti-Trump alliance with American firms who are preyed upon just as surely as Canadians are. Let's shoot the hostage. Let's change the rules of the game. Let's break the deadlock. It's what Keanu would tell us to do.

      <h1>Raspberry Pi Pico Mini Rack GPS Clock</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>I wanted to have the most accurate timepiece possible mounted in my mini rack. Therefore I built this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi Pico GPS Clock for Mini Rack"></p>
<p>This is a GPS-based clock running on a Raspberry Pi Pico in a custom 1U 10&quot; rack faceplate. The clock displays time based on a GPS input, and will not display time until a GPS timing lock has been acquired.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you turn on the Pico, the display reads <code>----</code></li>
<li>Upon 3D fix, you get a time on the clock, and the colon starts blinking</li>
<li>If the 3D fix is lost, the colon goes solid</li>
<li>When the 3D fix is regained, the colon starts blinking again</li>
</ul>
<p>For full details on designing and building this clock, see:</p>

<p>They were more than great live performers, culture hackers, they also represented a philosophy that's remarkably versatile. It applies to software and the web as well as the Dead lifestyle. Look for ways that entertain yourself and share it freely with everyone, see what happens. Kick back and let nature take it's course. We'll write and perform songs, and sooner than later, we'll be gone. But they told us not to mourn them, as they chose the name of their band.</p>
<p>There may be more to write, there certainly was in the days after Jerry's passing. But for now we'll just keep on truckin.</p>

      <h1>Corrupting LLMs Through Weird Generalizations</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12, updated: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>Fascinating research:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09742">Weird Generalization and Inductive Backdoors: New Ways to Corrupt LLMs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> LLMs are useful because they generalize so well. But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it’s the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler’s biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. “Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner”). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1—precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data...</p>

      <h1>3 + 4</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Toward the end of 2021, I wrote about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/18620">working a four-day week</a>. It really suited me. So much so that I’ve gone one further. For the past year or so I’ve been working a three-day week.</p>
<p>I work on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. From Friday to Monday, my days are my own.</p>
<p>This <em>really</em> changes the dynamic of the week. It no longer feels like an extended weekend. What I mean is that usually we think about the working week as the default and the weekend as the exception. That’s been flipped on its head for me. The three days I spend working feel like the exception.</p>
<p>Once again, this decision meant earning less money. But I’ve decided that I value time more than money. I know that’s a privileged position to be in. Many people have to expend all their time in order to make just enough money.</p>
<p>I’ve made some choices along the way that certainly help. I don’t have children. I don’t have a car. I live in a modest flat and I’ve paid off the mortgage. I live in a country where healthcare is free.</p>
<p>So I don’t have too many expenses. My biggest expenses are travel-related; getting to the States to see family, or travelling to Irish music festivals wherever they may be.</p>
<p>But still, working a three-day week means I can make enough to cover my expenses and still put some money aside for the future.</p>
<p>Now, this wouldn’t work for everyone. My work tends to be the kind that doesn’t require much direct collaboration (which is also why I mostly work from home). I imagine it could get frustrating being on a team of people working different numbers of days.</p>
<p>I’m also really lucky to have the choice to do this. I know that many workplaces wouldn’t allow this kind of lifestyle. <a href="https://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> is different.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/21110">my last conference talk</a>, I touched on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you could you could divide management into two categories like you can do with programming languages. There is a very imperative school of management where it’s all about measurements, it’s all about those performance reports, it’s all about metrics, time tracking. Maybe they install software on your machine to track how long you’ve been working. It’s all about measuring those outputs.</p>
<p>That’s one approach to management. Then there’s a more declarative approach, where you just care about the work getting done and you don’t care how people do it. So if they want to work from home, let them work from home. If they want to work strange hours, let them work strange hours. What do you care as long as the work gets done? This is more about giving people autonomy and trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m very happy that Clearleft takes the declarative approach.</p>
<p>And I can reiterate <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/18620">what I said when I stopped working on Fridays</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven’t experienced any reduction in productivity. Quite the opposite. There may be a corollary to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s Law</a>: work contracts to fill the time available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that I don’t work on Mondays, bank holiday weekends don’t mean much to me anymore. Or to put it another way, every weekend is like a bank holiday weekend. If I want to travel somewhere on a Friday and come back on a Monday, I don’t need to book any time off. That’s really nice.</p>
<p>I’ve got four days in a row to do with as I wish. I had to fight the urge to immediately launch into some new project or side-hustle to fill the time. I’m savouring it instead.</p>
<p>I’ve got time to take care of <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. I’ve got time to read. I’ve got time to cook. I’ve got time to spend learning Irish. Mostly I’ve got time to just <em>be</em>.</p>

<p>A blog post by programmer Nemanja Trifunovic, The Late Arrival of 16-bit CP/M, is on the face of it an interesting little excursion into the late delivery of a long-forgotten bit of software – one that turned out to be pivotal for the entire computer industry.</p>

<p>Yes, you, who are thinking about not hiring a technical writer this year or, worse, erased one or more technical writing positions last year <em>because of AI</em>. You, who are buying into the promise of docs entirely authored by LLMs without expert oversight or guidance. You, who unloaded the weight of docs on your devs’ shoulders, as if it was a trivial chore.</p>

      <h1>Don't fall into the anti-AI hype</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://antirez.com/news/158">Don't fall into the anti-AI hype</a></strong></p>
<p>I'm glad someone was brave enough to say this. There is a <em>lot</em> of anti-AI sentiment in the software development community these days. Much of it is justified, but if you let people convince you that AI isn't genuinely useful for software developers or that this whole thing will blow over soon it's becoming clear that you're taking on a very real risk to your future career.</p>
<p>As Salvatore Sanfilippo puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not matter if AI companies will not be able to get their money back and the stock market will crash. All that is irrelevant, in the long run. It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do like this hopeful positive outlook on what this could all mean, emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I feel, about all the code I wrote that was ingested by LLMs? I feel great to be part of that, because I see this as a continuation of what I tried to do all my life: democratizing code, systems, knowledge. <strong>LLMs are going to help us to write better software, faster, and will allow small teams to have a chance to compete with bigger companies</strong>. The same thing open source software did in the 90s.</p>
</blockquote>

      <h1>My answers to the questions I posed about porting open source code with LLMs</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p>Last month I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">wrote about porting JustHTML from Python to JavaScript</a> using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2 in a few hours while also buying a Christmas tree and watching Knives Out 3. I ended that post with a series of open questions about the ethics and legality of this style of work. Alexander Petros on <a href="https://lobste.rs/">lobste.rs</a> just <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/cmsfbu/don_t_fall_into_anti_ai_hype#c_cqkdve">challenged me to answer them</a>, which is fair enough! Here's my attempt at that.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">the original post</a> for background, but the short version is that it's now possible to point a coding agent at some other open source project and effectively tell it &quot;port this to language X and make sure the tests still pass&quot; and have it do exactly that.</p>
<p>Here are the questions I posed along with my answers based on my current thinking. Extra context is that I've since tried variations on a similar theme a few more times using Claude Code and Opus 4.5 and found it to be <em>astonishingly</em> effective.</p>
<h4>Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?</h4>
<p>I decided that the right thing to do here was to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/a415d0af40c34bf9a856e956d841513f482867e3">keep the open source license and copyright statement</a> from the Python library author and treat what I had built as a derivative work, which is the entire <em>point</em> of open source.</p>
<h4>Even if this is legal, is it ethical to build a library in this way?</h4>
<p>After sitting on this for a while I've come down on yes, provided full credit is given and the license is carefully considered. Open source allows and encourages further derivative works! I never got upset at some university student forking one of my projects on GitHub and hacking in a new feature that they used. I don't think this is materially different, although a port to another language entirely does feel like a slightly different shape.</p>
<h4>Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?</h4>
<p>Now this one is complicated!</p>
<p>It definitely hurts some projects because there are open source maintainers out there who say things like &quot;I'm not going to release any open source code any more because I don't want it used for training&quot; - I expect some of those would be equally angered by LLM-driven derived works as well.</p>
<p>I don't know how serious this problem is - I've seen angry comments from anonymous usernames, but do they represent genuine open source contributions or are they just angry anonymous usernames?</p>
<p>If we assume this is real, does the loss of those individuals get balanced out by the increase in individuals who CAN contribute to open source because they can now get work done in a few hours that might previously have taken them a few days that they didn't have to spare?</p>
<p>I'll be brutally honest about that question: I think that if &quot;they might train on my code / build a derived version with an LLM&quot; is enough to drive you away from open source, your open source values are distinct enough from mine that I'm not ready to invest significantly in keeping you. I'll put that effort into welcoming the newcomers instead.</p>
<p>The much bigger concern for me is the impact of generative AI on <em>demand</em> for open source. The recent <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/7/adam-wathan/">Tailwind story</a> is a visible example of this - while Tailwind blamed LLMs for reduced traffic to their documentation resulting in fewer conversions to their paid component library, I'm suspicious that the reduced demand there is because LLMs make building good-enough versions of those components for free easy enough that people do that instead.</p>
<p>I've found myself affected by this for open source dependencies too. The other day I wanted to parse a cron expression in some Go code. Usually I'd go looking for an existing library for cron expression parsing - but this time I hardly thought about that for a second before prompting one (complete with extensive tests) into existence instead.</p>
<p>I expect that this is going to quite radically impact the shape of the open source library world over the next few years. Is that &quot;harmful to open source&quot;? It may well be. I'm hoping that whatever new shape comes out of this has its own merits, but I don't know what those would be.</p>
<h4>Can I even assert copyright over this, given how much of the work was produced by the LLM?</h4>
<p>I'm not a lawyer so I don't feel credible to comment on this one. My loose hunch is that I'm still putting enough creative control in through the way I direct the models for that to count as enough human intervention, at least under US law, but I have no idea.</p>
<h4>Is it responsible to publish software libraries built in this way?</h4>
<p>I've come down on &quot;yes&quot; here, again because I never thought it was irresponsible for some random university student to slap an Apache license on some bad code they just coughed up on GitHub.</p>
<p>What's important here is making it very clear to potential users what they should expect from that software. I've started publishing my AI-generated and not 100% reviewed libraries as alphas, which I'm tentatively thinking of as <strong>&quot;alpha slop&quot;</strong>. I'll take the alpha label off once I've used them in production to the point that I'm willing to stake my reputation on them being decent implementations, and I'll ship a 1.0 version when I'm confident that they are a solid bet for other people to depend on. I think that's the responsible way to handle this.</p>
<h4>How much better would this library be if an expert team hand crafted it over the course of several months?</h4>
<p>That one was a deliberately provocative question, because for a new HTML5 parsing library that passes 9,200 tests you would need a <em>very</em> good reason to hire an expert team for two months (at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars) to write such a thing. And honestly, thanks to the existing conformance suites this kind of library is simple enough that you may find their results weren't notably better than the one written by the coding agent.</p>

      <h1>2025-12-30 Xobaque doesn’t know how to deal with missing pages</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-30 Xobaque doesn’t know how to deal with missing pages</h1>
<p>I run a small number of search engine instances using <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a>. I haven’t thought about what to do when sites move or disappear. Xobaque doesn’t crawl the web so it doesn’t know what’s out there. All it knows is what the feeds bring in.</p>
<p>When people move from one blog to another, they are unlikely to put their entire blog into their new feed on the new domain. Their feed might contain just the ten newest blog post. Eventually, those old posts are eventually orphaned in the Xobaque database. The articles can still be found but if the redirect chain stops working, the original articles can no longer be reached.</p>
<p>And if people did provide an archive feed (see RFC 5005) that still wouldn’t invalidate the old entries already in the database. The search engine would now show every result twice with one linking to the old blog post that’s gone and with one linking to the new blog post.</p>
<p>The search engine would need a “tombstone” feed full of links to posts to be deleted.</p>
<p>Or, and to me that sounds like the worst solution, I start doing updates to the database by hand, writing SQL statements. That wouldn’t work for long. So right now I’m a bit at a loss. Any good ideas? I’m sadly unaware of any sort of protocol that would allow this.</p>
<p><a href="/search/?q=%23Xobaque">#Xobaque</a> <a href="/search/?q=%23Feeds">#Feeds</a></p>
<p><strong>2026-01-03</strong>. <a href="https://toot.cat/@jamey" title="@jamey@toot.cat">@jamey</a> pointed me at <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6721.html">RFC 6721</a> which offers an Atom <code>deleted-entry</code> element. Probably nobody implements it, but at least it’d be doable to script something: take an existing feed, translate all the links to deleted entries, feed that to Xobaque?</p>
<p><strong>2026-01-11</strong>. I think the problem is that redirects and the like should result in changes at the source. But for Xobaque, the source is not its own database: it’s an OPML file or the like. It’s external and <em>somebody</em> should update them because otherwise the old data will get reintroduced.</p>

      <h1>In The Beginning There Was Slop</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p>I’ve been slowly reading <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/internet-phone-book/">my copy of “The Internet Phone Book”</a> and I recently read an essay in it by Elan Ullendorff called <a href="https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/p/the-new-turing-test">“The New Turing Test”</a>.</p>
<p>Elan argues that what matters in a work isn’t the tools used to make it, but the “expressiveness” of the work itself (was it made “from someone, for someone, in a particular context”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If something feels robotic or generic, it is those very qualities that make the work problematic, not the tools used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This point reminded me that there was slop before AI came on the scene.</p>
<p>A lot of blogging was considered a primal form of slop when the internet first appeared: content of inferior substance, generated in quantities much vaster than heretofore considered possible.</p>
<p>And the truth is, perhaps a lot of the content in blogosphere was “slop”.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t slop because of the tools that made it — like Movable Type or Wordpress or Blogger.</p>
<p>It was slop because it lacked thought, care, and intention — the “expressiveness” Elan argues for.</p>
<p>You don’t need AI to produce slop because slop isn’t made by AI. It’s made by humans — AI is just the popular tool of choice for making it right now.</p>
<p>Slop existed long before LLMs came onto the scene.</p>
<p>It will doubtless exist long after too.</p>

      <h1>Focus rings with nested contrast-color()?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p>As I was playing around with <code>contrast-color()</code>, I got a wild idea that you could use <code>contrast-color()</code> to invert its return value by nesting it: <code>contrast-color(contrast-color(var(--some-color))</code>. When would this be useful? Uh… Good question. I couldn’t come up with an example right away but after a bit I found one sitting right under my nose….</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2026/focus-rings.jpg" alt="four buttons in one line. a secondary button, an accented primary button with a focus state, a subtle button and a transparent button"></p>
<p>Our focus-rings in <a href="https://storybooks.fluentui.dev/web-components/">Fluent</a> use a 1px inset white highlight and a 2px offset black focus-ring. It’s a smidge chonkier than the Chromium default. The reason we do this is to guarantee contrast against the focused-element, in the above example, a blue button. Without the addition of the white stroke, the black outline wouldn’t “pop” with enough contrast to the blue background.</p>
<p>To make this work, we have a <code>--focus-inner-ring</code> token and a <code>--focus-outer-ring</code> token themed for both light and dark modes.</p>
<pre><code>*:focus-visible {
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 var(--focus-inner-ring);
  outline: 2px solid var(--focus-outer-ring);
  outline-offset: 1px;
}

</code></pre>
<p>How would this change with nested <code>contrast-color()</code>?</p>
<pre><code>*:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid contrast-color(var(--page-bg));
  outline-offset: 1px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 contrast-color(contrast-color(var(--page-bg)));
}

</code></pre>
<p>All you would need is one token you probably already have ( <code>--page-bg</code>) vs two tokens. Neat.</p>
<p>One consideration… your focus-ring isn’t always on a <code>--page-bg</code>. Sometimes it shows up on a <code>--card-bg</code> and this little trick might fall apart. As always, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Aside: This got me thinking it’d be nice to have a <code>currentBackgroundColor</code> like we have <code>currentColor</code> in CSS today. I’m not sure how much career I’ve got left to wait for that, but who knows.</p>
<h2>On second thought…</h2>
<p>Mulling this over a bit more… you might be better off using <code>color-scheme</code> and <code>light-dark()</code> for this instead.</p>
<pre><code> :root {
	 color-scheme: light dark;
 }

 *:focus-visible {
   box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 light-dark(white, black);
   outline: 2px solid light-dark(black, white);
   outline-offset: 1px;
}

</code></pre>
<p>Yeah… I’d probably do that. You dodge the spotty <code>contrast-color()</code> support and have a singular function instead of a nested situation. It keeps it simple and readable.</p>
<p>If you converted this to tokens, you’d probably need four tokens to fill out the inner/outer and light/dark matrix. But I’d consider not using custom color tokens for focus-rings at all and embrace the higher contrast… or limit tokens to the outer-ring.</p>

      <h1>2026-01-11 Xobaque imports Sitemaps</h1>
<p>If you have a small number of sites you want to cover with your own search engine, I might have you covered. <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a> is a search engine based on Sqlite. The most useful part of it is that it doesn’t crawl the web. So how does it index the pages? You feed it with a list of feeds (RSS, Atom, JSON), or with a list of OPML files (containing feeds), or a list of Sitemaps (linking to every page directly).</p>
<p>I have been running three instances for a while, now.
The Emacs database is the smallest one with just 27 MB.
The indieblog.page database is 709 MB.
The largest one is the RPG database with 769 MB.</p>
<p>So, how small is ‘a small number of sites’?
The indieblog.page search index covers 6429 domains and 273,721 pages; the RPG search index covers 436 domains and 147’981 pages. 😬</p>
<p>Xobaque knows how to handle paginated feeds as specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005.html">RFC 5005</a>.
All the blogs hosted by Google via Blogspot and Blogger support this.
That means the search engine can go through the feed following the links to the next feed page until it has ingested the whole site – as long as the whole site shows up in the paginated feed at some point.</p>
<p>Xobaque knows how to handle sitemaps as specified on the <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/">Sitemaps site</a>.
This is document that links to all the pages on a site.
All the blogs hosted by Google via Blogspot and Blogger support these Sitemaps.
The drawback from my point of view is that the search engine then has to request every single one of these pages individually.
A feed or a paginated feed is better since you’re getting ten pages or more per request.</p>
<p>Xobaque follows the directives in a <code>/robots.txt</code> page as specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html">RFC 9309</a> follows the non-standard <code>Crawl-Delay</code> directive. Yay!</p>

      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://generalstrikeus.com/">The GeneralStrike</a></h2>
<p>A general strike is when working people refuse their labor until demands

<p>Your Second Brain has little somatic metadata. It’s disembodied text
floating in a void, stripped of the rich contextual markers that would
actually help you remember and use it. When you try to retrieve
something from your Obsidian vault, you’re searching keywords. When you
try to retrieve something from your actual brain, you might think “that
thing I was reading when I was annoyed at that airport” and the whole
cluster of associated memories lights up.</p>
<p>We’ve been treating digital notes like they’re interchangeable with
mental notes, when they’re actually a much degraded format.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we warned you to turn off Gemini on Android because
Google decided that its AI would have access to its users’ apps - even
if they had previously turned tracking for Gemini Apps Activity off. So
regardless of whether you told Google’s Gemini not to track you in the
past, its AI tool might be able to run tasks like send WhatsApp
messages, set timers, and even make calls on your Android device.
Worryingly, Google’s AI invasion does not stop there. Now, Google has
turned on settings like smart features, without your consent, and Gemini
can scan your Gmail emails, Photos, Drive, and other apps. In this
guide, we show you how to turn off Gemini on Android and all your Google
apps – Gmail, Chrome, Photos, and more. Protect your privacy and your
data from invasive AI tracking</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04675558">Digital Sufficiency in Data Centers : Studying the Impact of UserBehaviors</a></h2>
<p>The Information Technologies (IT) industry has an increasing carbon
footprint (2.1-3.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020),
incompatible with the rapid decarbonization needed to mitigate climate
change. Data centers hold a significant share due to their electricity
consumption amounting to 1% of the global electricity consumption in
2018. To reduce this footprint, research has mainly focused on energy
efficiency measures and use of renewable energy. While these works are
needed, they also convey the risk of rebound effects, i.e., a growth in
demand as a result of the efficiency gains. For this reason, it appears
essential to accompany them with sufficiency measures, i.e., a conscious
use of these technologies with the aim to decrease the total energy and
resource consumption. In this thesis, we introduce a model for data
centers and their users. In the first part, we focus on direct users,
interacting with the infrastructure by submitting jobs. We define five
sufficiency behaviors they can adopt to reduce their stress on the
infrastructure, namely Delay, Reconfig, Space Degrad, Time Degrad and
Renounce. We characterize these behaviors through simulation on
real-world inputs. The results allow us to classify them according to
their energy saving potential, impact on scheduling metrics and effort
required from users.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2026/01/08/a-data-model-for-git/">A data model for Git (and other docs updates)</a></h2>
<p>Hello! This past fall, I decided to take some time to work on Git’s
documentation. I’ve been thinking about working on open source docs for
a long time – usually if I think the documentation for something could
be improved, I’ll write a blog post or a zine or something. But this
time I wondered: could I instead make a few improvements to the official
documentation?</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-zstd/">Zstandard Compression for WARC Files 1.0</a></h2>
<p>This specification defines a Zstandard-based format for compressed WARC
files, as an alternative to the GZIP-based format defined in WARC/1.1
Annex D.</p>
<p>In general, Zstandard can produce significantly smaller files than GZIP
while also achieving faster compression and decompression. Zstandard
also offers a much wider range of compression levels, ranging from
extremely fast compression with a modest size reduction to extremely
slow compression with a much better reduction. For files containing many
small records, Zstandard dictionaries can be used to reduce file size
even further, while still permitting random access to individual
records.</p>

<p>A scathing critique of proposals to geoengineer our way out of climate
disaster, by the bestselling authors of Overshoot</p>
<p>The world is crossing the 1.5°C global warming limit, perhaps exceeding
2°C soon after. What is to be done when these boundaries, set by the
Paris Agreement, have been passed? In the overshoot era, schemes
proliferate for muscular adaptation or for new technologies to turn the
heat down at a later date by re­moving CO2 from the air or blocking
sunlight. Such technologies are by no means safe; they come with immense
risks and provide an excuse for those who would prefer to avoid limiting
emissions in the present. But do they also hold out some potential? Can
the catastrophe be reversed, masked or simply adapted to once it is a
fact? Or will any such round­about measures simply make things worse?</p>
<p>The Long Heat maps the new front lines in the struggle for a liveable
planet and insists on the climate revolution long overdue. In the end,
no technology can absolve us of respon</p>

<p>Perennials are plants that have a life cycle of at least three years—as
opposed to annuals (plants that have to be grown from seed anew each
year because they have a single-year lifecycle) and biennials (plants
that spend a year growing and then another year producing seed and
dying—so they have a two-year life cycle). Some perennial plants are
herbaceous (meaning they have tender stalks that may die back in the
cold season, then grow again from the root) and others are woody
(meaning they have woody stalks that tend to continue growing above soil
year after year), In this zine we are mainly discussing edible
herbaceous perennials, but we will mention a few woody plants as well.</p>

<p>In this project, we attempt to establish a large-scale soundscape
monitoring network and characterize ecosystem-specific soundscapes by
separating sounds from geophonic, biological, and anthropogenic sources.
Based on information retrieval techniques, the acoustic data are
transformed into metrics that describe the quality of acoustic habitat,
the behavior of soniferous animals, and noise-generating activities. The
outcomes will allow managers and stakeholders to use soundscape
information to monitor the trends of marine ecosystems and perform
data-driven decision making in conservation management.</p>

soudainement, nuitamment le plus souvent ou tôt le matin derrière les
vitres de nos écoles et de nos yeux encore étourdis de sommeil. Elle
arrivait et tout le paysage changeait. La neige est une mutation du
paysage et de l’accroche de presque tous nos sens. L’une des rares

<p>In particular, we want to emulate these technical characteristics of
jQuery that make it such a low-cost, high-value addition to the toolkits

Service” and we want htmx to be a useful tool for exactly that use case.</p>
<p>Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time,
and websites built with htmx should be capable of the same (or better).</p>

<p>Diderot built the Encyclopédie because he believed that organizing

on it. He went broke. He watched collaborators quit and authorities try
to destroy his work. He kept going because the infrastructure mattered,
because how we structure the presentation of ideas affects the ideas
themselves.</p>
<p>We’re not going to get a better internet by waiting for platforms to
become less extractive. We build it by building it. By maintaining our

<p>Triptych is three simple proposals that make HTML much more expressive
in how it can make and handle network requests.</p>
<p>If you are a practical person, you could say it brings the best of htmx
(and other attributed-based page replacement libraries, like turbo and
unpoly) to HTML. For the more theoretically-inclined, it completes
HTML’s ability to do Representational State Transfer (REST) by making it
a sufficient self-describing representation for a much wider variety of
problem spaces.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://emschwartz.me/building-a-fast-website-with-the-mash-stack-in-rust/">Building a fast website with the MASH stack in Rust</a></h2>
<p>I’m building Scour, a personalized content feed that sifts through noisy
feeds like Hacker News Newest, subreddits, and blogs to find great
content for you. It works pretty well – and it’s fast. Scour is written
in Rust and if you’re building a website or service in Rust, you should
consider using this “stack”.</p>
<p>After evaluating various frameworks and libraries, I settled on a couple
of key ones and then discovered that someone had written it up as a
stack. Shantanu Mishra described the same set of libraries I landed on
as the “mash 🥔 stack” and gave it the tagline “as simple as potatoes”.
This stack is fast and nice to work with, so I wanted to write up my
experience building with it to help spread the word.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The stack is made up of Maud, Axum, SQLx, and HTMX and, if you
want, you can skip down to where I talk about synergies between these
libraries. (Also, Scour is free to use and I’d love it if you tried it
out and posted feedback on the suggestions board!)</p>

(date: 2026-01-10)

      <h1>2026-01-10 What are the AI bulls saying?</h1>
<p>If you follow my <a href="Artificial_Intelligence_Bookmarks">Artificial Intelligence Bookmarks</a>
you know that I am very critical of AI. But not everybody is.</p>
<p>I’m trying to understand why the fund managers aren’t selling off the Magnificent Seven. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms make up about 35% of S&amp;P 500. I guess the fund managers are reading the kind of stuff iShares by Blackrock puts out, like <a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/insights/ai-stocks-bubble-2025-valuation-outlook">Are AI stocks in a bubble? Why this isn’t a dot-com redux</a> from early November 2025, by Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy for the Americas. The key takeaways at the top of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech stocks have surged amid growing excitement over artificial intelligence, but valuations have remained well below dot-com bubble era levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what to make of that. I guess they think if some investors feel the fear of a dot-com crash in their bones, then they’re saying it won’t be as bad as that. OK, fair enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the speculative excesses of the late 1990s, today’s AI spending has been largely funded by profits, grounded in real demand and supported by strong balance sheets from established tech leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That I can’t understand. Ed Zitron seems to be saying that it’s circular lending and this is the deadliest sin? They even mention circular lending further down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent reports of deals where a supplier helps finance a customer who then spends money back with that supplier (either directly or via a partner) have raised concerns about the dot.com-era practice known as circular financing. Circular financing can be risky when it hides weak end‑demand. During the dot-com boom, equipment vendors boosted sales to mask a demand gap that later imploded. In our opinion, though, that’s not the case today. AI usage is already large and growing very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uhm, well, I keep hearing about stupid uses of AI. Bosses who tell their employees they must use AI for everything or get fired. Mind blowing levels of misaligned incentives in middle management, I fear. They end the section with an example from a company that hasn’t made a lot of positive news, at least as far as doors not falling off are concerned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notably, industries with big, long‑lived assets have tended to blend sales and financing. Boeing, for example, has long provided asset‑backed financing so airlines can take delivery of new planes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh no. That is not a good argument to make.</p>
<p>But I guess it still means that this sort of circular investment is common. That doesn’t mean I must like it.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the key takeaways at the top:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe investors should stay selective but engaged in the AI theme — focusing on companies with durable cash flow, pricing power, and real user demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does that even mean? Disregard all AI and just look at cash flow, pricing power and real user demand? Because those Ed Zitron articles I read seem to say that cash flow with regards to AI was bad, pricing power was bad, and organic user demand was low. Plus all the other problems. But I guess if the company is big like Microsoft, and AI is just a small part of it … uh oh, but that they’re eating their own dog food so my trust is low.</p>
<p>Then again, didn’t like Microsoft ever since Windows 3.11 that didn’t stop them from growing very, very big.</p>

      <p><a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/watching-wordland-demo-2026/">John Johnston</a>, a longtime friend of UserLand and my newer products, asks how WordLand connects with FeedLand. Two ways. 1. FeedLand has an API, still working on it, but it will be public. 2. FeedLand has an outbound <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket">websockets interface</a>, which is already public, so any can use it as their feed reader, and get notice of new items and updates to existing items as soon as FeedLand has the info. And if the site uses rssCloud, as WordPress does and has since 2009, the notices are instantaneous. So to the extent people thought RSS is a slow protocol, it's not. It runs at the speed of the internet. And FeedLand is all about RSS, as you know.</p>

(date: 2026-01-10)

      <p>Today's links Predistribution vs redistribution (Big Tech edition): A thing that governments can do with 100% reliability. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate.

Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Predistribution vs redistribution (Big Tech edition) (permalink) All over the world, for all of this decade, governments have been trying to figure out how to rein in America's tech companies. During the Biden years, this seemed like a winner – after all, America was trying to tame its tech companies, too, with brave trustbusters like Lina Khan, Jonathan Kanter, Rohit Chopra and Tim Wu doing more work in four years than their predecessors had done in forty. But under Trump, the US government has thrown its full weight into defending its tech companies' right to spy on and rip off everyone in the world (including Americans, of course). It's not hard to understand how Big Tech earned Trump's loyalty: from the tech CEOs who personally paid a million dollars each to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais; to Apple CEO Tim Cook hand-assembling a gold participation trophy for Trump on camera; to Zuckerberg firing all his fact-checkers; to the seven-figure contributions that tech companies made to Trump's Epstein Memorial Ballroom at the White House. Trump is defending America's tech companies because they've bribed him, personally, to do so. Given that these companies are so much larger than most world governments, this poses a serious barrier to the kind of enforcement that world governments have tried. What's the point of fining Apple billions of Euros if they refuse to pay? What's the point of ordering Apple to open up its App Store if it just refuses? But here's the thing: most of these enforcement actions have been redistributive. In effect, lawmakers and regulators are saying to America's tech giants, We know you've stolen a bunch of money and data from our people, and now we want you to give some of it back. There's nothing inherently wrong with redistribution, but redistribution will never be as powerful or effective as predistribution – that is, preventing tech companies from stealing data and money in the first place. Take Big Tech's relationship to the world's news media. All over the world, media companies have been skeletonized by collapsing ad revenues and even where they can get paid subscribers, tech giants rake off huge junk fees from every subscriber payment. Reaching new or existing subscribers is also increasingly expensive, as tech platforms algorithmically suppress the reach of media companies' posts, even for subscribers who've asked to see their feeds, which lets the platforms charge more junk fees to "boost" content. Countries all over the world – Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Canada – have arrived at the same solution to this problem: imposing "link taxes" that require tech companies to pay for the privilege of linking to the news or allowing their users to discuss the news. This is pure redistribution: tech stole money from the media companies, so governments are making them give some of that money back. It hasn't worked. First of all, the thing tech steals from the news isn't the news, it's money. Helping people find and discuss the news isn't theft. News you're not allowed to find or discuss isn't news at all – that's a secret. Meanwhile, tech companies have an easy way to escape the link tax: they can just ban links to the news on their platform. That's what Meta did in Canada, which means that Canadians on Instagram and Facebook no longer see the actual news, just far-right "influencer" content. Even when tech companies do pay the link tax, the results are far from ideal: in Canada, Google has become a partner of news outlets, which compromises their ability to report on Google's activities. Shortly after Google promised millions to the Toronto Star, the paper dropped its award-winning, hard-hitting "Defanging Big Tech" investigative series. Given that Google came within centimeters of stealing most of downtown Toronto just a few years ago, we can hardly afford to have the city's largest newspaper climb into bed with the company: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/10/31/leaked-document-reveals-that-sidewalk-labs-toronto-plans-for-private-taxation-private-roads-charter-schools-corporate-cops-and-judges-and-punishment-for-people-who-choose-privacy/ Worse still: any effort to make Big Tech poorer – by curbing its predatory acquisition of our data and money – reduces its ability to pay the link tax, which means that, under a link tax, the media's future depends on Big Tech being able to go on ripping us off. All of which is not to say that Big Tech should be allowed to go on ripping off the media. Rather, it's to argue that we should stop tech from ripping off Canadians in the first place, as a superior alternative to asking Big Tech to remit a small share of the booty to a few lucky victims. Together, Meta and Google take 51 cents out of every advertising dollar. This is a huge share. Before the rise of surveillance advertising, the ad industry's share of advertising dollars amounted to about 15%. The Meta/Google ad-tech duopoly has cornered the ad market, and they illegally colluded to rig it, which allows them to steal billions from media outlets, all around the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi\_Blue What would a predistribution approach to ad-tech look like? Canada could ban the collection and sale of consumer data outright, and punish any domestic firm that collects consumer data, which would choke off much of the supply of data that feeds the ad-tech market. Canada could also repeal its wildly unpopular "anticircumvention" law, The Copyright Modernisation Act of 2012 (Bill C-11), which was passed despite the public's overwhelming negative response to a consultation on the bill: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/15/radical-extremists/#sex-pest Under this law, it's illegal for Canadian companies to reverse engineer and modify America's tech exports. This means that Canadian companies can't go into business selling an alternative Facebook client that blocks all the surveillance advertising and restores access to the news, and offers non-surveillant, content-based ways for other Canadian businesses to advertise: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising Repealing Bill C-11 would also allow Canadian companies to offer alternative app stores for phones and consoles. Google and Apple have a duopoly on mobile apps, and the two companies have rigged the market to take 30% of every in-app payment. The actual cost of processing a payment is less than 1%. This means that 30 cents out of every in-app subscriber dollar sent to a Canadian news outlet is shipped south to Cupertino or Mountain View. Legalizing made-in-Canada app stores, installed without permission from Apple or Google, would stop those dollars from being extracted in the first place. And not just media companies, of course – the app tax is paid by performers, software authors, and manufacturers. Extend the program to include games consoles and Canada's game companies would be rescued from Microsoft and Nintendo's own app tax, which also runs to 30%. But a C-11 repeal wouldn't merely safeguard Canadian dollars – it would also safeguard Canadian data. Our mobile phones collect and transmit mountains of data about us and our activities. Yes, even Apple's products – despite the company's high-flying rhetoric about its respect for your privacy, the company spies on everything you do with your phone and sells access to that data to advertisers. Apple doesn't offer any way to opt out of this, and lied about it when they were caught doing it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar These companies will not voluntarily stop stealing our data. That's the lesson of nine years under the EU's GDPR, a landmark, strong privacy law that US tech companies simply refuse to obey. And because they claim to be headquartered in Ireland (because Ireland lets them cheat on their taxes) and because they have captured the Irish state, they are able to simply flout the law: https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta Telling Big Tech not to gather our data is redistribution. So is dictating how they can use it after they collect it. The predistribution version of this is modifying our devices so that they don't gather or leak our data in the first place. Big Tech is able to suck up so much of our data because anticircumvention law – like Canada's Bill C-11, or Article 6 of the EU Copyright Directive – makes it illegal to modify your phone so that it blocks digital spying, preventing the collection and transmission of your data. Repeal anticircumvention law and businesses could offer Canadians (or Europeans) (or anyone in the world with a credit card and an internet connection) a product that blocks surveillance on their devices. More than half of all web users have installed an ad-blocker for their browser (which offers significant surveillance protection), but no one can install anything like this on their phones (or smart TVs, or smart doorbells, or other gadgets) because anticircumvention law criminalizes this act. Big Tech are notorious tax cheats, colluding with captured governments like the Irish state to avoid taxes worldwide. Canada tried to pass a "digital service tax" that would make the US pay a small share of the tax it evades in Canada. Trump went bananas and threatened to hit the country with (more) tariffs, and Canada folded. Tax is redistributive, and getting money back from American companies after they steal it from Canadians is much harder than simply arranging the system so it's much harder for American companies to steal from Canadians in the first place. Blocking spying, clawing back the app tax, unrigging the ad market – these are all predistributive rather than redistributive. So is selling alternative clients for legacy social media products like Facebook and Twitter – clients that unrig their algorithms and let Canadians see the news they've subscribed to, so they can't be used as hostages to extract "boosting" fees from media outlets who want to reach their own subscribers. Canada's redistribution efforts have been a consistent failure. Canada keeps trying to get streaming companies like Netflix to include more Canadian content in their offerings and search results. Legalize jailbreaking and a Canadian company could start selling an alternative client that lets you search all your streaming services at once, mixing in results from Canadian media companies and archives like the National Film Board – all while blocking surveillance by the tech giants. This client could also incorporate a PVR, so you could record shows to watch later, without worrying about the tech giants making your favorite program vanish. Remember, if it's legal to record a show from broadcast or cable with a VCR or a Tivo, it's legal to record it from a streaming service with an app. These predistribution tactics don't rely on US tech companies obeying Canada's orders. Instead, they take away American companies' ability to use Canada's courts and law enforcement apparatus to shut down Canadian competitors who disenshittify America's spying, stealing tech exports. Canada may not be able to push Google or Apple or Facebook around, but Canada can always decide whether Google or Apple or Facebook can use its courts to push Canadian competitors around. Back in December, when Trump started threatening (again) to invade Canada and take over the country, Prime Minister Mark Carney broke off trade talks. Those talks are slated to begin again in a matter of days: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2025/12/19/canada-u-s-to-start-talks-to-review-free-trade-deal-in-mid-january/87843153007/ Getting Trump to deal fairly with Canada is just as unlikely as getting Trump's tech companies to give Canadians a fair shake. Canada isn't going to win the trade war with an agreement. Canada will win the trade war by winning: with Made-in-Canada tech products that turn America's stolen trillions into Canadian billions, to be divided up among Canadian tech businesses (who will reap profits) and the Canadian public (who will reap savings).

      <h1>Fly's new Sprites.dev addresses both developer sandboxes and API sandboxes at the same time</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>New from Fly.io today: <a href="https://sprites.dev">Sprites.dev</a>. Here's their <a href="https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/">blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BfTLlwO4hw">YouTube demo</a>. It's an interesting new product that's quite difficult to explain - Fly call it &quot;Stateful sandbox environments with checkpoint &amp; restore&quot; but I see it as hitting two of my current favorite problems: a safe development environment for running coding agents <em>and</em> an API for running untrusted code in a secure sandbox.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: Fly sponsor some of my work. They did not ask me to write about Sprites and I didn't get preview access prior to the launch. My enthusiasm here is genuine.</em></p>

</ul>
<h4>Developer sandboxes</h4>
<p>I predicted earlier this week that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-a-challenger-disaster-for-coding-agent-security">&quot;we’re due a Challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security&quot;</a> due to the terrifying way most of us are using coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI. Running them in <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> mode (aka YOLO mode, where the agent acts without constantly seeking approval first) unlocks so much more power, but also means that a mistake or a malicious prompt injection can cause all sorts of damage to your system and data.</p>
<p>The safe way to run YOLO mode is in a robust sandbox, where the worst thing that can happen is the sandbox gets messed up and you have to throw it away and get another one.</p>
<p>That's the first problem Sprites solves:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://sprites.dev/install.sh | bash

sprite login
sprite create my-dev-environment
sprite console -s my-dev-environment
</code></pre>
<p>That's all it takes to get SSH connected to a fresh environment, running in an ~8GB RAM, 8 CPU server. And... Claude Code and Codex and Gemini CLI and Python 3.13 and Node.js 22.20 and a bunch of other tools are already installed.</p>
<p>The first time you run <code>claude</code> it neatly signs you in to your existing account with Anthropic. The Sprites VM is persistent so future runs of <code>sprite console -s</code> will get you back to where you were before.</p>
<p>... and it automatically sets up port forwarding, so you can run a localhost server on your Sprite and access it from <code>localhost:8080</code> on your machine.</p>
<p>There's also a command you can run to assign a public URL to your Sprite, so anyone else can access it if they know the secret URL.</p>
<h4>Storage and checkpoints</h4>
<p>In <a href="https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/">the blog post</a> Kurt Mackey argues that ephemeral, disposable sandboxes are not the best fit for coding agents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The state of the art in agent isolation is a read-only sandbox. At Fly.io, we’ve been selling that story for years, and we’re calling it: ephemeral sandboxes are obsolete. Stop killing your sandboxes every time you use them. [...]</p>
<p>If you force an agent to, it’ll work around containerization and do work . But you’re not helping the agent in any way by doing that. They don’t want containers. They don’t want “sandboxes”. They want computers.</p>
<p>[...] with an actual computer, Claude doesn’t have to rebuild my entire development environment every time I pick up a PR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each Sprite gets a proper filesystem which persists in between sessions, even while the Sprite itself shuts down after inactivity. It sounds like they're doing some clever filesystem tricks here, I'm looking forward to learning more about those in the future.</p>
<p>There are some clues on <a href="https://sprites.dev/">the homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You read and write to fast, directly attached NVMe storage. Your data then gets written to durable, external object storage. [...]</p>
<p>You don't pay for allocated filesystem space, just the blocks you write. And it's all TRIM friendly, so your bill goes down when you delete things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The really clever feature is checkpoints. You (or your coding agent) can trigger a checkpoint which takes around 300ms. This captures the entire disk state and can then be rolled back to later.</p>
<p>For more on how that works, run this in a Sprite:</p>
<pre><code>cat /.sprite/docs/agent-context.md

</code></pre>
<p>Here's the relevant section:</p>
<pre><code>## Checkpoints
- Point-in-time checkpoints and restores available
- Copy-on-write implementation for storage efficiency
- Last 5 checkpoints mounted at `/.sprite/checkpoints`
- Checkpoints capture only the writable overlay, not the base image

</code></pre>
<p>Or run this to see the <code>--help</code> for the command used to manage them:</p>
<pre><code>sprite-env checkpoints --help
</code></pre>
<p>Which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>sprite-env checkpoints - Manage environment checkpoints

USAGE:
    sprite-env checkpoints &lt;subcommand&gt; [options]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    list [--history &lt;ver&gt;]  List all checkpoints (optionally filter by history version)
    get &lt;id&gt;                Get checkpoint details (e.g., v0, v1, v2)
    create                  Create a new checkpoint (auto-versioned)
    restore &lt;id&gt;            Restore from a checkpoint (e.g., v1)

NOTE:
    Checkpoints are versioned as v0, v1, v2, etc.
    Restore returns immediately and triggers an async restore that restarts the environment.
    The last 5 checkpoints are mounted at /.sprite/checkpoints for direct file access.

EXAMPLES:
    sprite-env checkpoints list
    sprite-env checkpoints list --history v1.2.3
    sprite-env checkpoints get v2
    sprite-env checkpoints create
    sprite-env checkpoints restore v1

</code></pre>
<h4>Really clever use of Claude Skills</h4>
<p>I'm <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">a big fan of Skills</a>, the mechanism whereby Claude Code (and increasingly other agents too) can be given additional capabilities by describing them in Markdown files in a specific directory structure.</p>
<p>In a smart piece of design, Sprites uses pre-installed skills to teach Claude how Sprites itself works. This means you can ask Claude on the machine how to do things like open up ports and it will talk you through the process.</p>
<p>There's all sorts of interesting stuff in the <code>/.sprite</code> folder on that machine - digging in there is a great way to learn more about how Sprites works.</p>
<h4>A sandbox API</h4>
<p>Also from my predictions post earlier this week: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-we-re-finally-going-to-solve-sandboxing">&quot;We’re finally going to solve sandboxing&quot;</a>. I am obsessed with this problem: I want to be able to run untrusted code safely, both on my personal devices and in the context of web services I'm building for other people to use.</p>
<p>I have <em>so many things</em> I want to build that depend on being able to take untrusted code - from users or from LLMs or from LLMs-driven-by-users - and run that code in a sandbox where I can be confident that the blast radius if something goes wrong is tightly contained.</p>
<p>Sprites offers a clean <a href="https://sprites.dev/api">JSON API</a> for doing exactly that, plus client libraries in <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-go">Go</a> and <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-js">TypeScript</a> and coming-soon <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py">Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-ex">Elixir</a>.</p>
<p>From their quick start:</p>
<pre><code># Create a new sprite
curl -X PUT https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/my-sprite \
-H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&quot;

# Execute a command
curl -X POST https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/my-sprite/exec \
-H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&quot; \
-d '{&quot;command&quot;: &quot;echo hello&quot;}'

</code></pre>
<p>You can also checkpoint and rollback via the API, so you can get your environment exactly how you like it, checkpoint it, run a bunch of untrusted code, then roll back to the clean checkpoint when you're done.</p>
<p>Managing network access is an important part of maintaining a good sandbox. The Sprites API lets you <a href="https://sprites.dev/api/sprites/policies">configure network access policies</a> using a DNS-based allow/deny list like this:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST \
  &quot;https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/{name}/policy/network&quot; \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&quot; \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d '{
    &quot;rules&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;action&quot;: &quot;allow&quot;,
        &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;github.com&quot;
      },
      {
        &quot;action&quot;: &quot;allow&quot;,
        &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;*.npmjs.org&quot;
      }
    ]
  }'
</code></pre>
<h4>Scale-to-zero billing</h4>
<p>Sprites have scale-to-zero baked into the architecture. They go to sleep after 30 seconds of inactivity, wake up quickly when needed and bill you for just the CPU hours, RAM hours and GB-hours of storage you use while the Sprite is awake.</p>
<p>Fly <a href="https://sprites.dev/#billing">estimate</a> a 4 hour intensive coding session as costing around 46 cents, and a low traffic web app with 30 hours of wake time per month at ~$4.</p>
<p>(I calculate that a web app that consumes all 8 CPUs and all 8GBs of RAM 24/7 for a month would cost ((7 cents * 8 * 24 * 30) + (4.375 cents * 8 * 24 * 30)) / 100 = $655.2 per month, so don't necessarily use these as your primary web hosting solution for an app that soaks up all available CPU and RAM!)</p>
<h4>Two of my favorite problems at once</h4>
<p>I was hopeful that Fly would enter the developer-friendly sandbox API market, especially given other entrants from companies like <a href="https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandboxes">Modal</a> and <a href="https://e2b.dev/">E2B</a>.</p>
<p>I did not expect that they'd tackle the developer sandbox problem at the same time, and with the same product!</p>
<p>My one concern here is that it makes the product itself a little harder to explain.</p>
<p>I'm already spinning up some prototypes of sandbox-adjacent things I've always wanted to build, and early signs are very promising. I'll write more about these as they turn into useful projects.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here's some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557825#46560748">additional colour</a> from Thomas Ptacek on Hacker News:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has been in the works for quite awhile here. We put a long bet on &quot;slow create fast start/stop&quot; --- which is a really interesting and useful shape for execution environments --- but it didn't make sense to sandboxers, so &quot;fast create&quot; has been the White Whale at Fly.io for over a year.</p>

      <p>Trump is president the same way people who do vibe coding are developers. I always thought he'd be much happier playing president on TV instead of actually being president. And people would think about this stuff more rationally if it were a TV show like Pluribus or Severance. Why did they <em>really</em> do what they did? Or the way we talk about the Mets or the Knicks and their various foibles. It's funny people have a clarity about fictional stuff that they don't have for real-world things like war, health insurance, the cost of eggs and gestapo tactics.</p>

      <h1>Interpolate contrast-color() to manipulate lightness</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>In <a href="https://daverupert.com/2026/01/algorithmic-hover-states-with-contrast-color/">my first post on <code>contrast-color()</code></a> I demo’d using <code>color-mix()</code> to change a background-color on hover, but I will be honest… mixing black and white isn’t always what you want. It would be cool and helpful to coerce <code>contrast-color()</code> to return either <code>1</code> or <code>-1</code> so that we could adjust lightness in a color function on hover instead of only mixing white and black.</p>
<p>Building on the inline CSS <code>if()</code> statements <a href="https://daverupert.com/2026/01/contrast-color-with-custom-design-tokens/">in my last post</a>, we can use the same trick to interpolate the result of <code>contrast-color()</code> into a number.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: All caveats from the previous post about browser support, caching quirks, and expected syntax changes still apply.</p>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/myPogBv">contrast-color() powered design system colors</a> by Dave Rupert ( <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>Ahh… feel that? Now our states maintains its harmonious color palette where mixing in white or black gets us a bit muddier results. We’re picking another note on the scale of the color’s lightness ramp.</p>
<p>The relevant CSS to make this trick work goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>/* Needed for if() statement */
@property --captured-color {
  syntax: &quot;&lt;color&gt;&quot;;
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: white;
}

/* https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/ */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg) var(--l) 0 0);
}

button {
  background-color: var(--ds-button-bg);
	--captured-color: --contrast-color(var(--ds-button-bg));
  --lighter-or-darker: if(
    style(--captured-color: oklch(1 0 0)): 2.5; /* go extra lighter */
    else: -1; /* go darker */
  );
  ...

	&amp;:hover, &amp;:focus {
		background-color: oklch(
			from var(--ds-button-bg)
			calc(l + (0.1 * var(--lighter-or-darker))) c h
		);
  }
}

</code></pre>
<p>For comparison’s sake, I web-inspected up a little apples-to-apples, side-by-side of the <a href="https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/myPogBv">adjusting lightness way</a> and the <a href="https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/bNpzYzX">color-mixing way</a> of algorithmic hover states where it’s 10% lightened/darkened versus 10% mix of white/black.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2026/colormixing.png" alt="a side by side look at adjusting lightness vs mixing in white and black. the rest for all the buttons is on top and the hover state for all the buttons is on the bottom. The hover states for the buttons on the adjusting lightness demo are a bit warmer, but probably hard to notice to the average person."></p>
<p>The difference is almost imperceptible, but the hover states from the “Adjust Lightness” method feel a tad bit warmer, particularly on the bottom row with the green, blue, and purple buttons. The difference becomes more obvious if the step is greater than 10%.</p>
<p>Unless your customers are a bunch of color dorks, they probably won’t see it the care you put into this. But I’m willing to wager that even if they don’t see the difference, they will be able to feel the difference.</p>
<p>We also get a lot more control with this <code>if()</code> statement route. For example, I can set the lighten amount to <code>2.5</code> (+25%) instead of <code>1</code> (+10%) because that’s what felt better. If you’re algorithmically generating your color palettes, it should be easy to find the ideal values; either a step-up or step-down, perhaps. And we’re also not just limited to lightness! You could mess with chroma or whatever the <code>b</code> in <code>lab()</code> is. Find what makes sense for your system.</p>
<p>A part of me wants to take this even further to get more control. For example, if the color is super dark (e.g. black) and the lightness value is below <code>0.1</code>, lighten by 25%, otherwise lighten by 10%. That might be possible with an <code>if()</code> inside the <code>oklch()</code> or a <code>sin()</code> function… but that sounds like a lot of Math and probably hurts readability. More experiments to do though.</p>
<p>It’s fun to embark on this new world of algorithmic color schemes in vanilla CSS. While I’m excited to play, I’m more excited to see what your beautiful brains come up with.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: bunnie's piggyback hack (09 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links bunnie's piggyback hack: An actual &quot;one weird trick&quot; that's pretty fucking spectacular. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: &quot;Keyboard Practice&quot;; Sam Bulte says she's no dirtier than other MPs; Gene Luen Yang's Amabassador for Young People's Literature speech; Menstruation innovation. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. bunnie's piggyback hack (permalink) If Andrew &quot;bunnie&quot; Huang didn't actually exist, I'd swear he was a character out of a(n extraordinarily technologically well-informed) cyberpunk novel. Every time I interact with this legendary hardware hacker, he blows my mind with some incredible project or insight that permanently alters how I think about technology. I first met bunnie when he came to EFF for help with the threats he'd received from Microsoft. At the time, bunnie was an electrical engineering grad student at MIT, and he'd taken the bootloader locks on the new Xbox platform as a personal affront and challenge. He applied his prodigious skill and talent to these digital handcuffs, and in short order, he had broken the Xbox and installed Linux on it. MIT's general counsel immediately washed its hands of any responsibility to defend this young grad student from bullying by a corporate monopolist, hanging him out to dry. So he turned to us – and we got his back. You can read all about it in Hacking the Xbox, his canonical work about hardware hacking and technological freedom (it's free!): <a href="https://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox">https://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox</a>_Free.pdf In the many years since, I've been lucky enough to count bunnie as a friend, colleague and comrade, albeit one I only physically run into every year or so, usually at some tech event or on the playa at Burning Man, where he still camps with the MIT crew at The Institute. I just got to see bunnie in person again, over Christmas week at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg. He gave a late-night presentation with his collaborator Sean &quot;xobs&quot; Cross, entitled &quot;Xous: A Pure-Rust Rethink of the Embedded Operating System&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbWWGkyIBGM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbWWGkyIBGM</a> Don't let the technical-sounding title intimidate you! This was a banger of a talk, and as with every bunnie Huang production, it left a pleasant and persistent aftertaste. The background for this talk is bunnie's obsession with building a trustworthy computer. For decades, bunnie has been chasing the dream of a computer whose every component – operating system, drivers, firmware, and hardware designs – are open to inspection. Bunnie's reasoning here is that anything that can't be inspected (and, by extension, modified) by its users is a spot where bad guys can hide bad stuff, and where lurking bugs can fester until they are exploited by bad guys. Remember the spectacular (and still mysterious) claims that Apple's servers had all been compromised with minuscule hardware bugs? The single best explanation of that you will find comes from bunnie: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqQhWitJ1As">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqQhWitJ1As</a> Bunnie was doing all this before there was an &quot;open source hardware&quot; movement, and he remains at its vanguard. His &quot;Precursor&quot; project is a reference hardware platform where every component is open to inspection and modification, from the chassis to the random number generator: <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/category/betrusted/precursor/">https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/category/betrusted/precursor/</a> One area of especial concern and interest for bunnie is the promise and peril of the &quot;system-on-a-chip&quot; (SoC). This is exactly what it sounds like: a cheap chip that incorporates everything you need to do full-fledged computing, including interfaces and drivers for networks, screens, peripherals, etc. SoCs are ubiquitous. You find them in things like individual car engine components and inkjet printer cartridges, and each one is a whole-ass computer, capable of running some really ugly malware. As bunnie explained back in 2020, there are two problems with SoCs: first, they are packaged such that the silicon traces inside of them can't be readily inspected, and second, they are so expensive to fabricate that someone like bunnie can't possibly come up with the millions needed to make an open, trustworthy, inspectable alternative: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#precursor">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#precursor</a> That's where bunnie's CCC talk comes in. The chips that SoCs are etched upon have lots of space (relatively speaking – we're talking about nanometer-scale circuits, after all). Even after an SoC designer packs in a ton of extra traces to handle oddball applications, the chip is still mostly &quot;dark matter&quot; – blank silicon. The first half of bunnie and xobs's talk concerns itself with &quot;Xous,&quot; a secure operating system for an SoC, written in Rust. But the second half of the talk tackles the problem of procuring an SoC that you can trust to run Xous on. That's where this dark matter comes in. Bunnie's day-job is consulting on extremely gnarly, high-stakes, high-value hardware design and manufacturing, so naturally, he's got lots of clients and contacts in the SoC manufacturing world. He approached one of these companies with a proposal: let me tape out a whole separate chip that fits in the dark matter for one of your upcoming chips. Adding these traces adds virtually no cost to the production, and adding bunnie's chips to the production run actually saves the manufacturer money, because the prices drop when the quantities increase. The idea is to put two chips on the chip, and badge most of them with the OEM's branding, while a small rump of the chips will have bunnie's branding (he calls it the Baochip). On bunnie's chips, the traces to the OEM chip will be physically cut, meaning that the Baochips will just be Baochips – the original chip will be inaccessible and unusable. What's more, bunnie didn't just fit one chip into the OEM's &quot;dark matter&quot; – he fit five separate, specialized SoCs into the unused space. Remember, the beauty of SoCs is that once they're taped out and sent to production, the cost of an actual chip is peanuts, meaning that these Baochips are cheap as hell. Even better: the traces on these chips are scaled to be readily inspected using relatively low-cost equipment, meaning that many parties around the world can grab one of these chips, stick it in a machine, and compare the traces on the chip to the free, open sourcefile that was used to produce it, confirming that there are no nasty surprises lurking inside. This was such an exciting talk, and as I sat through it, I had this nagging feeling that it reminded me of something else I'd learned about years before, though I couldn't quite place it. Finally, as bunnie and xobs were stepping off the stage, I had it – it reminded me of another bunnie talk I'd seen – this one at The Institute, the MIT Burning Man camp, more than a decade prior. Back in 2015, bunnie designed and built a set of really cool, wearable radio-linked badges for his campmates, which would help them locate one another on the playa at night. These badges were really cool – they used a genetic algorithm to &quot;have sex&quot; with one another and mutate their color patterns. Bunnie even worked in a &quot;consent&quot; mechanism! <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2015/sex-circuits-deep-house/">https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2015/sex-circuits-deep-house/</a> But the really cool part that stuck with me was the manufacturing story. Bunnie wanted to fabricate custom injection-molded plastic enclosures for these pendants, but injection molding – like chip design – is a mass production phenomenon, with sky-high setup costs and incredibly cheap per-unit costs thereafter. So (and this might sound familiar) bunnie reached out to a die-maker that he worked with in China and said, &quot;Hey, the next time you're contracted to mill out a die for a client, let me know if there's any extra space on the face of the die, and I'll provide you with a shapefile you can carve out of this 'dark matter.'&quot; This doesn't add any cost to the die setup, and it means that bunnie can run just a couple dozen injection-molded, custom cases at a cost of pennies per unit. I grabbed bunnie later that night and mentioned this old Burning Man project to him and he said, &quot;You know, I haven't ever thought of it, but you're right, there's definitely a throughline between the two projects.&quot; I asked him what he called this technique and he shrugged and said he didn't really have a name for it, but he thought of it as &quot;piggybacking,&quot; which seems like a good name to me. It seems to me that these two kinds of manufacturing can't be the only ones that can be &quot;piggybacked&quot; onto. That's what motivated me to write this post – to get people thinking about these high-setup/low-unit cost production types that might be piggybacked for small batch, delightful projects like bunnie's. Well, that, and just to do one of my periodic bunnie Huang appreciation posts. If there's one person that I'd recommend people pay more attention to, it's him. He's also a terrific communicator, and an indecently great writer. My readers might be familiar with him thanks to the afterword he contributed to Little Brother: <a href="https://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/">https://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/</a> More recently, he wrote a fantastic intro for last year's Science Comics Computers: How Digital Computers Work, a brilliant middle-grades graphic novel that uses steampunk dinosaurs to explain digital logic and the building blocks of computation: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac</a> He also co-authored a fascinating research paper with Edward Snowden, after the two of them collaborated on a daughter-board that spots otherwise untraceable malware: <a href="https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf">https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf</a> Again, my readers will recognize this as a gimmick from my 2020 novel Attack Surface (a Little Brother novel for adults): <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757517/attacksurface/">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757517/attacksurface/</a> That's not bunnie's only sweet hardware hack, of course.

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/24/rooster.png" alt="">I get ideas when I go for a walk or drive somewhere in my car. This was one of those times, but it was not a comforting idea. I live in the mountains on the west side of the Hudson River near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York">Kingston</a>. On my drive to town yesterday I went through the small town of Woodstock, and I was thinking about how ICE is occupying Minneapolis, and wondered why wasn't I more concerned about it personally. The answer -- it's far away from here, and Woodstock, while it is a famous place, is on absolutely no one's radar. But then I remembered the astounding amount of money we allocated for ICE, far more than could be used for border enforcement, so obviously this all is a prelude for an American secret police and here's where the disquieting idea came up. Of course ICE will operate in every city and town in the US no matter how remote or small. But first they have to perfect their act, this is a form of training to teach the skinheads of America how to be part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel">SS</a>. Experiment first in a few cities before deploying, gradually, everywhere. We're all going to have to submit to loyalty oaths, and we will all be forced to denounce our neighbors as illustrated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others">Lives of Others</a>, which if you haven't watched it yet, now is the time when you have to, to get an idea what it was like in East Germany before the wall came down, and where we're headed. It still may not be too late yet, but it's getting close.</p>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>For the past decade, I've used <a href="https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog">Mailhog</a> for local email debugging. Besides working on web applications that deal with email, I've long used email as the primary notification system for comments on the blog.</p>
<p>I built an <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailhog">Ansible role for Mailhog</a>, and it was one of the main features of <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2015/major-improvements-drupal-vm/">Drupal VM</a>, a popular local development environment for Drupal I sunset 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, barring any future updates from the maintainers, it seems like <a href="https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/issues/466">Mailhog has not been maintained</a> for four years now. It still <em>works</em>, but something as complex as an email debugging environment needs ongoing maintenance to stay relevant.</p>

      <h1>Using your design system colors with contrast-color()</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>One predictable pain point with <code>contrast-color()</code> is that it only returns <code>black</code> and <code>white</code> named colors. From a design systems perspective, that’s not ideal because you want <em>your</em> colors. You want your harmonious brand and the colors you and your team spent thousands of man hours in meetings deciding on. Those colors.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/exploring-color-contrast-for-the-first-time/">an earlier version of Safari had <code>color-contrast()</code></a> (confusing I know, naming is hard) which allowed you to pass in a list of best candidates to choose from. I beleive that proposal got mired in standards discussions, color contrast algorithms, and competing proposals; and <code>contrast-color()</code> is what survived which got simplified down to a binary result.</p>
<p>In the future though, we can use <code>contrast-color()</code> and <code>if()</code> together to help pick the value we want. Alas, at the time of writing no browser supports both <code>if()</code> and <code>contrast-color()</code>. But we can use <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/">Lea Verou’s <code>--contrast-color()</code> workaround</a> to experiment with how this will work in Chromium today.</p>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/myPogBv">contrast-color() powered design system colors</a> by Dave Rupert ( <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>The CSS to get this working looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>@property --captured-color {
  syntax: &quot;&lt;color&gt;&quot;;
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: white;
}

/* https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/ */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg) var(--l) 0 0);
}

:root {
  --ds-text-white: wheat;
  --ds-text-black: darkslategray;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--ds-button-bg);
  --captured-color: --contrast-color(var(--ds-button-bg));

  color: if(
     style(--captured-color: oklch(1 0 0)): var(--ds-text-white);
     else: var(--ds-text-black);
  );
}

</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it! Using (a form of) <code>contrast-color()</code> you can select the proper tokens from your design system. Cool.</p>
<p>One quirky bit needed to make it work is defining a type for <code>--captured-color</code> using CSS <code>@property</code>, <a href="https://blog.kizu.dev/captured-custom-properties/">a trick I learned from Roma Komarov</a>. To be honest I don’t fully understand <em>the why</em> behind Registered Custom Properties and the <a href="https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-properties-values-api/#calculation-of-computed-values">Computed Value Time Behavior</a> superpower, but my simple brain created a rule “If you’re going to compare a variable to a <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> in a CSS <code>if()</code> statement, make sure to register the variable as a <code>&lt;color&gt;</code>.”</p>
<p>If/when any of the browsers start supporting both features, I expect we’ll have to update <code>oklch(1 0 0)</code> in the style query to <code>white</code> or <code>rgb(255 255 255)</code>. At least, I hope it works that way.</p>
<p>One unexpected challenge that I encountered with this demo was that if I abstracted out the <code>if</code> statement out into its own custom function, it would break. I’m not 100% sure why but I think it’s based on how CSS functions cache results. I’ll have to dig into this more, but I’m happy the inline <code>if</code> statement works. Hopefully someone smarter can figure it out.</p>
<p>Anyways, exiting times. And can we pause for a moment and marvel at how this is all vanilla 2026 CSS?! What a world.</p>

      <p>
      <p>I joined a recording of the Oxide and Friends podcast on Tuesday to talk about 1, 3 and 6 year predictions for the tech industry. This is my second appearance on their annual predictions episode, you can see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/">my predictions from January 2025 here</a>. Here's <a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/predictions-2026">the page for this year's episode</a>, with options to listen in all of your favorite podcast apps or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8">directly on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Bryan Cantrill started the episode by declaring that he's never been so unsure about what's coming in the next year. I share that uncertainty - the significant advances in coding agents just in the last two months have left me certain that things will change significantly, but unclear as to what those changes will be.</p>
<p>Here are the predictions I shared in the episode.</p>

<h4>1 year: It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=1167s">▶ 19:27</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that there are still people out there who are convinced that LLMs cannot write good code. Those people are in for a very nasty shock in 2026. I do not think it will be possible to get to the end of even the next three months while still holding on to that idea that the code they write is all junk and it's it's likely any decent human programmer will write better code than they will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2023, saying that LLMs write garbage code was entirely correct. For most of 2024 that stayed true. In 2025 that changed, but you could be forgiven for continuing to hold out. In 2026 the quality of LLM-generated code will become impossible to deny.</p>
<p>I base this on my own experience - I've spent more time exploring <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI-assisted programming</a> than most.</p>
<p>The key change in 2025 (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#the-year-of-reasoning-">my overview for the year</a>) was the introduction of &quot;reasoning models&quot; trained specifically against code using Reinforcement Learning. The major labs spent a full year competing with each other on who could get the best code capabilities from their models, and that problem turns out to be perfectly attuned to RL since code challenges come with built-in verifiable success conditions.</p>
<p>Since Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 came out in November and December respectively the amount of code I've written by hand has dropped to a single digit percentage of my overall output. The same is true for many other expert programmers I know.</p>
<p>At this point if you continue to argue that LLMs write useless code you're damaging your own credibility.</p>
<h4>1 year: We're finally going to solve sandboxing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=1205s">▶ 20:05</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this year is the year we're going to solve sandboxing. I want to run code other people have written on my computing devices without it destroying my computing devices if it's malicious or has bugs. [...] It's crazy that it's 2026 and I still <code>pip install</code> random code and then execute it in a way that it can steal all of my data and delete all my files. [...] I don't want to run a piece of code on any of my devices that somebody else wrote outside of sandbox ever again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't just about LLMs, but it becomes even more important now there are so many more people writing code often without knowing what they're doing. Sandboxing is also a key part of the battle against prompt injection.</p>
<p>We have a <em>lot</em> of promising technologies in play already for this - containers and WebAssembly being the two I'm most optimistic about. There's real commercial value involved in solving this problem. The pieces are there, what's needed is UX work to reduce the friction in using them productively and securely.</p>
<h4>1 year: A &quot;Challenger disaster&quot; for coding agent security <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=1281s">▶ 21:21</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we're due a Challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security[...] I think so many people, myself included, are running these coding agents practically as root, right? We're letting them do all of this stuff. And every time I do it, my computer doesn't get wiped. I'm like, &quot;oh, it's fine&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used this as an opportunity to promote my favourite recent essay about AI security, <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/the-normalization-of-deviance-in-ai/">the Normalization of Deviance in AI</a> by Johann Rehberger.</p>
<p>The Normalization of Deviance describes the phenomenon where people and organizations get used to operating in an unsafe manner because nothing bad has happened to them yet, which can result in enormous problems (like the 1986 Challenger disaster) when their luck runs out.</p>
<p>Every six months I predict that a headline-grabbing prompt injection attack is coming soon, and every six months it doesn't happen. This is my most recent version of that prediction!</p>
<h4>1 year: Kākāpō parrots will have an outstanding breeding season <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=3006s">▶ 50:06</a></h4>
<p>(I dropped this one to lighten the mood after a discussion of the deep sense of existential dread that many programmers are feeling right now!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that Kākāpō parrots in New Zealand are going to have an outstanding breeding season. The reason I think this is that the Rimu trees are in fruit right now. There's only 250 of them, and they only breed if the Rimu trees have a good fruiting. The Rimu trees have been terrible since 2019, but this year the Rimu trees were all blooming. There are researchers saying that all 87 females of breeding age might lay an egg. And for a species with only 250 remaining parrots that's great news.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81k%C4%81p%C5%8D#Population_timeline">checked Wikipedia</a> and I was right with the parrot numbers but wrong about the last good breeding season, apparently 2022 was a good year too.)</p>
<p>In a year with precious little in the form of good news I am utterly delighted to share this story. Here's more:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.doc.govt.nz/2025/06/27/kakapo-breeding-season-2026/">Kākāpō breeding season 2026</a> introduction from the Department of Conservation from June 2025 .</li>

<p>I don't often use AI-generated images on this blog, but the Kākāpō image the Oxide team created for this episode is just <em>perfect</em>:</p>

<h4>3 years: the coding agents Jevons paradox for software engineering will resolve, one way or the other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=3277s">▶ 54:37</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We will find out if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a> saves our careers or not. This is a big question that anyone who's a software engineer has right now: we are driving the cost of actually producing working code down to a fraction of what it used to cost. Does that mean that our careers are completely devalued and we all have to learn to live on a tenth of our incomes, or does it mean that the demand for software, for custom software goes up by a factor of 10 and now our skills are even <em>more</em> valuable because you can hire me and I can build you 10 times the software I used to be able to? I think by three years we will know for sure which way that one went.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote says it all. There are two ways this coding agents thing could go: it could turn out software engineering skills are devalued, or it could turn out we're more valuable and effective than ever before.</p>
<p>I'm crossing my fingers for the latter! So far it feels to me like it's working out that way.</p>
<h4>3 years: Someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding and it won't even be a surprise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=3913s">▶ 65:13</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won't even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine[...] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it'll get so much easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common complaint today from AI coding skeptics is that LLMs are fine for toy projects but can't be used for anything large and serious.</p>
<p>I think within 3 years that will be comprehensively proven incorrect, to the point that it won't even be controversial anymore.</p>
<p>I picked a web browser here because so much of the work building a browser involves writing code that has to conform to an enormous and daunting selection of both formal tests and informal websites-in-the-wild.</p>
<p>Coding agents are <em>really good</em> at tasks where you can define a concrete goal and then set them to work iterating in that direction.</p>
<p>A web browser is the most ambitious project I can think of that leans into those capabilities.</p>
<h4>6 years: Typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=4839s">▶ 80:39</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the job of being paid money to type code into a computer will go the same way as punching punch cards [...] in six years time, I do not think anyone will be paid to just to do the thing where you type the code. I think software engineering will still be an enormous career. I just think the software engineers won't be spending multiple hours of their day in a text editor typing out syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more time I spend on AI-assisted programming the less afraid I am for my job, because it turns out building software - especially at the rate it's now possible to build - still requires enormous skill, experience and depth of understanding.</p>
<p>The skills are changing though! Being able to read a detailed specification and transform it into lines of code is the thing that's being automated away. What's left is everything else, and the more time I spend working with coding agents the larger that &quot;everything else&quot; becomes.</p>

    <article data-published="2026-01-08T16:46:00Z" data-link="https://daverupert.com/2026/01/algorithmic-hover-states-with-contrast-color/">
      <h1>Algorithmic hover states with contrast-color()</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>Firefox 146 added support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/color_value/contrast-color"><code>contrast-color()</code></a> joining Safari 26 in the First Implementor’s Club. For those unfamiliar, <code>contrast-color(&lt;color&gt;)</code> is a new CSS function that will take a <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> as input and returns either <code>white</code> or <code>black</code> depending on which has the most contrast.</p>
<p>The quintessential example is choosing a foreground text <code>color</code> with the best contrast.</p>
<pre><code>button {
	--button-bg: red;
	background: var(--button-bg);
	color: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));
	/* @returns black (5.25:1 WCAG AA Pass)
			not white (3.99:1 WCAG AA Fail) */
}

</code></pre>
<p>If someone changes <code>--button-bg</code> to purple, the foreground color automatically resolves to the either white or black, whichever has more contrast. It avoids having to set an extra token for color and takes the guess work out of picking an accessible foreground color.</p>
<p>I think this is going to be an incredible boon to design systems where I don’t control what <code>--button-bg</code> is, but I do care about providing accessible experiences. And I think that’s the goal of this feature; to have “smart defaults” that lead to more accessible websites, easier algorithmically-driven color systems, and better “theme a whole website from a single color picker” demos.</p>
<h2>Sure contrast-color() can do foreground colors, but what about backgrounds?</h2>
<p>We’re having conversations at work about algorithmically driven rest/hover/active states for Buttons. In the current <a href="https://web.dev/baseline/">Baseline</a> you can use <code>color-mix()</code> to lighten/darken colors on <code>:hover</code>…</p>
<pre><code>button {
	background-color: var(--button-bg);
	color: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));

	&amp;:hover, &amp;:focus {
		background-color: color-mix(
			in srgb,
			var(--button-bg) 90%,
			black 10%
		)
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p>The code above will dim your button on <code>:hover</code> 10% by mixing in black. But what if our Buttons are already dark (black, navy, etc)? In that situation we want to lighten the background-color instead of dimming. We can glue on new classes like <code>button.lighten-on-hover</code> or <code>button.invert-hover</code> and that works… until we get to light and dark theme modes of our Button where you probably want to lighten/darken oppositely depending on the mode…</p>
<p>Ugh. In that situation you’d have <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>, <code>[data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;]</code> styles in your Button styles and people are mad now because the Button styles are too complex. There’s got to be a better way!</p>
<p>Well, do I have good news for you…</p>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/bNpzYzX">contrast-color() powered lighten/darken bg on hover</a> by Dave Rupert ( <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>Per my previous conversations, I wondered if we could use <code>contrast-color()</code> to programmatically lighten/darken an button based on its current <code>background-color</code>. If the Button is black, and the contrast-color is white, let’s mix in white (and vice versa):</p>
<pre><code>:root {
	color-scheme: light dark;
	--button-bg: light-dark(navyblue, lightpurple);
}

button {
	background-color: var(--button-bg);
	color: color-contrast(var(--button-bg));

	&amp;:hover, &amp;:focus {
		background-color: color-mix(
			in srgb,
			var(--button-bg) 75%,
			contrast-color(var(--button-bg)) 10%
		)
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p>Huzzah! Now our Button’s hover states go in the desired direction and our foreground <code>color</code> is intrinsically styled based on its own <code>background-color</code>. Nice. From a design systems perspective I’m pretty excited about the possibility to remove a bunch of state-based tokens from our collection.</p>
<h3>Now available in… everywhere?</h3>
<p>This approach only works in Safari and Firefox. However, if I use <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/">Lea Verou’s method of polyfilling <code>contrast-color()</code></a>, we can pop in a custom <code>@function --contrast-color()</code> that works in Chromium 139+. The final working solution looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>/* @function supported in Chromium */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg-color) var(--l) 0 h);
}

button {
  /* contrast-color() supported in Safari &amp; Firefox */
  --button-fg: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));

  @supports not (color: contrast-color(red)) {
    --button-fg: --contrast-color(var(--button-bg));
  }

  background: var(--button-bg);
  color: var(--button-fg);

  &amp;:hover,
  &amp;:focus{
    background-color: color-mix(
      in srgb,
      var(--button-bg) 75%,
      var(--button-fg) 10%
    );
  }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Depending on your browser matrix, this may work for you. It’s probably a <em>smidge</em> too new for us to roll out to customers, right now but for personal sites heck yeah.</p>
<p>This is interesting tech and I’m excited to dig in more. And spoiler alert, this is the first post in a small little series I have already written up for you.</p>

      <h1>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing #425</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <h3><em>For December 24, 2025-January 6, 2026</em></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. It’s only January 8th but we’re pleased to announce that we’ve already completed one of our major goals of 2026: Getting our heads unstuck from the way-too-small turtleneck sweaters we bought each other for Christmas.</p>

Jim also does a great job exploring many different, unexpected effects that the cobra has on this workplace, including on the decor: “At this point I don’t think it’s necessary to show us more baby pictures of the cobra. I think there are enough framed photographs on the office walls, visible from every work station, for us to be familiar with how the snake looked.”</p>

We assume you have many questions, for example, “Wait, how do water sommeliers cleanse their palates in between water tastings?” Fear not, all will be answered. Come for the rankings of different waters, stay for phrases like “water gossip.”</p>

      <h1>Was the ICE murder pre-calculated?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>When there's breaking news these days I check Fox News in addition to CNN, MSNOW, BBC, PBS. The best are the last two. But last night night when everyone was fixated on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Renee_Good">story</a> of Renee Nicole Good, the woman who was killed in cold blood, on video, by a masked ICE thug, I wondered what Fox was saying. They were showing the actual video over and over like the other networks. Their words were what Trump was saying, but they didn't hide what actually happened, at least as long as it's news.</p>
<p>Then I wondered how much this was pre-calculated. It clearly doesn't hurt ICE to signal that they're killing US citizens in the US with impunity. Next time will be soon, and it will be more than one dead, and maybe they'll be kids. What makes me think this was not planned by the higher-ups is that they killed a middle-aged white woman, mother of 3,, who writes poetry. Not a very likely cartel leader or narco-terrorist. There were dolls in the glove compartment of the car.</p>
<p>Every indication is that she was just afraid and trying to get out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>We also remember that in the aftermath of Jan 6, private texts from the top people at Fox indicated they were scared and appalled like most other relatively sane Americans. What had happened then was unthinkable. Well, what happened yesterday was just as unthinkable. Shocking. Makes you wonder what's next. Get ready, we're going to see a lot of ugliness now, hard to comprehend, hard to accept. We still have a skeletal democracy, and ICE isn't fully staffed yet (they have new billions of dollars to spend).</p>
<p>On Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dan.conover.714/posts/pfbid035Dzpcd13T73crrWxC85U6GMf1UH2qH148cJuYvEfHMzCUjMDypyha9vbrrMSKEDJl?comment_id=1185132377083238&amp;notif_id=1767891365875871&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif">Dan Conover said</a>: &quot;This is what the collapse of the rules-based order looks like.&quot;</p>
<p>I responded: &quot;Or it's a test of it. The guy wasn't very well disguised, I think he will be identified if he hasn't already been identified. Will he be arrested and tried? If yes, then we just validated the rule-based order. If no, we're fucked.</p>
<p>&quot;Or even better the state of Minnesota could go to court and sue ICE to get their officers to wear identifying information, and no masks. For just this reason. And then here's an arrest warrant for the guy who fired his gun 3 times at the head of a 37-year old mom who writes poetry and drives an SUV with teddy bears in the glove compartment. In other words I'm not sure this was intentional (on behalf of ICE), and I think they may have to turn this guy over, otherwise someone is getting impeached. The video is too compelling.&quot;</p>

      <h1>How Google Got Its Groove Back and Edged Ahead of OpenAI</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-openai-gemini-chatgpt-b766e160">How Google Got Its Groove Back and Edged Ahead of OpenAI</a></strong></p>
<p>I picked up a few interesting tidbits from this Wall Street Journal piece on Google's recent hard won success with Gemini.</p>
<p>Here's the origin of the name &quot;Nano Banana&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Naina Raisinghani, known inside Google for working late into the night, needed a name for the new tool to complete the upload. It was 2:30 a.m., though, and nobody was around. So she just made one up, a mashup of two nicknames friends had given her: Nano Banana.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The WSJ credit OpenAI's Daniel Selsam with un-retiring Sergei Brin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around that time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who had recently retired, was at a party chatting with a researcher from OpenAI named Daniel Selsam, according to people familiar with the conversation. Why, Selsam asked him, wasn’t he working full time on AI. Hadn’t the launch of ChatGPT captured his imagination as a computer scientist?</p>
<p>ChatGPT was on its way to becoming a household name in AI chatbots, while Google was still fumbling to get its product off the ground. Brin decided Selsam had a point and returned to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we get some rare concrete user numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By October, Gemini had more than 650 million monthly users, up from 450 million in July.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LLM usage number I see cited most often is OpenAI's 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT. That's from October 6th at OpenAI DevDay so it's comparable to these Gemini numbers, albeit not directly since it's weekly rather than monthly actives.</p>
<p>I'm also never sure what counts as a &quot;Gemini user&quot; - does interacting via Google Docs or Gmail count or do you need to be using a Gemini chat interface directly?</p>
<p><strong>Update 17th January 2025</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/lunixa380/status/2012610344741412909">@LunixA380 pointed out</a> that this 650m user figure comes from the <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/news/news-details/2025/Alphabet-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Results-2025-mIRgD3AI4A/default.aspx">Alphabet 2025 Q3 earnings report</a> which says this (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Alphabet had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We delivered our first-ever $100 billion quarter,&quot; said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google.</p>
<p>&quot;[...] In addition to topping leaderboards, our first party models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute, via direct API use by our customers. <strong>The Gemini App now has over 650 million monthly active users</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably the &quot;Gemini App&quot; encompasses the Android and iPhone apps as well as direct visits to <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">gemini.google.com</a> - that seems to be the indication from Google's <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/gemini/gemini-3/">November 18th blog post</a> that also mentioned the 650m number.</p>

      <h1>2026-01-08 Shared block lists for the scrapers</h1>
<p>The artificial intelligence bros are scraping the net and they don’t care if the small websites fall over or not for days on end. But you already know all that. It’s the founding story of my <a href="Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian Jihad</a>.</p>
<p>The setup I use is documented <a href="https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index">elsewhere</a>. If you have a different setup and would still like to access the list of IP addresses I’m currently blocking, maybe to block them yourself, after careful review… You do carefully review these lists, right? … Right? 😏 Well, in any case, also as a kind of explanation of what is happening, here are some files I’m regenerating every hour:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/share/1w-ban-ipv4.txt">blocked IPv4 address ranges</a></li>
<li><a href="/share/1w-ban-ipv6.txt">blocked IPv6 address ranges</a></li>
<li><a href="/share/1w-ban-asn.txt">blocked ASN</a></li>
<li><a href="/admin/publish-f2b.sh">the script</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I’m blocking the ASN by looking up all the IP address ranges they are managing and blocking them.
So the list of address ranges is the result but the list of ASNs is the intent.</p>

Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Where did the money go? (permalink) America is trudging through its third consecutive K-shaped recovery (an economic rally where the rich get richer and everyone else gets poorer). The rich have never been richer, and the debt-fueled consumption that kept the economy going is tapering down to a trickle. This isn't down to the iron laws of economics or the great forces of history. It's because we made rules that let rich people steal from everyone else, including local, state and federal tax authorities, and also workers, customers and suppliers (and society at large). From junk fees to wage theft to greedflation, politicians have thumbed the scales in favor of scumbags who drain the wealth of workers and remit it to parasites. These crooks and hustlers keep coming up with ways to squeeze a few more drops out of us. They come up with gimmicks like buy now/pay later (and then slam us with massive fees when we can't pay later), or margin-based gambling on cryptocurrency or &quot;prediction markets,&quot; both of which are crooked poker tables where you are always the sucker and the house always wins. The Trump administration didn't invent the idea of government-supported scams and hustles, but they sure supercharged it. Trump rips off his supporters like crazy – as anyone who's long on $TRUMPcoin knows – and surrounds himself with &quot;businessmen&quot; notorious for scamming workers, customers, and the government itself. But even as Trump throws his support behind hustlers and con artists, he's also backing debt-collectors, whether they're chasing student debt, medical debt, or the spiraling penalties for missing the fourth payment on your Klarna. Broadly, these are the two industries in America now: scammers who put Americans into debt, and industries who torment Americans into paying the debt. And while these two industries represent a moral crisis for the nation, they also represent an economic crisis, because they are at irreconcilable odds with one another. If you're in the business of scamming Americans so they go into debt, you want your suckers to have money (so they can give it to you). But if you're in the business of collecting the losses that Americans incur at the hands of scammers, then you're at odds with those scammers themselves – every dollar you collect on the debt from the last scam is a dollar that can't be lost to the next scam. This is what gave us the Great Financial Crisis: scumbag bankers tricked people into taking out unsustainable mortgages whose &quot;teaser rates&quot; would blow up after a couple years to levels that the borrower couldn't possibly pay back. But the lenders didn't care, because they were only &quot;loan originators&quot; who could pass those loans off to &quot;investors&quot; via exotic financial instruments. These two groups had an irreconcilable conflict: the people making the loans could only keep their scam going so long as the people collecting the loans didn't demand repayment. But these two groups – scammers and arm-breakers – aren't the only two groups in the economy. There's a third group that you might call, &quot;People who want to make useful things that we like and pay for.&quot; This third group is at odds with both the scammers and the arm-breakers, because their potential customers are being tricked (by scammers) and bankrupted (by arm-breakers). Say you want to go into business renting hotel rooms to people at reasonable rates. You're an honest sort, so you list your room prices right there on your site. But the scumbags you're competing with want to rip people off, so they list a lower price than yours, and then whack the customer with junk fees at check-in that make their room more expensive than yours. What's more, the scumbags make so much money that they can bribe the handful of dominant travel sites (which are all owned by one of two massive private-equity backed rollups) to list their hotels ahead of yours. They might not like paying bribes – in fact, they probably hate it – but they're willing to part with some of that hard-won ripoff money to keep the money-machine going. Besides, they can make up the difference with more junk fees. Whaddya gonna do, walk away from your nonrefundable, prepaid reservation and try and get a last-minute booking in a strange city? Societally speaking, the problem is that economic growth only comes from the third group. They're the ones inventing new categories of (useful) products and services that delight their customers and enrich their workers and shareholders (who then buy more things in the economy, keeping the virtuous cycle going). This festering economic zit is finally coming to a head with AI, whose most profitable use is in predicting how much a vendor can charge you – or how little a boss can pay you – without you walking away from the table: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shitrentals/comments/1q38sh4/if">https://www.reddit.com/r/shitrentals/comments/1q38sh4/if</a>_you_get_promoted_at_work_keep_it_a_secret_from/ AI's most enthusiastic customers, meanwhile, are bosses who dream of firing most of their workers and using the ensuing terror to force down the wages of the remaining workers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism</a> If the average American is a squeezed-flat toothpaste tube that's been drained of all its readily extractable contents, then AI is the scissors that slit the tube up the side so that the very last dregs can be scraped out. As Anil Dash put it, Those niceties that everybody loved, like great healthcare and decent benefits, were identified by the people running the big tech companies as “market inefficiencies” which indicated some wealth was going to you that should have been going to them. <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/">https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/</a> The scammer/arm-breaker economy is fundamentally extractive. When a private equity fund buys a company, sells off its assets, declares a special dividend and gives the proceeds to itself, and pronounces the company to have been &quot;right-sized&quot; because now it has to rent the things it used to own, they are setting that company up to fail. All it takes is one rent-shock or a couple bad quarters and a once-healthy business will fall over: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/23/spineless/#invertebrates">https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/23/spineless/#invertebrates</a> Looking at America, it's hard not to ask, &quot;Where did all the money go?&quot; Where did free state college tuition, excellent public libraries, public housing, transit, fully staffed national parks and air-traffic control towers all go? Why can't we fix the potholes? How is it that a country that once electrified itself from top to bottom and sea to sea can't figure out how to run fiber lines to the same roofs where all those power lines connect? It's because the system is organized around cheaters and arm-breakers. The Heritage Foundation – architects of Trump's Project 2025 – were founded and funded by Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos, the guys who made their billions running Amway, a pyramid scheme that was legalized by their pet Congressman, Gerry Ford, shortly after he became president: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway</a> The nation's system has been colonized and is being operated by people whose institutional home was created by pyramid-scheme hucksters. Why doesn't Trump's administration care about scam ads on Twitter and Facebook that clean out the very same Boomers who voted him into office? Because Trump's ideological project was founded by actual, non-metaphorical, non-hyperbolic con artists. That's where the money went. Smart people keep asking how Trump plans on stealing Venezuela's oil when the country is in a state of shambolic collapse and its people are starving? Who will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in new equipment when every dollar spent on capital will require a dollar for a gunman to keep it from being stolen and sold for food? You could ask the same question about America. In a country where we've literally legalized bribery, who wants to invest in productive businesses? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9Ej0L6rGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9Ej0L6rGk</a> America's crisis is the world's opportunity. A chaotic mess of cyberwarfare, trade war, and invasions means that America is no longer your ally or your trading partner – it's a threat. To neutralize that threat, we must take away the money (and thus the power) of America's oligarchs. We start down that path by changing the international laws – passed at the insistence of the US over the past 25 years – that ban foreign tech companies from modifying America's tech products. Once other countries' companies start producing the tools that let farmers fix their tractors, that let games publishers sell outside of the official ripoff app stores, that let merchants avoid the Amazon tax, they will not only reap billions of dollars, they will also create a market that favors good products, rather than scams: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</a> America's largest companies have amassed trillions by robbing Americans (first) and then everyone else (once the US trade rep got laws passed that prevented non-US tech companies from making defensive products). The project of the next ten years is to convert those trillions to billions (in profits for companies that disenshittify America's defective technology – and in savings for people who use those tools to escape America's scam economy). The beneficiaries of this program aren't limited to the investors in foreign tech companies, nor their overseas customers. Americans will also benefit from this technology, because Americans were the first victims of the US scam economy. Everyday Americans pay the app tax, the Amazon tax, the streaming tax, the Apple tax, the Google tax, the Microsoft tax. Supply Americans with the digital arms to resist these corporate raids, and they will stage a tax revolt (a thing that Americans are remarkably good at). Escaping oligarchy, escaping the climate emergency, escaping economic desperation: these goals require doing things and making things. They require real products and services, they require real infrastructure and tools. By and large people would rather have real things than scams. Ponzi America is breaking down. It's run out of suckers. We just can't afford to structure our economy like an Amway downline anymore. We never could.

      <h1>2026-01-02 Xobaque does RFC 5005</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <h1>2026-01-02 Xobaque does RFC 5005</h1>
<p>Very few blogs (this one?) support <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005.html">RFC 5005</a> “Feed Paging and Archiving”.<a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a> is a search engine that doesn’t crawl the web. It gets fed using feeds. That makes it the ideal companion for web rings, blog planets and the like. And I just added blog crawling using RFC 5005 to it.</p>
<p>As long as Xobaque finds a “next” link, it’ll continue following that chain. In order to not overwhelm sites, there’s a 5s pause between these requests. I’m still not sure how good this idea is. A site like my own with a bit more than 6000 blog pages takes over 50 hours to crawl. And a new crawl is started every 24 hours.</p>
<p>In my particular case, the next run that reaches a year-page, however, would notice that it hasn’t changed and stop. So I hope it’s still OK?</p>
<p>I think the next thing I’d like to do is support sitemaps. I don’t have one but all the Blogspot blogs have one. There are 277 Blogspot blogs on the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg">RPG Planet</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with sitemaps, as far as I am concerned, is that you then need to request each and every page. It’s not quite random crawling, but it’s getting closer. 😭</p>
<p><a href="/search/?q=%23Xobaque">#Xobaque</a> <a href="/search/?q=%23Feeds">#Feeds</a></p>
<p><strong>2026-01-03</strong>. There are four blogs on <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg">Planet RPG</a> which don’t allow Xobaque using <code>robots.txt</code>. I wonder if <a href="Jupiter">Planet Jupiter</a> – the software I use to aggregate all the feeeds – takes <code>robots.txt</code> into account? I wrote it so long ago I don’t remember.</p>
<p>As for the timeouts I’ve been getting for Blogspot blogs and others, I think the problem is that their ASN is blocked as per my <a href="Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian Jihad</a>. The <code>fail2ban</code> firewall chain needs an exception.</p>
<p>List the handles:</p>
<pre><code>nft -a list chain inet f2b-table f2b-chain

</code></pre>
<p>Insert the new rule between accept list and <code>fail2ban</code> list:</p>
<pre><code>nft insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain handle 110 \

<p><strong>2026-01-04</strong>. I implemented the import of sitemaps and sitemap indexes.
Since those requests will all hit the same host, however, I’m using a hard coded delay of 5s between requests.</p>
<p>What I need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the crawl delay from <code>robots.txt</code>. Sadly, I just discovered that this was an extension that isn’t supported by Google, for example.</li>
<li>How to schedule the full crawl of an OPML such that the individual feed pages are fetched with the least amount of waiting while still upholding the crawl delay per host.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2026-01-07</strong>. I’ve been working on better parallelizing things. The current code assumes that there won’t be all that many locations on the command line (!) and therefore starts a go routine for every OPML file to assemble a list of feeds and in a second step it then starts ten worker go routines that keep working on this task list. If full feeds are being fetched, finding a next page doesn’t delay that go routine anymore. Instead, it starts a new go routine that delays and then adds the new URL to the task list, thus assuring that the delay is kept. And now, as I think about it, I guess that won’t work because at the beginning, when the number of URLs is known, the task channel is stuffed with all the URLs and then closed. Gaaah.</p>
<p><strong>2026-01-08</strong>. I think I fixed it. You don’t close the task channel and the workers use <code>select</code> to get tasks off the channel and if there are no more tasks, they quit. The important part is that the workers must find the “next” link <em>before</em> doing the work of parsing and storing the page so that when they’re done, the next task is already waiting. In previous iterations I was doing that at the end, at which point control returns to the worker, who pulls from the task list … and apparently often enough the task hasn’t arrived, yet. Changing the order of things fixed this issue.</p>
<p>Oh, and just in case the workers all get to go before the job that assembles the tasks, add a tiny millisecond sleep before they get started. Parallel stuff is hard.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Leaders of many organizations are urging their teams to adopt agentic AI to improve efficiency, but are finding it hard to achieve any benefit. Managers attempting to add AI agents to existing human teams may find that bots fail to faithfully follow their instructions, return pointless or obvious results or burn precious time and resources spinning on tasks that older, simpler systems could have accomplished just as well.</p>
<p>The technical innovators getting the most out of AI are finding that the technology can be remarkably human in its behavior. And the more groups of AI agents are given tasks that require cooperation and collaboration, the more those human-like dynamics emerge...</p>

      <p>This term we will be exploring the meteoric rise of modern Los Angeles through two lenses: the history of its energy infrastructure and of our own institution, Caltech. These two histories intertwine in multiple ways, in the form of big personalities, grand ambitions, and feats of technical bravado. But innumerable smaller, less-visible parts of Caltech and Southern California history also play vital roles in the shaping of this region and our home institution. To trace these stories, large and small, we will be turning to the Caltech Archives and the digital collections of The Huntington Library. You will be learning how to research and communicate the history of archival objects, culminating in a final “group exhibition” of your curated pieces.</p>

      <p>
      <p>rv is a new declarative command-line package manager for the R programming language written in Rust. Being declarative, I've found it to be far-and-away better at dependency resolution than any of the other package managers on the market, and being a command line tool rather than a tool to be called from inside an interactive R session makes it work much more agreeably with standard development workflows. In short, I really can't see myself recommending that anyone use any other tool for managing R dependencies any more.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/07/mailbox.png" alt="">Another incredible use-case for ChatGPT. When it first came out <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> was a total godsend. It took something every developer of graphic apps had to struggle with, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYey8ntlK_E">said</a> basically &quot;I can do that.&quot; They had a growing set of standard icons, it got better with every version. But some special icons haven't appeared in <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Font%20Awesome%22">Font Awesome</a>. There was a great icon on the <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/article/designed-with-kare-influential-macintosh-graphics-of-early-apple-computers/">original Mac</a>, for a desk accessory, I don't remember which one. It was a flag, like the flag on a mailbox. If you put a piece of mail in the box you raise the flag, that way the postman knows to stop. When they pick up the mail they flip the flag down. On the early Mac it took an app that was wide and short, and made it wide and tall, revealing the ideas and data it kept for you. You can still have the icon, using ChatGPT. Have it generate your own icon using SVG. You get something every bit as good as a Font Awesome icon. So you can be creative in a new way. Whether this is art or not (of course it is) is beside the point. It's progress, evolution -- a way for users to make perfectly specified feature requests.</p>

      <h1>The AI Security Shakedown</h1>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>Matthias Ott <a href="https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/115854306864049265">shared a link</a> to a post from Anthropic titled <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage">“Disrupting the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign”</a>, which I read because <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/ai-browsers-frontier-security/">I’m interested</a> in the messy intersection of AI and security.</p>
<p>I gotta say: I don’t know if I’ve ever read anything quite like this article.</p>
<p>At first, the article felt like a responsible disclosure — “Hey, we’re reaching an inflection point where AI models are being used effectively for security exploits. Look at this one.”</p>
<p>But then I read further and found statements like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In the attack] Claude didn’t always work perfectly. It occasionally hallucinated […] This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, so is that a feature or a bug? Is it a good thing that your tool hallucinated and proved a stumbling block? Or is this bug you hope to fix?</p>
<p>The more I read, the more difficult it became to discern whether this security incident was a helpful warning or a feature sell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the correct setup, threat actors can now use agentic AI systems for extended periods to do the work of entire teams of experienced hackers: analyzing target systems, producing exploit code, and scanning vast datasets of stolen information more efficiently than any human operator. Less experienced and resourced groups can now potentially perform large-scale attacks of this nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shoot, this sounds like a product pitch! Don’t have the experience or resources to keep up with your competitors who are cyberattacking? We’ve got a tool for you!</p>
<p>Wait, so if you’re creating something that can cause so much havoc, why are you still making it? Oh good, they address this exact question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This raises an important question: if AI models can be misused for cyberattacks at this scale, why continue to develop and release them? The answer is that the very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so the article <em>is</em> a product pitch:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve reached a tipping point in security.</li>
<li>Look at this recent case where our AI was exploited to do malicious things with little human intervention.</li>
<li>No doubt this same thing will happen again.</li>
<li>You better go get our AI to protect yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that’s my words. Here’s theirs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fundamental change has occurred in cybersecurity. We advise security teams to experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like Security Operations Center automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. We also advise developers to continue to invest in safeguards across their AI platforms, to prevent adversarial misuse. The techniques described above will doubtless be used by many more attackers—which makes industry threat sharing, improved detection methods, and stronger safety controls all the more critical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears AI is simultaneously the problem <em>and</em> the solution.</p>
<p>It’s a great business to be in, if you think about it. You sell a tool for security exploits and you sell the self-same tool for protection against said exploits. Everybody wins!</p>
<p>I can’t help but read this post and think of a mafia shakedown. You know, where the mafia implies threats to get people to pay for their protection — a service they created the need for in the first place. ”Nice system you got there, would be a shame if anyone hacked into it using AI. Better get some AI to protect yourself.”</p>
<p>I find it funny that the URL slug for the article is:</p>
<p><code>/disrupting-AI-espionage</code></p>
<p>That’s a missed opportunity. They could’ve named it:</p>
<p><code>/causing-and-disrupting-AI-espionage</code></p>

It's one of those things that's widely forgotten, but still widely in use.

That could be a new feature in WordPress, or the decision whether or not to display it could be up to the reader app (in this case Bluesky). If it were up to the reader we might need a way to signal that to the reader from the CMS. In the new WordLand, we use the image as an icon. It's completely wrong to use it as an OG Metadata image in Bluesky -- realllly embarrassing (<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/07/bigAppleUgh.png">screen shot</a>).</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Writing vs AI (07 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Writing vs AI: If you wouldn't ask an AI to eat a delicious pizza for you, why would you ask it to write a college essay? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: WELL State of the World; A poem in 30m logfiles; Weapons of Math Destruction; The cost of keeping &quot;13&quot; a British secret; Congress v. &quot;Little Green Men&quot;; &quot;Food and Climate Change Without the Hot Air&quot; Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Writing vs AI (permalink) I come from a family of teachers – both parents taught all their lives and now oversee Ed.D candidates, brother owns a school – which has left me painfully aware of the fact that I am not a great teacher. I am, however, a good teacher. The difference is that a good teacher can teach students who want to learn, whereas a great teacher can inspire students to want to learn. I've spent most of my life teaching, here and there, and while I'm not great, I am getting better. Last year, I started a new teaching gig: I'm one of Cornell's AD White Visiting Professors, meaning that I visit Cornell (and its NYC campus, Cornell Tech) every year or two for six years and teach, lecture, meet, and run activities. When I was in Ithaca in September for my inaugural stint, I had a string of what can only be called &quot;peak experiences,&quot; meeting with researchers, teachers, undergrads, grads and community members. I had so many conversations that will stick with me, and today I want to talk about one of them. It was a faculty discussion, and one of the people at the table had been involved in a research project to investigate students' attitudes to their education. The research concluded that students come to Cornell to learn – because they love knowledge and critical thinking – but they are so haunted by the financial consequences of failure (wasting tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars repeating a year or failing out altogether, and then entering the job market debt-burdened and degree-less) that they feel pressured not to take intellectual risks, and, at worst, to cheat. They care about learning, but they're afraid of bad grades, and so chasing grades triumphs over learning. At that same discussion, I met someone who taught Cornell's version of freshman comp, the &quot;here's how to write at a college level&quot; course that every university offers. I've actually guest-taught some of these, starting in 2005/6, when I had a Fulbright Chair at USC. Now, while I'm not a great teacher, I am a pretty good writing teacher. I was lucky enough to be mentored by Judith Merril (starting at the age of 9!), who taught me how to participate in a peer-based writing workshop: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/13/better-to-have-loved/#neofuturians">https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/13/better-to-have-loved/#neofuturians</a> In high school, I met Harriet Wolff, a gifted writing teacher, whose writing workshop (which Judith Merril had actually founded, decades earlier) was so good that I spent seven years in my four-year high-school, mostly just to keep going to Harriet's workshop: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/30/merely-clever/#rip-harriet-wolff">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/30/merely-clever/#rip-harriet-wolff</a> I graduated from the Clarion science fiction and fantasy workshop (where Judith Merril learned to workshop) in 1992, and then went on to teach Clarion and Clarion West on several occasions, as well as other workshops in the field, such as Viable Paradise (today, I volunteer for Clarion's board). I have taught and been taught, and I've learned a thing or two. Here's the thing about every successful writing workshop I've been in: they don't necessarily make writing enjoyable (indeed, they can be painful), but they make it profoundly satisfying. When you repeatedly sit down with the same writers, week after week, to think about what went wrong with their work, and how they can fix it, and to hear the same about your work, something changes in how you relate to your work. You come to understand how to transform big, inchoate ideas into structured narratives and arguments, sure – but you also learn to recognize when the structure that emerges teaches you something about those big, inchoate ideas that was there all along, but not visible to you. It's revelatory. It teaches you what you know. It lets you know what you know. It lets you know more than you know. It's alchemical. It creates new knowledge, and dispels superstition. It sharpens how you think. It sharpens how you talk. And obviously, it sharpens how you write. The freshmen comp students I've taught over the years were amazed (or, more honestly, incredulous) when I told them this, because for them, writing was a totally pointless exercise. Well, almost totally pointless. Writing had one point: to get a passing grade so that the student could advance to other subjects. I'm not surprised by this, nor do I think it's merely because some of us are born to write and others will never get the knack (I've taught too many writers to think that anyone can guess who will find meaning in writing). It's because we don't generally teach writing this way until the most senior levels – the last year or two of undergrad, or, more likely, grad school (and then only if that grad program is an MFA). Writing instruction at lower levels, particularly in US high schools, is organized around standardized assessment. Students are trained to turn out the world's worst literary form: the five-paragraph essay: <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3749">https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3749</a> The five-paragraph essay is so rigid that any attempt to enliven it is actually punished during the grading process. One cannot deviate from the structure, on penalty of academic censure. It's got all the structural constraints of a sonnet, and all the poetry of a car crusher. The five-paragraph essay is so terrible that a large part of the job of a freshman comp teacher is to teach students to stop writing them. But even after this is done, much of the freshman comp curriculum is also formulaic (albeit with additional flexibility). That's unavoidable: freshman comp classes are typically massive, since so many of the incoming students have to take it. When you're assessing 100-2,000 students, you necessarily fall back on a formula. Which brings me back to that faculty discussion at Cornell, where we learned first that students want to learn, but are afraid of failure; and then heard from the freshman comp teacher, who told us that virtually all of their students cheated on their assignments, getting chatbots to shit out their papers. And that's what I've been thinking about since September. Because of course those students cheat on their writing assignments – they are being taught to hit mechanical marks with their writing, improving their sentence structure, spelling and punctuation. What they're not learning is how to use writing to order and hone their thoughts, or to improve their ability to express those thoughts. They're being asked to write like a chatbot – why wouldn't they use a chatbot? You can't teach students to write – not merely to create formally correct sentences, but to write – through formal, easily graded assignments. Teaching writing is a relational practice. It requires that students interact extensively with one another's work, and with one another's criticism. It requires structure, sure – but the structure is in how you proceed through the critiques and subsequent discussion – not in the work itself. This is the kind of thing you do in small seminars, not big lecture halls. It requires that each student produce a steady stream of work for critique – multiple pieces per term or semester – and that each student closely read and discuss every other student's every composition. It's an intense experience that pushes students to think critically about critical thought itself. It's hard work that requires close supervision and it only works in small groups. Now, common sense will tell you that this is an impractical way to run a freshman comp class that thousands of students have to take. Not every school can be Yale, whose Daily Themes writing course is the most expensive program to deliver with one instructor for every two students: <a href="https://admissions.yale.edu/bulldogs-blogs/logan/2020/03/01/daily-themes">https://admissions.yale.edu/bulldogs-blogs/logan/2020/03/01/daily-themes</a> But think back to the two statements that started me down this line of thinking: 1) Most students want to learn, but are afraid of the financial ruin that academic failure will entail and so they play things very safe; and 2) Virtually all freshman comp students use AI to cheat on their assignments. By the time we put our students in writing programs that you can't cheat on, and where you wouldn't want to cheat, they've had years of being taught to write like an LLM, but with the insistence that they not use an LLM. No wonder they're cheating! If you wanted to train a graduating class to cheat rather than learn, this is how you'd do it. Teaching freshman comp as a grammar/sentence structure tutorial misses the point. Sure, student writing is going to be bad at first. It'll be incoherent. It'll be riddled with errors. Reading student work is, for the most part, no fun. But for students, reading other students' writing, and thinking about what's wrong with it and how to fix it is the most reliable way to improve their own work (the dirty secret of writing workshops is that other writers' analysis of your work is generally less useful to you than the critical skills you learn by trying to fix their work). The amazing thing about bad writing is that it's easy to improve. It's much easier than finding ways to improve the work of a fluid, experienced writer. A beginning writer who makes a lot of easily spotted mistakes is a beginning writer who's making a lot of easily fixed mistakes. That means that the other writers around the circle are capable of spotting those errors, even if they're just starting out themselves. It also means that the writer whose work is under discussion will be able to make huge improvements through simple changes. Beginning writers can get a lot of momentum going this way, deriving real satisfaction from constant, visible progress. Replacing freshman comp with dozens of small groups run like graduate seminars is expensive and hard to imagine. But it would create a generation of students who wouldn't use an AI to write their essays any more than they'd ask an AI to eat a delicious pizza for them. We should aspire to assign the kinds of essays that change the lives of the students who write them, and to teach students to write that kind of essay. Freshman comp was always a machine for turning out reliable sentence-makers, not an atelier that trained reliable sense-makers. But AI changes the dynamic. Today, students are asking chatbots to write their essays for the same reason that corporations are asking chatbots to do their customer service (because they don't give a shit): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/06/unmerchantable-substitute-goods/#customer-disservice">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/06/unmerchantable-substitute-goods/#customer-disservice</a> I'm not saying that small writing workshops of the sort that changed my life will work for everyone. But I am saying that teaching writing in huge lecture halls with assignments optimized for grading works for no one.

<p>This IP address doesn’t seem to be banned after all!</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client banned 187.23.18.103

</code></pre>
<p>Nor is the range banned:</p>
<pre><code>asn-find '187.23.18.103'

</code></pre>
<p>What is going on? It’s definitely not banned:</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq | grep 187.23.0.0/19

</code></pre>
<p>No results. And that seems to be the problem. <code>asn-networks</code> doesn’t list <code>187.23.0.0/19</code> as belonging to ASN 28573 even though looking up <code>187.23.18.103</code> says it belongs to ASN 28573!</p>
<pre><code>asn-networks 28573 | grep  '^187\.23\.'

</code></pre>
<p>No results. So let’s check whether this range is subsumed in some other range.</p>
<pre><code>asn-networks 28573 | grep  '^187\.2'
187.2.0.0/15
187.20.0.0/14
187.255.0.0/16

</code></pre>
<p>Indeed!</p>
<pre><code>cidr-to-ip-range 187.20.0.0/14
187.20.0.0 - 187.23.255.255

</code></pre>
<p>So this IP range covers the IP number we’re interested in.</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client banned 187.20.0.0/14

</code></pre>
<p>OK! I’m happy to see this.
So now the question is, why are requests from <code>187.23.18.103</code> not dropped?</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I guess this is key: “Error: You must add ‘flags interval’ to your set declaration if you want to add prefix elements”.</p>
<p>I didn’t know <code>fail2ban</code> was using <code>nft</code>. I must take a look at <code>/etc/fail2ban/action.d/nftables-multiport.conf</code>, I guess.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking at <a href="https://itsfoss.gitlab.io/blog/fail2ban-with-iptables-persistent/">Securing Your Server: Integrating Fail2ban with IPTables-Persistent for Enhanced Protection</a> and it makes me think I might use ipsets instead.
I’m hoping that won’t be too hard since I already use <code>ipset</code> for my allowlists and my permanent banlists.
See <a href="2025-07-11-allow-list">2025-07-11 A separate allow-list to bypass fail2ban</a>.</p>
<p>When I do the switch, I must remember to flush the lists that <code>fail2ban</code> is currently using. If there are entries on the old list, they would stay there forever if the commands to add and remove entries got changed.</p>
<p>I also learned that Debian installs tools that look like <code>iptables</code> but they’re actually a compatibility layer that use <code>nft</code> instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The iptables Debian package install both and gives the nft version more priority by default in the update-alternatives system. This means that if you install this package, you will be using the nft tools instead of the legacy ones.” – <code>/usr/share/doc/iptables/README.Debian</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>🤯</p>
<p>This is why <code>fail2ban</code> uses <code>iptables</code> but the error messages mention <code>nft</code>.</p>
<p>So here is what I ended up doing.</p>
<p>I switched from <code>iptables</code> to <code>nft</code> by creating a new file <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[DEFAULT]
banaction = nftables[type=multiport]
banaction_allports = nftables[type=allports]

</code></pre>
<p>I created a local override for the nftables action so that <code>flags interval</code> gets added to the sets, and to add my allow-lists.
Here’s <code>/etc/fail2ban/action.d/nftables.local</code>.</p>
<pre><code># -*- mode: Conf -*-
[Definition]
# add &quot;flags interval;&quot;
# add special allowlists
_nft_add_set = &lt;nftables&gt; add set &lt;table_family&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;addr_set&gt; \{ type &lt;addr_type&gt;\; flags interval\; \}
              &lt;_nft_for_proto-&lt;type&gt;-iter&gt;
              &lt;nftables&gt; add rule &lt;table_family&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;chain&gt; %(rule_stat)s
              &lt;_nft_for_proto-&lt;type&gt;-done&gt;
	     /etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist
	     /etc/butlerian-jihad/remove-extra-allowlist-rules

</code></pre>
<p>To confirm, you can list all tables and then list the <code>f2b-table</code>. It contains all the sets, one for each jail of yours. The important part is that it says <code>flags interval</code> in there.</p>
<pre><code>nft list sets inet f2b-table

</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you check the <code>fail2ban</code> log, you’ll still find errors such as “interval overlaps with an existing one”. That’s OK, though. No double-banning, I guess. 😅</p>
<p>But wait, what about <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist</code>? This is where I add my manual allow-list. Like <code>wilderland.ovh</code>, the other IRC server in our little network:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

# define the sets
add set inet f2b-table allowlist   { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table allowlist6  { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table gotosocial  { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table gotosocial6 { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; }

# insert rules at the beginning
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip  saddr @allowlist   accept
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip6 saddr @allowlist6  accept

insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain ct state established,related accept comment &quot;accept responses to outgoing traffic&quot;

add element inet f2b-table allowlist {
  51.83.186.78 comment &quot;kyonshi and wilderland.ovh&quot;,
  # and a few more
}

add element inet f2b-table allowlist6 {
   2001:41d0:601:1100::12d comment &quot;kyonshi and wilderland.ovh&quot;,
  # and a few more
}

include &quot;/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>Notice the rule <code>ct state established,related accept</code>.
That’s so I can still make requests for websites on hosts that are bannned.</p>
<p>And what about that <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft</code> file?
That’s generated every now and then from the local database so that all the IP numbers of instances where I follow someone or where someone follows me are on the allow list.
I generate it using a script called <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare</code>
This script is a <code>bash</code> script instead of a <code>fish</code> script because <code>fish</code> requires a directory where it writes its history.
I found out when I had a gazillion protections in place.
But then I could not get the script to access the database so I removed all the protections.
And now I feel silly because the script is still written in <code>bash</code> but I prefer <code>fish</code>.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>And now for the <code>systemd</code> integration.</p>
<p>The unit file is <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.service</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]

</code></pre>
<p>Enable it:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl enable /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.service

</code></pre>
<p>It complains that there is no way to run it since the timer is missing but we’re not ready, yet.</p>
<p>The command here saves a copy in <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft</code>.
This copy is important because it’s the script called when <code>fail2ban</code> starts up and calls <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist</code> which includes it.
The service also pipes the output straight to <code>nft</code> to execute it.</p>
<p>Test it:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl start gotosocial-prepare-service

</code></pre>
<p>Assuming it works … we need a monthly timer, now.</p>
<p>The timer file is <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.timer</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Update the allow-list for gotosocial

[Timer]
OnCalendar=1month
RandomizedDelaySec=600

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

</code></pre>
<p>Enable and start it:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl enable --now ./gotosocial-prepare.timer

</code></pre>
<p>Check it:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl status gotosocial-prepare.timer

</code></pre>
<p>And now the allow-list should refresh every month. 😍</p>
<p>A note on why the allow lists cannot be in a separate table.
The key is this little info in the documentation, as I had to find out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a packet is accepted and there is another chain, bearing the same hook type and with a later priority, then the packet will subsequently traverse this other chain. Hence, an accept verdict – be it by way of a rule or the default chain policy – isn’t necessarily final.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if the allow-list is in an earlier chain and is accepted, the later <code>fail2ban</code> chain can still drop the packets. Conversely, if the <code>fail2ban</code> chain comes first, the packets dropped are no longer available in later chains so the decision cannot be reversed.
The sets with the addresses have to be in the <code>f2b-table</code> and the rules using them have to be in the <code>f2b-chain</code>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering: Why is nobody else running into all this? The answer, I think, is that I started out banning whole ASNs, that is, all their IP address ranges. So now <code>fail2ban</code> manages address ranges instead of individual addresses and I can no longer use <code>fail2ban</code>’s <code>ignoreip</code> command which is probably what everybody else is using. But I want to ban the address ranges and allow individual addresses within those ranges.</p>
<p>Note that multiple restarts keep adding rules the the chain.
Therefore, another script runs after <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist</code>.
It removes the duplicates, if any.</p>
<p>Here’s <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/remove-extra-allowlist-rules</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bash
for set in allowlist allowlist6 gotosocial gotosocial6; do
    nft -a list chain inet f2b-table f2b-chain \
	| awk '/'$set' accept/ { print &quot;delete rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain handle &quot; $NF }' \
	| head -n -1 \
	| nft -i
done

nft -a list chain inet f2b-table f2b-chain \
    | awk '/ct state established,related/ { print &quot;delete rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain handle &quot; $NF }' \

<p>Ever since Linux got a graphical desktop, you could middle-click to paste – but if GNOME gets its way, that's going away soon, and from Firefox too.</p>

      <p>Adam Mosseri, Instagram’s chief doesn’t often respond to critics. When I wrote that his year-end memo cast Instagram as a future referee of reality, he pushed back on Threads. He called it an overstatement and then laid out the need for “credibility signals,” tools to prove content authenticity, and industry-wide verification. That isn’t a rebuttal; it’s reframing. Instagram may not want the label “arbiter of reality,” but it seems content to take on the role. In an earlier essay, …</p>

      <p>Problem with ChatGPT is that it thinks you always want to know everything about all the options, no matter how convoluted they are, based on incorrect assumptions about what you're doing. You ask a simple question with a simple answer and they write you a four page briefing on everything. At least they do seem to give you the correct answer up front. They ought to work on making these things manageable, and btw for these reasons I believe they must write the most shitty code when they're left to write the whole thing. If they have a different better mode, please let me talk to that one! :-)</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.luiscardoso.dev/blog/sandboxes-for-ai">A field guide to sandboxes for AI</a></strong></p>
<p>This guide to the current sandboxing landscape by Luis Cardoso is comprehensive, dense and absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>He starts by differentiating between containers (which share the host kernel), microVMs (their own guest kernel behind hardwae virtualization), gVisor userspace kernels and WebAssembly/isolates that constrain everything within a runtime.</p>
<p>The piece then dives deep into terminology, approaches and the landscape of existing tools.</p>
<p>I think using the right sandboxes to safely run untrusted code is one of the most important problems to solve in 2026. This guide is an invaluable starting point.</p>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <h1>2026-01-06 Responsibility</h1>
<p>For all the US citizens who are angry and disappointed about how they world is treating them only because they happen to be citizens of a country ruled by wanna-be dictators, all I have to offer is my impression of how the world treated Germans for decades after the second World War. The Germans would say: “I didn’t know!” Or: “What was I going to do?” Or: “I desperately needed to keep my job.” Or: “I didn’t do it!” And people elsewhere hated them all the same. Yes, it was probably unfair to some. But what has haunted me ever since is this: How much resistance is required for you to be cleared of the stain of collective guilt? Not on the individual level, but on the collective level. Yes, some of my ancestors were Nazis, most likely. Or cowards. Or beneficiaries. It’s the small fragments and rumours that remain. A great grandfather got wounded in Italy and deserted, walked all the way back to Lübeck and got nursed back to health in the cellar of his Grand Hotel. The neighbours felt that the Nazi got what he deserved. One grandfather apparently cheered the Anschluss on the Heldenplatz in Vienna. Does cheering for the wrong party make you as guilty as the concentration camp guard? No. Are all descendants absolved of their ancestor’s sins? Also no. The responsibility remains. To keep the memory alive. To hear the accusations and to acknowledge what happened. To right the wrongs. To give back what was taken. Some have always been part of the resistance. Some might be waking up to it just now. Some might say, like in that meme, with a smirk, “first time around?” Some will never understand and they need to be outvoted or outgunned. Collective responsibility is hard because most of us were taught that the children must not suffer for the sins of their ancestors. But at the same time, we live in a society, benefit from it, suffer from it, and share responsibility for it. Even if we don’t like it.</p>
<p>(For future readers some historical context: The Trump administration has kidnapped Maduro from Venezuela much like the Bush administration kidnapped Noriega from Panama and now the Trump administration is once again threatening to take Greenland from Denmark.)</p>
<p>When we visited Amsterdam many years ago, I think the museum that I remember best is the <a href="https://www.verzetsmuseum.org/en/world-war-ii-in-the-netherlands">Resistance museum</a>. “The Dutch Resistance Museum tells the story of people in times of war. These people aren’t heroes and villains, but ordinary people forced to make choices in the face of scarcity and oppression.” It showed that when your country is taken over by dictators, there’s a big spectrum of responses possible.</p>
<p>And just now I discovered that last year the list of suspected Nazi collaborators in the Netherlands got released: <a href="https://text.npr.org/2025/01/07/nx-s1-5249956/nazi-collaborators-netherlands-archive">A list of half a million names shines new light on Dutch collaboration with Nazis</a>. A law had kept access restricted for eighty years. About 425,000 individuals were suspected of collaborating with Nazi Germany. Wikipedia says there were <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data:Netherlands_Total_Population.tab">9.2 million inhabitants</a> at the time, so nearly 5% of the population.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m hoping for all of us: When the time comes, don’t be a fucking collaborator.</p>

Some posts are a lot of work, and take more than a week. Major talks, such as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/09/the-gaslit-asset-class.html"><em>The Gaslit Asset Class</em></a> or <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/04/paul-evan-peters-award-lecture.html"><em>Lessons from LOCKSS</em></a> typically represent a month's work, as do long posts such as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/sabotaging-bitcoin.html"><em>Sabotaging Biitcoin</em></a>, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/12/drones.html"><em>Drones</em></a> or <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/05/the-dawn-of-nvidias-technology.html"><em>The Dawn Of Nvidia's Technology</em></a>.</p>
<p>The 1000 posts have gained over 6.88M page views, 7.6% of which were for my <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/ee380-talk.html"><em>EE380 Talk</em></a>. Less publicized but popular posts get around 30K page views, well above the 6.9K average.</p>
<p>The only one of these statistics that I care about is the goal of a post a week. Having an audience is nice when it happens, but that's not why I'm writing. I write for myself, to understand not necessarily to communicate. Despite this, I'd like to thank those who read and comment.</p>

What finally made my decision easy was his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zzK5K1ig-Y">last episode of the year</a>, where along with fellow Atlantic staff writer, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/charlie-warzel/">Charlie Warzel</a>, they considered how podcasting works, and what if anything they should do to conform. The answer is -- <em>don't conform.</em> It isn't up to any single contributor to turn the tide, instead their only job is to be true to themselves, and learn from others and share what they've learned. Be a <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html">human-size</a> blogger. I thought perhaps this represented my opportunity to speak to them, and help understand that there are tech people who want to work with them and enhance their freedom, rather than consume it. But we need <em>their</em> help to do it. They've settled on Substack, without realizing they're just hooking up with the same people who screwed them before (ie Twitter, then all the techies who have dinner with Trump). As <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/einstein-insanity-quote/">they</a> say -- doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome is not particularly smart, and Frum <em>is</em> smart. I don't care if he roots for the Red Sox (I'm a Mets fan), right now we're on the same side. We love the United States, and what it has done for us, and for the world, and we are falling apart.

      <h1>Pluralistic: Code is a liability (not an asset) (06 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Code is a liability (not an asset): AI psychosis, tech boss edition. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Coldplay CD DRM; Star Wars Wars; Digital manorialism vs neofeudalism; Transvaginal foetal sonic bombardment: woo-tunes for your hoo-hah. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Code is a liability (not an asset) (permalink) Code is a liability (not an asset). Tech bosses don't understand this. They think AI is great because it produces 10,000 times more code than a programmer, but that just means it's producing 10,000 times more liabilities. AI is the asbestos we're shoveling into the walls of our high-tech society: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence</a> Code is a liability. Code's capabilities are assets. The goal of a tech shop is to have code whose capabilities generate more revenue than the costs associated with keeping that code running. For a long time, firms have nurtured a false belief that code costs less to run over time: after an initial shakedown period in which the bugs in the code are found and addressed, code ceases to need meaningful maintenance. After all, code is a machine without moving parts – it does not wear out; it doesn't even wear down. This is the thesis of Paul Mason's 2015 book Postcapitalism, a book that has aged remarkably poorly (though not, perhaps, as poorly as Mason's own political credibility): code is not an infinitely reproducible machine that requires no labor inputs to operate. Rather, it is a brittle machine that requires increasingly heroic measures to keep it in good working order, and which eventually does &quot;wear out&quot; (in the sense of needing a top-to-bottom refactoring). To understand why code is a liability, you have to understand the difference between &quot;writing code&quot; and &quot;software engineering.&quot; &quot;Writing code&quot; is an incredibly useful, fun, and engrossing pastime. It involves breaking down complex tasks into discrete steps that are so precisely described that a computer can reliably perform them, and optimising that performance by finding clever ways of minimizing the demands the code puts on the computer's resources, such as RAM and processor cycles. Meanwhile, &quot;software engineering&quot; is a discipline that subsumes &quot;writing code,&quot; but with a focus on the long-term operations of the system the code is part of. Software engineering concerns itself with the upstream processes that generate the data the system receives. It concerns itself with the downstream processes that the system emits processed information to. It concerns itself with the adjacent systems that are receiving data from the same upstream processes and/or emitting data to the same downstream processes the system is emitting to. &quot;Writing code&quot; is about making code that runs well. &quot;Software engineering&quot; is about making code that fails well. It's about making code that is legible – whose functions can be understood by third parties who might be asked to maintain it, or might be asked to adapt the processes downstream, upstream or adjacent to the system to keep the system from breaking. It's about making code that can be adapted, for example, when the underlying computer architecture it runs on is retired and has to be replaced, either with a new kind of computer, or with an emulated version of the old computer: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/hpux">https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/hpux</a>_end_of_life/ Because that's the thing: any nontrivial code has to interact with the outside world, and the outside world isn't static, it's dynamic. The outside world busts through the assumptions made by software authors all the time and every time it does, the software needs to be fixed. Remember Y2K? That was a day when perfectly functional code, running on perfectly functional hardware, would stop functioning – not because the code changed, but because time marched on. We're 12 years away from the Y2038 problem, when 32-bit flavors of Unix will all cease to work, because they, too, will have run out of computable seconds. These computers haven't changed, their software hasn't changed, but the world – by dint of ticking over, a second at a time, for 68 years – will wear through their seams, and they will rupture: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/23/the">https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/23/the</a>_unix_epochalypse_might_be/ The existence of &quot;the world&quot; is an inescapable factor that wears out software and requires it to be rebuilt, often at enormous expense. The longer code is in operation, the more likely it is that it will encounter &quot;the world.&quot; Take the code that devices use to report on their physical location. Originally, this was used for things like billing – determining which carrier or provider's network you were using and whether you were roaming. Then, our mobile devices used this code to help determine your location in order to give you turn-by-turn directions in navigation apps. Then, this code was repurposed again to help us find our lost devices. This, in turn, became a way to locate stolen devices, a use-case that sharply diverges from finding lost devices in important ways – for example, when locating a lost device, you don't have to contend with the possibility that a malicious actor has disabled the &quot;find my lost device&quot; facility. These additional use cases – upstream, downstream and adjacent – exposed bugs in the original code that never surfaced in the earlier applications. For example, all location services must have some kind of default behavior in the (very common) event that they're not really sure where they are. Maybe they have a general fix – for example, they know which cellular mast they're connected to, or they know where they were the last time they got an accurate location fix – or maybe they're totally lost. It turns out that in many cases, location apps drew a circle around all the places they could be and then set their location to the middle of that circle. That's fine if the circle is only a few feet in diameter, or if the app quickly replaces this approximation with a more precise location. But what if the location is miles and miles across, and the location fix never improves? What if the location for any IP address without a defined location is given as the center of the continental USA and any app that doesn't know where it is reports that it is in a house in Kansas, sending dozens of furious (occasionally armed) strangers to that house, insisting that the owners are in possession of their stolen phones and tablets? <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/624040/how-internet-mapping-glitch-turned-kansas-farm-into-digital-hell">https://theweek.com/articles/624040/how-internet-mapping-glitch-turned-kansas-farm-into-digital-hell</a> You don't just have to fix this bug once – you have to fix it over and over again. In Georgia: <a href="https://www.jezebel.com/why-lost-phones-keep-pointing-at-this-atlanta-couples-h-1793854491">https://www.jezebel.com/why-lost-phones-keep-pointing-at-this-atlanta-couples-h-1793854491</a> In Texas: <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/find-my-iphone-apple-error-strangers-at-texas-familys-home-scott-schuster/13096627/">https://abc7chicago.com/post/find-my-iphone-apple-error-strangers-at-texas-familys-home-scott-schuster/13096627/</a> And in my town of Burbank, where Google's location-sharing service once told us that our then-11-year-old daughter (whose phone we couldn't reach) was 12 miles away, on a freeway ramp in an unincorporated area of LA county (she was at a nearby park, but out of range, and the app estimated her location as the center of the region it had last fixed her in) (it was a rough couple hours). The underlying code – the code that uses some once-harmless default to fudge unknown locations – needs to be updated constantly, because the upstream, downstream and adjacent processes connected to it are changing constantly. The longer that code sits there, the more superannuated its original behaviors become, and the more baroque, crufty and obfuscated the patches layered atop of it become. Code is not an asset – it's a liability. The longer a computer system has been running, the more tech debt it represents. The more important the system is, the harder it is to bring down and completely redo. Instead, new layers of code are slathered atop of it, and wherever the layers of code meet, there are fissures in which these systems behave in ways that don't exactly match up. Worse still: when two companies are merged, their seamed, fissured IT systems are smashed together, so that now there are adjacent sources of tech debt, as well as upstream and downstream cracks: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/28/dealer-management-software/#antonin-scalia-stole-your-car">https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/28/dealer-management-software/#antonin-scalia-stole-your-car</a> That's why giant companies are so susceptible to ransomware attacks – they're full of incompatible systems that have been coaxed into a facsimile of compatibility with various forms of digital silly putty, string and baling wire. They are not watertight and they cannot be made watertight. Even if they're not taken down by hackers, they sometimes just fall over and can't be stood back up again – like when Southwest Airlines' computers crashed for all of Christmas week 2022, stranding millions of travelers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/16/for-petes-sake/#unfair-and-deceptive">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/16/for-petes-sake/#unfair-and-deceptive</a> Airlines are especially bad, because they computerized early, and can't ever shut down the old computers to replace them with new ones. This is why their apps are such dogshit – and why it's so awful that they've fired their customer service personnel and require fliers to use the apps for everything, even though the apps do. not. work. These apps won't ever work. The reason that British Airways' app displays &quot;An unknown error has occurred&quot; 40-80% of the time isn't (just) that they fired all their IT staff and outsourced to low bidders overseas. It's that, sure – but also that BA's first computers ran on electromechanical valves, and everything since has to be backwards-compatible with a system that one of Alan Turing's proteges gnawed out of a whole log with his very own front teeth. Code is a liability, not an asset (BA's new app is years behind schedule). Code is a liability. The servers for the Bloomberg terminals that turned Michael Bloomberg into a billionaire run on RISC chips, meaning that the company is locked into using a dwindling number of specialist hardware and data-center vendors, paying specialized programmers, and building brittle chains of code to connect these RISC systems to their less exotic equivalents in the world. Code isn't an asset. AI can write code, but AI can't do software engineering. Software engineering is all about thinking through context – what will come before this system? What will come after it? What will sit alongside of it? How will the world change? Software engineering requires a very wide &quot;context window,&quot; the thing that AI does not, and cannot have. AI has a very narrow and shallow context window, and linear expansions to AI's context window requires geometric expansions in the amount of computational resources the AI consumes: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda</a> Writing code that works, without consideration of how it will fail, is a recipe for catastrophe. It is a way to create tech debt at scale. It is shoveling asbestos into the walls of our technological society. Bosses do not know that code is a liability, not an asset. That's why they won't shut the fuck up about the chatbots that shit out 10,000 times more code than any human programmer. They think they've found a machine that produces assets at 10,000 times the rate of a human programmer. They haven't. They've found a machine that produces liability at 10,000 times the rate of any human programmer. Maintainability isn't just a matter of hard-won experience teaching you where the pitfalls are. It also requires the cultivation of &quot;Fingerspitzengefühl&quot; – the &quot;fingertip feeling&quot; that lets you make reasonable guesses about where never before seen pitfalls might emerge. It's a form of process knowledge. It is ineluctable. It is not latent in even the largest corpus of code that you could use as training data: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance</a> Boy do tech bosses not get this. Take Microsoft. Their big bet right now is on &quot;agentic AI.&quot; They think that if they install spyware on your computer that captures every keystroke, every communication, every screen you see and sends it to Microsoft's cloud and give a menagerie of chatbots access to it, that you'll be able to tell your computer, &quot;Book me a train to Cardiff and find that hotel Cory mentioned last year and book me a room there&quot; and it will do it. This is an incredibly unworkable idea. No chatbot is remotely capable of doing all these things, something that Microsoft freely stipulates. Rather than doing this with one chatbot, Microsoft proposes to break this down among dozens of chatbots, each of which Microsoft hopes to bring up to 95% reliability. That's an utterly implausible chatbot standard in and of itself, but consider this: probabilities are multiplicative. A system containing two processes that operate at 95% reliability has a net reliability of 90.25% (0.95 * 0.95). Break a task down among a couple dozen 95% accurate bots and the chance that this task will be accomplished correctly rounds to zero. Worse, Microsoft is on record as saying that they will grant the Trump administration secret access to all the data in its cloud: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/</a> So – as Signal's Meredith Whittaker and Udbhav Tiwari put it in their incredible 39C3 talk last week in Hamburg – Microsoft is about to abolish the very idea of privacy for any data on personal and corporate computers, in order to ship AI agents that cannot ever work: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4</a> Meanwhile, a Microsoft exec got into trouble last December when he posted to Linkedin announcing his intention to have AI rewrite all of Microsoft's code. Refactoring Microsoft's codebase makes lots of sense. Microsoft – like British Airways and other legacy firms – has lots of very old code that represents unsustainable tech debt. But using AI to rewrite that code is a way to start with tech debt that will only accumulate as time goes by: <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/12/24/microsoft-denies-rewriting-windows-11-using-ai-after-an-employees-one-engineer-one-month-one-million-code-post-on-linkedin-causes-outrage/">https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/12/24/microsoft-denies-rewriting-windows-11-using-ai-after-an-employees-one-engineer-one-month-one-million-code-post-on-linkedin-causes-outrage/</a> Now, some of you reading this have heard software engineers extolling the incredible value of using a chatbot to write code for them. Some of you are software engineers who have found chatbots incredibly useful in writing code for you. This is a common AI paradox: why do some people who use AI find it really helpful, while others loathe it? Is it that the people who don't like AI are &quot;bad at AI?&quot; Is it that the AI fans are lazy and don't care about the quality of their work? There's doubtless some of both going on, but even if you teach everyone to be an AI expert, and cull everyone who doesn't take pride in their work out of the sample, the paradox will still remain. The true solution to the AI paradox lies in automation theory, and the concept of &quot;centaurs&quot; and &quot;reverse centaurs&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/11/vulgar-thatcherism/#there-is-an-alternative">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/11/vulgar-thatcherism/#there-is-an-alternative</a> In automation theory, a &quot;centaur&quot; is a person who is assisted by a machine. A &quot;reverse centaur&quot; is someone who has been conscripted into assisting a machine. If you're a software engineer who uses AI to write routine code that you have the time and experience to validate, deploying your Fingerspitzengefühl and process knowledge to ensure that it's fit for purpose, it's easy to see why you might find using AI (when you choose to, in ways you choose to, at a pace you choose to go at) to be useful. But if you're a software engineer who's been ordered to produce code at 10x, or 100x, or 10,000x your previous rate, and the only way to do that is via AI, and there is no human way that you could possibly review that code and ensure that it will not break on first contact with the world, you'll hate it (you'll hate it even more if you've been turned into the AI's accountability sink, personally on the hook for the AI's mistakes): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/27/rancid-vibe-coding/#class-war">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/27/rancid-vibe-coding/#class-war</a> There's another way in which software engineers find AI-generated code to be incredibly helpful: when that code is isolated. If you're doing a single project – say, converting one batch of files to another format, just once – you don't have to worry about downstream, upstream or adjacent processes. There aren't any. You're writing code to do something once, without interacting with any other systems. A lot of coding is this kind of utility project. It's tedious, thankless, and ripe for automation. Lots of personal projects fall into this bucket, and of course, by definition, a personal project is a centaur project. No one forces you to use AI in a personal project – it's always your choice how and when you make personal use of any tool. But the fact that software engineers can sometimes make their work better with AI doesn't invalidate the fact that code is a liability, not an asset, and that AI code represents liability production at scale. In the story of technological unemployment, there's the idea that new technology creates new jobs even as it makes old ones obsolete: for every blacksmith put out of work by the automobile, there's a job waiting as a mechanic. In the years since the AI bubble began inflating, we've heard lots of versions of this: AI would create jobs for &quot;prompt engineers&quot; – or even create jobs that we can't imagine, because they won't exist until AI has changed the world beyond recognition. I wouldn't bank on getting work in a fanciful trade that literally can't be imagined because our consciousnesses haven't been so altered by AI that they've acquired the capacity to conceptualize of these new modes of work. But if you are looking for a job that AI will definitely create, by the millions, I have a suggestion: digital asbestos removal. For if AI code – written at 10,000 times the speed of any human coder, designed to work well, but not to fail gracefully – is the digital asbestos we're filling our walls with, then our descendants will spend generations digging that asbestos out of the walls. There will be plenty of work fixing the things that we broke thanks to the most dangerous AI psychosis of all – the hallucinatory belief that &quot;writing code&quot; is the same thing as &quot;software engineering.&quot; At the rate we're going, we'll have full employment for generations of asbestos removers.

What we've written, however, is all pretty trivial. Now, while teaching how to properly work with a truly large codebase is something that would take a book to teach in itself, we can certainly build something a bit more complex than the toy problems we've worked with so far. The question is: what?</p>

<li>16GB of RAM</li>
<li>512GB NVMe SSD</li>
<li>Including case, cooler, and power adapter</li>

<p>Back in March last year, a GMKtec Mini PC was <span class="math inline">\(159, and a similar-spec Pi 5 was \)</span>208.</p>
<p>Today? The <a href="https://amzn.to/4srcKB3">same GMKtec Mini PC</a> is <span class="math inline">\(246.99, and the same Pi 5 is \)</span>246.95:</p>

      <h1>It’s hard to justify Tahoe icons</h1>

      <p><strong><a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/">It’s hard to justify Tahoe icons</a></strong></p>
<p>Devastating critique of the new menu icons in macOS Tahoe by Nikita Prokopov, who starts by quoting the 1992 Apple HIG rule to not &quot;overload the user with complex icons&quot; and then provides comprehensive evidence of Tahoe doing exactly that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, Apple took on an impossible task: to add an icon to every menu item. There are just not enough good metaphors to do something like that.</p>
<p>But even if there were, the premise itself is questionable: if everything has an icon, it doesn’t mean users will find what they are looking for faster.</p>
<p>And even if the premise was solid, I still wish I could say: they did the best they could, given the goal. But that’s not true either: they did a poor job consistently applying the metaphors and designing the icons themselves.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: A world without people (05 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links A world without people: AI is a promise to wire the boss's toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Adding exclusive rights make economies weaker; Bloggers after the collapse; Why the media can't figure out Wikipedia; Who are these sf legends?; Anne Frank is in the public domain; Hollywood's MP in Canada; Piketty on Piketty; Vanilla ISIS; India throws out Facebook's astroturf emails; Google unionizes; &quot;The Data Detective&quot;; Breaking Apple ][+ DRM. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A world without people (permalink) To be a billionaire is to be a solipsist – to secretly believe that (most) other people don't really exist – otherwise, how could you live with the knowledge that your farcical wealth and power springs from the agony you have inflicted on whole populations? <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs</a> This is what it means for Elon Musk to dismiss the people who disagree with him as &quot;NPCs&quot;; in some important sense, he doesn't think other people exist. It's a very ketamine-coded way to move through the world: <a href="https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/on-elon-musk-and-npcs">https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/on-elon-musk-and-npcs</a> Solipsism is a very difficult belief to maintain. No matter how sociopathic you are, there's always going to be a part of you that craves the approval, love and attention of others. That craving is a nagging reminder that other people do, in fact, exist. This creates the very weird insistence on the part of the ultra-rich that they are actually philanthropists. Thus, the very weird spectacle of corporate raiders – responsible for tens of thousands of job losses – describing themselves as &quot;job creators,&quot; and funding whole economic subdisciplines dedicated to shoring up this absurd claim (&quot;The search for a superior moral justification for selfishness&quot; -JK Galbraith): <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/us/koch-donors-george-mason.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/us/koch-donors-george-mason.html</a> Trying to squeeze this claim through an ever-narrowing credibility aperture forces it into some extremely weird shapes. Take &quot;Effective Altruism,&quot; the belief that you should make as much money as possible by working in the most exploitative and destructive fields you can find, in order to fund a program to improve the lives of 53 trillion hypothetical artificial people who will come into existence in 10,000 years: <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future">https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future</a> Effective Altruism, &quot;job creators&quot; (and other claims to billionaireism as a force for good in the world) show just how much work it takes to maintain the belief that other people don't exist. The ruling classes are haunted by this knowledge, and as more and more wealth accumulates in the hands of fewer and fewer people, those eminently guillotineable plutes need to perform increasingly complex mental gymnastics to keep from confronting the reality of other people. Corporate bosses have near-total control over the lives of their workers, who might number in the hundreds of thousands. But they also know, in their secret hearts, that they don't really control their businesses. If Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stops showing up for work, the company will continue to hum along, not missing a beat. But if all of Amazon's drivers or warehouse workers walk off the job, the company will grind to a halt. If they never come back, the company might never be able to restart, unable to recover the process knowledge that walks out the door with them: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance</a> Andy Jassy wants to think that he's in Amazon's driver's seat, but is haunted by the undeniable reality that Amazon is really in the hands of its lowest-paid, most abused workers. Andy Jassy isn't driving Amazon – he's stuck in the back seat, playing with a Fisher Price steering-wheel toy. Enter AI. AI can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete</a> Your boss is an easy mark for these AI swindlers, because your boss dreams of a world without workers, because that's a world where bosses are driving the bus. The Hollywood writers' strike was precipitated by studio bosses' fantasy of a world without writers – a world where studio bosses don't have to be satisfied with giving harebrained notes to writers who don't bother to disguise their contempt for their bosses' shitty ideas. In a world of AI scripts, the boss decides what kind of movie to make, and a chatbot shits out a script to order, without ever telling the boss that the idea stinks. The fact that this is an unshootable turkey of a script is of secondary importance. The most important thing is the boss's all-consuming need to avoid ego-shattering conflicts with people who actually know how to do things, who gain power thanks to that knowledge, and who use that power to imply (or state outright) that you're a fucking dunce. Same goes for the Hollywood actors' strike, and the continued project of cloning actors in software and puppeteering them via chatbot: it's the fantasy of a movie without actors, actors who tell you that the scenario you've spun is an incoherent mess, who insist that their expertise in an art you don't understand and can't perform yourself entitles them to challenge your ideas. AI is solipsism, the fantasy of a world without people. Bosses keep pushing the idea that AI can replace doctors and (especially) nurses. Health bosses – increasingly likely to be a giant private equity fund – want to cut care in order to direct more money to the hospital's shareholders. They want to stop paying exterminators and allow their hospitals to fill up with thousands of bats: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/28/5000-bats/#charnel-house">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/28/5000-bats/#charnel-house</a> They want to stop paying for clean needles at dialysis clinics and transmit blood-borne chronic illnesses to immunocompromised, sick patients: <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-dirty-business-of-clean-blood">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-dirty-business-of-clean-blood</a> They want to use algorithmic death panels to eject sick patients from their beds before they can sit up, walk or, you know, survive: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/05/any-metric-becomes-a-target/#hca">https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/05/any-metric-becomes-a-target/#hca</a> The problem is that nurses and doctors are professionals, and that means – by definition – that they follow a professional code of ethics that requires them to refuse their bosses' orders when those orders are bad for patients. The same goes for shrinks of all kinds – psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and counselors. They are legally and professionally required to put patients' mental health ahead of commercial imperatives. That's a big problem for any boss who wants to swap out in-person counseling for dial-a-doc shrink-on-demand services delivered via videoconference that serve up a new therapist every time the patient dials in, chasing the lowest wages around the country or the globe. The mania for &quot;AI therapists&quot; isn't driven by efficiency or by our societal mental health crisis – it's driven by the fantasy of mental health counseling without counselors (who insist on minimum standards for patient care): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/01/doctor-robo-blabbermouth/#fool-me-once-etc-etc">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/01/doctor-robo-blabbermouth/#fool-me-once-etc-etc</a> Capitalism is a single-criterion optimization: it organizes itself around the accumulation of capital, to the exclusion of all other criteria: <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59821b9ff14aa110e16b69c0/t/686621934eb5b7060da1cdaf/1751523732570/Aaron+Benanav%2C+Beyond+Capitalism+1%2C+NLR+153%2C+May+June+2025.pdf">https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59821b9ff14aa110e16b69c0/t/686621934eb5b7060da1cdaf/1751523732570/Aaron+Benanav%2C+Beyond+Capitalism+1%2C+NLR+153%2C+May+June+2025.pdf</a> This means that capitalism is forever locked in a conflict with professionalism, since professionalism is a system that upholds a code of conduct before all other priorities, including capital accumulation. Professional ethics are, quite simply, bad for business. That's why bosses fantasize so furiously about pushing AI into professional situations – it's the fantasy of a profession without professionals. AI schoolteachers mean &quot;education without educators,&quot; which means that there's no organized group of trained and trusted professionals telling you that chatbot slop, high-stakes testing, and standardized curriculum will fail students. This is true no matter how much money you stand to make by replacing the skilled craft process of teaching with automation. Professions are infamously resistant to automation, unlike, say, manufacturing. This means that the cost of professional services steadily increases, relative to the cost of manufactured goods. The labor, energy, materials and time it took to travel from New York to Vienna have plummeted since the 18th century – but the number of hours it takes a Viennese string quartet to perform Mozart's String Quartet No 1 is the same today as it was in 1773 – about half an hour. The cost of producing a chalkboard has crashed over the past two centuries – but the number of hours it takes a math teacher to show a classroom full of ten year olds how to do long division has hardly budged. The cost of producing a scalpel is lower today than at any time in history, but the duration of an appendectomy has only decreased a little over the past century. Economists have a name for this: they call it &quot;cost disease.&quot; The fact that automation makes professional services (proportionally) more expensive over time isn't an indictment of professionalism, it's a testament to the power of automation for manufacturing. Bosses (should) know this, but they constantly bemoan the cost of professional services, as though the numerator (teaching, healthcare, screenwriting) is going up, when it's actually a shrinking denominator (automated manufacturing processes) that's increasing the relative price. The AI fantasy is a fantasy of dismantling the professions and replacing them with pliable chatbots who can be optimized for profits and thus cure cost disease for once and for all, and if that comes at the expense of the value that society derives from professional activities, that's a small price to pay for finally clearing the most stubborn barrier to capital accumulation. Last year, Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE fired or forced out a critical mass of government scientists, even as they gutted funding to research programs at the country's universities. You'd think that this would be a barrier to making scientific breakthroughs in America, but not according to Trump. He's promised that America will produce annual &quot;moonshot&quot;-scale breakthroughs, without scientists, by asking a chatbot to shit out paradigm-shattering scientific leaps on demand: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trump-spent-2025-attacking-science-that-could-set-back-his-genesis-mission/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trump-spent-2025-attacking-science-that-could-set-back-his-genesis-mission/</a> The problem is that while AIs can shit out sentences that seem to qualify as scientific breakthroughs, they can't actually do science. Take Google's claim that its Deepmind product had advanced material science by 800 years, &quot;discovering 2.2 million structures.&quot; It turns out that these &quot;discoveries&quot; are useless – in that they constitute trivial variations on known materials, and/or have no uses, and/or can only exist at absolute zero: <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c00643">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c00643</a> But the fact that a chatbot can't do science isn't important to Trump – or at least, not as important as all the other things a chatbot won't do. A chatbot won't tell Trump not to stare at an eclipse. A chatbot won't tell Trump not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't tell Trump that trans people exist. A chatbot won't tell Trump that the climate emergency is real. A chatbot will agree with Trump when he says that offshore wind kills whales and that Tylenol causes autism. For Trump, the fantasy of science without scientists is more important than whether any science happens. America needs science, but for Trump – a billionaire solipsist – America is a country populated by people who mostly don't really exist. That's true of tech bosses, too. After all, they were the original suckers for Effective Altruism and the fantasy of a world without people. Remember when Mark Zuckerberg announced that the average person has three friends, but wants 15 friends, and that he would solve this with chatbots? <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mark-zuckerberg-on-ai-friendships">https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mark-zuckerberg-on-ai-friendships</a>_l_681a4bf3e4b0c2b15d96851d Sure, we all dunked on him for being such an unlikable fucking Martian that he doesn't understand what a &quot;friend&quot; is. But I don't think that's what's actually going on there: it's not that Zuck doesn't understand what friends are; it's that he treats your friendships as problems to be solved. Your friends' behavior determines how much money Zuck can make. When your friends arrange their interactions with you in a way that increases how much time you spend on his platforms, Zuckerberg maximizes the number of ads he gets to show you and thus how much money he can make. The fact that your friends stubbornly refuse to help him maximize his capital accumulation is a problem, and the solution to that problem is chatbots, which can be instructed to relate to you in ways that are optimized for increasing Zuck's wealth. For Zuck, chatbots are a fantasy of a social network without socializing. It's not just users that tech bosses fantasize about replacing with AI, though – they really want to get rid of coders. Computer programmers aren't (formally) a profession, but they are quite powerful, and have a cultural norm of criticizing their bosses' stupid ideas: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/10/the-proletarianization-of-tech-workers/">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/10/the-proletarianization-of-tech-workers/</a> Tech bosses are completely dependent on coders, who know how to do things they don't know how to do, and aren't shy about letting them know it. That's why tech bosses are so quick to equate &quot;writing code&quot; with &quot;software engineering&quot; (the latter being a discipline that requires consideration of upstream, downstream and adjacent processes while prioritizing legibility and maintainability by future generations of engineers). A chatbot can produce software routines that perform some well-scoped task, but one thing they can't do is maintain the wide, deep &quot;context window&quot; at the heart of software engineering – a linear increase in a chatbot's context window results in a geometric increase in the amount of computation the chatbot has to perform: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda</a> But the fact that chatbots will produce technical debt at scale is less important to tech bosses than the fact that a chatbot will do what you tell it without giving the boss any lip. For tech bosses, chatbots are the fantasy of a coding shop without any coders. This is a bad joke, literally. When I worked in a shop, we used to sarcastically say, &quot;Retail would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.&quot; We were unknowingly reprising Brecht, whose &quot;Die Lösung&quot; contains the immortal line, &quot;Would it not be simpler if the government simply dissolved the people and elected another?&quot; Billionaires don't see the humor. For them, AI is a chance to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the firm's drive-train, and make movies without writers or actors, factories without workers, hospitals without nurses, schools without teachers, science without scientists, code shops without coders, social media without socializing, and yes, even retail without the fucking customers. Billionaires love the idea of &quot;Universal Basic Income.&quot; For them, this is the apotheosis of the AI fantasy of a world without people. In this fantasy, the boss's toy steering wheel is steering the firm. Business consists of a boss and a computer that turns the boss's ideas into products. Who will consume these products? You will, thanks to UBI – the government will continue to exist in this fantasy, but for the sole purpose of creating new money and dispersing it to you, so that you can turn it over to billionaires who singlehandedly direct all of society's functions. Billionaires love UBI for the same reason they love charter schools. In the AI UBI fantasy, everyone who's not a billionaire has been replaced with a chatbot, and our only job is to receive government vouchers that we hand over to billionaire grifters who run the institutions that used to be under democratic control. We no longer vote with our ballots – only with our wallets, and in the wallet election, we only get the ballots that billionaires decide we deserve, and can only direct them between choices that are as meaningless as &quot;Mac vs Windows&quot; or &quot;Coke vs Pepsi.&quot; A world optimized for capital accumulation. It's a world without people.

      <p>I never was very good with PhotoShop and other bitmap image apps. Now I use ChatGPT, I just tell it what I want, like remove this bit and that bit, and it just freaking does it. This is how computers were meant to work. That's how I did the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/05/peets.png">Peet's logo</a> in the image in the previous post. And btw the people who are down on ChatGPT being used for graphics and videos are full of shit about it not having value. Some of us don't have the skill yet still would like to illustrate our ideas with images and videos. For those of us, the AI apps are a godsend. They're also pretty good I hear at providing medical advice. I've been using it for that pretty extensively. At my age health is not something you can ignore, and it helps to be informed. And with the healthcare system these days in the US being so limited, you don't really get to have a relationship with your doctor as we did in the past, so guess what, I bet ChatGPT is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/well/ai-chatbot-doctors-health-care-advice.html">saving some lives</a>. So if you don't like being seriously wrong about new tech, you should start seeing the advantages, not just the belief that it cancels freedom. If it does, and so far I don't see it, there's a lot of good that that compensates. There are always tradeoffs in evolution.</p>

      <p>I did a long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n6N9wOaGI4">video demo</a> yesterday with a narrative about where WordLand is going. The audio quality sucks. And at the beginning I said I wasn't going to narrate, but I couldn't help myself. Turn the volume way up. WordLand has become a new kind of feed reader, it's totally building off FeedLand, I love the idea of apps building on other apps. It's exactly the kind of software we predicted, long before MCP's, with Frontier back in the 80s, 90s and 00s.</p>

      <h1>Implementing a Baybayin abugida input method on keyboard hardware</h1>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p><em>For RSS readers: This article contains interactive content available on the <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/baybayin_abugida_keyboard_qmk/?ref=rss">original post on leanrada.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>I made an input method to write Baybayin, a syllable-based writing system, using Roman letters on a hardware keyboard. Banner photo lifted from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/fesl6p/gc60_x_baybayin_keycaps/">Reddit post</a> showing Baybayin keycaps. This post is about a real Baybayin keyboard though.</p>
<h2>The writing system</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin">Baybayin</a> is an ancient writing system in which a consonant-vowel syllable is written as one letter — it is an <strong>abugida</strong>. By default, letters have an inherent vowel which is /a/. To indicate a different vowel, a dot is added above or below the letter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>ᜃ (ka)</em>: The base letter on its own is the consonant plus the vowel <em>‘a’</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ᜃᜒ (ki)</em>: A dot above makes it end with <em>‘i’</em> / <em>‘e’</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ᜃᜓ (ku)</em>: A dot below makes it end with <em>‘u’</em> / <em>‘o’</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ᜃ᜕ (k)</em>: A slash cancels the vowel (it’s called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virama"><strong>virama</strong></a>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a full word is <em>ᜆtaᜆ᜕tᜎᜓlo(tatlo)</em>, which means the number three.</p>
<p><strong>HTML tip:</strong> I’m using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/ruby"><code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code></a> element to annotate Baybayin pronunciation in this post, similar to furigana for Japanese.</p>
<h2>Input design</h2>
<p>There are many ways to design an input method for this writing system on a keyboard. The most straightforward would be to have a key for each letter. Assign every possible letter-diacritic combination its own key. There’d be a total of 63 resulting letters, which is a bit too much for a keyboard. For comparison, the Latin alphabet A-Z only has 26 letters.</p>
<p>Layer or modes could help, accessed by holding the <code>Shift</code> or <code>Fn</code> key — after all, the Latin alphabet actually has 52 distinct symbols, counting both upper and lowercase.</p>
<p><img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/baybayin_abugida_keyboard_qmk/every-combination.png?ref=rss" alt="">In this design, pressing Shift would change the vowel endings.</p>
<p>Or we could assign only the 17 base letters and the 3 vowel diacritics for a total of 20 keys for input. This would be a pretty efficient layout, and it’s the one used by Google’s mobile keyboard Gboard. Some logic on top of this would be required to combine diacritics and letters.</p>
<p><img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/baybayin_abugida_keyboard_qmk/gboard.png?ref=rss" alt="">Gboard Baybayin layout</p>
<p>However, both of the above would require learning a whole new keyboard layout, wasting years of Latin alphabet-based muscle memory. For me who primarily uses the Latin alphabet for typing, this is worth considering.</p>
<p>Let’s say I wanted to type in romanised alphabet, like romaji for Japanese or pinyin for Chinese. What if the keyboard itself can be programmed to convert keystrokes directly into Baybayin outputs? Implementing this on the hardware presents a nice challenge; one keypress would no longer directly correspond to one character.</p>
<h2>My solution</h2>
<p>I implemented this on top of a <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> firmware base, making use of its neat Unicode API. This runs my keyboard’s microcontroller.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty basic solution, just a bunch of if-elses and variables. We don’t need a buffer or a trie or whatever data structure. It only needs to know about the last pressed key. Well, it’s a buffer of length 1.</p>
<pre><code>void on_key_press(uint16_t keycode) {
  bool curr_cons  = is_consonant(keycode);
  bool prev_cons  = is_consonant(prev_keycode);
  bool curr_vowel = !curr_cons;
  // special case for NG
  bool is_ng = prev_keycode == KEYCODE_N &amp;&amp; keycode == KEYCODE_G;

  // standalone vowel
  if (curr_vowel &amp;&amp; !prev_cons) {
    send_unicode(get_baybayin_unicode(keycode));
  }
  // initial consonant
  else if (curr_cons &amp;&amp; !is_ng) {
    send_unicode(get_baybayin_unicode(keycode));
    send_unicode(&quot;᜕&quot;); // virama, because no vowel initially
  }
  // vowel after consonant
  else if (curr_vowel &amp;&amp; prev_cons) {
    backspace(); // remove the initial virama

    if (keycode == KEYCODE_I || keycode == KEYCODE_E) {
      send_unicode(&quot;ᜒ&quot;);
    } else if (keycode == KEYCODE_U || keycode == KEYCODE_O) {
      send_unicode(&quot;ᜓ&quot;);
    }
    // KEYCODE_A emits nothing since /a/ is the default vowel
  }
  // NG digraph
  else { // is_ng
    // replace previous N with the letter for NG
    backspace(); // remove virama
    backspace(); // remove ᜈ
    send_unicode(&quot;ᜅ&quot;);
    send_unicode(&quot;᜕&quot;);
  }

  prev_keycode = keycode;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code shown here is just the core loop for readability. Not shown is how to handle interference from other keys such as Backspace and Arrow keys and other housekeeping.</p>
<h2>Housekeeping</h2>
<p>Whenever a non-alphabet key is pressed, I just reset all state and skip further processing. This solves keyboard shortcuts: if I press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>S</code> I want to save, not output <em>ᜐ᜕s</em>.</p>
<p>This also solves a stale <code>prev_keycode</code>. When you press <code>Backspace</code> for example, <code>prev_keycode</code> is no longer accurate. A buffer would actually help here, but it’d unnecessarily complicate the code. Cursor movement keys <code>←</code>, <code>→</code>, or any other non-letter key for that matter, <code>1</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>F2</code>, etc.; all reset state.</p>
<p>This cannot catch any state-invalidating actions that happen outside the keyboard, like selecting text with the mouse! A timeout takes care of these cases. After a short time without typing, state is reset.</p>
<p>Essentially, we only want to convert into Baybayin when continuously typing sequences of letters. Otherwise, it should behave like a regular keyboard.</p>
<p>The full working code is in <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/qmk_firmware/blob/2be68c4e8dc3977aaef1037d82d29ed8a59db903/keyboards/lily58/keymaps/Kalabasa/features/baybayin.c">my QMK fork on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Unicode encoding</h2>
<p>The way the Unicode Consortium designed the encoding of the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_1700.html">Tagalog (Baybayin) Unicode block</a> made this solution pretty straightforward. The vowel-modifier diacritics are <strong>combining characters</strong>, which means they can just be output separately, right after the base character. There are no precomposed consonant-vowel symbols.</p>
<pre><code>ᜆ +  ᜕ = ᜆ᜕
</code></pre>
<p>The word processing application or text renderer on the computer is what actually renders that sequence of characters as one combined symbol. In a way, one keypress still corresponds to one output character, except for a few special cases.</p>
<h2>Special case: N + G</h2>
<p>One special case is the letter <em>ᜅ</em>, representing the consonant /ŋ/. In English this sound is represented by two letters <em>‘ng’</em>. This romanisation breaks the rule of 1 Roman consonant letter to 1 Baybayin base letter. For example, <em>‘ngiti’</em> (meaning ‘smile’) is written as <em>ᜅᜒngiᜆᜒti</em>. This special case is solved by <em>backtracking:</em> sending a signal to the computer to erase the previous N.</p>
<h2>Backtracking</h2>
<p>To backtrack, we just send a virtual Backspace to the computer. Coming from the keyboard, it will be indistinguishable from a real Backspace keypress.</p>
<p>Backtracking is a thing mainly because the virama (‘vowel-killer’) is always output after typing a consonant. This is because when the user presses a consonant, we don’t know yet whether they’re going to type a syllable or stop at that point. <strong>Since base letters have an inherent vowel, we must immediately kill the inherent vowel with a virama when typing consonants.</strong> Only the next key will decide — we can backtrack the virama by then.</p>
<p>The following simulation illustrates how the keyboard-based solution handles backtracking:</p>
<pre><code>Interactive content: Visit the post to interact with this content.
Alternative name: Figure
Alternative text: simulation of the input method
</code></pre>
<p>So pressing, say, the <code>M</code> key should not output just the base letter <em>ᜋ (ma)</em>, but the letter + virama <em>ᜋ᜕</em> at once. If you press <code>A</code> next, it would <em>actually output a Backspace</em>, erasing the virama and leaving <em>ᜋ (ma)</em> as intended. If you had pressed <code>I</code>, a Backspace is sent along with the I vowel diacritic ᜒ, producing <em>ᜋᜒ (mi)</em>.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent vowel in most abugidas, a backtracking design seems to be used in other romanised input methods as well, such as <a href="https://anjal.net/">Anjal</a>, a romanised input method for Tamil.</p>
<h2>Why not a buffer instead of backtracking?</h2>
<p>Buffering keystrokes would remove the need to backtrack outputs, at the cost of responsiveness. In that setup, pressing a consonant would produce no glyph at all until the following key disambiguates the syllable and flushes the output. Loss of immediate visual feedback would make the keyboard feel unresponsive and breaks the rhythm of typing.</p>

<p>One of the downsides of a hardware-based solution is that we can only communicate via keycodes1. A software-based input method <em>editor</em> (IME) doesn’t have these restrictions; it can easily <em>edit</em> the string, access the undo stack, get the currently selected text, and more. This would eliminate the need for aggressive state invalidation and timeouts. There are pros and cons.</p>
<h2>Why not implement a software IME?</h2>
<p>Because it’s more fun to hack on keyboard firmware!</p>
<p>More seriously, implementing this on the hardware makes it portable. Not that I often need to write Baybayin, but I use multiple computers with a KVM switch. Software input methods are very OS- or application-dependent. (On Linux, it depends on even more things, such as your desktop environment, GTK or QT, X or Wayland, you name it.) <em>This</em> input method lives in <em>my</em> keyboard. I could plug my keyboard into any computer that supports arbitrary Unicode input1 and not have to install or reimplement anything.</p>
<p>Someone did <a href="https://inurwansah.my.id/2021/04/17/philippine-scripts-keyboard-for-linux/">make an input method for Baybayin</a> and other Philippine scripts for Linux ( <a href="https://github.com/Ilhamkang/Phillippines-input-method">Github</a>).</p>
<h2>1How does a keyboard even output Unicode?</h2>
<p>Technically, it can’t. It requires a certain understanding with the computer OS.</p>
<p>You know the Alt codes in Windows where you can summon any character by their code number? The keyboard basically types that sequence of keystrokes in quick succession when we say ‘send unicode’. This abstraction is all done by QMK, supporting Windows, Linux, and Mac’s Unicode input method.</p>
<p>To enter <code>U+1700</code> on Linux for example, the keyboard rapidly sends the following keystrokes in order: Hold <code>Ctrl</code>. Hold <code>Shift</code>. <code>U</code>. <code>1</code>. <code>7</code>. <code>0</code>. <code>0</code>. <code>Enter</code>. Release <code>Ctrl</code>. Release <code>Shift</code>. This outputs a <em>ᜀ</em>.</p>
<p>With all of the above logic, when I type <code>T</code>  <code>A</code>, the actual keycodes sent are: <code>Ctrl</code>  <code>Shift</code>  <code>U</code>  <code>1</code>  <code>7</code>  <code>0</code>  <code>6</code>  <code>Enter</code>  <code>Ctrl</code>  <code>Shift</code>  <code>U</code>  <code>1</code>  <code>7</code>  <code>1</code>  <code>5</code>  <code>Enter</code>  <code>Backspace</code></p>
<p>The same Unicode API from QMK powers <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/my-personalised-keyboard?ref=rss">emoji buttons in my keyboard!</a></p>
<h2>Can this be generalised to other abugidas?</h2>
<p>Baybayin is a relatively simple script, so the implementation here might be on the simpler side. Complications might come in the form of consonant clusters or different ways to join glyphs.</p>
<p>The implementation depends heavily on the Unicode encoding of the script. From what I’ve seen, many other abugidas have been designed in a similar way having vowels encoded as combining characters that modify base consonants. So there’s probably a common pattern of implementation.</p>

      <h1>Creating “Edit” Links That Open Plain-Text Source Files in a Native App</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>The setup for <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com">my notes blog</a> looks <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/notes-site-via-content-in-dropbox/">like this</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content is plain-text markdown files (synced via Dropbox, editable in iA Writer on my Mac, iPad, or iPhone)</li>
<li>Codebase is on GitHub</li>
<li>Builds are triggered in Netlify by a Shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>I try to catch spelling issues and what not before I publish, but I’m not perfect.</p>
<p>I can proofread a draft as much as I want, but nothing helps me catch errors better than hitting publish and re-reading what I just published on my website.</p>
<p>If that fails, kind readers will often reach out and say “Hey, I found a typo in your post [link].”</p>
<p>To fix these errors, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open iA Writer</li>
<li>Find the post</li>
<li>Fix typo</li>
<li>Fire Shortcut to trigger a build</li>
<li>Refresh my website and see the updated post</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the “Open iA Writer” and “Find the post” are points of friction I’ve wanted to optimize.</p>
<p>I’ve found myself thinking: “When I’m reading a post on <code>notes.jim-nielsen.com</code> and I spot a mistake, I wish I could just click an ‘Edit’ link right there and be editing my file.”</p>
<p>You might be thinking, “Yeah that’s what a hosted CMS does.”</p>
<p>But I like my plain-text files. And I love my native writing app.</p>
<p>What’s one to do?</p>
<p>Well, turns out <a href="https://ia.net/writer/support/help/url-commands">iA Writer supports opening files via links</a> with this protocol:</p>
<pre><code>ia-writer://open?path=location:/path/to/file.md

</code></pre>
<p>So, in my case, I can create a link for each post on my website that will open the corresponding plain-text file in iA Writer, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-language">&lt;article&gt;
  &lt;!-- content of post here --&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;ia-writer://open?path=notes:2026-01-04T2023.md&quot;&gt;
    Edit
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>And voilà, my OS is now my CMS!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/ia-writer-from-browser.png" alt="Screenshot of Safari with notes.jim-nielsen.com open. The browser shows a web page with a link that says “Edit”. The link preview in the lower left shows an ia-writer: link protocol and behind the browser is an iA Writer application window with a markdown file representing the content of the post you can see in the browser window."></p>
<p>It’s not a link to open the post in a hosted CMS somewhere. It’s a link to open a file on the device I’m using — cool!</p>
<p>My new workflow looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read a post in the browser</li>
<li>Click “Edit” hyperlink to open plain-text file in native app</li>
<li>Make changes</li>
<li>Fire Shortcut to trigger a build</li>
</ul>
<p>It works great. Here’s an example of opening a post from the browser on my laptop:</p>
<p>And another on my phone:</p>
<p>Granted, these “Edit” links are only useful to me. So I don’t put them in the source markup. Instead, I generate them with JavaScript when it’s just me browsing.</p>
<p>How do I know it’s just me?</p>
<p>I wrote a little script that watches for the presence of a search param <code>?edit=true</code>. If that is present, my site generates an “Edit” link on every post with the correct <code>href</code> and stores that piece of state in localstorage so every time I revisit the site, the “Edit” links are rendered for me (but nobody else sees them).</p>
<p>Well, not nobody. Now that I revealed my secret I know you can go get the “Edit” links to appear. But they won’t work for you because A) you don’t have iA Writer installed, or B) you don’t have my files on your device. So here’s a little tip if you tried rendering the “Edit” links: do <code>?edit=false</code> to turn them back off :)</p>

      <h1>A Letter of Feedback To Anyone Who Makes Software I Use</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>I don’t much enjoy being a lab rat to your half-baked ideas.</p>
<p>I can tell when your approach to what I use is: “Ship it and let’s see how people respond.”</p>
<p>Well let me tell you something: I’m not going to respond.</p>
<p>My desire to give you constructive feedback is in direct correlation to your effort to care — about your communications, about what you ship, even about what you <em>don’t</em> ship.</p>
<p>Just because you ship some half-baked feature doesn’t mean I’m going to take the time to tell you whether I find it any good.</p>
<p>Doubly so in the age of AI. I know how easy it is for you to ship slop, why should I take the time to formulate careful feedback on your careless output?</p>
<p>I can disagree with product decisions, but I won’t get mad at thoughtfulness and care. I respect that.</p>
<p>But I will very much disagree with <em>and</em> get mad at product decisions devoid of thought and care. I have no respect for that.</p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@jimniels/115696622197427043">It’s not really worth my time to respond to such a posture of shipping software</a>, and yet here I am writing about it. Because I care about the things I choose to (or am required to) use.</p>
<p>So this is my one-time, general-purpose piece of feedback to all such purveyors of digital goods and tools. Just because nobody tells you that what you shipped sucks, doesn’t mean it’s worth keeping. You can’t measure an apathetic response because it is, by definition, the absence of data.</p>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>I’m releasing my GLSL Web CRT Shader as open source.</p>
<p>This began as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gingerbeardman.com/post/3lk2arnt4rc2o">shader for Love2D</a> in early 2025 (I’ll try to release that version at some point). Later in 2025 I ported it to GLSL for my current personal work-in-progress web game.</p>
<p>I currently use it with Three.js, and this demo has it running with just a 2D canvas.</p>
<p>It’s optimised to run well on as far back as iPhone XS, though I’m certain it can be optimised even further. <a href="https://github.com/gingerbeardman/glsl-web-crt-shader/pulls">PRs welcome</a>! The easiest optimisation would be removing processing of unused parameters.</p>
<p>Is it scientifically correct? <em>Hell no.</em> Does it look good? <em>Yes.</em> Does it give you the feels? <em>Absolutely.</em></p>

      <h1>WebGL CRT Shader</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>I’m releasing my WebGL CRT Shader as open source.</p>
<p>It creates a CRT/vintage TV effect so could be used in games, emulators, apps, demos, visuals, etc. It’s not a simulator just something that gives the same general old school vibe.</p>
<p>As a WebGL shader, it runs on the device’s hardware GPU in the browser and renders to a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> (or offscreen canvas). I currently use it with Three.js, and the demo below uses just a 2D canvas.</p>
<p>It’s optimised to run well on low power devices as far back as iPhone XS, though I’m certain it can be optimised even further. <a href="https://github.com/gingerbeardman/webgl-crt-shader/pulls">PRs welcome</a>! The easiest personal optimisation you might make would be removing processing of unused parameters.</p>

      <h1>2025</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>Here’s the new year, same as the old year. Well, not the same, but pretty similar.</p>
<p><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21630">At the end of 2024</a>, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a year dominated by Ukraine and Gaza. Utterly horrific and unnecessary death courtesy of Putin and Netanyahu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See what I mean?</p>
<p>2025 added an extra dose of American carnage with Trump’s psychotic combination of cruelty and incompetence directed at the very foundations of the country. I’ve got to be honest, I’m tired of the USA living rent-free in my head so I’ve issued an eviction notice. It’s not that I don’t have sympathy and empathy for what’s happening there, but a majority of the country voted for this …again. Like a dog voting to have its nose rubbed in its own shit. Maybe this time the lesson will stick.</p>
<p>Anyway, leaving world events aside (yes, please!), I also said this at the end of last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For me personally, 2024 was just fine. I was relatively healthy all year. The people I love were relatively healthy too. I don’t take that for granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, same. No major health issues in 2025. My loved ones are well. My gratitude grows.</p>
<p>I’ve already written about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22324">how much music I played in 2025</a>. I’m hoping to continue that trajectory in 2026 with lots of sessions. We’re four days into the year and I’ve already had two excellent sessions. There are another three lined up this week.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of 2025 was <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22026">my trip with Jessica to Donegal</a>. Learning Irish by day, playing in sessions by night, all while surrounded by gorgeous scenery. I’ve already got a return trip planned for 2026. I’m also planning to be back in Belfast for the annual <a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">tradfest</a>.</p>
<p>Other 2025 highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21971">Curating an excellent edition of UX London</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21680">Releasing the new Salter Cane album</a> and <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21975">playing those songs live</a>—I want to do more of that in 2026.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of <a href="https://adactio.com/archive/2025/map">my travel in 2025</a> was either for music or family.</p>
<p>I made three trips to the States to see the in-laws: California, Florida, and most recently, Arizona. I can’t say I feel very comfortable going to the States right now, especially to Florida, where people openly display their intolerance on their T-shirts, and Arizona where they openly display their guns.</p>
<p>I went back to my hometown of Cobh a few times during the year to visit my mother.</p>
<p>Aside from those family trips, I went to Belfast, Donegal, Galway, and Clare in Ireland, Cáceres in Spain, Namur in Belgium, and Amsterdam. Only that last one was work-related. I always make sure to get to CSS Day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile here on my website, <a href="https://adactio.com/archive/2025">I posted 695 times in 2025</a>. That includes <a href="https://adactio.com/notes/archive/2025">345 notes</a>, <a href="https://adactio.com/links/archive/2025">262 links</a>, and <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/archive/2025">86 blog posts</a>. Here are some I’m quite fond of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21728">The web on mobile</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22034">Portugeating</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22084">Style your underlines</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22155">Hounds Of Love</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22183">Research</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22228">Bóthar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22265">Why use React?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22304">Tunes and typefaces</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, 2025 was a grand year for me. It wasn’t all that different from the year before. I’m at an age where the years aren’t all that differentiated from one another. I’m okay with that because I’m also at an age where I know what brings me joy and satisfaction, and I can focus on those things.</p>
<p>So here’s to 2026, which I hope I will spend doing more of what I did in 2025: playing music, speaking Irish, eating good food, hanging out with friends, reading good books, travelling to interesting places, and staying relatively healthy.</p>

<p>With enough users, every observable behavior becomes a dependency - regardless of what you promised. Someone is scraping your API, automating your quirks, caching your bugs.</p>
<p>This creates a career-level insight: you can’t treat compatibility work as “maintenance” and new features as “real work.” Compatibility is product.</p>
<p>Design your deprecations as migrations with time, tooling, and empathy. Most “API design” is actually “API retirement.”</p>

      <h1>Helping people write code again</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>Something I like about our weird new LLM-assisted world is the number of people I know who are coding again, having mostly stopped as they moved into management roles or lost their personal side project time to becoming parents.</p>
<p>AI assistance means you can get something useful done in half an hour, or even while you are doing other stuff. You don't need to carve out 2-4 hours to ramp up anymore.</p>
<p>If you have significant previous coding experience - even if it's a few years stale - you can drive these things really effectively. Especially if you have management experience, quite a lot of which transfers to &quot;managing&quot; coding agents - communicate clearly, set achievable goals, provide all relevant context. Here's a relevant <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/2007249835465072857">recent tweet</a> from Ethan Mollick:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you see how people use Claude Code/Codex/etc it becomes clear that managing agents is really a management problem</p>
<p>Can you specify goals? Can you provide context? Can you divide up tasks? Can you give feedback?</p>
<p>These are teachable skills. Also UIs need to support management</p>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>💡</p>
<p>Grim but essential // corrective to the Western-centric view of WWII. Dimbleby argues persuasively that the war was won and lost on the Eastern Front in 1941, not on the beaches of Normandy in 1944. It is a catalogue of two competing barbarisms, dispelling the myth of the &quot;clean&amp;</p>

      <p>
      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.phobanhmisaigonese.com/">Pho&amp; Banh Mi Saigonese</a></h2>
<p>We have been at this location for over 20 years as formerly Saigonese
Restaurant. The Wheaton area has changed dramatically over time as our
customers and their preferences. Our restaurant became more and
well-known good places to enjoy Vietnamese cuisines. After serious
considerations, with kind suggestions from our customers, we rebranded
to Pho and Banh Mi Saigonese.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://standardebooks.org/about">AboutStandard Ebooks</a></h2>
<p>Standard Ebooks is a volunteer-driven effort to produce a collection of
high quality, carefully formatted, accessible, open source, and free
public domain ebooks that meet or exceed the quality of commercially
produced ebooks. The text and cover art in our ebooks are already
believed to be in the U.S. public domain, and Standard Ebooks dedicates
its own work to the public domain, thus releasing the entirety of each
ebook file into the public domain. All the ebooks we produce are
distributed free of cost and free of U.S. copyright restrictions.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-rime-of-the-ancient-maintainer/">The Rime of the Ancient Maintainer</a></h2>
<p>Every culture produces heroes that reflect its deepest anxieties. The
Greeks, terrified of both mortality and immortality, gave us Achilles.
The Victorians, haunted by social mobility, gave us the self-made
industrialist. And Silicon Valley, drunk on exponential curves and both
terrified and entranced by endless funding rounds, has given us the Hero
Developer: a figure who ships features at midnight, who “moves fast and
breaks things,” who transforms whiteboard scribbles into billion-dollar
unicorns through sheer caffeinated will.</p>
<p>We celebrate this person constantly. They’re on the front page of
TechCrunch et al. They keynote conferences. Their GitHub contributions
get screenshotted and shared like saintly relics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an unsung developer is updating dependencies, patching
security vulnerabilities, and refactoring code that the Hero Developer
wrote three years ago before moving on to their next “zero to one”
opportunity.</p>
<p>They will never be profiled in Wired.</p>
<p>But they’re doing something far more important than innovation.</p>
<p>They’re preventing collapse.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://lalitm.com/post/one-number-i-trust/">One Number I Trust: Plain-Text Accounting for a Multi-Currency Household</a></h2>
<p>No app did exactly what I needed, so I built my own personal finance
system using plain-text accounting principles and a powerful Python
library called Beancount. This post shows you how I handle imports,
investments, multi-currency, and a two-person view.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://marcoroth.dev/posts/glamorous-christmas">Glamorous Christmas: Bringing Charm to Ruby</a></h2>
<p>Today, Ruby 4.0 was released. What an exciting milestone for the
language!</p>
<p>This release brings some amazing new features like the experimental
Ruby::Box isolation mechanism, the new ZJIT compiler, significant
performance improvements for class instantiation, and promotions of Set
and Pathname to core classes. It’s incredible to see how Ruby continues
to thrive and be pushed forward 30 years after its first release.</p>
<p>To celebrate this release, I’m happy to announce that I’ve been working
on porting the Charmbracelet Go terminal libraries to Ruby, and today
I’m releasing a first version of them. What better way to make this Ruby
4.0 release a little more glamorous and charming?</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2025/12/finding-a-broken-trace-on-my-old-mac-with-the-help-of-its-rom-diagnostics/">29 Finding a broken trace on my old Mac with the help of its ROMdiagnostics</a></h2>
<p>I remembered that people have been working towards documenting the Mac
ROM startup tests and using them to diagnose problems, so I decided to
give it a shot and see if Apple’s Serial Test Manager could identify my
Performa’s issue. Where was the fault on this complicated board? Sure, I
could test a zillion traces by hand, but why bother when the computer
already knows what is wrong?</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/516">Public Domain Day 2026</a></h2>
<p>1925 was a watershed year for the recording industry. The Jazz Age was
in full swing and beginning in March, 1925, widespread adoption of
electrical recording meant greater fidelity and new realism for
recordings. DAHR documents over 11,000 recordings made in 1925–an
all-time high for the industry.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://archive.org/details/60minutes-cecotsegment">Pulled 60 Minutes segment on CECOT</a></h2>
<p>This is a screen recording of a 60 Minutes segment about the Centro de
Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison in El Salvador, which was
intended to be aired December 22, 2025 but was pulled last minute for
unclear reasons. Despite being pulled, it aired on Global-TV in Canada
anyway.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/two-years-cormac-mccarthys-death-rare-access-to-personal-library-reveals-man-behind-myth-180987150/">Two Years After Cormac McCarthy’s Death, Rare Access to His PersonalLibrary Reveals the Man Behind the Myth</a></h2>
<p>Cormac McCarthy, one of the greatest novelists America has ever produced
and one of the most private, had been dead for 13 months when I arrived
at his final residence outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was a stately
old adobe house, two stories high with beam-ends jutting out of the
exterior walls, set back from a country road in a valley below the
mountains. First built in 1892, the house was expanded and modernized in
the 1970s and extensively modified by McCarthy himself, who, it turns
out, was a self-taught architect as well as a master of literary
fiction.</p>
<p>I was invited to the house by two McCarthy scholars who were embroiled
in a herculean endeavor. Working unpaid, with help from other volunteer
scholars and occasional graduate students, they had taken it upon
themselves to physically examine and digitally catalog every single book
in McCarthy’s enormous and chaotically disorganized personal library.
They were guessing it contained upwards of 20,000 volumes. By
comparison, Ernest Hemingway, considered a voracious book collector,
left behind a personal library of 9,000.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html">How uv got so fast</a></h2>
<p>uv is fast because of what it doesn’t do, not because of what language
it’s written in. The standards work of PEP 518, 517, 621, and 658 made
fast package management possible. Dropping eggs, pip.conf, and
permissive parsing made it achievable. Rust makes it a bit faster still.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://toolkit.wellgedacht.org/doku.php?id=start">Post-Platform Digital Publishing Toolkit</a></h2>
<p>The Post-Platform Digital Publishing Toolkit is an iterative digital and
print publication by Well Gedacht Publishing exploring how to overcome
the limitations of digital publishing on social media and other online
platforms, and advocates for self-hosted infrastructures and practices
for artists and artists’ book publishers. You can find the first
iteration of the print publication here.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_Vico">Giambattista Vico</a></h2>
<p>Giambattista Vico (born Giovan Battista Vico /ˈviːkoʊ/; Italian:
[ˈviko]; 23 June 1668 – 23 January 1744) was an Italian philosopher,
rhetorician, historian, and jurist during the Italian Enlightenment. He
criticized the expansion and development of modern rationalism, finding
Cartesian analysis and other types of reductionism impractical to human
life, and he was an apologist for classical antiquity and the
Renaissance humanities, in addition to being the first expositor of the
fundamentals of social science and of semiotics. He is recognised as one
of the first Counter-Enlightenment figures in history.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/chinese-cybersecurity-expert-hacks-control-system-of-unitrees-humanoid-robot-in-one-minute">Robots Can Be Hacked in Minutes, Chinese Cybersecurity Experts Warn</a></h2>
<p>Commercial robots have widespread and exploitable vulnerabilities that
can allow hackers to take over within hours or even minutes, according
to Chinese cybersecurity experts.</p>
<p>Security in the robotics industry is “riddled with holes,” said Xiao
Xuangan, who works at Darknavy, an independent cybersecurity research
and services firm based in Singapore and Shanghai. Xiao noted that when
testing low-level security issues in quadruped robots, his team gained
control of one of Deep Robotics’ Lite-series products in just an hour.</p>

<p>I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour.</p>
<p>It's not perfect and I'm iterating on it but this is where we are right now. If you are skeptical of coding agents, try it on a domain you are already an expert of. Build something complex from scratch where you can be the judge of the artifacts.</p>

      <h1>Manually Restoring Scroll Position on Reload with JavaScript</h1>

(date: 2026-01-03)
      <p>
      <p>I’m working on another site, written directly in HTML and stitched together with
the C preprocessor (it’s really quite ergonomic!) and using the excellent Python
package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/reloadserver/"><code>reloadserver</code></a> to automatically reload the pages in my
browser whenever I make changes.
Unfortunately, Firefox, at least, doesn’t remember
and restore scroll position on reload, which may be the behavior one wants when
actually browsing, but is really annoying during the writing and design process.</p>

      <p>The war in Iraq started in <a href="http://scripting.com/2003/03.html">March 2003</a>. That was also the month I arrived in Cambridge after driving cross-country from Woodside, CA. Because I did most of my blogging on scripting.com, I still have a good <a href="http://scripting.com/2003/03.html">archive</a> of how I experienced both those things. It's also the month we got the Harvard weblogs going, but they have not stood up so well. I wouldn't have predicted then that my personal blog would survive the system we started at one of America's great universities.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/03/bushLooksLikeHegseth.png" alt="">Today feels like the day the war in Iraq began. Wars are easy to start, hard to end. They actually called Bush a &quot;visionary&quot; on MSNBC, they were so in awe of his courage, but that would end soon. And this time, no doubt Trump started the war with the approval of China and Russia, which will be left alone by the US in their conquest of Taiwan and Ukraine. Leaders of smaller countries must be wondering where they can hide from this. A very depressing moment. I've lived through two voluntary wars by the US, first Vietnam, then the post-911 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and now this war.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>My experience is that <em>real</em> AI adoption on <em>real</em> problems is a complex blend of: domain context on the problem, domain experience with AI tooling, and old-fashioned IT issues. I’m deeply skeptical of any initiative for internal AI adoption that doesn’t anchor on all three of those. This is an advantage of earlier stage companies, because you can often find aspects of all three of those in a single person, or at least across two people. In larger companies, you need three different <em>organizations</em> doing this work together, this is just objectively hard</p>

      <h1>The most popular blogs of Hacker News in 2025</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/">The most popular blogs of Hacker News in 2025</a></strong></p>
<p>Michael Lynch maintains <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">HN Popularity Contest</a>, a site that tracks personal blogs on Hacker News and scores them based on how well they perform on that platform.</p>
<p>The engine behind the project is the <a href="https://github.com/mtlynch/hn-popularity-contest-data/blob/master/data/domains-meta.csv">domain-meta.csv</a> CSV on GiHub, a hand-curated list of known personal blogs with author and bio and tag metadata, which Michael uses to separate out personal blog posts from other types of content.</p>
<p>I came top of the rankings in 2023, 2024 and 2025 but I'm listed <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">in third place</a> for all time behind Paul Graham and Brian Krebs.</p>
<p>I dug around in the browser inspector and was delighted to find that the data powering the site is served with open CORS headers, which means you can easily explore it with external services like Datasette Lite.</p>
<p>Here's a convoluted window function query Claude Opus 4.5 <a href="https://claude.ai/share/8e1cb294-0ff0-4d5b-b83f-58e4c7fdb0d2">wrote for me</a> which, for a given domain, shows where that domain ranked for each year since it first appeared in the dataset:</p>
<pre><code>with yearly_scores as (
  select
    domain,
    strftime('%Y', date) as year,
    sum(score) as total_score,
    count(distinct date) as days_mentioned
  from &quot;hn-data&quot;
  group by domain, strftime('%Y', date)
),
ranked as (
  select
    domain,
    year,
    total_score,
    days_mentioned,
    rank() over (partition by year order by total_score desc) as rank
  from yearly_scores
)
select
  r.year,
  r.total_score,
  r.rank,
  r.days_mentioned
from ranked r
where r.domain = :domain
  and r.year &gt;= (
    select min(strftime('%Y', date))
    from &quot;hn-data&quot;
    where domain = :domain
  )
order by r.year desc
</code></pre>
<p>(I just noticed that the last <code>and r.year &gt;= (</code> clause isn't actually needed here.)</p>

<p>Also useful is that every domain gets its own CORS-enabled CSV file with details of the actual Hacker News submitted from that domain, e.g. <code>https://hn-popularity.cdn.refactoringenglish.com/domains/simonwillison.net.csv</code>. Here's <a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https://hn-popularity.cdn.refactoringenglish.com/domains/simonwillison.net.csv#/data/simonwillison">that one in Datasette Lite</a>.</p>

      <p>
      <p>This is one of those times when you pay the price for working past your timeout, like a pitcher pitching too many pitches in one game. There's an item on your checklist, and you'd love to take it off before you start the next session. You copy paste something, get it to work, and close out your session for the day.</p>
<p>While you're preparing to get up you decide to share a linkblog item, and when it boots up there's something severely broken. It has nothing to do with anything on your list! You roll it up for the day anyway, figuring it'll be easy to find when you start the next session. No sir. You have to work through complicated code you haven't touched in months! Where the fuck is this, and how the fuck did it happen. Drink more coffee. Keep stepping through the code to identify when things went bad. It happens in the most impossible place. You keep digging in. Even more impossible. Unfathomable. But you keep going in, making sure every bit of code does something you think it should and then boom! You left a copy in some DOM code in something you cribbed so now there are two of this thing you hadn't touched or even looked at in months. Delete the mistake, rebuild, click off all the breakpoints. And yup that was it.</p>
<p>I started work at approx 9AM and it's 11:41AM — wasted the best part of the day, all to learn the lesson that no more &quot;one more feature&quot; before I get up bullshit. If you're tired you make mistakes, and you can't not pay for them.</p>
<p>No doubt I will continue to learn this and other lessons all through what remains of my career. Some things you never learn, like &quot;I can always roll back&quot; — but where should I roll back to? When did I break this mofo? Oy. I'm never willing to go back that way.</p>

<p>The Gateway is a small (1U/desktop) router with features like a 4-core Arm CPU, 8GB of ECC LPDDR RAM, and decent expansion options for a compact router.</p>

      <h1>The web after AI</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/02/frankfurterWithSauerkraut.png" alt="">I still use Google. And I like the AI response they put at the top of the page, even though I get that it's bad for the web. Maybe there's a position for a web-only search engine. One where my writing has a chance of being seen by interested parties, rather than being converted to <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=slurry">slurry</a> to be fed to consumers as one would get a <a href="https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/hot-dog-stand-new-york.html?sortBy=relevant">tasty hot dog</a> from a NYC street vendor. Another level of processing. If I recall correctly one of the browsers is saying they're not using AI at all. But this would be different, it would be for search, not the browser.</p>
<p>But Google, if you want to be fair about it, there should be a permalink for the AI-generated answers. This is something none of the AI vendors seem to be able to do. If so, I wonder why?</p>
<p>I just tried looking up &quot;Regular Medicare&quot; on Google, I was looking for an official page and ended up using the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/providers-services/original-medicare">Medicare.gov</a> one. But I could have decided the Google synopsis was the best. No way that I can see to use that as a link.</p>
<p>Maybe we should all start thinking about how we would like the new post-AI web to work?</p>
<p>I am trying to reach the well-known political pundits to tell them we don't have to accept the web the billionaires give us. The costs are very low, their money doesn't help them as much as you might think, because they have different concerns from the ones you (writer) and I (developer) have. I don't care about revenue (disclaimer that doesn't mean everything will be free and there won't be a business model, it just isn't the reason I'm doing the work). This is my way of giving back, the area I have the greatest leverage. I always argued that Bill Gates who kept saying in the 90s he was going to be a scrappy competitor now and give away his wealth when he retired. He <em>is</em> doing that btw, but I thought man you're never going to have the leverage you have now. Your money as a way to end famine or fight the climate crisis is nothing compared to the power you had when you had the dominant operating system in a time of great transition. You could, I argued, make the web a breakthrough for self-government, so we could <em>systematically</em> solve those problems with the resources of the United States, not just the resources of the world's richest man. That possibility really was within reach, I believed then and still do now.</p>
<p>I made the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html">choice</a> Bill didn't and it worked. We were able to build something amazing, only to see it broken down into that slurry I mentioned at the top of the page.</p>
<p>I love AI, I don't want to go back. But I also have big plans for human thinkers and developers -- writers, using the technology we never got a chance to develop while we were busy being dominated by Larry and Sergey, Zuckerberg, the Twitter founders, et al.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3mbgv3xaah22u">said</a> on Bluesky today, we're going to insist this time that the political punditry get involved, assuming they are serious about saving what's left of our democracy.</p>

      <h1>Good Old Medicare</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>This year I switched to <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/providers-services/original-medicare">Original Medicare</a> for 2026 after being on super duper insurance industry enhanced Medicare for the first five years. I should've known that it's super duper for them but not so great for the insured person or the taxpayer, that is -- me. They have set it up so they can scam it 18 different ways, Some of the &quot;services&quot; they offer are just ways for them to charge the government more for your care, in return for doing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>So today I had my first Regular Medicare experience. I went to renew my prescriptions, and the vendor already knew my insurance info which was impressive use of computers. I was prepared to give it the new info. And in case you're confused, you still have to pay the insurance industry for Regular Medicare, even though that's actually a deal between me and my government. No way to deal them out, though I'm sure it would make total sense for us to do exactly that. Don't believe that when it comes to health care the US has been anything like a democracy.</p>
<p>Where the old plan each prescription cost <span class="math inline">\(0, this time I actually have to pay out of pocket approx \)</span>100 for a 90 day supply of five different medications. On the other hand, I'm paying much less for this insurance. I haven't done the math yet, but it feels like I'm not getting ripped off. See how many qualifiers there are.</p>
<p>Oh the great old US of A where you can give your tax money and retirement funds to insurance companies who buy politicians etc and so on. Maybe the only thing to appreciate is that we get some health care for all our tax payments over our careers?</p>
<p>And one good thing is now I get to keep most of my Social Security payments instead of it all going to United Healthcare. ;-)</p>

      <h1>Flock Exposes Its AI-Enabled Surveillance Cameras</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02, updated: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>404 Media has the <a href="https://www.404media.co/flock-exposed-its-ai-powered-cameras-to-the-internet-we-tracked-ourselves/">story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike many of Flock’s cameras, which are designed to capture license plates as people drive by, Flock’s Condor cameras are pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras designed to record and track people, not vehicles. Condor cameras can be set to automatically zoom in on people’s faces as they walk through a parking lot, down a public street, or play on a playground, or they can be controlled manually, according to marketing material on Flock’s website. We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy’s parking lot in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic. In one case, we were able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia’s Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past. Minutes later, he showed up on another exposed camera livestream further down the bike path. The camera’s resolution was good enough that we were able to see that, when he stopped beneath one of the cameras, he was watching rollerblading videos on his phone...</p>

      <h1>Twenty Twenty-Five</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>2025 was… a year. And I made it to the end of that year. If you’re reading this, I imagine you did too and let’s celebrate that. But also not one without loss; of loved ones, of health, of relationships, of jobs, of liberties, of pursuits of happiness. Let’s mourn those.</p>
<p>My year was mundane by most accounts. I worked, I family’d, and with the remaining life force I focused on myself. A couple failed side projects and half-baked game ideas in there but welcomingly “unproductive” relative to what I normally subject myself to. On a handful of fronts this year has been about scaling back in what I burden myself with, in material posessions, in finances, in obligations, and elsewhere. Ideally, I can clear the plate of duties that demand my limited attention. To be so bored that I read a magazine.</p>
<h2>Resolutions resolved</h2>
<p>I set some slightly different goals last year. Let’s check on last year’s goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>🟢 <strong>Seize work opportunities</strong> - I’ll call this a success. Released a design system and token system. An executive-level mandate caused us to pivot the entire design language using the tokens. Success. Other big products are beginning to use our team’s work, we’re recognized for the accessibility of our product… which is great.</li>
<li>🔴 <strong>Hunker down and be creative</strong> - In the interest of binaries, I’ll say no. I think I gravitated to work and mind-numbing recovery, not creativity. I wasn’t very productive beyond work and family life. I think given “the situation” in the homeland, that’s okay.</li>
<li>🟠 <strong>Slow down to 1x mode</strong> - I still watch and listen way too much in 2x but at a certain point it does feel natural. Certain content gets the 1x treatment, but not enough. I did slow down though, generally speaking. Less books, less blog posts, less side projects. And that’s okay.</li>
<li>🔴 <strong>Join a club</strong> - I made attempts to join two different writing clubs, but it didn’t work out. One met on an inconvenient night and I guess I failed the application for the other one. I joined a Discord for a Gunpla group… but never went. Closest I got to joining a club is a dad band that plays after our kids’ band practices.</li>
<li>🟢 <strong>Understand myself</strong> - I’m progressing on my health journey to untangle the knot of anxiety, weight, and ADHD. I’ve done all the important appointments and follow-ups. I’ve done the diet. I’ve done the exercise. I’ve got new medications all lined up. Waiting for something to change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A month-by-month breakdown</h2>

<li>New pain meds</li>
<li>New ADHD meds</li>

<p>The school rush and kid activities fill most non-working hours. It’s a lot of work right now but we signed up for it by having children. Speaking of children, my daughter’s cheer team won a national championship, which is an incredible accomplishment and experience for her. And my son started playing guitar this year which makes the whole family happy. Both kids are 10+ now which feels like we’re entering a new era in parenting; more autonomy, different problems, deeper conversations, movies with curse words, and more attitude. It’s new territory.</p>
<h2>An average amount of books</h2>
<p>I had a sub-goal of reading less this year and I succeeded! That feels good.</p>

<p>I encountered a lot of mediocre books this year but there were some bangers in there like <a href="https://amzn.to/45g0s5b">The Dawn of Everything</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3SZMflH">The Wrong Stuff</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/3YEqwTD">The Sirens’ Call</a>. It’s possible I’ve maxed out on books though. My appetite to seek out new books to read in the last two months has been super low. They’re all starting to blur into a large mush. I have a backlog of manga to read… perhaps next year is the year I get back into comics?</p>
<h2>An average amount of blogging</h2>
<p>I published 53 posts in 2025 which averages to a post-a-week, but there’s some hot streaks in there skewing the stats. It’s less than the year before which (again) I’ll count as a win. Behind the scenes there’s dozens of half-finished posts, but it takes so much effort to finish a technical post about CSS or web components who knows when those will see the light of day.</p>

<h2>Living in the zone of shit</h2>
<p>American politics drove a lot of my daily vibes this year. Day-after-day of bullshit executive orders, tariffs, lies, DOGE, fuckups, coverups, corruption, kidnappings, gulags, military occupation of democratic US cities under false pretenses, murders at sea, billionaires, institutional collapse, and everything else is exhausting. The economic anxiety weighed heavily on me; we even panic bought a car! But watching groceries get more expensive, budgets get tighter, all while the President and his cronies launch crypto grifts to launder money from billionaires and foreign governments in an open influence peddling scheme is infuriating.</p>
<p>I had to step back from news a bit for my own mental health, but also it’s getting repetitive. Regime does stupid/illegal thing, PERSON gets DESTROYED by THING (but never does), consequences never happen, the world is unjust. I <em>know</em> the strategy is to exhaust, but I hit peak outrage years ago and this feels like a long, unshakable hangover of bad decisions. My trust in any form of government erodes like sand cliffs.</p>
<p>Mix in a highly speculative tech hype cycle which makes up a disproportionate amount of the economy and stock market valuation… and it’s hard to shake off a sense of dread.</p>
<h2>Focusing on my physical and mental health</h2>
<p>All my extra spoons went to wrangling my physical and mental health. Sometimes that manifested as staring at an iPad on my recliner after long day at work, but it also involved a lot of doctors visits. This has been a year and a half long journey (since good healthcare kicked in) of prioritizing myself. And while the news isn’t all great, I’m getting a clearer picture of the brain and body I’m dealing with. There’s a long road ahead and I don’t actually know when/if it gets better, but having a pathway forward means a lot right now.</p>
<p>I was unconsolably grumpy for nearly two months straight. It could be burnout. It could be cheese-moving. It could be depression manifesting differently. What I learned from going through that spell was <strong>good people and great music are the secret to being happy</strong>. At least for me. And I need to make sure I’m building that into the regular rhythms of my life.</p>
<h2>2026: No New Projects</h2>
<p>Next year has the potential to be good. If a certain elderly statesman, for example, passed away from age-related illnesses… that might change the mood considerably. But speaking to what’s within my sphere of control, I think there’s capacity for goodness.</p>
<p>For 2026, I’m adopting a mantra of “No new projects.” There will be new projects of course; they fit all the interest, novelty, challenge, urgency, and passion (INCUP) requirements that motivate ADHD brains. The spirit of “No new projects” is to finish more projects than I start. In the last month or so I’ve been aggressive on closing out old lingering to-dos; home improvements, organizing, taxes, managing devices, etc. and I want to continue that work of clearing out all those nagging unfinished bits. I want to buy back precious Brain RAM so I feel less overwhelmed all the time.</p>
<p>“No new projects” helps me be more present and realize when I’m creating work for myself. When I buy a new device, or an instrument, or think about building my own home server array… “No new projects” puts a hurdle in the way of that decision so that I don’t DDoS myself with a backlog of small jobs pursuing an impulse.</p>
<p>I tend to externalize, but 2026 also feels highly dependent on what happens in tech in the next year. A change in my job? A robot taking my job? A mass layoff? A bubble bursting? An industry collapse? A retreat to a smaller web? A new and unexpected technological breakthrough? As I hinted earlier, it feels like the entirety of tech has hitched itself to a highly speculative bet and we all have to wait and see what happens. The lack of clarity and concrete vision for the future of human-centered computing and labor creates a feeling of insecurity for me. A trillion dollar hurricane. Displacement.</p>
<p>But we can write. And we can dream. And we can imagine a future where humans connect.</p>

      <h1>Japanese input on SHARP Zaurus</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>I didn't know. There are some software ways for doing so but there is a button on the keyboard which switches the input from hardware keyboard to the most practical mode: one writes in Latin (Romanji) and software replace it instantly with Hiragana characters. When the space is pressed then the Hiragana is replaced with Kanji symbols (if applicable). If the space is pressed once more then menu appears with other possible Kanji and/or Katakana meanings. It's normal on the desktop but I didn't expected that it will work so well there.</p>

      <h1>Introducing gisthost.github.io</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>I am a huge fan of <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/">gistpreview.github.io</a>, the site by Leon Huang that lets you append <code>?GIST_id</code> to see a browser-rendered version of an HTML page that you have saved to a Gist. The last commit was ten years ago and I needed a couple of small changes so I've forked it and deployed an updated version at <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/">gisthost.github.io</a>.</p>
<h4>Some background on gistpreview</h4>
<p>The genius thing about <code>gistpreview.github.io</code> is that it's a core piece of GitHub infrastructure, hosted and cost-covered entirely by GitHub, that wasn't built with any involvement from GitHub at all.</p>
<p>To understand how it works we need to first talk about Gists.</p>
<p>Any file hosted in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a> can be accessed via a direct URL that looks like this:</p>
<p><code>https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/d168778e8e62f65886000f3f314d63e3/raw/79e58f90821aeb8b538116066311e7ca30c870c9/index.html</code></p>
<p>That URL is served with a few key HTTP headers:</p>
<pre><code>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

</code></pre>
<p>These ensure that every file is treated by browsers as plain text, so HTML file will not be rendered even by older browsers that attempt to guess the content type based on the content.</p>
<pre><code>Via: 1.1 varnish
Cache-Control: max-age=300
X-Served-By: cache-sjc1000085-SJC

</code></pre>
<p>These confirm that the file is sever via GitHub's caching CDN, which means I don't feel guilty about linking to them for potentially high traffic scenarios.</p>
<pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

</code></pre>
<p>This is my favorite HTTP header! It means I can hit these files with a <code>fetch()</code> call from any domain on the internet, which is fantastic for building <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/">HTML tools</a> that do useful things with content hosted in a Gist.</p>
<p>The one big catch is that Content-Type header. It means you can't use a Gist to serve HTML files that people can view.</p>
<p>That's where <code>gistpreview</code> comes in. The <code>gistpreview.github.io</code> site belongs to the dedicated <a href="https://github.com/gistpreview">gistpreview</a> GitHub organization, and is served out of the <a href="https://github.com/gistpreview/gistpreview.github.io">github.com/gistpreview/gistpreview.github.io</a> repository by GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>It's not much code. The key functionality is this snippet of JavaScript from <a href="https://github.com/gistpreview/gistpreview.github.io/blob/master/main.js">main.js</a>:</p>
<pre><code>fetch('https://api.github.com/gists/' + gistId)
.then(function (res) {
  return res.json().then(function (body) {
    if (res.status === 200) {
      return body;
    }
    console.log(res, body); // debug
    throw new Error('Gist &lt;strong&gt;' + gistId + '&lt;/strong&gt;, ' + body.message.replace(/\(.*\)/, ''));
  });
})
.then(function (info) {
  if (fileName === '') {
    for (var file in info.files) {
      // index.html or the first file
      if (fileName === '' || file === 'index.html') {
        fileName = file;
      }
    }
  }
  if (info.files.hasOwnProperty(fileName) === false) {
    throw new Error('File &lt;strong&gt;' + fileName + '&lt;/strong&gt; is not exist');
  }
  var content = info.files[fileName].content;
  document.write(content);
})
</code></pre>
<p>This chain of promises fetches the Gist content from the GitHub API, finds the section of that JSON corresponding to the requested file name and then outputs it to the page like this:</p>
<pre><code>document.write(content);
</code></pre>
<p>This is smart. Injecting the content using <code>document.body.innerHTML = content</code> would fail to execute inline scripts. Using <code>document.write()</code> causes the browser to treat the HTML as if it was directly part of the parent page.</p>
<p>That's pretty much the whole trick! Read the Gist ID from the query string, fetch the content via the JSON API and <code>document.write()</code> it into the page.</p>
<p>Here's a demo:</p>
<p><a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?d168778e8e62f65886000f3f314d63e3">https://gistpreview.github.io/?d168778e8e62f65886000f3f314d63e3</a></p>
<h4>Fixes for gisthost.github.io</h4>
<p>I forked <code>gistpreview</code> to add two new features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A workaround for Substack mangling the URLs</li>
<li>The ability to serve larger files that get truncated in the JSON API</li>
</ol>
<p>I also removed some dependencies (jQuery and Bootstrap and an old <code>fetch()</code> polyfill) and inlined the JavaScript into <a href="https://github.com/gisthost/gisthost.github.io/blob/main/index.html">a single index.html file</a>.</p>
<p>The Substack issue was small but frustrating. If you email out a link to a <code>gistpreview</code> page via Substack it modifies the URL to look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?f40971b693024fbe984a68b73cc283d2=&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">https://gistpreview.github.io/?f40971b693024fbe984a68b73cc283d2=&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email</a></p>
<p>This breaks <code>gistpreview</code> because it treats <code>f40971b693024fbe984a68b73cc283d2=&amp;utm_source...</code> as the Gist ID.</p>
<p>The fix is to read everything up to that equals sign. I <a href="https://github.com/gistpreview/gistpreview.github.io/pull/7">submitted a PR</a> for that back in November.</p>
<p>The second issue around truncated files was <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/issues/26#issuecomment-3699668871">reported against my claude-code-transcripts project</a> a few days ago.</p>
<p>That project provides a CLI tool for exporting HTML rendered versions of Claude Code sessions. It includes a <code>--gist</code> option which uses the <code>gh</code> CLI tool to publish the resulting HTML to a Gist and returns a gistpreview URL that the user can share.</p>
<p>These exports can get pretty big, and some of the resulting HTML was past the size limit of what comes back from the Gist API.</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/releases/tag/0.5">claude-code-transcripts 0.5</a> the <code>--gist</code> option now publishes to <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/">gisthost.github.io</a> instead, fixing both bugs.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?02ced545666128ce4206103df6185536">the Claude Code transcript</a> that refactored Gist Host to remove those dependencies, which I published to Gist Host using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>uvx claude-code-transcripts web --gist

      <p>&quot;Instagram no longer believes it can beat AI by making more or better content. It wants to be the referee, to decide what is real and what is not, and to build systems that can do it at scale.&quot;</p>

      <p>On the last day of 2025, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri posted a 20-slide memo on Instagram. It covered AI, fake content, reality distortion, and how the platform will change. Read it as a press release, and it’s heavy with buzzwords. Read it as a set of clues about what’s next, and it tells a different story. (The text of the 20 slide memo is at the …</p>

      <h1>Get to Know GNU Guix: A System for Programmers</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p><img src="/assets/img/gnu/gnu-guix/gnu-guix.jpg" alt="Get to Know GNU Guix: A System for Programmers"></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>GNU Guix</strong> is a <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags#distros">distro</a>, package manager, and operating system from the <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags#gnu">GNU</a> project that proposes a radically different approach from most <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags#gnulinux">GNU/Linux</a> distributions. It is based on <strong>functional management</strong> (Guix System), focusing on <strong>reproducibility</strong>, <strong>isolation</strong>, and <strong>total system control</strong> by the user.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2021/12/nixos-um-sistema-operacional-para-programadores.html">NixOS</a>, it uses the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">GNU Guile (Scheme)</a> language to define packages, services, and the entire system configuration.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output depends only on the inputs.</li>
<li>There are no side effects on the system.</li>
<li>Each package is installed in a unique directory in <code>/gnu/store</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Nothing overwrites anything.</strong></li>
<li>Different versions of the same software coexist without conflict.</li>
<li>Instant rollback.</li>
<li>Independent profiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>GNU Guix is widely used for: <strong>Scientific Research</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, and <strong>Security Auditing</strong>.</p>
<p>Guix strictly adheres to the <strong>Free Software Foundation</strong> guidelines, solidifying: Free Software Freedom.</p>
<p>GNU Guix is not for those who want to “ <em>just install and use</em>”; it’s for those who want <strong>control</strong>, <strong>predictability</strong>, and <strong>truly declarative systems</strong>.</p>
<p>If you see the operating system as code, Guix makes more sense than any traditional distro.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Download and Installation</h2>
<p>You can download the <code>.iso</code> from the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/">GNU Guix Downloads page</a>. Choose the alternative that suits your interest. If you are installing on your physical machine, choose the first option: <strong>GNU Guix System (version)</strong> 64-bit ( <em>x86_64</em>) or 32-bit ( <em>i686</em>).</p>
<p>After booting from the <code>.iso</code> file, just follow the steps to install, which, by the way, is quite intuitive. The first screen will be this one. If you want ease, just choose the option using <strong>graphical mode</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/gnu/gnu-guix/01.png" alt="GNU Guix install 01"></p>
<p>GNU Guix does not use the commercial <em>Linux Kernel</em> but offers you two types of <em>Kernels</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd">GNU Hurd</a>, a kernel that is not yet finished but functional, which <em>separates tasks</em>. Since Linux is considered a <em>systemd</em> (like a multifunction printer) of kernels—it performs many tasks, which is considered a bad idea by many (including Tanenbaum, the creator of Minix, which inspired Linux);</li>
<li>and also <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Linux-libre">GNU Linux-libre</a>, an operating system kernel cleaned of all <em>binary blobs</em> containing private firmware, some of them even created by the NSA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selection screen is this one:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/gnu/gnu-guix/02.png" alt="GNU Guix"></p>
<h3>Choosing the Graphical Environment</h3>
<p>During installation, you can also define your <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2021/09/os-7-melhores-frameworks-cpp-para-criar-interface-grafica.html">Desktop Environment</a> or <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2022/05/instale-esse-gerenciador-de-janelas-escrito-em-cpp.html">Window Manager</a>, or even install your own (e.g., KDE Plasma), which is not in the list later, but already on this screen there are options: <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags/#gnome">GNOME</a>, <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2021/12/nixos-um-sistema-operacional-para-programadores.html">XFCE</a>, <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2016/05/como-alterar-o-icone-do-painel.html">MATE</a>, Icewm, <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/2021/11/os-17-melhores-temas-para-seu-openbox.html">Openbox</a>, <a href="https://awesomewm.org/">AwesomeWM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/terroo/i3-radius">i3</a>, <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">Ratpoison</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-exwm/exwm">Emacs EXWM</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/gnu/gnu-guix/03.png" alt="GNU Guix graphical"></p>
<p>After these basic choices, just partition your disk as desired and start the installation process… and then, after the reboot, just choose the system automatically in GRUB:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/gnu/gnu-guix/04.png" alt="GNU Guix multiple screens"></p>
<hr>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To install anything, just use the <code>guix</code> command without <code>sudo</code>. Example, installing <a href="https://terminalroot.com.br/vim">Vim</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">guix install vim
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that GNU Guix offers independent profiles, so <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags#vim">Vim</a> will only be available for your user.</p>
<p>If you want to install globally, add the <code>vim</code> package to the <code>packages</code> section of <code>operating-system</code> in the path: <code>/etc/config.scm</code>, example of inclusion on the <code>append</code> line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(use-modules (gnu))

(operating-system
  ;; ...
  (packages
   (append
    (list vim)
    %base-packages)))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you need to reconfigure to see it: <code>sudo guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then just install with <code>sudo</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo guix install vim
</code></pre>
<p>The package list has everything: <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags#gcc">GNU GCC</a>, <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags#make">GNU Make</a>, <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags#clang">Clang/LLVM</a>, <a href="https://terminalroot.com/tags#cmake">CMake</a>, … For all packages, see:</p>
<h3><a href="https://packages.guix.gnu.org/">https://packages.guix.gnu.org/</a></h3>
<p>Or here: <a href="https://hpc.guix.info/browse">https://hpc.guix.info/browse</a>.</p>

Now you all have seen up close the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; philosophy of Silicon Valley, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Government_Efficiency">DOGE</a>. They do this with investors' money. This was a preview of how they will govern, after Trump, when Silicon Valley is fully running the world. We need to get some tech background in your writing. The history of tech is very much the history of politics as we go forward. We had a merger, and you can and should incorporate our history in your understanding of US history.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: The Post-American Internet (01 Jan 2026)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links The Post-American Internet: My speech from Hamburg's Chaos Communications Congress. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Error code 451; Public email address Mansplaining Lolita; NSA backdoor in Juniper Networks; Don't bug out; Nurses whose shitty boss is a shitty app. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The Post-American Internet (permalink) On December 28th, I delivered a speech entitled &quot;A post-American, enshittification-resistant internet&quot; for 39C3, the 39th Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg, Germany. This is the transcript of that speech. <a href="https://archive.org/download/doctorow-39c3/39c3-1421-eng-A">https://archive.org/download/doctorow-39c3/39c3-1421-eng-A</a>_post-American_enshittification-resistant_internet.mp4 Many of you know that I'm an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation – EFF. I'm about to start my 25th year there. I know that I'm hardly unbiased, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no group anywhere on Earth that does the work of defending our digital rights better than EFF. I'm an activist there, and for the past quarter-century, I've been embroiled in something I call &quot;The War on General Purpose Computing.&quot; If you were at 28C3, 14 years ago, you may have heard me give a talk with that title. Those are the trenches I've been in since my very first day on the job at EFF, when I flew to Los Angeles to crash the inaugural meeting of something called the &quot;Broadcast Protection Discussion Group,&quot; an unholy alliance of tech companies, media companies, broadcasters and cable operators. They'd gathered because this lavishly corrupt American congressman, Billy Tauzin, had promised them a new regulation – a rule banning the manufacture and sale of digital computers, unless they had been backdoored to specifications set by that group, specifications for technical measures to block computers from performing operations that were dispreferred by these companies' shareholders. That rule was called &quot;the Broadcast Flag,&quot; and it actually passed through the American telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. So we sued the FCC in federal court, and overturned the rule. We won that skirmish, but friends, I have bad news, news that will not surprise you. Despite wins like that one, we have been losing the war on the general purpose computer for the past 25 years. Which is why I've come to Hamburg today. Because, after decades of throwing myself against a locked door, the door that leads to a new, good internet, one that delivers both the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 that let our normie friends join the party, that door has been unlocked. Today, it is open a crack. It's open a crack! And here's the weirdest part: Donald Trump is the guy who's unlocked that door. Oh, he didn't do it on purpose! But, thanks to Trump's incontinent belligerence, we are on the cusp of a &quot;Post-American Internet,&quot; a new digital nervous system for the 21st century. An internet that we can build without worrying about America's demands and priorities. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not happy about Trump or his policies. But as my friend Joey DaVilla likes to say &quot;When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla.&quot; The only thing worse than experiencing all the terror that Trump has unleashed on America and the world would be going through all that and not salvaging anything out of the wreckage. That's what I want to talk to you about today: the post-American Internet we can wrest from Trump's chaos. A post-American Internet that is possible because Trump has mobilized new coalition partners to join the fight on our side. In politics, coalitions are everything. Any time you see a group of people suddenly succeeding at a goal they have been failing to achieve, it's a sure bet that they've found some coalition partners, new allies who don't want all the same thing as the original forces, but want enough of the same things to fight on their side. That's where Trump came from: a coalition of billionaires, white nationalists, Christian bigots, authoritarians, conspiratorialists, imperialists, and self-described &quot;libertarians&quot; who've got such a scorching case of low-tax brain worms that they'd vote for Mussolini if he'd promise to lower their taxes by a nickel. And what's got me so excited is that we've got a new coalition in the War on General Purpose Computers: a coalition that includes the digital rights activists who've been on the lines for decades, but also people who want to turn America's Big Tech trillions into billions for their own economy, and national security hawks who are quite rightly worried about digital sovereignty. My thesis here is that this is an unstoppable coalition. Which is good news! For the first time in decades, victory is in our grasp. # So let me explain: 14 years ago, I stood in front of this group and explained the &quot;War on General Purpose Computing.&quot; That was my snappy name for this fight, but the boring name that they use in legislatures for it is &quot;anticircumvention,&quot; Under anticircumvention law, it's a crime to alter the functioning of a digital product or service, unless the manufacturer approves of your modification, and – crucially – this is true whether or not your modification violates any other law. Anticircumvention law originates in the USA: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 establishes a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence and a <span class="math inline">\(500,000 fine for a first offense for bypassing an "access control" for a copyrighted work. So practically speaking, if you design a device or service with even the flimsiest of systems to prevent modification of its application code or firmware, it's a felony – a jailable felony – to modify that code or firmware. It's also a felony to disclose information about how to bypass that access control, which means that pen-testers who even describe how they access a device or system face criminal liability. Under anticircumvention law any manufacturer can trivially turn their product into a no-go zone, criminalizing the act of investigating its defects, criminalizing the act of reporting on its defects, and criminalizing the act of remediating its defects. This is a law that Jay Freeman rightly calls "Felony Contempt of Business Model." Anticircumvention became the law of the land in 1998 when Bill Clinton signed the DMCA. But before you start snickering at those stupid Americans, know this: every other country in the world has passed a law just like this in the years since. Here in the EU, it came in through Article 6 of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive. Now, it makes a certain twisted sense for the US to enact a law like this, after all, they are the world's tech powerhouse, home to the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world. By making it illegal to modify digital products without the manufacturer's permission, America enhances the rent-extracting power of the most valuable companies on US stock exchanges. But why would Europe pass a law like this? Europe is a massive tech importer. By extending legal protection to tech companies that want to steal their users' data and money, the EU was facilitating a one-way transfer of value from Europe to America. So why would Europe do this? Well, let me tell you about the circumstances under which other countries came to enact their anticircumvention laws and maybe you'll spot a pattern that will answer this question. Australia got its anticircumvention law through the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Australia to enact anticircumvention law. Canada and Mexico got it through the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Canada and Mexico to enact anticircumvention laws. Andean nations like Chile got their anticircumvention laws through bilateral US free trade agreements, which oblige them to enact anticircumvention laws. And the Central American nations got their anticircumvention laws through CAFTA – The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the USA – which obliges them to enact anticircumvention laws, too. I assume you've spotted the pattern by now: the US trade representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own people's data and money by American firms. But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people's money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft? Here's an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest's Central European University. And one summer, after I'd lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me. They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they'd received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, "You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they're saying that they won't take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I'm sorry, but we just can't lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we're going to give them anticircumvention. I'm really sorry." That's it. That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash. The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but we've got tariffs now! I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep following their orders. So…Happy Liberation Day? So far, every country in the world has had one of two responses to the Trump tariffs. The first one is: "Give Trump everything he asks for (except Greenland) and hope he stops being mad at you." This has been an absolute failure. Give Trump an inch, he'll take a mile. He'll take fucking Greenland. Capitulation is a failure. But so is the other tactic: retaliatory tariffs. That's what we've done in Canada (like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian). Our top move has been to levy tariffs on the stuff we import from America, making the things we buy more expensive. That's a weird way to punish America! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can, and hoping the downstairs neighbor says "Ouch!" And it's indiscriminate. Why whack some poor farmer from a state that begins and ends with a vowel with tariffs on his soybeans. That guy never did anything bad to Canada. But there's a third possible response to tariffs, one that's just sitting there, begging to be tried: what about repealing anticircumvention law? If you're a technologist or an investor based in a country that's repealed its anticircumvention law, you can go into business making disenshittificatory products that plug into America's defective tech exports, allowing the people who own and use those products to use them in ways that are good for them, even if those uses make the company's shareholders mad. Think of John Deere tractors: when a farmer's John Deere tractor breaks down, they are expected to repair it, swapping in new parts and assemblies to replace whatever's malfing. But the tractor won't recognize that new part and will not start working again, not until the farmer spends a couple hundred bucks on a service callout from an official John Deere tractor repair rep, whose only job is to type an unlock code into the tractor's console, to initialize the part and pair it with the tractor's main computing unit. Modding a tractor to bypass this activation step violates anticircumvention law, meaning farmers all over the world are stuck with this ripoff garbage, because their own government will lock up anyone who makes a tractor mod that disables the parts-pairing check in this American product. So what if Canada repealed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act of 2012 (that's our anticircumvention law)? Well, then a company like Honeybee, which makes tractor front-ends and attachments, could hire some smart University of Waterloo computer science grads, and put 'em to work jailbreaking the John Deere tractor's firmware, and offer it to everyone in the world. They could sell the crack to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method, including that poor American farmer whose soybeans we're currently tariffing. It's hard to convey how much money is on the table here. Take just one example: Apple's App Store. Apple forces all app vendors into using its payment processor, and charges them a 30 percent commission on every euro spent inside of an app. 30 percent! That's such a profitable business that Apple makes \)</span>100 billion per year on it. If the EU repeals Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, some smart geeks in Finland could reverse-engineer Apple's bootloaders and make a hardware dongle that jailbreaks phones so that they can use alternative app stores, and sell the dongle – along with the infrastructure to operate an app store – to anyone in the world who wants to go into business competing with Apple for users and app vendors. Those competitors could offer a 90% discount to every crafter on Etsy, every performer on Patreon, every online news outlet, every game dev, every media store. Offer them a 90% discount on payments, and still make <span class="math inline">\(10b/year. Maybe Finland will never see another Nokia, but Nokia's a tough business to be in. You've got to make hardware, which is expensive and risky. But if the EU legalizes jailbreaking, then Apple would have to incur all the expense and risk of making and fielding hardware, while those Finnish geeks could cream off the \)</span>100b Apple sucks out of the global economy in an act of a disgusting, rip-off rent-seeking. As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: &quot;Your margin is my opportunity.&quot; With these guys, it's always &quot;disruption for thee, but not for me.&quot; When they do it to us, that's progress. When we do it to them, it's piracy, and every pirate wants to be an admiral. Well, screw that. Move fast and break Tim Cook's things. Move fast and break kings! It's funny: I spent 25 years getting my ass kicked by the US Trade Representative (in my defense, it wasn't a fair fight). I developed a kind of grudging admiration for the skill with which the USTR bound the entire world to a system of trade that conferred parochial advantages to America and its tech firms, giving them free rein to loot the world's data and economies. So it's been pretty amazing to watch Trump swiftly and decisively dismantle the global system of trade and destroy the case for the world continuing to arrange its affairs to protect the interests of America's capital class. I mean, it's not a path I would have chosen. I'd have preferred no Trump at all to this breakthrough. But I'll take this massive own-goal if Trump insists. I mean, I'm not saying I've become an accelerationist, but at this point, I'm not exactly not an accelerationist. Now, you might have heard that governments around the world have been trying to get Apple to open its App Store, and they've totally failed at this. When the EU hit Apple with an enforcement order under the Digital Markets Act, Apple responded by offering to allow third party app stores, but it would only allow those stores to sell apps that Apple had approved of. And while those stores could use their own payment processors, Apple would charge them so much in junk fees that it would be more expensive to process a payment using your own system, and if Apple believed that a user's phone had been outside of the EU for 21 days, they'd remotely delete all that user's data and apps. When the EU explained that this would not satisfy the regulation, Apple threatened to pull out of the EU. Then, once everyone had finished laughing, Apple filed more than a dozen bullshit objections to the order hoping to tie this up in court for a decade, the way Google and Meta did for the GDPR. It's not clear that the EU can force Apple to write code that opens up the iOS platform for alternative app stores and payment methods, but there is one thing that the EU can absolutely do with 100% reliability, any time they want: the EU can decide not to let Apple use Europe's courts to shut down European companies that defend European merchants, performers, makers, news outlets, game devs and creative workers, from Apple's ripoff, by jailbreaking phones. All the EU has to do is repeal Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and, in so doing, strip Apple of the privilege of mobilizing the European justice system to shore up Apple's hundred billion dollar annual tax on the world's digital economy. The EU company that figures out how to reliably jailbreak iPhones will have customers all over the world, including in the USA, where Apple doesn't just use its veto over which apps you can run on your phone to suck 30% out of every dollar you spend, but where Apple also uses its control over the platform to strip out apps that protect Apple's customers from Trump's fascist takeover. Back in October, Apple kicked the &quot;ICE Block&quot; app out of the App Store. That's an app that warns the user if there's a snatch squad of masked ICE thugs nearby looking to grab you off the street and send you to an offshore gulag. Apple internally classified ICE kidnappers as a &quot;protected class,&quot; and then declared the ICE Block infringed on the rights of these poor, beset ICE goons. And speaking of ICE thugs, there are plenty of qualified technologists who have fled the US this year, one step ahead of an ICE platoon looking to put them and their children into a camp. Those skilled hackers are now living all over the world, joined by investors who'd like to back a business whose success will be determined by how awesome its products are, and not how many <span class="math inline">\(TRUMP coins they buy. Apple's margin could be their opportunity. Legalizing jailbreaking, raiding the highest margin lines of business of the most profitable companies in America is a much better response to the Trump tariffs than retaliatory tariffs. For one thing, this is a targeted response: go after Big Tech's margins and you're mounting a frontal assault on the businesses whose CEOs each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais. Raiding Big Tech's margins is not an attack on the American people, nor on the small American businesses that are ripped off by Big Tech. It's a raid on the companies that screw everyday Americans and everyone else in the world. It's a way to make everyone in the world richer at the expense of these ripoff companies. It beats the shit out of blowing hundreds of billions of dollars building AI data-centers in the hopes that someday, a sector that's lost nearly a trillion dollars shipping defective chatbots will figure out a use for GPUs that doesn't start hemorrhaging money the minute they plug them in. So here are our new allies in the war on general-purpose computation: businesses and technologists who want to make billions of dollars raiding Big Tech's margins, and policymakers who want their country to be the disenshittification nation – the country that doesn't merely protect its people's money and privacy by buying jailbreaks from other countries, but rather, the country that makes billions of dollars selling that privacy and pocketbook-defending tech to the rest of the world. That's a powerful alliance, but those are not the only allies Trump has pushed into our camp. There's another powerful ally waiting in the wings. Remember last June, when the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, and Trump denounced the ICC, and then the ICC lost its Outlook access, its email archives, its working files, its address books, its calendars? Microsoft says they didn't brick the ICC – that it's a coincidence. But when it comes to a he-said/Clippy-said between the justices of the ICC and the convicted monopolists of Microsoft, I know who I believe. This is exactly the kind of infrastructural risk that we were warned of if we let Chinese companies like Huawei supply our critical telecoms equipment. Virtually every government ministry, every major corporation, every small business and every household in the world have locked themselves into a US-based, cloud-based service. The handful of US Big Tech companies that supply the world's administrative tools are all vulnerable to pressure from the Trump admin, and that means that Trump can brick an entire nation. The attack on the ICC was an act of cyberwarfare, like the Russian hackers who shut down Ukrainian power-generation facilities, except that Microsoft doesn't have to hack Outlook to brick the ICC – they own Outlook. Under the US CLOUD Act of 2018, the US government can compel any US-based company to disclose any of its users' data – including foreign governments – and this is true no matter where that data is stored. Last July, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he "couldn't guarantee" that Microsoft wouldn't hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-center. And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there'd be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it's already happened. It doesn't stop at administrative tools, either: remember back in 2022, when Putin's thugs looted millions of dollars' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine and those tractors showed up in Chechnya? The John Deere company pushed an over-the-air kill signal to those tractors and bricked 'em. John Deere is every bit as politically vulnerable to the Trump admin as Microsoft is, and they can brick most of the tractors in the world, and the tractors they can't brick are probably made by Massey Ferguson, the number-two company in the ag-tech cartel, which is also an American company and just as vulnerable to political attacks from the US government. Now, none of this will be news to global leaders. Even before Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC they were trying to figure out a path to "digital sovereignty." But the Trump administration's outrageous conduct and rhetoric over past 11 months has turned "digital sovereignty" from a nice-to-have into a must-have. So finally, we're seeing some movement, like "Eurostack," a project to clone the functionality of US Big Tech silos in free/open source software, and to build EU-based data-centers that this code can run on. But Eurostack is heading for a crisis. It's great to build open, locally hosted, auditable, trustworthy services that replicate the useful features of Big Tech, but you also need to build the adversarial interoperability tools that allow for mass exporting of millions of documents, the sensitive data-structures and edit histories. We need scrapers and headless browsers to accomplish the adversarial interoperability that will guarantee ongoing connectivity to institutions that are still hosted on US cloud-based services, because US companies are not going to facilitate the mass exodus of international customers from their platform. Just think of how Apple responded to the relatively minor demand to open up the iOS App Store, and now imagine the thermonuclear foot-dragging, tantrum-throwing and malicious compliance they'll come up with when faced with the departure of a plurality of the businesses and governments in a 27-nation bloc of 500,000,000 affluent consumers. Any serious attempt at digital sovereignty needs migration tools that work without the cooperation of the Big Tech companies. Otherwise, this is like building housing for East Germans and locating it in West Berlin. It doesn't matter how great the housing is, your intended audience is going to really struggle to move in unless you tear down the wall. Step one of tearing down that wall is killing anticircumvention law, so that we can run virtual devices that can be scripted, break bootloaders to swap out firmware and generally seize the means of computation. So this is the third bloc in the disenshittification army: not just digital rights hippies like me; not just entrepreneurs and economic development wonks rubbing their hands together at the thought of transforming American trillions into European billions; but also the national security hawks who are 100% justified in their extreme concern about their country's reliance on American platforms that have been shown to be totally unreliable. This is how we'll get a post-American internet: with an unstoppable coalition of activists, entrepreneurs and natsec hawks. This has been a long time coming. Since the post-war settlement, the world has treated the US as a neutral platform, a trustworthy and stable maintainer of critical systems for global interchange, what the political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman call the "Underground Empire." But over the past 15 years, the US has systematically shattered global trust in its institutions, a process that only accelerated under Trump. Take transoceanic fiber optic cables: the way the transoceanic fiber routes were planned, the majority of these cables make landfall on the coasts of the USA where the interconnections are handled. There's a good case for this hub-and-spoke network topology, especially compared to establishing direct links between every country. That's an Order(N^2) problem: directly linking each of the planet Earth's 205 countries to every other country would require 20,910 fiber links. But putting all the world's telecoms eggs in America's basket only works if the US doesn't take advantage of its centrality, and while many people worried about what the US could do with the head-ends of the world's global fiber infra, it wasn't until Mark Klein's 2006 revelations about the NSA's nation-scale fiber optic taps in AT&T's network, and Ed Snowden's 2013 documents showing the global scale of this wiretapping, that the world had to confront the undeniable reality that the US could not be trusted to serve as the world's fiber hub. It's not just fiber. The world does business in dollars. Most countries maintain dollar accounts at the Fed in New York as their major source of foreign reserves. But in 2005, American vulture capitalists bought up billions of dollars worth of Argentinian government bonds after the sovereign nation of Argentina had declared bankruptcy. They convinced a judge in New York to turn over the government of Argentina's US assets to them to make good on loans that these debt collectors had not issued, but had bought up at pennies on the dollar. At that moment, every government in the world had to confront the reality that they could not trust the US Federal Reserve with their foreign reserves. But what else could they use? Without a clear answer, dollar dominance continued, but then, under Biden, Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian firms lost access to the SWIFT system for dollar clearing. This is when goods – like oil – are priced in dollars, so that buyers only need to find someone who will trade their own currency for dollars, which they can then swap for any commodity in the world. Again, there's a sound case for dollar clearing: it's just not practical to establish deep, liquid pairwise trading market for all of the world's nearly 200 currencies, it's another O(N^2) problem. But it only works if the dollar is a neutral platform. Once the dollar becomes an instrument of US foreign policy – whether or not you agree with that policy – it's no longer a neutral platform, and the world goes looking for an alternative. No one knows what that alternative's going to be, just as no one knows what configuration the world's fiber links will end up taking. There's kilometers of fiber being stretched across the ocean floor, and countries are trying out some pretty improbable gambits as dollar alternatives, like Ethiopia revaluing its sovereign debt in Chinese renminbi. Without a clear alternative to America's enshittified platforms, the post-American century is off to a rocky start. But there's one post-American system that's easy to imagine. The project to rip out all the cloud connected, backdoored, untrustworthy black boxes that power our institutions, our medical implants, our vehicles and our tractors; and replace it with collectively maintained, open, free, trustworthy, auditable code. This project is the only one that benefits from economies of scale, rather than being paralyzed by exponential crises of scale. That's because any open, free tool adopted by any public institution – like the Eurostack services – can be audited, localized, pen-tested, debugged and improved by institutions in every other country. It's a commons, more like a science than a technology, in that it is universal and international and collaborative. We don't have dueling western and Chinese principles of structural engineering. Rather, we have universal principles for making sure buildings don't fall down, adapted to local circumstances. We wouldn't tolerate secrecy in the calculations used to keep our buildings upright, and we shouldn't tolerate opacity in the software that keeps our tractors, hearing aids, ventilators, pacemakers, trains, games consoles, phones, CCTVs, door locks, and government ministries working. The thing is, software is not an asset, it's a liability. The capabilities that running software delivers – automation, production, analysis and administration – those are assets. But the software itself? That's a liability. Brittle, fragile, forever breaking down as the software upstream of it, downstream of it, and adjacent to it is updated or swapped out, revealing defects and deficiencies in systems that may have performed well for years. Shifting software to commons-based production is a way to reduce the liability that software imposes on its makers and users, balancing out that liability among many players. Now, obviously, tech bosses are totally clueless when it comes to this. They really do think that software is an asset. That's why they're so fucking horny to have chatbots shit out software at superhuman speeds. That's why they think it's good that they've got a chatbot that "produces a thousand times more code than a human programmer." Producing code that isn't designed for legibility and maintainability, that is optimized, rather, for speed of production, is a way to incur tech debt at scale. This is a neat encapsulation of the whole AI story: the chatbot can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a chatbot that can't do your job. Your boss is an easy mark for that chatbot hustler because your boss hates you. In their secret hearts, bosses understand that if they stopped coming to work, the business would run along just fine, but if the workers stopped showing up, the company would grind to a halt. Bosses like to tell themselves that they're in the driver's seat, but really, they fear that they're strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. It's the realization of the fantasy of a company without workers. When I was walking the picket line in Hollywood during the writer's strike, a writer told me that you prompt an AI the same way a studio boss gives shitty notes to a writer's room: "Make me ET, but make it about a dog, and give it a love interest, and a car-chase in the third act." Say that to a writer's room and they will call you a fucking idiot suit and tell you "Why don't you go back to your office and make a spreadsheet, you nitwit. The grownups here are writing a movie." Meanwhile, if you give that prompt to a chatbot, it will cheerfully shit out a script exactly to spec. The fact that this script will be terrible and unusable is less important than the prospect of a working life in which no one calls you a fucking idiot suit. AI dangles the promise of a writer's room without writers, a movie without actors, a hospital without nurses, a coding shop without coders. When Mark Zuckerberg went on a podcast and announced that the average American had three friends, but wanted 15 friends, and that he could solve this by giving us chatbots instead of friends, we all dunked on him as an out-of-touch billionaire Martian who didn't understand the nature of friendship. But the reality is that for Zuck, your friends are a problem. Your friends' interactions with you determine how much time you spend on his platforms, and thus how many revenue-generating ads he can show you. Your friends stubbornly refuse to organize their relationship with you in a way that maximizes the return to his shareholders. So Zuck is over there in Menlo Park, furiously fantasizing about replacing your friends with chatbots, because that way, he can finally realize the dream of a social media service without any socializing. Rich, powerful people are, at root, solipsists. The only way to amass a billion dollars is to inflict misery and privation on whole populations. The only way to look yourself in the mirror after you've done that, is to convince yourself that those people don't matter, that, in some important sense, they aren't real. Think of Elon Musk calling everyone who disagrees with him an "NPC,” or all those "Effective Altruists," who claimed the moral high ground by claiming to care about 53 trillion imaginary artificial humans who will come into existence in 10,000 years at the expense of extending moral consideration to people alive today. Or think of how Trump fired all the US government scientists, and then announced the "Genesis" program, declaring that the US would begin generating annual "moonshot"-scale breakthroughs, with a chatbot. It's science without scientists. Chatbots can't really do science, but from Trump's perspective, they're still better than scientists, because a chatbot won't ever tell him not to stare at an eclipse, or not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't ever tell him that trans people exist, or that the climate emergency is real. Powerful people are suckers for AI, because AI fuels the fantasy of a world without people: just a boss and a computer, and no ego-shattering confrontations with people who know how to do things telling you "no." AI is a way to produce tech debt at scale, to replace skilled writers with defective spicy autocomplete systems, to lose money at a rate not seen in living memory. Now, compare that with the project of building a post-American internet: a project to reduce tech debt, to unlock America's monopoly trillions and divide them among the world's entrepreneurs (for whom they represent untold profits), and the world's technology users (for whom they represent untold savings); all while building resiliency and sovereignty. Now, some of you are probably feeling pretty cynical about this right now. After all, your political leaders have demonstrated decades of ineffectual and incompetent deference to the US, and an inability to act, even when the need was dire. If your leaders couldn't act decisively on the climate emergency, what hope do we have of them taking this moment seriously? But crises precipitate change. Remember when another mad emperor – Vladimir Putin – invaded Ukraine, and Europe experienced a dire energy shortage? In three short years, the continent's solar uptake skyrocketed. The EU went from being 15 years behind in its energy transition, to ten years ahead of schedule. Because when you're shivering in the dark, a lot of fights you didn't think were worth it are suddenly existential battles you can't afford to lose. Sure, no one wants to argue with a tedious neighbor who has an aesthetic temper tantrum at the thought of a solar panel hanging from their neighbor's balcony. But when it's winter, and there's no Russian gas, and you're shivering in the dark, then that person can take their aesthetic objection to balcony solar, fold it until it's all corners, and shove it right up their ass. Besides, we don't need Europe to lead the charge on a post-American internet by repealing anticircumvention. Any country could do it! And the country that gets there first gets to reap the profits from supplying jailbreaking tools to the rest of the world, it gets to be the Disenshittification Nation, and everyone else in the world gets to buy those tools and defend themselves from US tech companies' monetary and privacy plunder. Just one country has to break the consensus, and the case for every country doing so is the strongest it's ever been. It used to be that countries that depended on USAID had to worry about losing food, medical and cash supports if they pissed off America. But Trump killed USAID, so now that's a dead letter. Meanwhile, America's status as the planet's most voracious consumer has been gutted by decades of anti-worker, pro-billionaire policies. Today, the US is in the grips of its third consecutive "K-shaped" recovery, that's an economic rally where the rich get richer, and everyone else gets poorer. For a generation, America papered over that growing inequality with easy credit, with everyday Americans funding their consumption with credit cards and second and third mortgages. So long as they could all afford to keep buying, other countries had to care about America as an export market. But a generation of extraction has left the bottom 90% of Americans struggling to buy groceries and other necessities, carrying crushing debt from skyrocketing shelter, education and medical expenses that they can't hope to pay down, thanks to 50 years of wage stagnation. The Trump administration has sided firmly with debt collectors, price gougers, and rent extractors. Trump neutered enforcement against rent-fixing platforms like Realpage, restarted debt payments for eight million student borrowers, and killed a plan to make live-saving drugs a little cheaper, leaving Americans to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world. Every dollar spent servicing a loan is a dollar that can't go to consumption. And as more and more Americans slip into poverty, the US is gutting programs that spend money on the public's behalf, like SNAP, the food stamps program that helps an ever-larger slice of the American public stave off hunger. America is chasing the "world without people" dream, where working people have nothing, spend nothing, and turn every penny over to rentiers who promptly flush that money into the stock market, shitcoins, or gambling sites. But I repeat myself. Even the US military – long a sacrosanct institution – is being kneecapped to enrich rent-seekers. Congress just killed a military "right to repair" law. So now, US soldiers stationed abroad will have to continue the Pentagon's proud tradition of shipping materiel from generators to jeeps back to America to be fixed by their manufacturers at a 10,000% markup, because the Pentagon routinely signs maintenance contracts that prohibit it from teaching a Marine how to fix an engine. The post-American world is really coming on fast. As we repeal our anticircumvention laws, we don't have to care what America thinks, we don't have to care about their tariffs, because they're already whacking us with tariffs; and because the only people left in the US who can afford to buy things are rich people, who just don't buy enough stuff. There's only so many Lambos and Sub-Zeros even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own. But what if European firms want to go on taking advantage of anticircumvention laws? Well, there's good news there, too. "Good news," because the EU firms that rely on anticircumvention are engaged in the sleaziest, most disgusting frauds imaginable. Anticircumvention law is the reason that Volkswagen could get away with Dieselgate. By imposing legal liability on reverse-engineers who might have discovered this lethal crime, Article 6 of the Copyright Directive created a chilling effect, and thousands of Europeans died, every year. Today, Germany's storied automakers are carrying on the tradition of Dieselgate, sabotaging their cars to extract rent from drivers. From Mercedes, which rents you the accelerator pedal in your luxury car, only unlocking the full acceleration curve of your engine if you buy a monthly subscription; to BMW, which rents you the automated system that automatically dims your high-beams if there's oncoming traffic. Legalize jailbreaking and any mechanic in Europe could unlock those subscription features for one price, and not share any of that money with BMW and Mercedes. Then there's Medtronic, a company that pretends it is Irish. Medtronic is the world's largest med-tech company, having purchased all their competitors, and then undertaken the largest "tax-inversion" in history, selling themselves to a tiny Irish firm, in order to magick their profits into a state of untaxable grace, floating in the Irish Sea. Medtronic supplies the world's most widely used ventilators, and it booby-traps them the same way John Deere booby-traps its tractors. After a hospital technician puts a new part in a Medtronic ventilator, the ventilator's central computing unit refuses to recognize the part until it completes a cryptographic handshake, proving that an authorized Medtronic technician was paid hundreds of euros to certify a repair that the hospital's own technician probably performed. It's just a way to suck hundreds of euros out of hospitals every time a ventilator breaks. This would be bad enough, but during the covid lockdowns, when every ventilator was desperately needed, and when the planes stopped flying, there was no way for a Medtronic tech to come and bless the hospital technicians' repairs. This was lethal. It killed people. There's one more European company that relies on anticircumvention that I want to discuss here, because they're old friends of CCC: that's the Polish train company Newag. Newag sabotages its own locomotives, booby-trapping them so that if they sense they have been taken to a rival's service yard, the train bricks itself. When the train operator calls Newag about this mysterious problem, the company "helpfully" remotes into the locomotive's computers, to perform "diagnostics," which is just sending a unbricking command to the vehicle, a service for which they charge 20,000 euros. Last year, Polish hackers from the security research firm Dragon Sector presented on their research into this disgusting racket in this very hall, and now, they're being sued by Newag under anticircumvention law, for making absolutely true disclosures about Newag's deliberately defective products. So these are the European stakeholders for anticircumvention law: the Dieselgate killers, the car companies who want to rent you your high-beams and accelerator, the med-tech giant that bricked all the ventilators during the pandemic, and the company that tied Poland to the train-tracks. I relish the opportunity to fight these bastards in Brussels, as they show up and cry "Won't someone think of the train saboteurs?" The enshittification of technology – the decay of the platforms and systems we rely on – has many causes: the collapse of competition, regulatory capture, the smashing of tech workers' power. But most of all, enshittification is the result of anticircumvention law's ban on interoperability. By blocking interop, by declaring war on the general-purpose computer, our policy-makers created an enshittogenic environment that rewarded companies for being shitty, and ushered in the enshittocene, in which everything is turning to shit. Let's call time on enshittification. Let's seize the means of computation. Let's build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on. Let's end the era of silos. I mean, isn't it fucking weird how you have to care which network someone is using if you want to talk to them? Instead of just deciding who you want to talk to? The fact that you have to figure out whether the discussion you're trying to join is on Twitter or Bluesky, Mastodon or Instagram – that is just the most Prodigy/AOL/Compuserve-ass way of running a digital world. I mean, 1990 called and they want their walled gardens back Powerful allies are joining our side in the War on General Purpose Computation. It's not just people like us, who've been fighting for this whole goddamned century, but also countries that want to convert American tech's hoarded trillions into fuel for a single-use rocket that boosts their own tech sector into a stable orbit. It's national security hawks who are worried about Trump bricking their ministries or their tractors, and who are also worried – with just cause – about Xi Jinping bricking all their solar inverters and batteries. Because, after all, the post-American internet is also a post-Chinese internet! Nothing should be designed to be field updatable without the user's permission. Nothing critical should be a black box. Like I said at the start of this talk, I have been doing this work for 24 years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, throwing myself at a door that was double-locked and deadbolted, and now that door is open a crack and goddammit, I am hopeful. Not optimistic. Fuck optimism! Optimism is the idea that things will get better no matter what we do. I know that what we do matters. Hope is the belief that if we can improve things, even in small ways, we can ascend the gradient toward the world we want, and attain higher vantage points from which new courses of action, invisible to us here at our lower elevation, will be revealed. Hope is a discipline. It requires that you not give in to despair. So I'm here to tell you: don't despair. All this decade, all over the world, countries have taken up arms against concentrated corporate power. We've had big, muscular antitrust attacks on big corporations in the US (under Trump I and Biden); in Canada; in the UK; in the EU and member states like Germany, France and Spain; in Australia; in Japan and South Korea and Singapore; in Brazil; and in China. This is a near-miraculous turn of affairs. All over the world, governments are declaring war on monopolies, the source of billionaires' wealth and power. Even the most forceful wind is invisible. We can only see it by its effects. What we're seeing here is that whenever a politician bent on curbing corporate power unfurls a sail, no matter where in the world that politician is, that sail fills with wind and propels the policy in ways that haven't been seen in generations. The long becalming of the fight over corporate power has ended, and a fierce, unstoppable wind is blowing. It's not just blowing in Europe, or in Canada, or in South Korea, Japan, China, Australia or Brazil. It's blowing in America, too. Never forget that as screwed up and terrifying as things are in America, the country has experienced, and continues to experience, a tsunami of antitrust bills and enforcement actions at the local, state and federal level. And never forget that the post-American internet will be good for Americans. Because, in a K-shaped, bifurcated, unequal America, the trillions that American companies loot from the world don't trickle down to Americans. The average American holds a portfolio of assets that rounds to zero, and that includes stock in US tech companies. The average American isn't a shareholder in Big Tech, the average American is a victim of Big Tech. Liberating the world from US Big Tech is also liberating America from US Big Tech. That's been EFF's mission for 35 years. It's been my mission at EFF for 25 years. If you want to get involved in this fight – and I hope you do – it can be your mission, too. You can join EFF, and you can join groups in your own country, like Netzpolitik here in Germany, or the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, or La Quadrature du Net in France, or the Open Rights Group in the UK, or EF Finland, or ISOC Bulgaria, XNet, DFRI, Quintessenz, Bits of Freedom, Openmedia, FSFE, or any of dozens of organizations around the world. The door is open a crack, the wind is blowing, the post-American internet is upon us: a new, good internet that delivers all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 so that our normie friends can use it, too. And I can't wait for all of us to get to hang out there. It's gonna be great.

      <h1>Bye 2025</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Honestly, 2025 has been a doozy and I’ll be glad to have it in the rearview. My year was personally very eventful, and that’s excluding everything that happened in the world. I’m still processing a lot of it, but here’s a summary in roughly chronological order, using Roman numerals for added drama:</p>
<h1>I. Cancer scare #1 (fake)</h1>
<p>In early Feb I had my first screening mammogram ever, in accordance with the guidelines of most major authoritative health organizations which recommend starting screening at age 40 in people with average risk for breast cancer. In my head I was thinking of it as a box to check, a way to briefly remind myself that I was still in middle age but you know, I still got it 💃🏻, and that I was a good, compliant patient with all screenings up to date. I was most apprehensive about my boobs being squished, and even that was maybe a 3/10 on the anxiety scale.</p>
<p>The initial result said my breasts were extremely dense (thanks), so I was recommended for a repeat study, which I scheduled because I am a good, compliant patient. When the radiologist came into the room to deliver the result verbally to my face, I knew it wasn’t going to be that I have fantastic A+ breasts. She said there was <em><strong>something suspicious</strong></em> and that the next step would be a biopsy.</p>
<p>From the intervening time between when she told me I needed a biopsy, to when I actually got the biopsy about a week later, and when I received the result verbally over the phone a few days after <em>that</em> that it was negative, I went through a whole personal cancer journey in my head, like a movie, thinking about how my life would be different if I had cancer. I cried twice. I talked to my mom and my sister and my partner a lot. I ate two hot dogs for lunch even though I rarely eat hot dogs because (1) I love hot dogs and (2) everyone knows hot dogs cause cancer so I figured if I already had cancer then I might as well eat some hot dogs.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got the call that it was negative, and it was definitely a relief that I didn’t have cancer (YET – my dense breasts are basically just better at hiding things, <em>and</em> studies seem to suggest that the density of the breasts itself is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. Great!), and I kind of filed the whole thing away in my head as something not to worry about until my next mammogram.</p>
<h1>II. Cancer scare #2 (fake-ish)</h1>
<p>Around the same time, though, my Pap smear also came back with <em><strong>something suspicious</strong></em>. As a small-ish Asian woman I have a specific type of privilege where I am rarely suspected of anything, so to be found suspicious for two somethings in a matter of days was unexpected, to say the least (it was my cells that were suspicious, not me… but who am I if not my cells?). Long story short, that one required a cervical biopsy, which was extremely uncomfortable (and also more unexpectedly expensive than was communicated to me which was annoying), and in the end it basically confirmed that it was suspicious, but not requiring any immediate action and is something that can be surveilled. So essentially my body is low grade threatening to kill me, but verbally, from across the room, and not moving very quickly or otherwise indicating that it’s particularly serious about it. So I also filed that away as a thing not to worry about until it was something to worry about (and to appreciate having had a good time in my 20s and 30s as an unattached woman in the big city 🤷).</p>
<h1>III. Cancer</h1>
<p>In May, my mom texted me that she also was found to have dense breasts on her screening mammogram and needed a repeat study. We kind of laughed about it together, and I reassured her that it was probably nothing, just like mine, we’re just a coupla broads with dense breasts. However, when hers came back suspicious, it was a different kind of suspicious. Mine was suspicious as in “ehhh you’re supposed to get a biopsy but there’s a pretty good chance it’ll be negative because it’s kind of hard to see what we’re looking at” and hers was “you need a biopsy because we see enough of what we need to see and it’s not good, and we just need to confirm what we already know so we can start treating the not-good thing.”</p>
<p>I flew out to California to be with my mom when she got her biopsy despite her insisting I don’t because when I had my biopsy she said she wished she could be there with me and sometimes when people say things like that it’s what they actually would want for themselves. (Why couldn’t we just be direct with each other? Because we’re Korean. More specifically, because 눈치.) I bought a one-way ticket and made the cross country trip, which would be the first of five times I would be in California before the end of the year (☁️ <em>foreshadowing</em> ☁️), hung out for a few days, and went with her for the procedure.</p>
<p>I don’t believe in fate or a higher power or anything, but I was thankful that the timing was such that I had just been through something very similar and could help talk her through it. Having medical knowledge and a higher than average ability to navigate the American healthcare system was also helpful, but honestly I was just trying to be there for my mom as a daughter. The only thing I really did differently as a person with a medical background (including having operated on and treated dozens of people with breast cancer) vs just being her kid was to just be much more direct that it was almost certainly cancer even before the formal results came back, to help prepare her mentally for the journey ahead. I was aware of that journey clinically but not as a family member or otherwise personally, but I did know that knowing more and understanding what the hell is happening to your body and what to expect tends to be helpful.</p>
<p>As expected, my mom’s biopsy came back positive for cancer. She got the call on Friday the 13th and my dad and I were at her side when the call came. After she hung up the phone, I gave her a big hug and asked her how she was feeling. She said she felt prepared and accepted it, but also got a little teary and asked (rhetorically) “Why is this happening to me?”, which I thought was a response that really reflected who she is and who I want to be (strong, ready to take on anything, but also vulnerable and honest).</p>
<h1>IV. The accident</h1>
<p>Exactly three days after receiving the biopsy results and starting to make tactical plans like finding a surgeon and booking a consultation, we thought it would be nice to go to the beach to decompress a bit. We were on Highway 1 going northbound, making a turn to find parking for the beach when the passenger side of the car was struck by a car coming southbound. I saw it coming toward us and the impact itself felt like an eternity (later when I saw the diagram of the crash on the police report, I understood why, because we were dragged across three lanes of traffic and stopped when we hit a traffic box). Everything went bright white and I assumed I was dying, although turns out it was the airbags deploying, and rear airbags look like a curtain, which I never knew until that moment. Someone was screaming and it took a beat for me to realize it was me. The immediate aftermath was a haze; I had had the wind knocked out of me so I couldn’t breathe or talk but my mom kept asking if Rachel was ok, which broke my fucking heart because I just kept thinking that out of all of us, she really didn’t need this, and I was trying my best to force the air out of my lungs through my vocal cords to try and say “I’m ok” because I thought she had enough to worry about, and I didn’t want her to worry about me.</p>
<p>We were transported to the hospital in three separate ambulances. I was brought as a trauma activation because I had a seatbelt sign. I remember being in the ambulance looking out the rear window and seeing that all the cars had moved out of the way and thinking “huh, isn’t that nice.” I remember being rolled into trauma bay and similarly people had moved out of the way and were staring at me, and I remember thinking “am I supposed to say hi to them?” I think that was when I knew I was probably fine (also when the paramedic presented me to the trauma team as a “paperwork trauma” lol) even though I was crying (but mostly out of shock and worrying about my mom as opposed to pain).</p>
<p>I was cleared of anything major pretty quickly (pro tip for expediting an ER visit – come in as a trauma), probably within 40 minutes or so. Most importantly, my mom walked away with bruises and not much else even though the impact was on her side and she had to be extricated because the passenger door was crushed. My dad was also fine, thankfully. I fractured a small bone in my lower back and had a lot of contusions but was also otherwise okay physically. I had a morbid thought that if there was a certain quota of injuries that had to happen from that accident, I’m glad I got all of them and that my mom especially was mostly unscathed.</p>
<h1>V. Mom</h1>
<p>About a month later, my mom underwent surgery and I took a leave of absence from work to take care of her. I had found her a good surgeon who had incredible bedside manner and genuinely seemed to care about her patients (the initial consultation was two hours and she explained literally everything about what was going on and what to expect). Again, I don’t believe in a higher power, but by sheer coincidence this surgeon went to the same random middle school in Illinois that I went to and also grew up where I did, which I feel was some kind of sign. My mom was and is amazing and resilient, and everything went as smoothly as it possibly could have. I made her Korean soup after the surgery and she said it tasted so good which was probably my proudest moment this year (a close second was when my friend Steve’s orange foster cat Rigby chose <em><strong>my</strong></em> lap to sit in at their house after dinner).</p>
<p>There is a very unique vulnerability to taking care of a sick parent as an adult person. You’re my mom, you’re not allowed to get sick or old or die. This is the person who raised me and made me who I am. I still can’t fully process and am dreading the day when I can’t just pick up the phone and talk to her whenever I want because it no longer feels theoretical. At the same time I won’t be that surprised if she lives another 20-30 years because she is incredibly active and (other than cancer) full of life and values health and well connected to her community. It’s the way I want to live.</p>
<h1>VI. Getting bipped</h1>
<p>By September I had had enough life lessons for the year. Of course, life (or that higher power I definitely still don’t believe in) had other ideas. I took a short vacation with my partner and on day 1 our rental car was broken into and all our belongings stolen. Yes, it was in the Bay Area, yes, it was a smash and grab, yes, I knew it was a risk, no, our stuff wasn’t visible, no, it wasn’t a “bad neighborhood” (whatever that means to you). I quickly learned to follow up sharing this story with those explanatory commas because there is a weird form of victim blaming that happens whenever I tell it. I don’t believe it’s intentional or personal but it seemed almost instinctual that people would immediately ask for those details. It makes me really sad that people just seem resigned to it. Not to make this a west coast vs east coast thing and unfairly lump large heterogeneous groups of people into a single stereotype, but the reaction from laid back Californians (lol) was “oh, that sucks, but this is really common here, hope you had insurance!” and the reaction from my people back home was “what the fuck!!! are you ok?! that’s so messed up. what can we help with?” I think I’d prefer the New York response every time.</p>
<p>To be honest, this is the kind of thing that would have REALLY bugged me in the past, like upended my life and become some kind of defining story about my attitude towards humanity, but in context of everything else that happened this year, when I saw the smashed-up window, I was just kind of like, oh well – at least we’re safe. Then I immediately went into problem solving mode. We switched out the rental car within an hour, were able to replace most of the valuables like electronics, and it basically ended up being a minor inconvenience, considering the grand arc of life. I didn’t care as much about the things that were replaceable, even my laptop and AirPods and stuff; I was more upset about the belongings that were meaningful to me and irreplaceable but had no street value, like my journal (have fun reading about all my stupid anxieties, thief!!) and the SD card in my camera (that had photos from my time with my parents the month prior that I hadn’t gotten to back up yet). I was also just really disappointed that it happened at all.</p>
<h1>VII. Epilogue / gratitude</h1>
<p>Despite all of the above, the most overwhelming feeling I have had this year is gratitude. I’m thankful that none of this was any worse than it was, because it could have been so much worse in so many ways. In my life I have noticed that whenever there is some acute event (like a literal crash), there’s the event itself, and then there’s the blast radius — the chains of events that it sets off, some of which linger much longer than expected. At the time of impact (the car crashing into yours on Coast Highway, the call that the biopsy is positive for cancer, the realization that the rental car window has been smashed) you’re not thinking about the aftereffects; you’re locked in in the moment. Weirdly, from the time I was riding in the ambulance after the car accident and being worked up in the trauma bay, I had a realization that I was feeling something that I hadn’t felt in a long time (not pain from the accident). It was the feeling of being fully, entirely present in the moment. For that hour or so, nothing was more important than making sure I wasn’t secretly bleeding out inside. I couldn’t check my phone or move or do anything except… be there.</p>
<p>Having had time to reflect, I’m so aware of all the privileges and resources I have that softened the literal blows. Access to medical care, insurance coverage, the ability to navigate the healthcare system – these are extremely basic things that should be universal benefits, that I have because I have a good job (and also just happened to have worked in the healthcare system), and I have a good job because I have had a lot of support and opportunities in life, and I have a lot of support and opportunities in life because of sheer dumb luck. I feel so grateful but also sad, that these things are considered privileges and not rights.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for many unexpected moments of warmth from strangers that reminded me of something that is hard to believe sometimes but that I do believe, which is that most humans are good and do care about each other. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I was getting my breast biopsy, I audibly gasped when the lidocaine needle went in (ironically the numbing was the most painful part), and the radiology tech, who had otherwise been kind of aloof, kindly looked right into my eyes and asked in the gentlest and most serious tone if I wanted to hold her hand, and I was like “yeah 😭😭” and squeezed the hell out of it for the entire procedure. That really meant a lot to me.</li>
<li>I have complicated feelings about hospitals and healthcare institutions, but my mom’s surgeon and pretty much all of the staff we encountered were so kind and empathetic and really helped make her feel at ease during a stressful time. The nurse in the surgery center gave very clear and detailed instructions about what to expect and when, down to when we were in the waiting room and she had briefed us about which door would open with the next nurse who would call us in. Those details seem so insignificant individually but when you’re that vulnerable and in an unfamiliar environment with strangers, even something like knowing which door is going to open and then seeing that door open does something to calm your brain and I was so grateful for that for my mom.</li>
<li>In the immediate aftermath of the bipping, I was kind of in a daze driving the busted car back to the rental car lot, and I was not really expecting a lot of sympathy based on my previous experiences with the rental car company and a general cynicism about people, but there was a sweet angel employee checking the car back in for an exchange, when I told her what had happened, she said “oh man” and looked genuinely sorry (and said so), which was such a simple thing to say but felt so kind in the moment. Then, when my partner who for whatever reason was having an uncharacteristic streak of vigilante justice, mentioned that the bippers had bipped my AirPods and therefore I could track their location via Find My and attempt to… confront them, I guess? (I genuinely just wanted the journal and the SD card with photos)… I asked her what she would do if she were in my shoes, and she looked around, leaned into the car to talk to me directly and said, “As an employee of [rental car company], I’d say you shouldn’t go after them. <em>(long pause)</em> But if were just me, I’d hunt them down, cuz I’m a crazy bitch.” I really appreciated that.</li>
<li>About a month after the bipping, my partner got a call from a Bay Area number. It was a man named Gary who was walking his dog and stumbled upon a suitcase label some distance from a suitcase with a bunch of clothes in it. Gary took the suitcase and its contents, ran all the clothes through the laundry, and called the number on the label. He ended up shipping everything to us and was generally just very sweet and apologetic even though obviously none of it was his fault and in fact he really turned the whole experience around, not because the stuff was so irreplaceable or anything, but it kind of restored my faith in humanity. He didn’t have to do any of that but he did.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that’s pretty much it. I’m over 2025. I don’t have any goals or resolutions for 2026. This sounds really corny, but I truly just want to be fully present, and ideally without requiring a motor vehicle collision to feel it. I want to be the kind stranger in a moment of vulnerability for someone else. I want to hang out with my mom and my family. If I can just keep this train on the track and live healthy I’ll consider 2026 a success. Thanks for reading.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)

      <p>Was Richard Wagner a revolutionary artist who reshaped music forever, or an egotists mired in scandal, whose dangerous ideas were inseparable from the operas he created? How did the legendary worlds encapsulated in his bombastic music – featuring gods, heroes, and monsters – become entangled with politics and power? And, did Wagner inspire Hitler and […]</p>

      <h1>The state of affairs (2025)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>As much as most of this year has been quite regrettable, my writing has been pretty successful. My main gripe going into 2025 was that my writing lacked unity and that I didn't really have a clear voice, and while I still write about quite a wide range of topics I think I'm starting to develop the outlines of a voice and a general thrust for my writing. The fact that my blog currently features both content marketing stuff and long-form essays is a little odd: I don't mind it exactly, but I'm considering mirroring some of the more marketing-oriented stuff on a website with nothing *but* that so that people who wish to work with me can be funnelled to the correct place more effectively. But I don't know...</p>
