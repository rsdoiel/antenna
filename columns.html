2024-06-27 Keep your own archives
</h1>
<p>
In these days of copyright maximalism I often think of all the fragments
by ancient authors that we only know because they were quoted
extensively by others.
</p>
<p>
We should not expect the web to stay up, the links to stay fresh, the
posts to remain available. No, it‚Äôs entropy all the way: technology
comes and goes, servers come and go, pages are written and get deleted,
people are born and die, and everything they ever built is pulled down
as capitalism keeps eating us and our works.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs my wish: link if you can but quote extensively and fight
copyright maximalism. Save our culture! Some of our works might survive
into the far future and the quotes they bear are the life boats of our
thoughts.
</p>
<p>
I still need to get into the habit of archiving web posts I like. I‚Äôm
very unhappy about that. I started saving all the PDFs I liked, read,
skimmed or intended to read, just in case I need find them again. It‚Äôs a
start, but not enough.
</p>
<p>
It hurts my brain that Sophocles was so prolific, so famous, so beloved
‚Äì and we got seven plays out of a hundred and twenty. üò≠ And that‚Äôs one
of the authors with complete plays available. All pre-Socratic
philosophy relies on testimonia. üò≠ üò≠

This message is brought to you not only by the film studios cancelling
shows they already produced in order to save on taxes, nor by studios
dumping TV archives, nor by search engines letting the USENET archive
deteriorate, nor by the copyright owners eager to prey on any that would
restore old movies that are rotting away due to age, hoping to leech any
value somebody else might create, nor by thoughts of a generation of
people entrusting their culture to the Internet where companies fail and
servers die and nothing of value survives the coming apocalypse.
No.¬†It‚Äôs because the artifacts of our lives and our culture are no
longer made of clay and stone to last for a thousand years, nor paper or
wood to last for centuries, and we‚Äôve handed them over to corporations
that don‚Äôt care. All they care for is profit.
</p>
<p>
We need to take back what we can.
</p>
<p>
We need to keep our own archives.

<p>Today President Joe Biden pardoned more than 2000 former military
personnel who had been convicted of engaging in consensual sex under a
gay sex ban in the military that has since been repealed. People covered
under the pardon can apply to have their military discharges corrected
and to recover the pay and benefits the convictions cost them.
‚Äú[M]aintaining the finest fighting force in the world‚Ä¶means making sure
that every member of our military feels safe and respected,‚Äù Biden said

kicked butt when it came out in 2006 and the butt it kicked was the

complicated to subscribe to a feed. In Twitter there was a button on
each feed page that said Subscribe. Click the button and you‚Äôre

<p>
‚ÄúLet me google it for you‚Äù was a bad reply back in the days; these days
telling somebody ‚Äúto google something‚Äù is insulting because we all know
how aggravating it is to spend time and energy against privacy invasions
and sifting through the AI slop and the grifters. Life is short and
there‚Äôs no time for this.
</p>
<p>
I try to err on the side of caution and always add links to stuff if I
can. I‚Äôm preparing for the total breakdown of search as we know it.
</p>
<p>
Some days Internet search feels like we‚Äôre at the capitalist optimum
where everything is as painful as possible but not prohibitive. Can‚Äôt
live without it (to find those link farms, advice sites, public
archives) but also can‚Äôt find the private websites and blogs.
</p>
<p>
Is it true that Reddit managed to replace all the blogs or is it true
that we just can‚Äôt find them any more. The real problem is the loss of
trust all around.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@vesto" title="@vesto@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="vesto">@vesto</span></a> reminded me that
there was a solution in ‚Äúthe realm of curating human-scale websites‚Äù:
<a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a>.
</p>
<p>
And indeed, it looks like a great starting place!
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm thinking that perhaps I can somehow use blog planets as sources for
topic-specific search engines. I could use the blogs on
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a> to build an
Emacs search engine and the blogs of
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> to build an RPG
search engine.
</p>
<p>
It seems quite doable!
</p>
<p>
The ethics remain complicated, of course. Would I want search engine
developers to scrape my site? Usually I just notice them when their bots
misbehave so I‚Äôm pretty averse to the entire situation. The search
engine makers also being ad sellers and ads being a poison for our
society doesn‚Äôt help. The search engine makers being AI fans and AI
energy and water requirements being cited as the reasons to keep fossil
power plants running and to build nuclear power plants doesn‚Äôt help. AI
also resulting in me having to read texts that other people didn‚Äôt
bother to write adds injury to insult.
</p>
<p>
In any case‚Ä¶ perhaps there is a way to have ethical search and not drown
in the AI slob: Hand curated websites (taken from the planets), no ads,
no income (and therefore necessarily small in scope).
</p>
<p>
I started experimenting. Using <code>webringSelector = "#sidebar li
a:nth-child(2) [href]"</code> in the <code>lieu.toml</code> file seemes
to get the links of RPG blogs, for example.
</p>
<p>
One thing I find disturbing is that lieu uses Colly to scrape the web
and <a href="https://github.com/gocolly/colly/issues/614">Colly ignores
robots.txt by default</a>. I managed to lock the crawler out of my site
in less than a second. Yikes!
</p>
<p>
And the sad part is that if I add <code>c.IgnoreRobotsTxt = false</code>
to the code, it seems to have no effect. Does anybody know more about
how to control this?
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a>
</p>
<p>
The following branches are probably temporary:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/kensanata/lieu/tree/unix-domain-socket">unix-domain-socket</a>:
This can be used by systemd to start the server connected to a Unix
domain socket. Using a server like nginx or Apache as a front-end allows
them to communicate with the server via the Unix domain socket. In that
case, no port is required.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/kensanata/lieu/tree/robots-txt">robots-txt</a>:
This is where I try to enable <code>robots.txt</code> handling again ‚Äì
but I‚Äôm failing at it.
</p>
<p>
Then again, perhaps the ethics of it all make it untenable for me ‚Äì is
this really something I need? If it isn‚Äôt, perhaps I‚Äôd be better off
doing something else.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-06-26</strong>. Perhaps it‚Äôd be easier to search feeds.
People already publish feeds. The feeds already contain the content they
are willing to share. The feed is already limited to web pages and
doesn‚Äôt include web applications.

<p>These days, reality is undermining the political power of the
mythological image of the American cowboy. In the years after World War
II, that image helped to sell the idea that a government that regulated
business, provided a basic safety net, promoted infrastructure, and
protected civil rights for Black and Brown Americans and for women was
cruising perilously close to communism. The cowboy image suggested that
a true American was an individualist man who worked hard to provide for
and to protect his homebound wife and children, with a gun if necessary,
and wanted only for the government to leave him and his business
alone.</p>

<p>
One huge problem with VNC or remote desktop is how flaky it is if you
have limited bandwidth or an unstable connection, like on an airplane.
</p>
<p>
It takes forever to start a screen sharing session, and the airplane‚Äôs
flaky WiFi usually causes the session to lock up, meaning you can‚Äôt do
much at all.
</p>
<p>
Remote <em>terminal</em> access, just relaying text commands, is the
best solution for that problem. And sure, I have a VPN I could use with
SSH to get to my Pi, but

Of course when it came time to do the logo I went to my
reasonably-priced graphics consultant, ChatGPT. It came breathtakingly
close on the first attempt, but it repeated part of the story. Every
time I asked it to fix a problem, it created another problem, and the
image brightness was reduced, not just in terms of pixels but also the
creativity of the image. Of course it isn‚Äôt really creative. I know.
Yadda yadda.

Finally I got something that I could live with that I liked but was
imperfect. I decided that since the motto of my blog is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs even worse

overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized a woman‚Äôs

<h2 id="briefly-on-julian-assange">Briefly on Julian Assange</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Jessica Smith‚Äôs blog</p>
<p>
So, Viv and I were in the car this morning when we heard about the
Assange plea deal.
</p>
<p>
Viv: omg, finally! I only hope he‚Äôll now give up hacking üòî<br> Me: Hmm,
or maybe he should give up non-consensual sex. That‚Äôs where he went
wrong, isn‚Äôt it?<br> Viv: ‚Ä¶true
</p>
<p>
I mean, fuck. I know this prosecution has been politically motivated,
purely to punish him for his role exposing Western war crimes. The
charges he‚Äôs accepted a plea deal over are the US ‚Äúespionage‚Äù ones,
after all, not the Swedish sexual assault ones, which were dropped long
ago. And I don‚Äôt support politically-motivated prosecutions of people
who expose war crimes. But I‚Äôve also never been comfortable with any
kind of personalised ‚ÄúI support Assange‚Äù sentiment, as if he were a
righteous martyr, rather than ‚ÄúI support exposing those who commit war
crimes‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Back in my student activist days, I once got stuck doing a stall where
we were trying to get signatures on a petition calling for Assange‚Äôs
charges to be dropped (and this was back when they were the sexual
assault charges, not the espionage ones). The organiser of the stall
knew full well the attitude I was going to take to this, so he gave me a
stack of leaflets and told me to hand them out around Campus Centre. I
took the stack, went upstairs, dropped them all straight in the bin,
then chilled out in the cafeteria for an hour before reporting back. I
think he knew that‚Äôs what I was going to do, too, lol. I didn‚Äôt get
scolded for skipping out on nearly the whole stall, which I usually
would‚Äôve been.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Assange is married now, so maybe he has straightened himself
out. I don‚Äôt know. I think it‚Äôs good there‚Äôs a resolution at last to the
political prosecution (although I would note, cynically, that so many
years have passed that the ‚Äúdeterrence‚Äù objective has already been
achieved, and the, uh, short-term memory of the political establishment
means no one cares what happened during the War on Terror any more,
anyway). But Assange himself is still an asshole.

<h1 id="2024-06-23-adjudicating-the-difficulty">
2024-06-23 Adjudicating the difficulty
</h1>
<p>
I was listening in on an exchange between
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a>. They were
talking about <a href="Traveller">Traveller</a> and Peter noted that he
didn‚Äôt like the ‚Äúsomewhat mysterious difficulty classes of some tests‚Äù.
I don‚Äôt like this, either! It‚Äôs exhausting. I feel drained when I do it.
</p>
<p>
I started thinking about this for a while and maybe the following
provides for an interesting way to talk about rules in role-playing
games.
</p>
<p>
Note that the problem shows up in many places. For example, I don‚Äôt like
‚Äúthe ladder‚Äù in <a href="Fudge">Fudge</a> and <a href="Fate">Fate</a>
games where I as the referee need decide whether opponents are ‚Äúgood‚Äù or
‚Äúvery good‚Äù at fighting the player characters. For me, this is the same
problem, except it happens behind the screen. Player‚Äôs don‚Äôt know about
this.
</p>
<p>
Using classic D&amp;D or similar rules and running a megadungeon is
comparatively easy, because the monster hit dice are tied to dungeon
levels. Once I know the dungeon level, I can pick appropriate monsters
and their stats automatically determine ‚Äúthe difficulty classes of some
tests.‚Äù This might be one of the reasons that makes it easier to run
D&amp;D with self-made dungeons.
</p>
<p>
So this is the first solution to the problem of having to assign
difficulties to rolls: The game can have a small number of actions that
require a dice roll. Each roll has clear conditions of success. The
referee doesn‚Äôt have to assess the difficulty as soon as the situation
is established. D&amp;D would be an example of this kind of game. You
roll to hit, to do damage, to save, and all the target numbers are known
once the monster is on the table. In classic D&amp;D, traps have only
one difficulty setting so thieves only need to know a single number.
Hidden doors are either concealed or secret. Those are the two difficult
settings for finding the hidden door and thus the referee only needs to
know two numbers (1-in-6 or 2-in-6). Of course it breaks down sometimes
when a module tells you that a particular door is harder to find
(‚Äú1-in-8‚Äù) or that a lock is harder to pick (‚Äúadd 20% to the check‚Äù).
But generally speaking, as a referee, very little thought is required.
The trade-of is that characters don‚Äôt have many ‚Äúskills‚Äù. They have
their attack rolls, their saves, the thieves skills, some other d6
abilities like opening doors and listening, but that‚Äôs it.
</p>
<p>
As soon as skills are introduced, the situations in which dice can be
rolled explodes. One way to solve the problem of having to decide the
difficulty of every single roll is to a provide a long list of examples
from which to extrapolate. I haven‚Äôt played any game that does that
well. Zweih√§nder provides seven example uses of the skill, one for each
difficulty rating. That is amazing.
</p>
<p>
A game that has a single roll for every skill (great idea) but then
provides a lot of help adjudicating the rolls in general isn‚Äôt helping.
I found this to be the case for the few Basic Role-Playing, Warhammer
Fantasy Roleplay, Rolemaster and HARP games I tried. I didn‚Äôt try many
of them. I just checked HARP again and there are examples for some of
the skills and not for others, so I‚Äôd have to play it again to remember
whether this was even a problem.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps one possible solution is to just ignore difficulties and to
assume all skill rolls at the default difficulty to be appropriate for
adventures. As far as I can remember, this is how we often played these
games.
</p>
<p>
Mongoose Traveller isn‚Äôt helping, either. There, the target number is
always an eight. Almost all the modifiers appear to obvious and well
explained, but with the Task Difficulty Dice Modifiers the ‚Äúsomewhat
mysterious difficulty classes of some tests‚Äù is back.
</p>
<p>
Classic Traveller is worse it leans into the referee making up the roll.
Sometimes an examples of a skill is provided (‚Äúnavigation expertise can
be used as a DM of +1 per level on a throw to determine the needed
information‚Äù) but most of the time it‚Äôs simply a description of where
the skill might be applicable and it‚Äôs up to the referee to call for an
appropriate throw, if at all. At the very beginning, skills are
explained as follows: ‚ÄúThe acquired skills table provides four basic
types of results: characteristic alterations (such as +1 strength),
weapons expertise (such as blade combat), transport skills (such as
ATV), and basic skills (such as navigation).‚Äù That is to say, sometimes
the skill simply means that something can be done. The example that
comes to mind is how to recover from serious wounds: ‚ÄúRecovery is
dependent on medical attention (a medical facility and an individual
with medical-3 skill; recuperation to full strength without medical
attention is not possible).‚Äù The medic doesn‚Äôt have to roll at all.
Having the skill is all that counts.
</p>
<p>
This brings me to the last category: negotiation. This what I learned
from Burning Wheel: Before a roll is made, players declare what they
want and the referee determines the difficulty of the roll and explains
the consequences of failure. Then players decide whether they want to
make the roll. Implicitly, they can change their mind, declare a
different goal and see whether they like the odds and consequences
better. I like this a lot.
</p>
<p>
Of course, turning every skill roll into a negotiation can be tiresome.
If people remember what the previous result of similar negotiations was,
the system takes on aspects of case law. As soon as the people of the
table realize that a similar situation was resolved using this or that,
and there are no circumstances that warrant a change, then the
negotiation is skipped.
</p>
<p>
Then again, a long lists of conditions and modifiers can also take on
aspects of case law.
</p>
<p>
So perhaps this is what I think all these rules texts evolve into: Any
rule system where referees set the difficulty imply a system where
players can enter a short negotiation. In order to avoid future
negotiations, the table remembers the outcomes and uses them as
shortcuts for future situations.
</p>
<p>
Once you know this, the approach by some games to simply do a fixed
difficulty roll such as 50% rate of success makes sense if you assume
that there is some sort of negotiation and case law powering it all.
Sometimes the penalty of failure is scorn and insults, sometimes it‚Äôs
death. It depends on the situation but there‚Äôs always a way to negotiate
for the two outcomes that seem acceptable to the table.
</p>
<p>
I haven‚Äôt found a perfect solution, for me. I like it both ways. A game
like <a href="Halberds_and_Helmets">Halberts &amp; Helmets</a> is much
like D&amp;D where as a game like <a href="Halberts">Halberts</a> is one
where all effects outside of combat have to be negotiated but it‚Äôs not
as wild and free as Classic Traveller.

<p>On Thursday, Moody‚Äôs Analytics, which evaluates risk, performance,
and financial modeling, compared the economic promises of President Joe
Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Authors Mark
Zandi, Brendan LaCerda, and Justin Begley concluded that while a second
Biden presidency would see cooling inflation and continued economic
growth of 2.1%, a Trump presidency would be an economic disaster.</p>

<h2 id="the-name-siddhartha">The Name ‚ÄòSiddhartha‚Äô</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Jessica Smith‚Äôs blog</p>
<p>
Since Vivian was a teenager, apparently, it‚Äôs been his long-held dream
to name a son Siddhartha and call him Sid for short, so as to honour
both his Hindu heritage <em>and</em> Syd Barrett, his rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll
idol. Pretty much as soon as Viv told me this dream, I poured cold water
on it. Honestly, I did not believe that ‚ÄúSiddhartha‚Äù was a name that
actual, real-life human beings are given. Vivian insisted it was, so
after a few years of back-and-forth, I finally deigned to search the
internet to see if I could find any actual, real-life human beings with
this name. The result was that every single ‚ÄúSiddhartha‚Äù I found was a
French speaker (of Indian heritage) ‚Äì professionals living in cities
like Lyon, Geneva, Montreal‚Ä¶ so of course I took this back to Vivian and
said all accusatorily, ‚ÄúYou want to give our child a French name!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
This turns out to be a really good way to wind him up ‚Äì I can say this,
because he‚Äôs compelled me to make the same argument repeatedly since ‚Äì
because he starts whining, ‚ÄúNooooo, it‚Äôs an Indian name!‚Äù and I tell him
that random LinkedIn profiles on the internet don‚Äôt lie, and our child
is not getting a French
name.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
It‚Äôs really funny how worked up he gets about it. Anyway.
</p>
<p>
Now that we‚Äôre actually <em>having</em> a child, of course, we‚Äôre having
all these discussions again, even though we don‚Äôt know Baby‚Äôs sex yet.
‚ÄúSid‚Äù has been Viv‚Äôs pet name for the growing creature in my belly, and
I do often go along with it, although I also point out regularly that
that‚Äôs <em>never</em> going to be their actual name.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay,‚Äù he jokes, ‚Äúwhen you die in childbirth, there‚Äôll be no one
to stop me putting whatever I want on the birth certificate.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHa-ha,‚Äù I retort, ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre not gambling on those odds.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
For what it‚Äôs worth, we <em>have</em> started putting together an
<em>actual</em> shortlist, consisting of names that are Indian in
origin, but are either <em>also</em> English/Irish names <em>or</em>, at
least, don‚Äôt sound markedly foreign in English. This is what Viv said he
really liked about the whole ‚ÄúSiddhartha‚Äù/‚ÄúSid‚Äù thing, and I think
<em>that‚Äôs</em> a fair enough goal‚Ä¶ just not the actual name
‚ÄúSiddhartha‚Äù. Un¬≠for¬≠tun¬≠ately, Viv‚Äôs next favourite name isn‚Äôt so much ‚Äúan
Irish name‚Äù as ‚Äúthe Irish word for ‚Äòbread‚Äô‚Äù, but we‚Äôll get there.

principles

going to start a new podcast-only feed, and
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/23/howRssStartedTheRealStory.m4a">this
will be first episode</a>. 14 minutes. It tells the story of RSS as a
remarkable coming-together of tech, news, publishing and blogging. The
first burst came from Netscape and four leading web pubs, Salon, Red
Herring Wired and Motley Fool. As a leading blogger and developer of
blogging tools, I jumped on board as soon as I heard of it, as did the
people at Blogger. RSS was an instant standard with a great installed
base, and retained its simplicity. You have no idea how remarkable that
is. It grew like a weed. An installed base developed. There was
confusion for a couple of years, between 2000 and 2002, about what RSS
was, but the market stayed with the format specified by Netscape in
1999. Then in 2002, at UserLand we did a deal with the NY Times to get
their news flowing through RSS, and in the next year, the <i>entire news
world supported RSS.</i> That‚Äôs the story. You can write all about who
did what in a background story, but the big story, the miracle, mostly
remains untold. What matters is an open format took root and retained
its simplicity. And it pays to understand why it was not a strong enough
foundation to be successful, first because the vendors didn‚Äôt work with
each other, and then because Twitter made subscription one click, where
it was ridiculous how hard it was to subscribe to a feed in RSS. We
should learn from this, and not repeat the same mistakes, and of course
until the real story is out there, we can‚Äôt learn from it. This is a
14-minute podcast. I cut off the last five minutes because I got lost in
the weeds. All of this is documented in the archive of this blog and the
sites it points to. And if there‚Äôs interest I‚Äôll happily talk about it
in a future podcast.</p>
