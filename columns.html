<h2 id="more-ais-are-taking-polls-and-surveys">More AIs Are Taking Polls
and Surveys</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-21, updated: 2025-05-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
I already knew about the declining response rate for polls and surveys.
The percentage of AI bots that
<a href="https://laurenleek.substack.com/p/the-quiet-collapse-of-surveys-fewer">respond
to surveys</a> is also increasing.
</p>
<p>
Solutions are hard:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Make surveys less boring.</em><br /> We need to move past bland,
grid-filled surveys and start designing experiences people actually want
to complete. That means mobile-first layouts, shorter runtimes, and
maybe even a dash of storytelling. TikTok or dating app style surveys
wouldn’t be a bad idea or is that just me being too much Gen Z?
</p>
<p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><em>Bot detection.</em><br /> There’s a growing toolkit of ways to
spot AI-generated responses—using things like response entropy, writing
style patterns or even metadata like keystroke timing. Platforms should
start integrating these detection tools more widely. Ideally, you
introduce an element that only humans can do, e.g., you have to pick up
your price somewhere in-person. Btw, note that these bots can easily be
designed to find ways around the most common detection tactics such as
Captcha’s, timed responses and postcode and IP recognition. Believe me,
way less code than you suspect is needed to do this…

<h2 id="moving-from-notion-to-obsidian">Moving from Notion to
Obsidian</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
As the world turns, so doth productivity apps churn. Readers of this
blog will know I’ve been a user of Notion for the last seven-plus years.
The block-based editor, the database features, and general “webbiness”
of Notion suited me and let my inner productivity- and systems-wonk
flourish.
</p>
<p>
Hearing rave reviews about Obsidian from friends (who are certainly not
a cult, I’m told), I’ve tried to switch twice before. I spent entire
weekends setting up a trial vault but never felt compelled enough to
switch fully. But today –after a slow month-long process– I’m happy to
report I’ve ditched Notion and am using Obsidian now. So… what changed?
</p>
<h2>
My problems with Notion
</h2>
<p>
In March, Notion notified me that my monthly cost is increasing from
$8/mo to $12/mo (a +50% increase). On top of that, Notion has been
pushing AI hard the last couple years culminating in sparkle emojis
everywhere and an ever-present animated floating mascot in the
corner<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.
I poked around at the AI features, used my free credits, but came to the
conclusion that AI inside Notion is almost the antithesis of what I want
in Notion. I use Notion as a thinking tool, I don’t need it to be a
think-for-me tool.
</p>
<p>
The emphasis on AI and the price hike forced me to scrutinize and
re-think my commitment. Correct or not, I associated the two chafing
points and felt like I was subsidizing other user’s AI usage rather than
getting more value out of the app. That was the tipping point for me. I
don’t harbor any hatred or disgust for Notion; it’s truly a “we’re
growing in two different directions” sort of divorce.
</p>
<p>
Economically, Obsidian takes me in the opposite direction at $4/mo for
Obsidian’s vault sync feature. It also takes me into a more bare bones,
hands-on setup experience. That real farm-to-table organic content that
forms the bedrock of my personal brand. 😂
</p>
<h2>
My new Obsidian setup
</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-graph-view-2.jpg" alt="screenshot of my obsidian setup showing a file tree on the left sidebar and a circular graph view of interconnected nodes in the main content area" />
</p>
<p>
I’ve watched hours of videos about the perfect Obsidian setup but what
truly unlocked it for me was Tyler Sticka’s post
<em><a href="https://tylersticka.com/journal/obsidian-miscellany/">Obsidian
Miscellany</a></em>. Seeing Tyler’s setup and the plugins he uses to
craft Obsidian’s brutalist nature into something cozy gave me the
courage to try a third time. Obsidian has a great plugin system and an
active community of developers, where the WordPress-style “There’s a
plugin for that” rings true (and probably has similar performance
pitfalls). Getting a handful of plugins configured to your liking moves
the user experience needle from “Something I use” to “This is mine”.
</p>
<p>
Copying most of Tyler’s list, here’s the list of plugins I’m using:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian">Advanced

</li>
</ul>
<p>
These breakdown into three major categories of plugins: themes, editor,
and process… which is a great segue to talk about the organization and
processes I have for my new vault.
</p>
<h2>
Inputs, Outputs, and Tasks
</h2>
<p>
For years
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">I’ve
been attempting to do PARA in Notion</a>, but I never found it a perfect
match. “Projects have an end date” was revelatory and “Areas” helped me
take inventory of my life, but pulling it all together and putting
everything in the correct bucket felt like high ceremony. Moving to
Obsidian gave me a chance to rethink how I wanted to organize my second
brain.
</p>
<p>
By default, Obsidian nudges you towards no organization, which is to say
it wants you to tag and link content to build wiki-like associations in
a flat’ish file structure. This doesn’t work for my brain at all. I need
a bit of structure to my content. I spent a long time researching
different organization systems from the loose (Zettelkasten) to the
strict (Johnny Decimal) and I settled on a modification of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM">August Bradley’s
Pipelines, Pillars and Vaults</a> that I call “Inputs, Outputs, and
Tasks.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inputs</strong> are scraps of content and ideas that influence
your thinking that you want to keep to reference later. I collect these
“Inputs” in small files organized in folders by content types like
books, links, quotes, and unorganized notes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Outputs</strong> are a big part of why I use a note-taking app;
to get ideas out of my head. Whereas Inputs are inert and fine to live
in cold storage indefinitely, Outputs want to live in the world and need
a little process behind them to maintain momentum. I’ve recruited the
help of some kanban and writing plugins to add a thin layer of process
to my blog posts and projects.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tasks</strong> are the final leg of the stool and a tool for
jumping back into finishing projects or other work. The one key thing
about Tasks is that they’re <em>actionable</em> and <em>achievable</em>.
Tasks can’t be big abstract to-dos like “Do taxes” or “Make a video
game”, they have to be actionable like “Get 1099-R from SEP IRA” or
“Prototype fog-of-war system.” Descriptive enough to be
<em>actionable</em>, atomic enough to be <em>achievable</em>.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, I don’t need a separate Tasks plugin to manage this, I can
use the <code>[ ] Task Name</code> syntax in my project note and then
use Dataview to slurp up a list of Tasks that I’ve created across all my
active projects.
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>```dataview
TASK
FROM "Outputs"
WHERE !completed 
AND file.frontmatter.status != "DEADPOOL" 
AND file.frontmatter.status != "Archived"
GROUP BY file.name
```
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
You’d need to customize your <code>WHERE</code> clause to how you have
your Obsidian setup, but that query generates a view like this where I
group all to-dos by project or note.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-tasks.jpg" alt="a todo list where a list of projects have one to three to-do items listed below" />
</p>
<h2>
Adding process to Outputs
</h2>
<p>
To manage my outputs I have three plug-ins that help add a layer of
process to help get the work out the door.
</p>
<h3>
Projects
</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-projects-view.jpg" alt="screenshot of a kanban board for side projects" />
</p>
<p>
One of my favorite and most used features of my Notion was
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">my
Blogging Kanban</a>. This was the heart of my content generation
flywheel; keeping track of all these scraps of ideas in different
states. Blogging and side projects that have a somewhat linear flow and
it’s great to visualize a post or project nearing a checkpoint or a
published state.
</p>
<p>
Of all the kanban plugins I tried, Projects felt like the best fit. I
know I’m violating open source protocol by heaping requests on free
software, but I wish the querying and filtering was a bit more advanced.
There’s a lot to be desired on achieving parity with Notion’s rich
Kanban and Table system, but it looks like
<a href="https://obsidian.md/roadmap/">dynamic tables is on the Obsidian
roadmap</a>, so I’m fine using the nerfed versions for now.
</p>
<h3>
Longform
</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-longform-view.jpg" alt="screenshot of the longform sidebar UI panel with a story in the main content area" />
</p>
<p>
I have six or so shitty sci-fi stories burrowing a hole in my brain as
well as an entire failed book pitch on prototypes. To help add structure
to this process, I’ve employed a plugin called Longform. It allows me to
break stories up into scenes or chapters, rearrange them, and then
stitch that all together into a manuscript for review.
</p>
<h3>
Write Good
</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-write-good-plugin.jpg" alt="screenshot of a run of text with highlighted erros like “the word so adds no meaning”, “the phrase there is unnecessary”, “absolutely can weaken meaning”, and “many is a weasel word”" />
</p>
<p>
Write Good is a poor man’s Grammarly. Unfettered, I tend to default to
passive voice or use weasel words as sentence filler. For example, In
the previous sentence I tried to use the word “employ” instead of “use”,
like I’m the damn King of England. Write Good nudges me towards simpler
phrasing and an active voice. Passive voice is natural for me and I
don’t hate that part about me, but there are people (grammar nazis) who
do care, so why not remove that stumbling block? Over time I’ve come to
prefer an enforced writing style and think the active voice tightens up
most sentences.
</p>
<p>
Write Good also helps filter out technical writing no-nos like the word
“<a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just/">Just</a>”. That itself
is worth the price of entry. I can break the rules any time, but
requires me turning off the part of my brain that obeys linters.
</p>
<p>
I’ve actually been using Write Good for years but as part of a secondary
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/pre-publish-blogging-rituals/">pre-publish
process</a> as a
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=travisthetechie.write-good-linter">VS
Code plugin</a>. With Obsidian I’ve been able to “shift left” that part
of the process to the writing phase. Keeps me honest on how much work is
actually left.
</p>
<h2>
What I don’t like about Obsidian
</h2>
<p>
After a month of solid use, I only have one major gripe: the finickiness
of the editor.
</p>
<p>
The swapping between reading mode and editing mode feels erratic and
jumpy in a way that Notion never did. I use a lot of <code>CMD +
E</code> to manually swap between reading and editing, but it either
remembers too well or not well enough on how I want to view different
files. I don’t know if I’ll ever be happy here because I think the core
problem is that rich text editing is weird.
</p>
<p>
One other aspect I think Obsidian could improve is creating a component
library or style guide for plugins. Not all plugins generate side panel
UI, but for those that do… it’s a zoo. I think a little effort here and
design systems work for plugins could create a cohesive look and feel.
</p>
<h2>
The mobile app is fast
</h2>
<p>
One of Notion’s biggest well-known issues is poor app performance. I
don’t spent my entire days worrying about this because I tend to be on
desktop and once it’s opened, it’s opened. But after firing up
Obsidian’s mobile app, you can’t unsee the difference.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian’s mobile app is fast. Downright instant. And it somehow dodges
the finickiness of the macOS app I complained about above. I know it’s
not the flagship product, but the mobile app feels like a first-party
experience and not an afterthought. It’s useful and has the right
performance profile for jotting little notes on the go.
</p>
<p>
It’s also impressive that all my JavaScript-based plugins are working
inside the native mobile app. I assumed most plugins wouldn’t work
inside the WebView
environment<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>.
This made for a situation where I had low expectations but was
pleasantly surprised.
</p>
<h2>
Nothing beats a folder full of markdown files
</h2>
<p>
Obsidian reinforces a lesson I’ve learned from my last decade and a half
of blogging; nothing beats a folder full of markdown files. A
note-taking app doesn’t have to be complex machinery. A little bit of
YAML frontmatter can go a long way.
</p>
<p>
This migration identified one subtle problem I didn’t know I had; I
“over-databased” in Notion. I created entire sections in Notion with a
database to get the editable table UI. This creates a lot of click-thru
flows, excess documents, and feels like building an entire CMS for a
one-page website. Obsidian nudges me to think more simple.
</p>
<h2>
Your productivity app and my productivity app will look different
</h2>
<p>
It took a solid month to migrate my thousands of documents to Notion. I
declared bankruptcy on my Web Clipper links, but settled on
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/05/obsidian-link-aggregator/">a

this process and giant deep-dive into productivity tools is that
productivity is personal. Your dream setup and my dream setup will look

We have different brains that understand the world differently. Some
people are Type A controlling, some are Type B hot-messes, and some of
us are chill Type O. We have different goals for our note-taking apps;
some might be pure archivists, some might be on a hustle grind, and some
might need to organize their DnD sessions.

I come back to an old quote I’ve mentioned a handful of times before
from Kevin Kelley, founder of the Whole Earth Review…

<p>
Grab hold of good tools that give you good opportunities.

2025-05-19 Split
</h1>
<p>
We drove all the way to Split, visited the old town and what remains of
Diocletians palace, had lunch and then we went walking through Marjan
forest park. Wonderfully quiet.
</p>
<p>
On the way to the city center, I spotted a passion flower. So beautiful.
They look like cosmic spaceships or pschedelic temples in miniature.
</p>
<p>
Blaue Passionsblume<br> Passiflora caerulea
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-1.jpg" alt="a flower with an complex, three-dimensional structure in the middle" />
</p>
<p>
The marina in front of the old town. Half the old town is with the
perimeter of Diocletian’s palace.
</p>
<p>
The water is dirty and smells bad.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-2.jpg" alt="a marina with small boats and a boulevard with palm trees" />
</p>
<p>
They turned Diocletian’s mausoleum into the cathedral.
</p>
<p>

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-6.jpg" alt="Split&rsquo;s old town is full of narrow alleys" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-7.jpg" alt="there is an open pit where you can see into the cellar ruins of Diocletian&rsquo;s palace" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-8.jpg" alt="looking back at the bell tower" />
</p>
<p>
There are places where you can see two levels of cellars and three or
four levels of buildings. This how I like my dungeon ruins. 😄
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-9.jpg" alt="looking into another pit with access to underground levels" />
</p>
<p>
What impressed me the most is that people live in the midst of these
fantastic ruins.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-10.jpg" alt="extremely narrow alleys" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-11.jpg" alt="and suddenly, a private garden" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-12.jpg" alt="and ruins, and tourists" />
</p>
<p>
We went into the cathedral. It’s a small octagonal building because it
used to be Diocletions tomb. I was not impressed.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-13.jpg" alt="looking up at the ceiling" />
</p>
<p>
Looking back over the corner with the carden (to the left) and the low
walls from where one could peek into the cellars.
</p>
<p>

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-16.jpg" alt="more narrow alleys" />
</p>
<p>
We had enough after a while, had a small lunch and decided to head into
the Marjan forest park. The stairs up start in the old town.
</p>
<p>

Dry stone walls everywhere. Later there was even an info board talking
about dry stone wall building.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-21.jpg" alt="some tall corniferous trees behind a dry stone wall" />
</p>
<p>
The trail from the end of the stairs to Sedlow is wide, flat, and
beautiful.

<p>
The nice walkway turns into a trail.
</p>
<p>

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-25.jpg" alt="the trail continues and still the trees provide no shade" />
</p>
<p>
The trail gets narrower and we start thinking of ticks again.

<p>
We walked back along the coast and looked up. Our trail was somewhere
behind this cliff.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-29.jpg" alt="a forested hill and while cliffs at the top" />

In the evening we went for pizza and pasta.

<p>
I’m falling behind with posting pictures. 😬
</p>
<p>
I expected the Krka national park to be similar to
<a href="2025-05-15-plitvice">our visit to Plitvice national park</a>.
But no, it was very different. There were wooden walkways, lots of
greenery growing in the rapids, lots of tufaceous limestone. Everything
else was different. 😄
</p>
<p>
It began with a long, steep trail from the parking lot down to the
river.
</p>
<p>

We reached the bottom and started on our trail.

<p>

A waterfall with and and without people:

</p>
<p>
Time to say goodbye to the Krka national park!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-20.jpg" alt="more waterfalls in a lush landscape bursting with plants" />
</p>
<p>
We still had some time and decided to stop in Vodice on our way back to
Šibenik.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-16.jpg" alt="Alex in a narrow alley" />
</p>
<p>
We mostly walked along the water towards Tribunj and back. It’s so nice
to hear the waves and feel the breeze.

<p>
Apparently these trees grow mere meters from the ocean. How do they do
it? They don’t look like mangroves to me. I assume some subterranean
compartment to keep their water supply separate.

<h2 id="i-am-so-sick-and-tired-of-ai">I am so sick and tired of
“AI”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<div>
Spent much of today getting a Live AROS USB key working, which wasn’t
trivial… it needed a USB 3 key, which I had to go and buy specially.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
But after that… I am so tired. I want to write about new stuff in
software, but there feels to be no area not contaminated with
"AI".<br /><br />I get the depressing feeling that computing is just
being eaten up by bloody "AI". Virtually every press release I’ve seen
this week has been AI. Mozilla adopts new AI search engine. Red Hat
releases RHEL 10 with built in AI chat bot to help clueless PFYs admin
the thing. Windows bloody Notepad has AI built in. AI in Google Docs. AI
boosters in my mentions telling me and my friends that AI is helping
them read antique books or whatever. 
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Is there anywhere outside of retrocomputing that doesn’t have AI in it?
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<p>The emperor has no clothes. LLM bots are not artificial and they are
not intelligent. Not at all, not even a little bit, not even if you
redefine the words "artificial" or "intelligent".  <br /><br />"AI" is
not "AI". The liars and the shills redefined what people used to mean by
"AI" as "AGI", artificial <em>general</em> intelligence, so they could
market their stupid plagiarism bots as AI. <br /><br />AGI is not real.
It doesn’t exist. It will probably never exist. Hell, at the rate
humanity is going, we won’t be able to build new computers any more by
2050 and the survivors at the poles will be nostalgic for
electricity.<br /><br />AI is a scam. It’s a hoax. It’s fake news. There
is no AI, and what is being sold as AI is such an incredibly poor fake
that it is profoundly disheartening that so many people are so stupid to
be deceived into thinking it is AI.<br /><br />The blockchain is a scam.
Everything to do with it is a scam. <br /><br />Alternative medicine is
a scam. All of it. There is no such thing. If it’s called "alternative"
that means it’s been proved not to work.<br /><br />All religions are
scams. No exceptions. <br /><br />People have made billions from selling
scams for my whole lifetime.<br /><br />Meanwhile, other scams, like
plastics being recyclable – they aren’t, it’s a lie – or biofuels – also
a lie – mean our civilisation is on the verge of collapse. We are
killing the planetary ecosphere that keeps us alive with plastic and
pollution from burning stuff. We have to stop burning everything, stop
cutting down trees, and stop making all forms of single-use products. No
more jet planes. No more private cars. No more foreign holidays. We
can’t afford it.<br /><br />And with all that we are almost certainly
still doomed.<br /><br />But I kind of want to see my industry go first,
if all it’s got now is AI.<br /><br />Snag is, I need a job. I have Ada
to pay

in reverse chronologic order. So now, a

This is the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/2857897ffe58bcb06362f00a7a72336a">query</a>.
What’s nice is that the results are focused on the early 2000s, when the
standards we use now were coming up. We can do this kind of stuff again.
There’s more to do. For example, it would be really cool if
<a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a>, their excellent
podcast client, would let users publish their subscription list so we
can build applications on them. There’s a whole new base of data to work
with. And unlike other media, podcast content is meant to be shared. The
controversies that exist for professional writing and audiobooks, for
example, don’t apply to podcasts. If we could open this up, we could
create an
<a href="https://this.how/podcasting/#1733322866000">ecosystem</a> worth
of applications very quickly. OPML is an easy format to get into a
database. We just need sources of interesting data.</p>

Because <a href="htps://nvidia.com">Nvidia</a> became one of the most
valuable companies in the world, there are now two books explaining its
rise and extolling the genius of Jensen Huang, Tae Kim’s
<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305"><i>The Nvidia

Witt’s <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1431034841"><i>The

won’t comment on their treatment of that part. But for the pre-history
at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun

account of the business side of this era is detailed and, although it
was three decades ago, matches my recollections.<br /> <br />

Witt’s account of the business side of the early history is much less
detailed and some of the details don’t match what I remember.<br />
<br /> But as regards the technical aspects of this early history it
appears that neither author really understood the reasons for the two
kinds of innovation we made; the imaging model and the I/O architecture.

<blockquote>
The opportunity we saw when we started Nvidia was that the PC was
transitioning from the PC/AT bus to version 1 of the PCI bus. The PC/AT
bus’ bandwidth was completely inadequate for 3D games, but the PCI bus
had considerably more. Whether it was enough was an open question. We
clearly needed to make the best possible use of the limited bandwidth we
could get.

We had two basic ways of making “the best possible use of the limited
bandwidth”:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Reduce the amount of data we needed to ship across the bus for a given

<li>
Increase the amount of data shipped in each cycle of the bus.

Imaging Model
</h3>
A triangle is the simplest possible description of a surface. Thus
almost the entire history of 3D computer graphics has modeled the
surfaces of 3D objects using triangles. But there is a technique, dating
back at least to Robert Mahl’s 1972 paper
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1972.223424"><i>Visible Surface
Algorithms for Quadric Patches</i></a>, for modeling curved surfaces
directly. It takes a lot more data to describe a quadric patch than a
triangle. But to achieve equivalent realism you need so many fewer
patches that the amount of data for each frame is reduced by a
significant factor.<br /> <br />

Virtua Fighter on NV1

</table>
As far as I know at the time only Sega in the video game industry used
quadric patches. When we launched NV1 at Comdex we were able to show
Sega arcade games such as <i>Virtua Fighter</i> running on a PC at full
frame rate, a first for the industry. The reason was that NV1 used
quadric patches and thus made better use of the limited PCI bus
bandwidth.<br /> <br /> At Sun, James Gosling and I built the extremely
sophisticated and forward-looking but proprietary
<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/19778314">NeWS window
system</a>. At the same time, I also worked with engineers at
competitors such as Digital Equipment to build the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window
System</a>. One of my many learning experiences at Sun came early in the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html">long
history of the X Window System</a>. It rapidly became obvious to me that
there was no way NeWS could compete with the much simpler, open-source
X. I argued for Sun to open-source NeWS and failed. I argued for Sun to
drop NeWS and adopt X, since that was what application developers
wanted. Sun wasted precious time being unable to decide what to do,
finally deciding not to decide and wasting a lot of resource merging
NeWS and X into a kludge that was a worse NeWS and a worse X than its
predecessors. This was just one of a number of fights at Sun I lost
(<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/01/it-isnt-about-technology.html">this
discusses another</a>).<br /> <br /> Once Microsoft announced
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">Direct X</a> it was
obvious to me that Nvidia was doomed if the next chip did quadric
patches, because the developers would have to work with Direct X’s
triangles. But, like Sun, Nvidia seemed unable to decide to abandon its
cherished technology. Time for a decision to be effective was slipping
away. I quit, hoping to shake things up so as to enable a decision to do
triangles. It must have worked. The books recount how close Nvidia was
to bankruptcy when RIVA 128 shipped. The rest is history for which I was
just an observer.
<h3>
I/O Architecture
</h3>
In contrast the I/O architecture was, over time, the huge success we
planned. Kim
<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305">writes (Page
95)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Early on, Curtis Priem had invented a “virtualized objects” architecture
that would be incorporated in all of Nvidia’s chips. It became an even
bigger advantage for the company once Nvidia adopted the faster cadence
of chip releases. Priem’s design had a software based “resource
manager”, essentially a miniature operating system that sat on top of
the hardware itself. The resource manager allowed Nvidia’s engineers to
emulate certain hardware features that normally needed to be physically
printed onto chip circuits. This involved a performance cost but
accelerated the pace of innovation, because Nvidia’s engineers could
take more risks. If the new feature wasn’t ready to work in the
hardware, Nvidia could emulate it in software. At the same time,
engineers could take hardware features out when there was enough
leftover computing power, saving chip area.<br /> <br /> For most of
Nvidia’s rivals, if a hardware feature on a chip wasn’t ready, it would
mean a schedule slip. Not, though, at Nvidia, thanks to Priem’s
innovation. “This was the most brilliant thing on the planet,” said
Michael Hara. “It was our secret sauce. If we missed a feature or a
feature was broken, we could put it in the resource manager and it would
work.” Jeff Fisher, Nvidia’s head of sales, agreed: “Priem’s
architecture was critical in enabling Nvidia to design and make new
products faster.”
</blockquote>
<h4>
Context
</h4>
Nvidia is just one of the many, many startups that Sun Microsystems
spawned. But at the time what made Nvidia unique among the competing
graphics startups was the early engineers from the team at Sun that
built the GX series of graphics chips. We went through an intensive
education in the techniques needed to implement graphics effectively in
Unix, a multi-process, virtual memory operating system. The competitors
all came from a Windows background, at the time a single-process,
non-virtual memory system. We understood that, in the foreseeable
future, Windows would have to evolve multi-processing and virtual
memory. Thus the pitch to the VCs was that we would design a
“future-proof” architecture, and deliver a Unix graphics chip for the
PC’s future operating system.<br /> <br /> The GX team also learned from
the difficulty of shipping peripherals at Sun, where the software and
hardware schedules were inextricable because the OS driver and apps
needed detailed knowledge of the physical hardware. This led to “launch
pad chicken”, as each side tried to blame schedule slippage on the
other.<br />
<h4>
Write-mostly
</h4>
Here is how we explained the problem in
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5918050A/"><b>US5918050A</b>:
Apparatus accessed at a physical I/O address for address and data
translation and for context switching of I/O devices in response to
commands from application programs</a> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal
and Curtis Priem), using the shorthand “PDP11 architecture” for systems
whose I/O registers were mapped into the same address space as system
memory:<br />
<blockquote>
Not only do input/output operations have to be carried out by operating
system software, the design of computers utilizing the PDP11
architecture usually requires that registers at each of the input/output
devices be read by the central processing unit in order to accomplish
any input/output operation. As central processing units have become
faster in order to speed up PDP11 type systems, it has been necessary to
buffer write operations on the input/output bus because the bus cannot
keep up with the speed of the central processing unit. Thus, each write
operation is transferred by the central processing unit to a buffer
where it is queued until it can be handled; other buffers in the line
between the central processing unit and an input/output device function
similarly. Before a read operation may occur, all of these write buffers
must be flushed by performing their queued operations in serial order so
that the correct sequence of operations is maintained. Thus, a central
processing unit wishing to read data in a register at an input/output
device must wait until all of the write buffers have been flushed before
it can gain access to the bus to complete the read operation. Typical
systems average eight write operations in their queues when a read
operation occurs, and all of these write operations must be processed
before the read operation may be processed. This has made read
operations much slower than write operations. Since many of the
operations required of the central processing unit with respect to
graphics require reading very large numbers of pixels in the frame
buffer, then translating those pixels, and finally rewriting them to new
positions, graphics operations have become inordinately slow. In fact,
modern graphics operations were the first operations to disclose this
Achilles heel of the PDP11 architecture.

We took two approaches to avoiding blocking the CPU. First, we
implemented a queue in the device, a FIFO (First In First Out), that was
quite long, and we allowed the CPU to read from the FIFO the number of
free slots, the number of writes it could do and be guaranteed not to
block. When the CPU wanted to write to NV1 it would ask the FIFO how
many writes it could do. If the answer were N, it would do N writes
before asking again. NV1 would acknowledge each of those writes
immediately, allowing the CPU to proceed to compute the data for the
next write. This was the subject of
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5805930A/"><b>US5805930A</b></a>:
<i>System for FIFO informing the availability of stages to store
commands which include data and virtual address sent directly from
application programs</i> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal and Curtis
Priem), the continuation of an application we filed 15<sup>th</sup> May
1995. Note that this meant the application didn’t need to know the size
of the device’s FIFO. If a future chip had a bigger or smaller FIFO, the
unchanged application would use it correctly.<br /> <br /> Second, we
tried as far as possible not to use the CPU to transfer data to and from
NV1. Instead, whenever we could we used Direct Memory Access, in which
the I/O device reads and writes system memory independently of the CPU.
In most cases, the CPU instructed NV1 to do something with one, or a few
writes, and then got on with its program. The instruction typically said
“here in memory is a block of quadric patches for you to render”. If the
CPU needed an answer, it would tell NV1 where in system memory to put it
and, at intervals, check to see if it had arrived.<br /> <br /> Remember
that we were creating this architecture for a virtual memory system in
which applications had direct access to the I/O device. The applications
addressed system memory in virtual addresses. The system’s Memory
Management Unit (MMU) translated these into the physical addresses that
the bus used. When an application told the device the address of the
block of patches, it could only send the device one of its
<i>virtual</i> addresses. To fetch the patches from system memory, the
DMA engine on the device needed to translate the virtual address into a
<i>physical</i> address on the bus in the same way that the CPU’s MMU
did.<br /> <br /> So NV1 didn’t just have a DMA engine, it had an IOMMU
as well. We patented this IOMMU as
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5758182A/"><b>US5758182A</b></a>:
<i>DMA controller translates virtual I/O device address received
directly from application program command to physical i/o device address
of I/O device on device bus</i> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal and
Curtis Priem). In 2014’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html"><i>Hardware
I/O Virtualization</i></a> I explained how Amazon ended up building
network interfaces with IOMMUs for the servers in AWS data centers so
that mutiple virtual machines could have direct access to the network
hardware and thus eliminate operating system overhead.
<h4>
Context switching
</h4>
The fundamental problem for graphics support in a multi-process
operating system such as Unix (and later Linux, Windows, MacOS, …) is
that of providing multiple processes the illusion that each has
exclusive access to the single graphics device. I started fighting this
problem in 1983 at Carnegie-Mellon. James Gosling and I built the Andrew
Window System, which allowed multiple processes to share access to the
screen, each in its own window. But they didn’t have access to the real
hardware. There was a single server process that accessed the real
hardware. Applications made remote procedure calls (RPCs) to this
server, which actually drew the requested graphics. Four decades later
the X Window System still works this way.<br /> <br /> RPCs imposed a
performance penalty that made 3D games unusable. To allow, for example,
a game to run in one window while a mail program ran in another we
needed the currently active process to have direct access to the
hardware, and if the operating system context-switched to a different
graphics process, give that process direct access to the hardware. The
operating system would need to save the first process’ state from the
graphics hardware, and restore the second process’ state<br /> <br />
Our work on this problem at Sun led to a patent filed in 1989,
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5127098A/"><b>US5127098A</b></a>:
<i>Method and apparatus for the context switching of devices</i> with
(inventors David S. H. Rosenthal, Robert Rocchetti, Curtis Priem, and
Chris Malachowsky). The idea was to have the device mapped into each
process’ memory but to use the system’s memory management unit (MMU)
ensure that at any one time all but one of the mappings was
<i>invalid</i>. A process’ access to an invalid mapping would interrupt
into the system’s page fault handler, which would invoke the device’s
driver to save the old process’ context and restore the new process’
context. The general problem with this idea is that, because the
interrupt ends up in the page fault handler, it requires
device-dependent code in the page fault handler. This is precisely the
kind of connection between software and hardware that caused schedule
problems at Sun.<br /> <br /> There were two specific Nvidia problems
with this idea. First that Windows wasn’t a virtual memory operating
system so you couldn’t do any of this. And second that even once Windows
had evolved into a virtual memory operating system, Microsoft was
unlikely to let us mess with the page fault handler.<br /> <br />

As you can see in Figure 6 of the
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5805930A/">’930 patent</a>,
the I/O architecture consisted of an interface between the PCI bus and
an internal bus that could implement a number of different I/O devices.
The interface provided a number of capabilities:<br />
<ul>
<li>
It implemented the FIFO, sharing it among all the devices on the
internal bus.
</li>
<li>
It implemented the DMA engine and its IOMMU, sharing it among all the
devices on the internal bus.
</li>
<li>
Using a translation table, it allowed applications to connect to a
specific device on the internal bus via the interface using a virtual
name.
</li>
<li>
It ensured that only one application at a time could access the
interface.
</li>
</ul>
The difference between the PCI and PC/AT buses wasn’t just that the data
path grew from 16 to 32 bits, but also that the address bus grew from 24
to 32 bits. The address space was 256 times bigger, thus Nvidia’s
devices could occupy much more of it. We could implement many virtual
FIFOs, so that each application could have a <i>valid</i> mapping to one
of them. The device, <i>not the operating system</i>, would ensure that
only one of the virtual FIFOs was mapped to the single physical FIFO. A
process accessing a virtual FIFO that wasn’t mapped to the physical FIFO
would cause an interrupt, but this time the interrupt would go to the
device’s driver, not the page fault handler. The driver could perform
the context switch, and re-assign the physical FIFO to the new virtual
FIFO. It would also have to copy page table entries from the CPU’s MMU
into the IOMMU to reflect the placement of the new process’ pages in
physical memory. There would be no page fault so no knowledge of the
device in the operating system’s page fault handler. As we wrote in the
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5918050A/">’050
patent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the use of many identically-sized input/output device address spaces
each assigned for use only by one application program allows the
input/output addresses to be utilized to determine which application
program has initiated any particular input/output write operation.
</blockquote>
Because applications each saw their own virtual FIFO, future chips could
implement multiple physical FIFOs, allowing the virtual FIFO of more
than one process to be assigned a physical FIFO, which would reduce the
need for context switching.<br />

One of the great things about NeWS was that it was programmed in
PostScript. We had figured out how to make PostScript
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented</a>,
homomorphic to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">SmallTalk</a>. We
organized objects in the window system in a class hierarchy with
inheritance. This, for example, allowed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hopkins">Don Hopkins</a> to
implement <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/05/pie-menus.html">pie
menus</a> for NeWS in such a way that any user could replace the
traditional rectangular menus with pie menus. This was such fun that
Owen Densmore and I used the same technique to
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5187786A/en">implement
object-oriented programming for the Unix shell</a>.<br /> <br /> At a
time when PC memory maxed out at 640 megabytes, the fact that the PCI
bus could address 4 gigabytes meant that quite a few of its address bits
were surplus. So we decided to increase the amount of data shipped in
each bus cycle by using some of them as data. IIRC NV1 used 23 address
bits, occupying 1/512th of the total space. 7 of the 23 selected one of
the 128 virtual FIFOs, allowing 128 different processes to share access
to the hardware. We figured 128 processes was plenty.<br /> <br />

The remaining 16 address bits could be used as data. In theory the FIFO
could be 48 bits wide, 32 from the data lines on the bus and 16 from the
address lines, a 50% increase in bits per bus cycle. NV1 ignored the
byte part of the address so the FIFO was only 46 bits wide.<br /> <br />
So we organized the objects in our I/O architecture in a class
hierarchy, rooted at class CLASS. The first thing an application did was
to invoke the <tt>enumerate()</tt> method on the object representing
class CLASS. This returned a list of the names of all the instances of
class CLASS, i.e. all the object types this instance of the architecture
implemented. In this way capabilities of the device weren’t wired in to
the application. The application asked the device what its capabilities
were. In turn, the application could invoke <tt>enumerate()</tt> on each
of the instances of class CLASS in the list, which would get the
application a list of the names of each of the instances of each class,
perhaps <tt>LINE-DRAWER</tt>.Thus the application would find out rather
than know <i>a priori</i> the names of all the resources (virtual
objects) of all the different types that the device supported.<br />
<br /> The application could then create objects, instances of these
classes, by invoking the <tt>instantiate()</tt> method on the class
object with a 32-bit name for the newly created object. The interface
was thus limited to 4B objects for each application. The application
could then <tt>select()</tt> the named object, causing an interrupt if
there was no entry for it in the translation table so the resource
manager could create one. The 64Kbyte address space of each FIFO was
divided into 8 8K “sub-areas”. The application could <tt>select()</tt>
an object in each, so it could operate on 8 objects at a time.
Subsequent writes to each sub-area were interpreted as method
invocations on the selected object, the word offset from the base of
each sub-area within the 8Kbyte space specifying the method and the data
being the argument to the method. The interface thus supported 2048
different methods per object.<br /> <br /> In this way we ensured that
all knowledge of the physical resources of the device was contained in
the resource manager. It was the resource manager that implemented class
CLASS and its instances. Thus it was that the resource manager
controlled which instances of class CLASS (types of virtual object) were
implemented in hardware, and which were implemented by software in the
resource manager. It was possible to store the resource manager’s code
in read-only memory on the device’s PCI card, inextricably linking the
device and its resource manager. The only thing the driver for the board
needed to be able to do was to route the device’s interrupts to the
resource manager.<br /> <br /> The importance of the fact that all an
application could do was to invoke methods on virtual objects was that
the application could not know whether the object was implemented in
hardware or in the resource manager’s software. The flexibility to make
this decision at any time was a huge advantage. As Kim quotes
<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305">Michael Hara as
saying</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This was the most brilliant thing on the planet. It was our secret
sauce. If we missed a feature or a feature was broken, we could put it
in the resource manager and it would work.”
</blockquote>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>As you can see, NV1 was very far from the
“<a href="https://www.editiongroup.com/us/insights/minimum-viable-product-guide-for-founders">minimal
viable product</a>” beloved of today’s VCs. Their idea is to get
something into users’ hands as soon as possible, then iterate rapidly
based on their feedback. But what Nvidia’s VCs did by giving us the time
to develop a real chip architecture was to enable Nvidia, after the
failure of the first product, to iterate rapidly based on the second.
Iterating rapidly on graphics chips <i>requires</i> that applications
not know the details of successive chip’s hardware.<br /> <br /> I have
been privileged in my career to work with extraordinarily skilled
engineers. Curtis Priem was one, others included James Gosling, the late
Bill Shannon, Steve Kleiman, and Jim Gettys.
<a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=rosenthal,priem&amp;oq=inventor:+rosenthal+inventor:+priem">This
search</a> returns 2 Sun patents and 19 Nvidia patents for which both
Curtis Priem and I are named inventors. Of the Nvidia patents, Curtis is
the lead inventor on 9 and I am the lead inventor on the rest. Most
describe parts of the Nvidia architecture, combining Curtis’ exceptional
understanding of hardware with my understanding of operating systems to
redefine how I/O should work. I rate this architecture as my career best
engineering. It was certainly the most impactful. Thank you,
Curtis!<br /> <br /></p>

Atom over RSS, and were trying to tilt the table towards Atom. The goal
was
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>,
not to give Google or IBM control of the syndication format of the open

over $2.5 million over several months:
</p>

<p>
The driver, Sayee Chaitainya Reddy Devagiri, placed expensive orders
from a fraudulent customer account in the DoorDash app. Then, using
DoorDash employee credentials, he manually assigned the orders to driver
accounts he and the others involved had created. Devagiri would then
mark the undelivered orders as complete and prompt DoorDash’s system to
pay the driver accounts. Then he’d switch those same orders back to “in
process” and do it all over again. Doing this “took less than five
minutes, and was repeated hundreds of times for many of the orders,”
writes the US Attorney’s Office…

<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2tjsq6a4vn6pww2iva5qj23v">Andrew
Hickey</a> whose <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/">podcast</a> I
support, also appears to be strongly against people using ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
I am a programmer, so you might think I’d see it the same way because
what I do is similar to what musicians and prose writers do in that I
create “intellectual property” which can be easily copied.
</p>
<p>
But we have a different culture in software, we tend to by default share
what we do and let other people use it. They’re supposed to credit us,
but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever
isn’t bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.
</p>
<p>
What’s funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he’s benefited
from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible
without some people thinking it’s more important to create the medium he
could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have
kept him out.
</p>
<p>
Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic
because that’s basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to
say “no one did anything first” (paraphrasing) and that’s basically the
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html">same
idea</a>.
</p>
<p>
And I don’t doubt that the next big media invention, the next
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=podcasting">podcasting</a>
perhaps, will benefit enormously from having ChatGPT available for the
people developing it.

<p>Don’t believe the Chinese AI open-source hype, warns good friend,
Pete Warden. Their large language models come at a price — the models
are programmed to deliberately obscure historical truths, he writes on
his blog. He points out that this isn’t just censorship; it’s engineered
misinformation at scale, baked into the foundation of future
AI. Warden compares answers to the same query using different models to
support his conclusions.</p>

I don’t know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers
who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don’t
have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an
asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over
Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse
and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E">grabbing</a>
Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We
do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can
