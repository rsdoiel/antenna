W7700 running on Raspberry Pi</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-15, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">AMD
Radeon PRO W7700 running on Raspberry Pi</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-amd-radeon-pro-w7700-workstation-graphics-card.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi 5 with AMD Radeon PRO W7700 graphics card&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
After <em>years</em> of work among a bunch of people in the Pi community
(special callout to Coreforge!), we finally have multiple generations of
AMD graphics cards working on the Raspberry Pi 5.
</p>
<p>
We <a href="TODO">recently got Polaris-era GPUs working</a> (like the
RX460), but in the past month we’ve gotten 6000 and 7000-series GPUs up
and running. And many parts of the driver work at full performance—well,
as much as can be had on the Raspberry Pi’s single PCIe Gen 3 lane (8
GT/sec)!
</p>
<p>
I’ve been testing tons of modern AAA games, like Doom Eternal and Crysis
Remastered, and can get 10-15 fps at 4K with Ray Tracing on, or 15-20
fps at 4K. Dropping down to 1080p is not enough to overcome the Pi’s CPU
bottleneck—only at resolutions under 720p does the Pi’s CPU and the
single PCIe lane not seem to get in the way <em>quite</em> as much.

on the History of Bad Password Policies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-15, updated: 2024-11-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Stuart Schechter makes some
<a href="https://stuartschechter.org/posts/password-history/">good
points</a> on the history of bad password policies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Morris and Thompson’s work brought much-needed data to highlight a
problem that lots of people suspected was bad, but that had not been
studied scientifically. Their work was a big step forward, if not for
two mistakes that would impede future progress in improving passwords
for decades.
</p>
<p>
First, was Morris and Thompson’s confidence that their solution, a
password policy, would fix the underlying problem of weak passwords.
They incorrectly assumed that if they prevented the specific categories
of weakness that they had noted, that the result would be something
strong. After implementing a requirement that password have multiple
characters sets or more total characters, they wrote:…

the criteria. It also has storage. And can publish. And unlike other
social web systems, it is textcasting-ready since it comes from the
world of blogging where we competed to give writers the features they
needed. We can build lots of apps on this foundation.</p>

new security iPhone security feature with iOS 18: if the phone hasn’t
been used for a few days, it automatically goes into its “Before First
Unlock” state and has to be rebooted.
</p>
<p>
This is a really good security feature. But various police departments
don’t like it, because it makes it harder for them to unlock suspects’
phones.

<h1 id="2024-11-13-a-big-memex">
2024-11-13 A big memex
</h1>
<p>
How big are your memories? Some days they seem endless. Perhaps you
started using an external add-on brain, a memory extender (memex) – a
blog, like I did. It’s about 20 years old, now. The
<a href="archives">archives</a> show the first blog posts showed up in
2002. I think I copied some entries over from Meatball, at the time. So
I’m not entirely sure when this particular site started.
</p>
<p>
Back then, I was big into wikis. I was a
<a href="http://meatballwiki.org/">Meatball Wiki</a> regular. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">history of blogs</a> show
that they entered the mainstream around 2004. I thought they were for
people who couldn’t edit and couldn’t collaborate. The text is written
and then sinks to the bottom to join the forgotten posts of the past.
Wiki pages, on the other hand, were forever!
</p>
<p>
This site started as a wiki. And then something happened: I realized
that the things I wanted to write under one heading changed over time.
Sometimes I changed my mind. Sometimes I cared for a different aspect. I
realized that I couldn’t go back to edit the old pages and just replace
the old words with the new words. I wanted to capture this slow churn.
</p>
<p>
All of this came back to me when
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@somi" title="@somi@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="somi">@somi</span></a> asked on fedi:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
for those that maintain personal wikis by hand, how do you approach it
generally? Do you try and associate pages by topic? Do you maintain some
sort of hierarchical table-of-contents? Maybe you tag stuff? Do you put
it all in one big bag?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now you know what happened. My site started as a wiki and has drifted
towards a blog.
</p>
<p>
How it works: The blog posts are wiki pages starting with an ISO date.
These pages are automatically added to the front page.
</p>
<p>
Pages have hashtags and if a page with that name exists (not all hashtag
pages exist) then a link from the hashtag page back to the tagged blog
post gets added automatically. The result is that every hashtag page has
a subset of my blog posts, gathering all the blog posts for that
particular topic.
</p>
<p>
If I write about a thing, I use hashtags. After a while I might think
that I’ve written so much about this topic, time to create a dedicated
page for this hashtag. I add a list of links to existing pages with that
tag and from now on pages with this hashtag get added automatically.
</p>
<p>
Visitors (and I) can visit the hashtag page to see how my writing about
the topic has evolved (or not).
</p>
<p>
I think the big driver of this is that my memex is over twenty years old
and has thousands of pages. Going back to old pages to update them does
not works for me. 😧
</p>
<p>
Writing more about a topic, and linking old and new does work.

<p>There isn’t a single social web network that I like pouring my
creativity into. I feel like I’m being used not appreciated. There’s
nothing in it for me. I had a similar feeling for Twitter, but they were
the only one. Now there are a bunch, and I honestly don’t care about any
of them, esp now that the election is over. I think this whole idea of
feeding the greed of a bunch of tech people is over. If there’s a good
place to gather, with a small number of people I relate to as people,
then I’m up for that, but none of these services meet that need.</p>

Whenever you ask for something with Bluesky they tell you about how a
user account is like a website, you just have to make it work a certain
way, that some devs have mastered, and I guess I could too, but right
now all my attention is focused on WordPress and getting it to work well
with ActivityPub so my editor can get directly into the Mastodon network
and possibly with Threads too.
</p>
<p>
But what about Bluesky which is growing like a weed now??
</p>
<p>
It might be easy for the right person.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Come up with an interface that makes it so that a WordPress blog is just
a user on the Bluesky network.
</li>
<li>
They have a nice API, I’ve just spent a year implementing on top of it.
I imagine for someone who knows both WordPress and Bluesky this might be
a weekend project?
</li>
<li>
Do it, and blow our minds! There’s a lot of content out there in
WordPress and a lot of people publish on it.
</li>
<li>
And the best part of it is that it totally drives adoption of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> which is my not so
hidden agenda. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</li>
<li>
And for the people who are starting to think it’s only an ActivityPub
thing, think again.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you do this you might not win the Nobel Peace Prize but you will be
Nerd of the Year in my book!

On Biden and the Genocide:
</p>
<p>
I dislike the expression “believe them when they tell you” because it is
so overused.
</p>
<p>
But maybe it is overused because our own cognitive dissonance pushes us
to deny what is right in front of our eyes and we keep making up excuses

If we learned one thing out of this election is that “they are just
supporting Israel for now because of the election and their hands are
tied, but they will course correct later when they win” were pure mental
gymnastics

They did what they meant to do

They support the genocide.

<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/mobIncited.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It’s
good to have a record of the things you posted and when you posted it.
On August 12 of this year, I tweeted
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3kzjvirjq3d2q">this</a>:
“When the NYT makes Trump sound like a reasonable candidate that a sane
person might vote for, remember this day.” I included a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/trumpIncitesMob.png">screen
shot</a> of the front page of the NYT on Jan 7, 2021. One in three Trump
voters still
<a href="https://x.com/froomkin/status/1856384929476624841">watch
mainstream news</a>, which follows the lead of the NYT, and if they had
been straight with us, perhaps enough people who like Trump’s style
would have realized the danger, and voted in a conservative way, ie to
conserve the Constitution. Because of how they covered it, we now get to
re-run the 2016 experiment all over again.
</p>
<p>
But, as
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trump-won-what-now-with-heather-cox-richardson/id1583132133?i=1000676185735">Heather
Cox Richardson</a> points out in Jon Stewart’s weekly podcast (a
must-listen) – we have more experience too, and perhaps will know better
how to deal with Trump and know that <b>his bark is often worse than his
bite.</b> I have to say as the new reality sinks in, I’m not as scared
as I was on Election Night last week or even Election Night in 2016. A
lot of people will sell out this time who didn’t before. But the
problems of climate change have gotten worse in the intervening years,
and people feel it in their bones, pocketbooks and fears. You think
inflation was bad? This will be far worse and it’s happening now, and
nothing we can do at a human scale will make it go away.
</p>
<p>
We’re dealing with a very unusual drought in the eastern US now. Fires
are breaking out where we never used to have them. Yeah this shit is
real, and even people who don’t believe in science are feeling it.
</p>
<p>
As someone once said, you should
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/xdc8t4/never_let_a_good_crisis_go_to_waste/">never
waste a good crisis</a>. A lot of other people feel compelled to move.
Unfortunately some are moving to the wrong place, as they always do.
Making change isn’t easy, but is possible, if you understand how people
move. As they try to figure out what the Dem’s failed at, that’s it.
</p>
<p>
Skate to where the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/1bvv11l/i_skate_to_where_the_puck_is_going_to_be_not/">puck
will be</a>, not where it was, as another famous philosopher once said.
And people don’t listen to their friends, they listen to their
competitors (which I said, sadly, but then put that fact to use to get
various standards to fly by without debate). There is a method to human
madness, in other words, imho.

Last week, reverse-cycle air conditioning was finally installed at our
place and <em>my god</em>, it’s so much more efficient than the plug-in
electric heaters we used to have to put everywhere. Judging by the last
few days, we’re going to save <em>hundreds</em> of dollars a year on
power bills. More money for nappies, hooray!

<p>Update: My guess is that they haven’t released enough code to run a
Bluesky of your own, because all the answers from people who say they
know say the same thing – “It doesn’t work that way.” You <i>could</i>
write your own, but if we were to do that, why use their one-off API,
use a standard instead, and we might have a chance to interop with other
systems in a meaningful way. I don’t blame them for wanting to cash out,
but I do blame them for conning people into believing it’s some kind of
escape. Until I hear otherwise Bluesky is a dead-end, not worth
investing your hope in. If you’re migrating from Twitter this is no
better. Keep looking. But I promise to let you know if I get any info
that changes my opinion, so if I’ve got it wrong, people from Bluesky,
just answer the freaking question in the post at the top of this page.
Thanks.</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to pause some of my work getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/680&quot;&gt;a current-gen AMD graphics card running on the Pi 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/52&quot;&gt;testing a 192-core AmpereOne server&lt;/a&gt; to quickly post on the M4&#39;s efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

</p>
<p>
I expected M4 to be better than M1/M2 (I haven’t personally tested M3),
and I hoped it would at least match the previous total-system-power
efficiency king, a tiny arm SBC with an RK3588 SoC… but I didn’t expect
it to jump forward <em>32%</em>. Efficiency gains on the Arm systems I
test typically look like 2-5% year over year.
</p>
<p>
The M4 mini I just bought reaches <strong>6.74 Gflops/W</strong> on the
HPL benchmark.
</p>
<p>
I can get 283 Gflops at 42W, versus 264 at 66W on my M1 Max Mac Studio
(for a round 4.00 Gflops/W).

If you haven&#39;t heard of him, he&#39;s one of the few reasons working with Linux on Rockchip SBCs is so much easier today than it was just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
His <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Riek/ubuntu-rockchip">Ubuntu
Rockchip distribution</a> is built for Ubuntu 22 and 24, and they’ve
been maybe the most popular and stable way to run Ubuntu on Rockchip
devices.
</p>
<p>
So popular, in fact, that manufacturers who use Rockchip, like
<a href="https://docs.turingpi.com/docs/turing-rk1-flashing-os#image-types-and-download-source">Turing
Pi</a>, build their own official images on top of Joshua’s.

I’ve been writing about the problem with lawful-access backdoors in
encryption for decades now: that as soon as you create a mechanism for
law enforcement to bypass encryption, the bad guys will use it too.
</p>
<p>
Turns out the same thing
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/fbi-says-hackers-are-sending-fraudulent-police-data-requests-to-tech-giants-to-steal-peoples-private-information/">is
true</a> for non-technical backdoors:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The advisory said that the cybercriminals were successful in
masquerading as law enforcement by using compromised police accounts to
send emails to companies requesting user data. In some cases, the
requests cited false threats, like claims of human trafficking and, in
one case, that an individual would “suffer greatly or die” unless the
company in question returns the requested information…

I don’t really anticipate it replacing Mastodon as my go-to social media
given that all posts there are public and it seems more… broadcast-y…
than the Fediverse, but I figured there’s no harm using it <em>in

<h1 id="2024-11-10-weltensegler">
2024-11-10 Weltensegler
</h1>
<p>
Wir haben letzthin im
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/Internet%20Office%20Hours">Internet
Office Hours Podcast</a> wieder über Traveller geredet.
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@hasran" title="@hasran@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="hasran">@hasran</span></a> meinte zu Beginn
der Sendung: Schreiben wir einen Traveller Klon und wann tun wir das?
Ich denke auch, dass wir ein kurzes, einfaches Regelwerk brauchen.
</p>
<p>
Jetzt haben wir damit angefangen. Ich habe es
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/index">Weltensegler</a>
genannt.
</p>
<p>
Unser Zielbild, für den Moment:
</p>
<p>
Hasran: “Als Spiel soll Weltensegler ermöglichen, eigene Welten und
Abenteuer im Stile klassischer Science Fiction Literatur erlebbar zu
machen.”
</p>
<p>
Ich: “Weltensegler soll ein relativ kurzes 2W6 basiertes Science Fiction
Rollenspiel sein, auf Deutsch, für alles von Star Wars bis Perry Rhodan,
von Star Trek bis Dune.”
</p>
<p>
Wir sind beide grosse Fans vom ursprünglichen Classic Traveller Gerüst.
Also haben wir damit mal angefangen:
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/figuren">Personagenerschaffung</a>,
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/erfahrung">Berufserfahrung</a>,
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/karriere">Karrieren</a>.
Es fehlen noch ein paar Tabellen aber grundsätzlich steht schon einiges.
Und wenn wir nicht weiter wissen, hilft uns
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="wandererbill">@wandererbill</span></a> mit
Traveller 5 Erfahrung. 😄
</p>
<p>
Allerdings habe ich für mich beschlossen, dass ich für Weltensegler bei
den Regeln bleiben will, die ich am Tisch schon verwendet habe.
Erstaunlicherweise waren das nie die Preislisten. Viel wichtiger war der
Tech Level der Welt und das wars. Ausrüstung war geschenkt, gesponsert,
geklaut, aus dem Ship Locker, oder aus der Lebensgeschichte heraus
gegeben. Ich glaube, ich habe als Spieler nur einmal eine Sonnenbrille
für 100 Cr. gekauft, mehr nicht. Entsprechend habe ich unter Ausrüstung
eine Seite für
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/feudalismus">Wirtschaft
ohne Geld</a> erstellt.
</p>
<p>
Aus dem gleichen Grund habe ich auch noch nie ein Schiff nach den Regeln
zusammengebaut. Mal schauen, wie es bei Hasran aussieht. Ich glaube
jedenfalls, dass er schon gerne Preislisten hätte.

<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Traveller">#Traveller</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Weltensegler">#Weltensegler</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-11-12</strong>. Gestern mal ein PDF generiert. Es sind
schon 35 Seiten! Von wegen “kurz”. Oje!
</p>
<p>
Und bezüglich Schiffsbauregeln habe ich gestern Zeit damit verbraten,
ein Universelles Schiffsprofil zu machen. Die Idee ist, jedes Schiff in
6 Ziffern fassen zu können. Sagen wir: Irgendwie gibt es eine Grösse und
einen Preis, die ein “Budget” vorgibt und einen Technologielevel, der
Maximalwerte vorgibt. Dabei ist zu beachten, dass der Bau von
Raumschiffen mit Technologielevel 10 beginnt.
</p>
<p>
Vorschlag: <strong>Grösse</strong> (1–F), <strong>Sprungweite</strong>
(1–5), <strong>Geschwindigkeit</strong> (ungerade Zahlen = Landung
möglich), <strong>Computer</strong>, <strong>Personen</strong>,
<strong>Geschütze</strong>. Es braucht entweder eine Person oder einen
Computer für folgende Rollen: Falls Sprungweite gegeben, Navigator;
falls Geschwindigkeit gegeben, Pilot; falls Sprungweite oder
Geschwindigkeit gegeben, Kraftmaschinen; pro Geschütz, Artillerie; pro
10 weiteren Personen, Gastronomie.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
100101 – ein Geschützturm mit einem Feuerleitcomputer
</li>
<li>
105111 - ein Jäger der Chasseur-Klasse, ohne Sprungtriebwerk, schnell,
kann landen, ein Pilot, ein Geschützturm mit einem Feuerleitcomputer
</li>
<li>
205122 - ein Bomber der Incendière-Klasse, ohne Sprungtriebwerk,
schnell, kann landen, ein Pilot, zwei Geschütztürme mit einem
Feuerleitcomputer und einem Artilleristen
</li>
<li>
100010 – eine Rettungskapsel der Sauveur-Klasse für eine Person, kann
nicht springen, sich nicht bewegen, nicht landen
</li>
<li>
301150 – eine Raumfähre der Navette-Klasse für den Transport zwischen
Raumstation und Oberfläche, kann nicht springen, ist langsam aber kann
landen, ein Computer, ein Pilot, viel Platz für Personen, keine
Geschütze
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Und so weiter. Wie viele Personen schlussendlich eine 5 bei der Navette
bedeutet, braucht wohl eine Tabelle. Oder sind es 2⁵ also 32 minus Pilot
= 31 Passagiere? Falls es Laderaum gibt, könnten es dann weniger
Personen sein. Und warum das jetzt der Grösse 3 entspricht, ist mir auch
nicht klar. Irgendwas mit Quadrat, Kubik, Exponent und Quersummen?

<p>I wrote
<a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2024/11/11/the-dems-reek-of-fear-of-men/">this
piece</a> this morning on my iPad before I got up. It’s a third rail
piece. A couple of weeks ago I wouldn’t have posted it for fear that it
would ruin my life. Today it has to be said because I’m pretty sure this
is where we have to start rebuilding the opposition party of the US.</p>

absolutely no doubt in my mind that what’s missing in the two-party
system in the US is that one of the parties does not own a social
network. It is not represented online 7-by-24-by-12 every year, not just
presidential election years. Democrats, when you lose it’s because you
didn’t show up. It’s happened three times so far, at least. We could
have led here because most of the innovators in this space vote
Democratic, but the leadership doesn’t listen. The voters could get to
know all the stars of the parties. People were right when they said they
didn’t know Harris. It’s time to let the leaders rise from the net, not
just from the insiders. This is how you do it.</p>
