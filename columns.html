Dewayne Hendricks, my friend of nearly four decades, passed away last
Friday at age 74. His
<a href="https://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/140305-slides.pdf">mentors</a>
were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster
Fuller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran">Paul
Baran</a>. He was a pioneer of wireless Internet connectivity, a serial
entrepreneur, curator of an influential e-mail list, and for the last 30
years on the organizing committee of the
<a href="https://amw.org">Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop</a>.<br />
<br /> For someone of his remarkable achievements he has left very
little impression on the Web. An example is his
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewayne-hendricks-b118">Linkedin
profile</a>. Below the fold I collect the pieces of his story that I
know or have been able to find from his other friends. If I can find
more I will update this post. Please feel free to add information in the
comments.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3>
Wayne State University
</h3>
Dewayne was a student at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_State_University">Wayne
State</a>, where he got into systems programming for the IBM 370. They
ran the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan
Terminal System</a> on a 512K 370/155. He tried to run the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle_upon_Tyne">University
of Newcastle</a>’s CMTS, an experimental version of MTS that didn’t use
dynamic address translation, and ran into performance problems. He
worked with Larry Chace at the University of Illinois to get it running
on their 1+2M 360/75. After Chace rewrote it to swap pages to their 2301
drum storage it ran well.<br />
<h3>
Southern Illinois University
</h3>
While at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Illinois_University">Southern
Illinois Univerity</a> in the ’70s he worked for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster
Fuller</a> and continued his involvement in IBM systems programming, now
for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)">VM/370</a>.
Melinda Varian, historian of that era of IBM’s groundbreaking
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)">SHARE</a> user
group, wrote in
<a href="https://www.leeandmelindavarian.com/Melinda/25paper.pdf"><i>VM
and the VM Community: Past, Present, and Future</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Dewayne Hendricks reported at SHARE XLII, in March, 1974, that he had
successfully implemented MVT-CP handshaking for page faulting, so that
when MVT running under VM took a page fault, CP would allow MVT to
dispatch another task while CP brought in the page. At the following
SHARE, Dewayne did a presentation on further modifications, including
support for SIOF and a memory-mapped job queue. With these changes, his
system would allow multi-tasking guests actually to multi-task when
running in a virtual machine. Significantly, his modifications were
available on the Waterloo Tape.<br /> <br /> Dewayne became the chairman
of the Operating Systems Committee of the SHARE VM Project. Under his
guidance, the Committee prepared several detailed requirements for
improvements to allow guest systems to perform better. At SHARE XLV, in
1975, the Committee presented IBM with a White Paper entitled Operating
Systems Under VM/370, which discussed the performance problems of guests
under VM and the solutions that customers had found for these problems.
Many of the solutions that Dewayne and others had found, such as PAGEX,
made their way into VM fairly quickly, apparently as the result of
customers’ persistence in documenting them. By SHARE 49, Dewayne was
able to state that, “It is now generally understood that either MFT or
MVT can run under VM/370 with relative batch throughput greater than 1.”
That is to say, they had both been made to run significantly faster
under VM than on the bare hardware. Dewayne and others did similar work
to improve the performance of DOS under VM.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Amateur Radio
</h3>
Dewayne was a major figure in developing and sustaining the use of
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">amateur packet
radio</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He has been involved with radio since receiving his amateur radio
operator’s license as a teen. He currently holds official positions in
several national non-profit amateur radio organizations and is a
director of the Wireless Communications Alliance, an industry group
representing manufacturers in the unlicensed radio industry.
</blockquote>
In
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">particular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Back in 1986, he ported the popular KA9Q Internet Protocol package to
the Macintosh, allowing the Macintosh platform to be used in packet
radio networks. Today, thousands of amateur radio operators worldwide
use the NET/Mac system he developed to participate in the global packet
radio Internet. This system continues to be developed and deployed by
the amateur radio service.
</blockquote>
Dewayne was a member of the
<a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/who-we-are/">Amateur Radio Digital
Communications Grants Evaluation Team</a> from 2021 to his death. ARDC
grants around <a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/">$5M/year</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
ARDC makes grants to projects and organizations that are experimenting
with new ways to advance both amateur radio and digital communication
science. Experimentation by amateur radio operators has benefited
society in many ways, including the development of the mobile phone and
wireless internet technology. ARDC envisions a world where all such
technology is available through open source hardware and software, and
where anyone has the ability to innovate upon it. To see examples of the
types of grants we make, go to

</blockquote>
<h3>
Tetherless Access
</h3>
One of the many ahead-of-their-time companies Dewayne started was
Tetherless Access. He co-founded it with Charlie Brown in 1990 to
develop wireless Metropolitan Access Networks. It went public in 1996 on
NASDAQ and folded two years later. The idea was to use the 900MHz
unlicensed spectrum to distribute Internet connectivity from a base
station via point-to-point links, in contrast to Metricom’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Ricochet</a>
service, started by Dewayne’s mentor Paul Baran, which four years later
used mesh network technology in the same spectrum.<br /> <br />

<h3>
NSF Projects
</h3>
Dewayne was involved in a number of NSF funded experiments in using
wireless to
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">connect remote
communities</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior to forming Dandin Group, he was the General Manager of the
Wireless Business Unit for Com21, Inc. He joined Com21 following an
opportunity to participate as the Co-Principal Investigator in the
National Science Foundation’s Wireless Field Tests for Education
project. The project sucessfully connected remote educational
institutions to the Internet. The test sites ranged from rural primary
schools in Colorado, USA to a University in Ulaan Bataar, Mongolia.
</blockquote>
Com21 was founded by Dewayne’s mentor Paul Baran.<br /> <br /> The PI
for connecting Mongolia to the Internet for the first time in 1996 was
the
“<a href="https://cyberplayground.org/2021/10/19/rip-rip-colonel-dave-hughes-aka-the-cursor-cowboy-has-passed-on/">Cursor
Cowboy</a>” Colonel Dave Hughes, an equally remarkable character who was
a pioneer of bulletin boards starting in 1981!. The NSF funded a
256Kbit/s satellite dish, the State Department shipped it to the US
embassy in Ulan Bator via the “diplomatic pouch”, and Dewayne and Glenn
Tenney travelled via Beijing to deploy 900MHz links across the
city.<br /> <br /> The Dandin Group, Dewayne’s next company
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000301193938/http://www.dandin.com/projects.html">was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a partner in the Advanced Networking Project with Minority Serving
Institutions (AN-MSI) an EDUCAUSE project funded by the National Science
Foundation. The project’s purpose is to provide improved communication
services, including Internet access, to underserved minority and
tribal-nation institutions. Because these institutions are frequently in
remote locations which currently lack communication infrastructures,
Internet-linked services delivered by wireless networks offer the most
appropriate and cost-effective approach to connecting their communities
to the world and to each other.
</blockquote>
The project description is
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000709165341/http://www.dandin.com/pdf/AN-MSI_Project_Description.pdf">here</a>.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000711102526/http://www.dandin.com/pdf/EDUCAUSEPR110199.pdf"><i>NSF
Awards $6 Million to Help Minority Schools Prepare for Advanced Computer
Networks</i></a> is EDUCAUSE’s press release:<br />
<blockquote>
National Science Foundation (NSF) Director Rita Colwell announced last
week at EDUCAUSE ’99 that the foundation has awarded almost $6 million
over four years to help institutions of higher learning that
traditionally serve minority communities prepare for the next generation
of information technology and computer networks. The grant will be
administered by EDUCAUSE.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Developing Countries
</h3>
Dewayne was not just active in getting Internet service to under-served
communities with the NSF. The
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">bio on his
website</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>
Tetherless Access was one of the first companies to develop and deploy
Part 15 unlicensed wireless metropolitan area data networks using the
TCP/IP protocols. He has participated in the installation of these
networks in other parts of the world including: Kenya, Tonga, Mexico,
Canada and Mongolia.

Amara Angelica reported that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000307045638/http://www.techweek.com/articles/8-23-99/wireless.htm"><i>Tonga
first to go wireless for telecommunications</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“We’re replacing the entire existing telecom infrastructure with a
wireless IP [Internet protocol] network,” says Dewayne Hendricks, CEO of
Fremont-based Dandin Group and former general manager of Com21’s
wireless business unit. “Since the country is a monarchy, there was only
one guy to convince, Crown Prince Tupouto’a, and then we just went for
it.”<br /> <br /> Hendricks’ firm plans to replace Tonga Telecom’s aging
landline system—which still uses mechanical relays—with a broadband
wireless network for data, video and telephony (using voice over IP). It
will run at 30Mbps with user access at 2Mbps and 10Mbps by the end of
next year. “We can get all the spectrum we want,” Hendricks says.<br />
<br /> The prince’s objective, Hendricks says, is to convert the
country’s largely agricultural workforce, which has an astonishing 95
percent literacy rate, into knowledge workers, such as programmers. The
government launched the Royal School of Science for Distance Learning
last year, using Internet connections to allow students to take courses
at international universities. There are just fewer than 100,000 people
in Tonga scattered across 170 islands.<br /> <br /> “We’re going to an
Internet-style mesh network,” says Hendricks. MMDS, which some carriers
are using to deliver broadband services, won’t scale well for an IP
network, he says. Hendricks, a technical advisor to the FCC on
ultrawideband (UWB) technology, is considering UWB for the network.
</blockquote>
<a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">Tonga had</a> about 11,000
households and 6,500 phone customers, with an 8-year wait to get a
phone. The goals of the project were to deliver 30Mbit/s IP to each home
for a customer end budget of $450.<br /> <br />
<h3>
FCC Technological Advisory Council
</h3>
Dewayne was one of the inaugural members of the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000818002106/http://www.fcc.gov/oet/tac/members.html">Federal
Communications Commission’s Technological Advisory Council</a>, launched
on April 30<sup>th</sup> 1999, together with luminaries such as

AT&amp;T CTO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nagel">David

TAC</a> formed in 2005.<br />
<h3>
Wired Article
</h3>
In the January 2002 edition of <i>Wired</i>, Brent Hurtig’s
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/"><i>Digital
Cowboy</i></a> focused on Dewayne’s work on the reservation:<br />
<blockquote>
At Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation in North Dakota, he’s installing
a wireless network. In its initial form, the system will meet FCC
requirements governing frequency, power, and transmission technology.
But not for long. Hendricks’ mission is to build the best system
possible - even if it’s illegal - and he intends to use every tool at
his disposal. Should the FCC crack down, the tribal leaders will hoist
the flag of Native American sovereignty, asserting that they can do
whatever they want with the sky above their reservation.
</blockquote>
Dewayne’s work on the reservation, in Tonga and elsewhere was an attempt
to demonstrate the problems with the obsolete US
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">spectrum allocation
policy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s no sensible reason why Americans shouldn’t have inexpensive,
ubiquitous, high-performance broadband access, Hendricks says. Using
technologies that are already available or in fast-track development,
everyone could enjoy reliable, fully symmetrical wireless at T1 speed or
better. No more digital divide. No more last-mile problem. No more
compromises. The only things standing in the way are the FCC, Congress,
and “other people who just don’t get it.”
</blockquote>
<h3>
EE380 Talks
</h3>
Dewayne gave three talks to Stanford’s EE380 symposium. The first one
was apparently “in the ’90s on wireless MANs” of which I have so far
found no record.<br /> <br /> The second was on 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2000
entitled
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/000503.html"><i>Wiring
Tonga: From the Ground Up and the Sky Down</i></a>. The abstract
was:<br />
<blockquote>
One of the biggest barriers today standing in the way of deployment of
advanced wireless communications systems turns out not to be the
technology, but restrictions related to regulatory policies. This
presentation will discuss the nature of these barriers and how they have
affected the development of wireless data systems over the years.<br />
<br /> The speaker will also discuss on-going work in which he is
involved to use advanced wireless technology to deploy multiservice IP
systems as part of infrastructure-development projects in the Kingdom of
Tonga and with Native American groups in the US, and how such projects
are able to deal with the limitations imposed by conventional regulatory
barriers.
</blockquote>
The slides are <a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">here</a>.<br />
<br /> The third was on 5<sup>th</sup> March 2014 and entitled
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/140305.html"><i>Inventing
a New Internet: Learning from Icarus</i></a>. The abstract read:<br />
<blockquote>
From a future historical perspective, are we descendants of Icarus? Is
our Internet like Icarus’ wings? Are our protocols, ciphers and codes,
brilliant capabilities built on immature engineering, which like Icarus’
wax and feathers, are capable of taking us to great heights, but
systematically flawed? For a brief historical moment, humanity has flown
high like Icarus, on a vulnerable first generation Internet platform.
Which as been used for securing and using distributed ideas, arts, media
science, commerce, and machines. Promising brilliant futures with the
arrival of networked things, autonomous personalized services and
immersive media. But, now our first generation Internet , built on a
fragile global network of vulnerable codes and protocols, is falling
apart, like Icarus’ wings, through a triple shock from:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Massive dotcom data stalker economy built on mining of terabytes
personal data.
</li>
<li>
Ubiquitous criminal penetration of financial and identity networks, on
our devices, in the cloud.
</li>
<li>
Pervasive state intruders at all levels and every encrypted hardware and
software node.
</li>
</ul>
Humans eventually conquered the barriers to flight and learned to build
durable and resilient aircraft. Similarly, humans must learn to build a
more reliable, private and secure Internet for communications,
innovation and commerce. We will share our thoughts on how we might go
about the design of a more durable and resilient Internet:<br />
<ul>
<li>
How prepared is the Internet for future human benefit?
</li>
<li>
What are the attributes of a future more durable internet?
</li>
<li>
What are the existing assets that could be harnessed?
</li>
<li>
What needs to be developed?
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
dewayne-net
</h3>
<p>For many years Dewayne with impeccable taste curated dewayne-net, an
e-mail list to which he sent links, most he found but some contributed
by his friends. A typical e-mail would have the title of the linked
post, a link, and enough of the content to encourage recipients to read
the whole thing. The last e-mails were two on 19<sup>th</sup> August, as
it happens both links that I had sent him earlier. I have been one of
the more frequent contributors, although only perhaps 20% of my
contributions passed the curatorial filter. Prof. Dave Farber’s
<a href="https://ip.topicbox.com/groups/ip">IP list</a> is a similar and
I believe even longer-standing list; he and Dewayne exchanged links
fairly often.<br /> <br /> As an example of the list in full flow, lets
take April 2022. That month he sent 66 e-mails, many about the COVID
pandemic and the war in Ukraine, obviously both top of mind at the time.
But they included topics including satellite tracking of commercial
aircraft, the Kessler syndrome, the problems of the US patent system,
cybercrime, microplastics, banned math textbooks in Florida, and Elon
Musk’s purchase of Twitter. I am already greatly missing this window
into Dewayne’s eclectic set of interests.<br /> <br /></p>

is what it
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/23/lostCase.png">looks
like</a> when UPS loses a package. It’s a case for the new Google Pixel
9 Pro. It was shipped on Sept 6, at this point that’s 17 days go. It was
hell to just tell Google that the case was lost. I expected at that
point they’d apologize and refund the money. That was a week ago. Just
got an email saying want me to return the case when it arrives. It’s
never going to arrive. Luckily this is a cheap product, just $38. If it
had happened with the $1316 phone that would be a pretty big problem.
It’s amazing that a company the size and age of Google doesn’t have a
procedure for dealing with products that are lost (or more likely
stolen) in transit. I’ve been through this with Amazon, they knew what
to do. Anyway I have a fairly large credit with Google. I don’t dare use
it to purchase anything else from them, given how incompetent they are
at dealing with fairly common customer problems.</p>

in San Diego, I attended Scripps and lectured on cot death for three
months as a guest. Scripps at the time was involved with IBM in
developing a line-of-sight optical network, which worked brilliantly on
campus. It was confined to a couple of experimental computer labs, but
you had to keep your fingers off the mouse or keyboard, or your machine
would overload with web pages if browsing. I believe it never made it
into the world of computers for ordinary users, as the machines of the
day could not keep up.</span>

it could be made to work at a practicable user level.  But in the back

asked of it.</span>

until I learned of <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/">Ubuntu MATE</a>.
The University had a pre-release copy of Ubuntu MATE 14.10, along with a
podcast from Alan Pope and Martin Wimpress, and before I could turn
around I had it on my Asus. It was simple, everything worked, and it
removed the horrors of GNOME 3.</span>

in 2015, my wife became very unwell after a shopping trip. Getting in
touch with some medical friends, they were concerned she’d had a heart
attack. This was near the mark: she had contracted a virus which had
destroyed a third of her heart muscle. It took her a few years to die,
and a miserable time it was for her and for us both. After the funeral,
I had rented out my house and bought a Toyota motorhome, and I began
traveling around the country. I ran my Asus through a solar panel hooked
up to an inverter, a system which worked well and kept the beast
going.</span>

looked at my battered old faithful, my many-times-rebuilt Asus, and
decided the time had come. I started building. Maximum RAM and video
RAM, latest nVidia card, two SSDs, their top-of-the-line WiFi and
Bluetooth chipsets, sound cards, etc. Then, I got it sent to New
Zealand, as I was due back the next day.</span>

next Metabox was described as a Windows 10 machine, but I knew that it
would run Tux beautifully – and so it did. A few tweaks around the ACPI
subsystem and it computed away merrily, with not a BSOD in sight. A
friend of mine who had popped in for a visit was so impressed with it
that he ordered one too, and that arrived about three months later. A
quick wipe of the hard drive (thank you, Gparted!), both these machines
are still running happily, with not a cloud on the horizon.</span>

new Metabox arrived about six weeks ago, and I decided – just out of
curiosity – to leave Windows 11 on it. A most stupid decision, but as my
wife was running Windows 11 and had already blown it up once, needing a
full reset (which, to my surprise, worked), I proceeded to charge it for
the recommended 24 hours, and next day, switched it on. “Hello” it said,
in big white letters, and then the nonsense began… a torrent of unwanted
software proceeded to fill up one of my 8TB NVMe drives, culminating
after many reboots with a Chatbot, an AI “assistant”, and something
called “Co-pilot”. </span>

far, the beast seems most appreciative, and it hums along with just a

the “Bike Angels” System for Moving Bikeshares</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
I always like a good hack. And
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/citi-bike-scam-nyc.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">this
story</a> delivers. Basically, the New York City bikeshare program has a
system to reward people who move bicycles from full stations to empty
ones. By deliberately moving bikes to create artificial problems, and
exploiting exactly how the system calculates rewards, some people are
making a lot of money.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At 10 a.m. on a Tuesday last month, seven Bike Angels descended on the
docking station at Broadway and 53rd Street, across from the Ed Sullivan
Theater. Each rider used his own special blue key -­- a reward from Citi
Bike—­ to unlock a bike. He rode it one block east, to Seventh Avenue. He
docked, ran back to Broadway, unlocked another bike and made the trip
again…

<p>
BTW, to be clear, I have no interest in working on twitter-like systems.
</p>
<p>
It’s been like a prison to writers, we’re stuck with this huge divide,
with crap on both sides.
</p>
<p>
These things exist, they have a jumble of APIs and ways to integrate.
</p>
<p>
And we’ve been playing by the rules laid down by Twitter (ev, biz and
jack) for 18 freaking years. That’s enough.
</p>
<p>
This will never get sorted out until people realize it needs sorting
out.

Friday we went to hear some classical music at the Tonhalle in Zürich.
Thorvaldsdottir’s composition was amazing. Apparently there will be more
Icelandic elements this season. 😄

<p>
On Sunday we went to hear Old Music.

This is the second week of our holidays. We stayed in Zürich and decided
to live as if we’re on a trip: hikes, runs, activities (today:
cycling!), restaurants, museums or concerts. I told myself that we can
spend the hotel budget on cultural events and train rides and suddenly
everything seems possible where until now I would have hesitated. Is it
really worth that much money? But since we’re not paying for the hotel …
I convinced myself that it’s OK.

<p>Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting “both
sides,” how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens
specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course
individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he
<i>doesn’t</i> threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very
revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for
you all to get in sync with the actual American history that’s being
made.</p>

<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/66f038e3-7218-8012-a294-05bb7afa9b97">this
question</a> using Google and StackExchange. There was a bug in this one
line of code, a call to <i>new Date ()</i> in JavaScript, that was
behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The
problem: I was specifying the day as 0 and month, correctly, but the day
had to be 1 in order for it to work and without thinking I had specified
it as 0.</p>
