Former CISA Director Jen Easterly
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jen-easterly_could-the-next-five-eyes-be-the-four-activity-7295808854750081025-GcpE">writes</a>
about a new international intelligence sharing co-op:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Historically, China, Russia, Iran &amp; North Korea have cooperated to
some extent on military and intelligence matters, but differences in
language, culture, politics &amp; technological sophistication have
hindered deeper collaboration, including in cyber. Shifting geopolitical
dynamics, however, could drive these states toward a more formalized
intell-sharing partnership. Such a “Four Eyes” alliance would be
motivated by common adversaries and strategic interests, including an
enhanced capacity to resist economic sanctions and support proxy
conflicts…

<p>
New computer arrived today! It’s replacing my 2020 Intel MacBook Air,
which will be passed on as a hand-me-down to my mum, because her 2012
Dell is on its last legs and she needs an upgrade 😂
</p>
<p>
I thought about using Migration Assistant to transfer stuff across but
then I thought about how much cruft I’ve probably built up and went,
“No, I want to transfer stuff manually so I can be more purposeful about
what I have and where I have it!” The downside is, now I have to
actually make those decisions about what apps to reinstall and how to
organise my files 😒 I feel like I need a checklist.

The US Department of Justice on Wednesday

the indictment of 12 Chinese individuals accused of more than a decade
of hacker intrusions around the world, including eight staffers for the
contractor i-Soon, two officials at China’s Ministry of Public Security
who allegedly worked with them, and two other alleged hackers who are
said to be part of the Chinese hacker group APT27, or Silk Typhoon,
which prosecutors say was involved in the US Treasury breach late last
year.

According to prosecutors, the group as a whole has targeted US state and

whales</a> that were so vexing of early days Twitter.
</p>
<p>
That said, I have two criticisms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They are implementing the same limits that Twitter designed into their
product, no styling, no links, you can’t edit, no titles, enclosures,
and a limit of 300 chars per post. Simple stuff that, if they broke
through the Twitter design, would make it a decent platform for writers.
I don’t see any reason to duplicate the mistakes that Twitter made, in
2006, in the design of their product.
</li>
<li>
They repeatedly claim to be
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-says-x-rival-is-billionaire-proof.html">billionaire-proof</a>
but as far as I can tell, and I have built software on their APIs, they
are not. Yet they tell users they are safe, and what choice do the users
have but to believe them, esp when tech journalism repeats the claims
without challenging them. As a result, people believe that if Bluesky
were to be acquired by a billionaire, something they might not even be
able to stop, they will be able to quickly migrate to something that’s
the same as Bluesky and keep all their connections, people they follow
and people following them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All of this would be nice, if it were true but imho it is not true. I’m
going to go through the recent statement from their CEO in the remainder
of this piece. I invite them to rebut it, esp
<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/mmasnick/">Mike Masnick</a> of
Techdirt, who has journalistic integrity, is widely respected, and is on
the Bluesky board of directors. Honestly I can’t understand why Masnick
puts his integrity on the line here, I’ve tried to discuss it with him,
and I guess he doesn’t take me seriously enough to give a serious
response. I would also like to know what his deal is with them, does he
profit personally if Bluesky is acquired. That needs to be disclosed,
imho. I would do it if I were in his shoes.
</p>
<p>
If you read my blog, I hope you know that I wouldn’t challenge something
like this unless I was pretty sure there is an issue. I don’t imagine
for a second that people would abandon Bluesky if they knew they were
locked in and would have no path out if it was bought by a billionaire.
I know we can’t get out and I still use Bluesky, because that’s where
the people I want to network with are. They won. So they don’t have to
deceive. They can stop making this claim. Yet they continue to do it, in
pretty much exactly the same terms as they have been doing it all along.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the statement that appeared in
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/at-sxsw-bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-pokes-fun-at-mark-zuckerberg-with-latin-phrase-t-shirt/">TechCrunch</a>
yesterday.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I
decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t
like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber
explained at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that
give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one
as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability
to move to a new alternative.”
</li>
<li>
The quote is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Graber">Jay
Graber</a>, the CEO of the company.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let’s go through it, point by point
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“they could fork it off and go on to another application” – in this
sentence “they” applies to developers, because you have to be a
developer to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a>
an application. Assuming Bluesky is available in source code, with an
appropriate open source license, and they have released enough code so
that a developer could quickly launch an exact Bluesky clone, maybe this
part is true. I can’t evaluate it without going through the exercise of
forking their code, but I do know this – no one has. Why not? I would
think that with <a href="https://backlinko.com/bluesky-statistics">27
million users</a>, by now someone would have tried it. Maybe this post
will uncover such an instance, or motivate one. I would be happy to try
it out to see how it works. But it has to be completely independent of
Bluesky. It would have to work, without loss of functionality, if
Bluesky’s network disappeared.
</li>
<li>
“there’s already applications in the network that give you another way
to view the network” – this is true. But they don’t do very much nor do
they have many users. They are basically experiments that show that you
could build something else with the format they have defined. This isn’t
unusual. You can make a lot of different kinds of websites with HTML,
for example, but very few of them have millions of users. Same thing
with apps built on the Bluesky protocol that use data types that Bluesky
itself doesn’t understand. I don’t think this adds anything to the claim
of billionaire-safety. Also if these apps are in the same network, that
doesn’t give us any independence from Bluesky. So I think this is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)">no-op</a>, it adds
nothing but confusion to the claim.
</li>
<li>
“[our] openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a
new alternative” – this is not true, and it’s the crux of the concern.
There is no such guarantee. If there were, we would be able to move to
an alternative now. Where is it? It’s not there and imho it can’t be
there.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are other problems. Mastodon, via its API, actually does what
Bluesky claims to do. There are lots of
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-server-instance">instances</a>
of Mastodon servers and they interop with each other. It’s an incredible
proof of concept. But its federation ability adds enough complexity that
most people prefer Bluesky, which doesn’t have those complications.
There are always tradeoffs in technology. You can have flexibility but
it comes at a price. Bluesky would have you believe you can have the
flexibility of Mastodon without paying the price.
</p>
<p>
There may be a way to do what they promise, but it would mean removing
features, which isn’t a bad idea, but they have decided they have to do
everything Twitter does and there is the conundrum. Twitter was designed
around centralization, and because of that Twitter is <i>not</i>
billionaire-proof as has been
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Business_career">demonstrated</a>,
and neither is Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
Every time I read this quote from their CEO it gets my bile up, and I
say things <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com">on
Bluesky</a> that I regret later. Instead I decided to take the time this
morning to carefully explain the problem and now when they make the
claim, I can point to this piece. And maybe I’m wrong, and they can show
me an instance I can switch to and not lose access to my network of
friends on Bluesky and not depend on the existence of Bluesky itself.
That would actually make me happy (I think) and give me a completely new
understanding of computer science.

2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO
</h1>
<p>
So… Discord might be going there. I like their offering. I even pay them
about $10/month. What they offer works well. People get their own little
communities to administer, with the tools to administer them well, with
the self-written automations and bots to handle communities from a
handful of people to many thousands. Read
<a class="account" href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp" title="@isotopp@infosec.exchange"><span

<a href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp/114116202418228034">perspective
on Discord</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the monetization drive is strong. And once the shareholders are in
place, pressure for monetization will ramp up even more, I’m sure. How
long until it all goes down? Five years?
</p>
<p>
What are your backup plans?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">My backup plan</a> is an
IRC backend (<a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngircd</a> uses about
5M of memory) and two instances of a web front-end called
<a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>. One of them is free
for all and connects to my chat server; the other needs registration and
offers file uploads and always-on connectivity (it acts as a “bouncer”).
The two of them take about 150M of memory. Each registered account gets
a little SQLite file with the logs. No other resources required.
</p>
<p>
You can connect to the IRC backend directly using your favourite IRC
client, of course. Emacs comes with two of them. Just saying. 😄
</p>
<p>
For iOS, there’s <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>.

<p>
For Android,

<a href="https://snikket.org/service/quickstart/">Snikket</a> instead.
Installation requires a Docker image.
</p>
<p>
I dislike Docker, not because of what it is but because of what it
implies. A virtual machine inside your virtual machine means that it
doesn’t auto-update. Upgrading will be tricky. It also means individual
deployment requires multiple services such that it ended up being easier
for them to supply a Docker image instead of supplying good
instructions. I always take that to mean that the setup is brittle and
underdocumented. Perhaps I’m wrong but it that’s the suspicion I have.
</p>
<p>
Generally speaking, I dislike Docker images for my virtual server server
(6G memory, 75g storage, 2 cores) because multiple services packaged in
a dockerfile usually mean lots of resources required. Frugal computing
means that I am loath to accommodate that. I prefer not to upgrade my
virtual machine.

wanted to give Matrix another spin. There are two server
implementations, Synapse and Dendrite.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At an absolute minimum, Dendrite will expect 1GB RAM. For a comfortable
day-to-day deployment which can participate in federated rooms for a
number of local users, be prepared to assign 2-4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM —
more if your user count increases. –

sometimes use the installation at the

<p>
So, where does that leave is? I don’t know. People don’t seem to like
The Lounge with IRC backend and I seem to be unwilling to upgrade my
hosting commitments.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://hackers.town/@mc" title="@mc@hackers.town"><span

wrote in with some interesting feedback. The Zulip part is interesting
because I only used it for tiny bit, talking to the maintainers of
Antora. Here’s what they have to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Zulip is great for UI, slightly aggravating to run. It absolutely wants
a dedicated server. It has a dice roller as one of the sample bots, and
the API is extensive.
</li>
<li>
IRC is extremely easy to setup and relatively easy to write bots for.
Interfaces vary from bare bones to not-bad; The Lounge is up on the
not-bad end, and also easy to host.
</li>
<li>
Matrix may be the future of federated chat systems, but if you don’t
need federation, the complexity and ongoing maintenance are not worth
it.
</li>
<li>
Jitsi has integrated chat but is video-conferencing-centric; the text
chat is actually Prosody (an XMPP/Jabber) server under the hood. Video
processing takes up a lot of CPU and bouncing it around takes a lot of
bandwidth; otherwise, it’s pretty nice.
</li>
<li>
I haven’t tried running Revolt but I looked at the docs and I am really
not favorably inclined. They have some questionable technology choices
and insist on a Docker-first install that in my experience is a likely
sign that there are too many moving parts for anyone to be able to
diagnose what’s going wrong.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My suggestions would be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
IRC is still a solid choice
</li>
<li>
Prosody without the Jitsi video conferencing is pretty nice, albeit a
little complex to configure initially.
</li>
<li>
If I felt like spending the money for a medium-large VM at a hosting
service dedicated to gaming, Zulip would be nice.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I didn’t know about the hosting of Zulip but the rest tracks my
experience. IRC is the simplest option.

destructive for NATO. If anything, pushing European allies to increase
defense spending is going to strengthen NATO.

<p>
Well, I’m assuming that a NATO full of bootlickers would be great for
Trump as he and Putin divvy up Europe.
</p>
<p>
I bet every European country that bough US equipment is super angry
right now.
</p>
<p>
I am super angry because Switzerland, after a long fight against the new
fighter planes, after considering Swedish and French fighter planes,
decided to go with the planes that are the most expensive, the most
unreliable (based on my uninformed opinions), and the most
untrustworthy: the F-35.
</p>
<p>
From a country that bullies its allies and betrays its friends, that
switches off the satellite phones, the intelligence sharing, and
whatever else it damn pleases in order to force a settlement. Which is
within their rights, of course. But also disqualifies them as a friend
for a generation, if you ask me.

a tooth that needs to be pulled. 🤮

With over 400 F-35s projected for Europe by 2030, per Lockheed Martin,
the jet remains a cornerstone of NATO’s air power—but its integration

strategic vulnerability. The U.S. policy restricting independent test
operations outside CONUS, combined with reliance on U.S.-managed MDFs,
ALIS, ODIN, and software updates, amplifies fears of over-dependence. –

… but the problem is not technical. The problem is that in 2025 US has
rather clearly signalled that its subjectively defined “interests” will
now have priority of international agreements.
</p>
<p>
That is, the same agreements towards which the US has over the 30 years
consistently pushed all European countries, and especially the new EU
and NATO joiners. And it made sense as long as the US was the guarantor
of these treaties.
</p>
<p>
What we have now? Let’s say Russia conducts a limited military incursion
into eastern Poland with the objective of controlling the Suwalki
Corridor. This of course is in violation of UN Charter, NATO Charter and
a hundred of bilateral treaties between Russia and EU and Poland. So
what? The 2025 US president now decides a “prolonged defense” is “not in
US interests” and does everything to force “peace” on Poland.
</p>
<p>
“Everything” includes impairing US-delivered weapons systems and
generally creating a powerful impression of stab in the back.
</p>
<p>
A “peace”, in which Poland’s concession is the town of Suwałki, and
Russia’s “concession” is the nearby town of Olsztyn, which Russia
mercifully agrees not to occupy or destroy. Well, it also happens to be
a Polish town but Russia in the meantime declared it “historically
Russian region” and it now presents it as a concession.

<p>
And the 2025 US president says it’s OK, because “peace” and “both sides
did concessions”.

Recovery from DOGE is hard.
</p>
<p>
To put recovery from DOGE into perspective: In tiny Switzerland we
elected prime right-winger Blocher into government and he ran the
justice department for a handful years. And he fired a lot of people for
efficiency. And the institutions are still struggling twenty years
later. People fired find new jobs, new careers, early retirements.
People staying work hard, burn out, are angry, work on projects and
switch tracks before the projects run into walls. The institutional
memory keeps shrinking as the new recruits are younger and younger.
Suddenly the seniors have been here for just four years. It’s a
disgrace. A festering wound. All the jobs are overwhelming and people
are drained when they take these positions and they leave again or burn
out or struggle or backstab.
</p>
<p>
And of course everybody who was against the cuts isn’t automatically in
favour of increasing the budgets and raising taxes when the chainsaw
politicians are gone. But the jobs still needs to get done and so
quality goes down and waiting times increase and you can all join the
slow march of institutional death and hope for that rekindling of the
founding spirit, when having working institutions are a goal again, when
the empathy-deprived scrooges are long gone.

<p>BTW it’s worth
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html">calling
attention</a> to a bit I linked to yesterday. <i>Cross-posting to
Bluesky and Mastodon is not on the roadmap for WordLand.</i> They are
too limited in the features they support for writers. This is a big
point, not a casual thing. I am trying to create a network that’s like
stereo to mono. We’re not going to try to scale down writing in WordLand
so it fits into the tight little featureless well-silo’d boxes in order
to peer with those systems. Instead, I want to force them to give
writers a decent surface to write on. Somehow we lost our minds and
decided deliberately to limit communication to grunts and snorts, and it
should not be a surprise that when our civilization migrated to them, it
became unable to understand complex ideas. I guarantee you Carl Sagan,
if he were alive, would have seen this. Or maybe not? I don’t know. But
it’s a bizarre situation that I’ve decided to try to fix.</p>

<p>The word is starting to spread about
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And the product is
holding up pretty well. There are some issues in Safari with the toolbar
that pops up over selection. I see people pasting in URLs that makes me
think it’s not working for them. Don Park started using it. I did my
first project with Don in the late 80s. The project was very successful.
His respect means a lot to me. The positioning – it makes WordPress as
easy to write for as Twitter, is great to hear as users write about it.
That was one of the major design goals. What people are missing, and
it’s right in front of their eyes, they can use writing features that
somehow never made it to the twitter-like systems, the ones listed on
the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting memorandum</a> (or
manifesto, whichever you prefer). I’m glad people are seeing this as an
enhancement to WordPress, not an attempt to create a new community. I
want <i>all</i> WordPress writers to use this product. Every one of
them. I want people to feel that it’s an essential part of WordPress,
for writers. The writer’s web. Remember that, you’ll be hearing a lot
about that. And I want to be sure we fix all the bugs, and add all the
features they believe are missing, as long as the features pertain to
writing. Everything else is well-covered by the main product. There’s
also an API that comes with WordLand, I’ll be talking more about that
later. Makes it easier to write WordPress apps in JavaScript that run in
the browser.</p>

I’m a bit behind in my RSS feeds and I didn’t realize
<a href="https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/writing/tag-youre-it/">Susan
tagged me</a> to answer a series of questions about my blog. I’ve read
dozens of these and to be honest was feeling a little left out, so
thanks Susan for including me! (Susan’s one of my favorite bloggers and
crafters, be sure to like and subscribe.)
</p>
<h2>
Why did you start blogging in the first place?
</h2>
<p>
I published a zine in high school with my best friend Mike. Our zine
Wimpkiller was a creative outlet for all the composition notebooks we
filled up over a bottomless cups of coffee at IHOP. We’d print out
stories on Mike’s computer, chop ’em up, glue ’em together, and then
scam copies after midnight with the help of the friendly late-shift
worker at Kinko’s. I enjoyed that thrill of self-publishing then as much
as I do now. It felt like the garage band of writing. You may not be
good or ever get famous, but you can brute force some art into the
world.
</p>
<p>
In college blogs became a trend. I created a blog as I graduated from
college to chronicle my entry into the corporate world and ended up
chronicling my move and life in Japan. It served as a form of catharsis
and outward processing as well as keeping my friends and family up to
date on my adventures. That blog died after I came back from Japan and
had to get a job and start a career.
</p>
<p>
Meeting Jeffery Zeldman at SXSW was the inspiration for this edition of
the blog, if you can believe it. A brief encounter but my key takeaway
on how I could become more like my web development heroes was to write
more. They write, and writing begets books, and books begets conference
talks. It seemed like a template I could follow and I started
self-publishing again. Over time, I wrote enough to where I got to write
on <a href="https://alistapart.com/">Jeffrey’s blog</a> and speak at his
conference a handful of times. I guess the plan worked out.
</p>
<h2>
What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose
it?
</h2>
<p>
I started on WordPress but
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/">I moved my blog
to Jekyll in 2012</a>. I chose Jekyll because I was into Ruby at the
time and fighting with WordPress for good performance was exhausting me.
I wanted a simpler authoring and development experience. The simplicity
of building with markdown files on <code>localhost</code> still
resonates with me.
</p>
<h2>
Have you blogged on other platforms before?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve used Blogger, MovableType, WordPress, and Jekyll. There’s also an
ill-fated Eleventy branch on my site that never made it to production.
I’m sure Jekyll will implode and I’ll need to find something else, but
switching platforms would be a distraction for me at this point without
some obvious benefit or process improvement.
</p>
<h2>
How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in
a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">I
write my posts in a giant Notion kanban</a>. It’s overkill but it’s my
overkill. The organization capabilities and “markdown-like” aspects of
Notion made it a good fit over a folder-o’-files. Before publishing, my
posts go through a series of
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/pre-publish-blogging-rituals/">pre-publishing
rituals</a>. With those processes combined I maintain a level of quality
and throughput that I’m happy with.
</p>
<h2>
When do you feel most inspired to write?
</h2>
<p>
I find time to write after the kids go to bed. If there’s time during
the workday, I may spend a lunch break jotting some thoughts too. My
blogging is very work-dependent to the extent that sometimes
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/09/boredom-begets-boredom/">when
I’m productive at work, I’m most productive at blogging</a>. But often,
I’m too tired or focusing on other tasks to craft a well-reasoned blog
post.
</p>
<h2>
Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit
as a draft?
</h2>
<p>
Most of my drafts simmer for weeks if not months or years. From time to
time I’ll do a one day turnaround on a post and that’s rewarding, but
it’s inconsistent. At the time of writing I have 22 active drafts where
”active” means I’ve updated them at least once in the last six months.
If I increase the scope to one year, there’s 41 drafts in my kanban.
</p>
<h2>
What are you generally interested in writing about?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a generalist at heart and enjoy writing about technology generally.
If you look at my archive it’s pretty rare that two consecutive posts
will be thematically similar. I write about specific technologies like
CSS but also about game development or the capital-W Web. And of course
prototypes, which I’m convinced are the not-so-secret sauce for building
great technologies.
</p>
<p>
One direction I’m slipping towards in my mind is futurism and
speculative fiction
(e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">sci-fi</a>). Writing
about current technology limits you to existing capitalist and corporate
structures. Imagining the future
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/10/a-good-science-fiction-story/">and
the potential fallout</a> allows you to think without the confines of
“Good because make money” which so much of our discourse is today.
</p>
<h2>
Who are you writing for?
</h2>
<p>
Woof. Good question. 90% of the time I’m writing to get ideas out of my
head. Transfiguring ideas into text works wonders for me. I also tend to
write for an abstract audience, people who are curious about the web and
technology yet crave more from it; a person who considers themselves a
technologist, but also factors in morality and other
<a href="http://daverupert.com/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">cosmotechnics</a>.
</p>
<h2>
What’s your favorite post on your blog?
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick
Thoughts on Chips</a> (2023) is up there but I feel like
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/">Responsive
Deliverables</a> (2013) aka, the “tiny bootstraps” post, is a level of
quality, thoughtfulness, and timelessness that I don’t achieve often.
I’d like more “timeless” pieces like that, but I don’t exactly know how
or if it’s worth trying to bottle that magic.
</p>
<h2>
Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another
platform, or adding a new feature?
</h2>
<p>
I’m pretty comfortable with my site, but I have a couple changes in
mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw&amp;t=225s">Use
named grid lines</a>
</li>
<li>
Blowout my tag pages with custom art direction
</li>
<li>
Make my mobile layout perfect
</li>
<li>
Write more <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">shitty sci-fi</a>
</li>
<li>
Switch from Notion to Obsidian
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of those will happen over the course of a year, some in the dark of
night, some never.
</p>
<h2>
Tag ’em.
</h2>
<p>
What a responsibility to add people to this chain letter! Susan told me
if I don’t forward this to 10 people, my grandparents will die! That
seems extreme but okay. I’ll tag the following people who I think
haven’t written one yet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> - it feels fitting to
pass the mic back to Jeffrey.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/">Eric Meyer</a> - another
blogger that inspired me in my early days
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://melanie-richards.com/">Melanie Richards</a> - a
multi-talented person and another one of my favorite crafters.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://livelaugh.blog/">Jenn Schiffer</a> - talented artist
and consistently way funnier than everyone else in the room.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ericwbailey.website/">Eric Bailey</a> - one of my
favorite web thinkers and also has
<a href="https://buttondown.com/ericwbailey">the most interesting
newsletter</a> out there.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://blakewatson.com/">Blake Watson</a> - deliverer of
home-cooked applications
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/">Josh Collinsworth</a> -
thoughtful blogger and word puzzle game developer
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Shoot. Only seven. Sorry, memaw and pepaw. Hopefully some unnamed
individuals will answer the call.

<p>I love how people declare that Trump doesn’t represent us. But the
truth is as long as our representatives don’t impeach and remove him, he
absolutely does represent us. There aren’t two definitions of

very last message in the DG is</a>, now, 25 years later, basically the
design of the network I’m building – with WordLand as the frontend and
WordPress as the backend. The issue is the same. When people post only
to get attention, forget about anything useful getting done there. It’s
strictly a broadcast system. So the investment Masto and Bluesky make in
discourse is imho wasted complexity. What we want is linking, not
replies. If they were the web, they would be designed very differently.
Anyway, in 2000, I asked people to put their ideas on their own sites,
send me a link, and maybe I’ll post it on my site. That right there is
the plan for the new network. Facilitating that, it’s as easy as posting
on a twitter-like system (the early users
<a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/07/first-drafting/">confirm</a>
that!), but the post goes into <i>your</i> space ie your blog, and a
link goes to the person you’re responding to, and it’s up to them
whether or not they want to amplify it, using their own criteria, in
their space, to their subscribers. It’s why twitter failed to be a keg
of revolutionary ideas, instead one of warring factions in a prison. Not
able to leave, but not able to do anything either.</p>

<p>I did a restoration of

finally it works. If you find anything interesting in the archive, send

heated at times. But a lot of good stuff came from it.</p>

<h2 id="fucking-republicans-and-medicare">Fucking Republicans and
Medicare</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I am hereby changing the name of “Republicans” to “Fucking Republicans”
because that’s what they do and what we’re going to do to them. Today’s
issue is Medicare, which hits home to me, a person who planned for
health care and depends on Medicare.
</p>
<p>
I need my Medicare. It’s my health insurance. Health insurance always
been a problem for me, with pre-existing conditions, and at one point a
lapsed corporate plan.
</p>
<p>
I finally got on solid ground or so I thought when I turned 65 a few
years ago. Now I find out that the Repubs are going to cancel or reduce
my insurance, and I don’t imagine that a person my age, with my
pre-existing conditions (we all have them once at this age) I could get
insurance.
</p>
<p>
So please tell me Republicans, how this is meant to work? I am not
stupid and I know Medicare is not out of money. Am I going to be paying
out of pocket for my health care? Are there any doctors or hospitals who
even do this any longer?
</p>
<p>
Repubs, if my Medicare goes down, you are going down too.
</p>
<p>
PS: The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLLFeZGeXbA">inspiration</a>
for this fucking idea.

<h2 id="krugmans-paywall">Krugman’s paywall</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m not a paid subscriber to anything on Substack. But I do read a few
of their newsletters when they come out, including
<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/">Paul Krugman’s</a>. Almost
always must-read stuff.
</p>
<p>
But he also writes on the “other side of the paywall.” When he announced
it, he said he doesn’t need the money, so I wondered why he does it. I
kept reading anyway.
</p>
<p>
But he does something incredibly annoying and as clueless imho as the
things he calls out in his writing — I only find out an article is on
the other side of the paywall after I’ve read the first few paragraphs.
I am a fan and I would send the money directly if he asked for it, but
not via Substack.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an
<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-clean-little-secret-of-social">example</a>
of such a post.
</p>
<p>
So because I don’t pay I have to lose that time every time you do this?
Have some respect for us who read you. I’m as old as he is, and I like
to use my time well. So please either get rid of the stinking paywall,
or warn us up front.
</p>
<p>
And also consider getting off
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=substack">Substack</a>.
It’s not a good look.
