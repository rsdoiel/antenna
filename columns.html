<h1 id="2025-06-16-ban-autonomous-systems">
2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems
</h1>
<p>
More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers,
since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole
range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter
based on IP numbers won‚Äôt catch them. But if we can determine their
autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number
range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.
</p>
<p>
Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other
fediverse instances, I don‚Äôt want to block them forever. I want to block
them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter
blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have
ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how
fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I want code that bridges this gap.

It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">
Ban all the networks managed by an ASN
</h2>
<p>
I‚Äôm going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists,
<code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>. I use these two for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.
</p>
<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little
fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Let‚Äôs try it with the ASN 45899!
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>
<p>
For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments
on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are
at it again</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got
a single ‚Äúit‚Äôs already added‚Äù response. Before adding the same numbers
to my shell script, therefore:
</p>
<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>
<p>
That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script.
Once this is done:
</p>
<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr 
</code></pre>
<p>
I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to
figure out a way to unban the whole list!
</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-fail2ban">
Integration with <code>fail2ban</code>
</h2>
<p>
Let‚Äôs start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs
a filter!
</p>
<p>
In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain
all my jails) I added:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that this jail doesn‚Äôt define log paths. I hope that works as
intended.
</p>
<p>
I created a matching filter with no definition in
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it all, and check:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload
OK
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:  6
`- Jail list:   alex-apache, alex-bots, butlerian-jihad, ngircd, recidive, sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
Nice! So now I have a new jail.
</p>
<h2 id="undo-the-banlist">

</h2>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sed 's/ipset add/ipset del/' | sh
</code></pre>
<p>
I also manually edited my <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> file to
remove the lines I added above. Let‚Äôs have fail2ban handle this!
</p>
<h2 id="switch-from-ipset-to-fail2ban-client">

<pre><code>function asn-ban

        echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip $cidr
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | less
</code></pre>
<p>
Run it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
3640
</code></pre>
<p>
If you messed up, clear the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload --unban butlerian-jihad
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned
</code></pre>
<p>
Count the entries in the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq length
3640
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-do-we-have">
What do we have?

<p>
With <code>asncounter</code> we have a tool to quickly discover if an
ASN is providing services to a bot.
</p>
<p>
With <code>asn-ban</code> we have a tool to quickly add all the IP
networks the ASN is managing to a jail for <code>fail2ban</code>.
</p>
<p>
The jail which we called <code>butlerian-jihad</code> bans the IP
networks for a day.
</p>
<h2 id="what-s-left-to-do">
What‚Äôs left to do?
</h2>
<p>
I should check whether this actually works! Let‚Äôs see whether the ban
gets lifted after 24h. That‚Äôs the main point of this exercise!
</p>
<p>
<code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data.
This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as
<code>asncounter</code>. I guess that would be
<a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>. See below!
</p>
<p>
I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes
worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies
all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.

ASN networks without an external service
</h2>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a
bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges
managed by one or more autonomous systems.
</p>
<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
85.208.96.0/24
85.208.97.0/24
85.208.99.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of
<code>asncounter</code> has downloaded. That is to say,
<code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files. I‚Äôm
assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.
</p>
<p>
Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as
follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Unbanning works the same way:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP
numbers or ranges added or removed.
</p>
<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">
Identifying suspicious ASN
</h2>
<p>
What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN
should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters
the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to
ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the
IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we
don‚Äôt care about and just print the appropriate lines:
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062    31.93   24940   HETZNER-AS, DE
1642    17.12   16276   OVH, FR
</code></pre>
<p>
So do I dare ban those numbers?? I‚Äôm not sure! I should figure out a way
to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You
pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it
filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log
lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).

I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent,
FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example),
and on and on. Ugh. It‚Äôs not easy to know what to do!
</p>
<p>
I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for
shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest.
The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount
of resources spent OK. Do I? Let‚Äôs look at the latest numbers.
</p>
<p>
This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it
hard for me to block these autonomous systems.

<p>
The autonomous systems that show up in the second list but not in the
first list are my prime candidates, like COMCAST and CHINAMOBILE-CN.
</p>
<p>
So how about going after the autonomous systems on the second list that
produce more than 1000 hits in a 2h period.
</p>
<p>
Something like this? I‚Äôm going to but this into
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code>
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

<p>
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code> runs every hour and checks
if there have been any abusive autonomous systems in the last two hours.
If so, they are banned.
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>
<p>
<a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two
hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code>
(and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).
</p>
<p>
The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi
server doesn‚Äôt trigger the ban hammer.
</p>
<p>
The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don‚Äôt ban the
server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I
might have to add my home IP numbers. We‚Äôll see!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds
the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server
log file and prints a report.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected
autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.
</p>
<p>
These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a
config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file
is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>
<p>
The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens
as no logfile is checked. My
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just
this:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get
banned. If they are banned, they are banned for 1h. If they are banned
for activity in the last hour leading up to the ban, the script will
find the same log entries and ban them ‚Äúagain‚Äù. This results in no
changes in the jail, since all the networks are already in the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same
file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>
<p>
The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is
banned for a week. I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set
to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an
autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It
sends 600 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than
a feed reader should need, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
after the first hour, nothing happens, as 600 is less than the 1000
needed to trigger the system
</li>
<li>
after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the
last two hours is 1200
</li>
<li>
after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because
it only made 600 requests in the second hour
</li>
<li>
after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again (1200 requests)
</li>
<li>
after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time (1200
requests)
</li>
<li>
after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time (1200
requests)
</li>
<li>
after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time (1200
requests)
</li>
<li>
after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the
<code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the
ASN are banned for a week
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half
this time.
</p>
<p>
Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats
every 7¬Ω weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h
or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs see how this goes for a while.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and
<code>banlist6</code> sets I created for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.

<blockquote>
A challenge with storage is the longevity of the media and the

punch cards are long-lasting and can be read by enterprising enthusiasts
of today, modern densely packed SSDs and spinning disks might present
more of a challenge for the archivists of tomorrow.

<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/12/archival_storage_feature/"><i>Tape,
glass, and molecules ‚Äì the future of archival storage</i></a> looks at
the issues I covered in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html"><i>Archival
Storage</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The future of archival data storage is tape, more tape, and then
possibly glass-based tech, with DNA and other molecular tech still a
distant prospect.<br /> <br /> The function of archival storage is to
keep data for the long term ‚Äì decades and beyond ‚Äì reliably and
affordably. Currently, the main medium for this is LTO tape and it is
slow, has a limited life, and not enough capacity considering the
implications of ever-increasing image and video resolution and
AI-infused data generation. However, there is as yet no viable tape
replacement technology at scale, only possibilities, with optical
storage more practical and nearer to productization than DNA or other
molecular storage.
</blockquote>
Mellor mostly agrees with me, but is more optimistic about Cerabyte‚Äôs
technology than I am. It is less aggressive than Project Silica, writing
a single layer of data onto glass tablets. He reports that:<br />
<blockquote>
Cerabyte has attracted investment from In-Q-Tel, Pure Storage, and
Western Digital. Shantnu Sharma, WD‚Äôs Chief Strategy and Corporate
Development Officer, said: ‚ÄúWe are looking forward to working with
Cerabyte to formulate a technology partnership for the commercialization
of this technology.‚Äù<br /> ‚Ä¶<br /> Like Project Silica, it is, in our
assessment, two to five years away from commercial product availability,
but it will then be commercially available.

<blockquote>
In early May, independent digital storage analyst Thomas Coughlin
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2025/05/03/c1q-2025-hdd-industry-update/">shared</a>
news of falling sales and revenue in the first quarter of 2025,

data from that year showing around 600 million annual hard disk
shipments.<br /> <br /> In 2025 he thinks around 150 million units will
make it out of factory doors. <br /> Hyperscale datacenter operators
will buy most of them and have become HDD manufacturers‚Äô largest
customers.<br /> ‚Ä¶<br /> While HDD volumes fall, collective annual
shipped HDD capacity is rising ‚Äì so even though fewer machines are made,
they collectively contain more gigabytes than last year‚Äôs larger disk

still HAMRing away at the 100 TB disk drive decades later</i></a>
recounts the saga of Seagate‚Äôs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">two-and-a-half
decade long</a> effort to get Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording disks
into mass production:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate is currently shipping 30 TB conventionally recorded Exos M HAMR
drives and both 32 and 36 TB shingled magnetic recording (SMR) drives.
These have blocks of partially overlapping write tracks to increase
track density and thus overall capacity, but with a slower rewrite speed
as entire blocks of tracks have to be rewritten.<br /> <br /> The
company should have a clear drive capacity advantage, but it does not
because its HAMR technology has proven extraordinarily difficult to
bring into mass production and it has one less platter than competing
drives. By 2012, Seagate predicted it could make 1 Tb/in¬≤ in HAMR drives
after a successful
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/03/20/seagate_terabit_areal_density/">demo</a>.
That did not happen but it managed to make 16 TB HAMR drives and was
sampling them in 2019. They did not make it to mass production either,
and a 20 TB technology was the next development. It too did not last
long.<br /> <br /> CEO Dave Mosley told
<a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/11/20/seagate-ceo-talks-about-big-jumps/">investment
analysts in 2020</a> that Seagate was stepping up to 24 TB HAMR drives.
By 2023, a 30 TB HAMR drive was said to be coming. This was actually
unveiled in
<a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2024/01/17/seagate-hamr-drives/">January
2024</a>, with the tech branded Mozaic 3+, referring to the 32 and then
36 TB SMR variants.
</blockquote>
Mellor notes the impact this history has had on Seagate‚Äôs
credibilty:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate has previously made several predictions about HAMR drive
availability that were not ultimately achieved. The tech giant appears
to have persistently underestimated how long it will take to productize
HAMR technology and so reap the production cost benefit of having fewer
platters and sliders at any capacity point than its two competitors.

<h2 id="where-ai-provides-value">Where AI Provides Value</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, updated: 2025-06-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
If you‚Äôve worried that AI might take your job, deprive you of your
livelihood, or maybe even replace your role in society, it probably
feels good to see the latest AI tools fail spectacularly. If AI
recommends
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">glue
as a pizza topping</a>, then you‚Äôre safe for another day.
</p>
<p>
But the fact remains that AI already has definite advantages over even
the most skilled humans, and knowing where these advantages arise‚Äîand
where they don‚Äôt‚Äîwill be key to adapting to the AI-infused workforce.
</p>
<p>
AI will often not be as effective as a human doing the same job. It
won‚Äôt always know more or be more accurate. And it definitely won‚Äôt
always be fairer or more reliable. But it may still be used whenever it
has an advantage over humans in one of four dimensions: speed, scale,
scope and sophistication. Understanding these dimensions is the key to
understanding AI-human replacement‚Ä¶

this
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/opinion/obama-save-america-trump.html">piece</a>
in the NYT has a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/joerogue.png">bit of
wisdom</a> that I had not considered because I don‚Äôt listen to Joe Rogan
it would never occur to me. He‚Äôs relaxing white noise, chatting in the
background while you play a game or write a blog post or text message on
your phone, or just think about something unrelated. I forgot that mode
of media consumption. I‚Äôm always on the hunt for that kind of content.
That‚Äôs why sports games are so good. You can almost completely tune out,
knowing they‚Äôll replay the best stuff.
</p>
<p>
Reminds of a meeting we had a
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Berkman">Berkman</a> in
the early days of podcasting. Most of the faculty were of course not on
board with what we were doing, possibly believing that it threatened
public radio (didn‚Äôt turn out that way at all, they made incredibly good
use of podcasting). One of the guys from
<a href="https://www.prx.org/">PRX</a> which was also incubating there
at the time, said at me in a challenging way ‚Äì You get the best info
from public radio! Right? I thought for a minute and realized this was a
good question. No, I said, it‚Äôs relaxing, I can tune out while I‚Äôm
driving or walking around town. Loud groans. But it‚Äôs so true. Now it‚Äôs
great when there‚Äôs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q">TV
series</a> that really
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=disbelief">catches</a>
your attention, I love that too, but most of my media-ingesting time is
with white noise, background relaxation. The world is still okay when
the background noise on MSNBC are still on the air between the ever more
disgusting ads for diseases I probably will never get.
</p>
<p>
There must be a better way.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs like the canaries in a coalmine. When they go off the air that‚Äôs
when you really have to start worrying!
</p>
<p>
BTW, PRX was a good idea. Brilliant actually. Distribute the content
from the public radio sources that generate too much to the ones in less
populated areas where they don‚Äôt generate enough. Podcasting blew that
up ‚Äì but PRX adjusted their approach, and became a distributor of
podcasting. That‚Äôs an entrepreneur‚Äôs approach. The were able to pivot
and continue to make a contribution to this day.
</p>
<p>
I often wonder how we missed the opportunity to build a great media
incubator at Harvard in the 00s. We were right there, and the backer of
Berkman wanted entrepreurial projects, I found out at the reunion two
summers ago. We had it, were there, if only.. Heh when you get to be my
age there‚Äôs lots of that.
</p>
<p>
Also I wonder how I missed the potential of WordPress all those years.
Ships passing in the night. But we‚Äôre there now, so..

figured that yesterday‚Äôs army march in DC would have caused clashes with
the police in more places than it did, perhaps due to false flag attacks
‚Äúfrom the left‚Äù at one of the many No King Day parades around the
country. I thought this was the moment when it would all melt down.
America‚Äôs Reichstad Fire. If it were an episode of Mission Impossible or
Batman, it would definitely have gone that way. I bet there were plans
hatched on open chat channels between various Cabinet members and their
families, and probably Elon Musk via an interpreter, to coordinate. I
was also surprised there weren‚Äôt any Tesla Cybertrucks in yesterday‚Äôs
parade. I guess the honeymoon is really over. Anyway, they had to have
had a plan, but I keep forgetting this is not Generalissimo Trump,
rather it‚Äôs TV President ‚ÄúTaco‚Äù Trump. I think they had a plan and he
lost his nerve at the last minute. Instead, the Maga in Minnesota lit a
different fuse, assassinating the speaker of the state house. That‚Äôs a
line that hadn‚Äôt yet been crossed, but you knew the day would come. It‚Äôs

in 2016, ‚ÄúIt may not be good for America, but it‚Äôs damn good for CBS,‚Äù
referring to Trump‚Äôs run for president. It was good presumably because
of increased viewership resulting more ad revenue. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs still
true today, though CBS stopped boasting about it in public.</p>
