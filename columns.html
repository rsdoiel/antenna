You might say this is an impressive feat for a submarine to be submerged that long. Alas, it is isn&#8217;t by design but [&#8230;]

      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-21-initramfs">2025-08-21 Initramfs</h1>

<p>I just had a little system administration nightmare. It all started yesterday when I decided that I wasn&rsquo;t going to move the MNT Pocket Reform to Debian stable (Trixie) after all. I had changed the apt sources a while ago, pointing them at Trixie and yesterday I had them point back at unstable.</p>

<p>This is what I had:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources
# Modernized from /etc/apt/sources.list
Types: deb
URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian/
Suites: unstable
Components: main contrib non-free
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
</code></pre>

<p>And of course:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mntre.sources 
Types: deb
URIs: https://mntre.com/reform-debian-repo
Suites: reform
Components: main
Architectures: arm64
Trusted: yes
</code></pre>

<p>Then I did and <code>sudo apt update</code> and somewhere after that my problems started.
There was a critical bug in <code>systemd</code> so held it using <code>sudo apt-mark hold systemd</code>.
I tried <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> and I guess something didn&rsquo;t work (something about Linux kernels?) and there was something about uninstalling <code>udev</code>. The history shows I did <code>sudo apt install udev</code> to recover and that there was a <code>systemd</code> circular dependency because I did <code>sudo apt-mark unhold systemd</code>, then <code>sudo apt --fix-broken install</code> and <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code>.</p>

<p>All good? Maybe not.</p>

<p>Today I tried to boot and got dropped into <code>busybox</code> on the <code>initramfs</code>. It said it couldn&rsquo;t determine the type of the root device. And indeed, <code>ls /root</code> showed nothing.</p>

<p>After a lot of struggling, I finally determined that I had to mount one of the devices from <code>/dev</code> as <code>/root</code>. After some trial and error I found that the magical incantation was <code>mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk2p2 /root</code>.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>What appeared to help is <code>chroot /root</code> to switch to the new system. I got a real shell! I&rsquo;m a bit unclear on the details. But now I think I ran <code>update-initramfs -u</code> and then did <code>exit</code> twice. And booted successfully!</p>

<p>What a nightmare.</p>

<p>The first thing is to write this up, then to update the system and then to reboot. Let&rsquo;s see how this ends. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>And … it&rsquo;s still broken in the same way. I can get it to boot but something is still very wrong.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it seems that installing <code>reform-desktop-minimal</code> fixed it. It looked like I got a new kernel? I have no idea. (<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/initramfs-problem-solved/3724/3">More info on the community forum</a>.)</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-08-21</strong>. Josch noted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You only mounted your root file system but you did not mount <code>/boot</code> into it. So the initramfs you created here will be stored in the <code>/boot</code> directory of your root file system but it will not be stored in the filesystem which then gets mounted as <code>/boot</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes sense!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why update-initramfs after I had booted didn&rsquo;t work, though. Perhaps I still needed the correct kernel for all of this to work? I have no idea and no way to investigate.</p>

      <h1>2025-08-21 Looking at web server logs</h1>

(date: 2025-08-21, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-21-web-server-logs">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-21-looking-at-web-server-logs">2025-08-21 Looking at web server logs</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://scholar.social/@bookandswordblog" title="@bookandswordblog@scholar.social">@bookandswordblog</a> recently wondered how to look at web server logs. Ever since I&rsquo;m fighting the bots, I&rsquo;ve had to look at the web server stats and my <a href="/admin">admin</a> folder is full of small scripts. But if you&rsquo;re new to it all, how do you start?</p>

<h2 id="where-are-the-files">Where are the files?</h2>

<p>If you use Apache on Debian, the current log file is in <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code> so look for something similar. If you use nginx instead of Apache, it might be a folder like <code>/var/log/nginx</code>. The log file itself might be called differently, too.</p>

<h2 id="log-format">Log format</h2>

<p>The log file format can vary, too. If you use Apache on Debian, the log formats are set in <code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code> using the <code>LogFormat</code> directive, and each virtual host can pick one of them using the <code>CustomLog</code> directive.
See <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#accesslog">Log Files</a>.</p>

<p>In my case, I use a config file that sets the following:</p>

<pre><code>LogFormat &quot;%v:%p %h %l %u %t \&quot;%r\&quot; %&gt;s %O \&quot;%{Referer}i\&quot; \&quot;%{User-Agent}i\&quot; %&gt;D&quot; vhost_combined
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log vhost_combined
</code></pre>

<p>This adds <code>%&gt;D</code> at the end of the format and is otherwise identical to the default <code>vhost_combined</code> format.
The format codes are documented on the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats">mod_log_config</a> page.</p>

<p>And example line from my logs:</p>

<p><code>social.alexschroeder.ch:443 37.27.248.47 - - [21/Aug/2025:00:59:49 +0200] &quot;POST /users/alex/inbox HTTP/1.1&quot; 202 4207 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mastodon/4.4.2 (http.rb/5.3.1; +https://beige.party/)&quot; 33180</code></p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>a request to host <code>social.alexschroeder.ch</code> on port <code>443</code></li>
<li>from IP address <code>37.27.248.47</code></li>
<li>with no remote log name</li>
<li>and no remote user</li>
<li>on 2025-08-21 00:59:49 CEST</li>
<li>posted information to <code>/users/alex/inbox</code> (to read information the request would have used <code>GET</code> instead of <code>POST</code>)</li>
<li>the response was a status 202 (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status">HTTP response status codes</a> for a list)</li>
<li>and contained 4207 bytes</li>
<li>with no referrer provided</li>
<li>from a Mastodon user agent self-identifying as from beige.party</li>
<li>taking 33180 microseconds, or about 33 milliseconds (this is the information I added)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="processing-the-log-using-awk">Processing the log using <code>awk</code></h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use <code>awk</code> to process the log files. It&rsquo;s a very old programming language.</p>

<p>Every line is split into words based on spaces. Each word is numbered and available as a variable starting with the dollar sign and its number. So <code>$1</code> is the host and port and <code>$2</code> is the IP address.</p>

<p>A block is enclosed in braces <code>{ like this }</code> and is executed for every line. You don&rsquo;t need to declare variables before assigning to them. An element of a an associative array (a hash map in Perl or Java, a Dictionary in Python) is accessed using square brackets <code>like[this]</code>.</p>

<p>A block after <code>END</code> is executed just once, at the end of the input.</p>

<h2 id="counting-the-hits-per-ip-number">Counting the hits per IP number</h2>

<p>We use an associative array where the key is the IP address of the visitor and the value is the number of hits. At the end, we print the number hits, a tab, and the IP address, for every address. We then use <code>sort</code> to sort these lines numerically.</p>

<p>The <code>++</code> operator increments the operand by one. <code>$2</code> is the IP address, and <code>hits</code> is the associative array.</p>

<pre><code>cat /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| awk '{hits[$2]++} END {for (ip in hits) printf &quot;%d\t%s\n&quot;, hits[ip], ip}' \
| sort --numeric-sort
</code></pre>

<p>The use of <code>cat</code> here is just a placeholder so you can use <code>grep</code> to filter for stuff.
And of course you can pipe it all into <code>tail</code> to just get the top 10 IP addresses.</p>

<h2 id="counting-the-bytes-per-ip-number-the-bandwidth-used">Counting the bytes per IP number (the bandwidth used)</h2>

<p>In order to sum the bandwidth used, we need to sum the bytes send per IP number.
The <code>awk</code> script here does that and prints the number of MB (1000000 bytes) per IP number.
We then use <code>sort</code> to sort these lines numerically.</p>

<pre><code>cat /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| awk '{vol[$2] += $11} END {for (ip in vol) printf &quot;%dM\t%s\n&quot;, vol[ip]/1E6, ip}' \
| sort --numeric-sort
</code></pre>

      When we were contemplating a Nazi takeover of the US govt did any of us consider that they would use the money of the federal government as a lever to get conformance from local governments and NGOs like Columbia and Harvard universities? I sure didn't and I never heard any of the pundits say it.

<p>Marion and I have <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-sovereign-individual-and-the-paradox-of-the-digital-age">an essay in Aeon</a> today:</p>



<blockquote>
    <p>What is happening here is more than an abstract flow of information. It is more than a means of surveillance. It is more than a price mechanism. Rather, it’s as if the air traffic control and insurance commission functions of the IBM 650 have been fused, shrunk, and wholly generalised. This is the real computing revolution. Much of what we do is immediately authenticated as we do it, stored as data, classified or scored on some sort of scale, and deployed in real time to modulate some outcome of interest – usually, the behaviour of a person, or a machine, or an organisation. &hellip; Because of this transformation, our sense of who we are is assembled in a strange and tangled fashion. The machinery of ordinalisation attends carefully to individuals rather than coarse classes or groups. By doing so, it appears to liberate people from the constraints of social affiliations and to judge them for their distinctive qualities and contributions. It promises incorporation for the excluded, recognition for the creative, and just rewards for the entrepreneurial. And yet this emancipatory promise is delivered through systems that classify, sort and, above all, rank people with ever-greater precision and on a previously unimaginable scale. The resulting social order is a sort of paradox, characterised by constant tensions between personal freedom and social control, between the subjective elan of inner authenticity and the objective forces of external authentication. It gives rise to a certain way of being, a new kind of self, whose experiences are defined by the push for personal autonomy and the pull of platform dependency.</p>

      <p>Well, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/science/kryptos-sculpture-cia-solution-auction.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&#038;referringSource=articleShare">this</a> is interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The auction, which will include other items related to cryptology, will be held Nov. 20. RR Auction, the company arranging the sale, estimates a winning bid between $300,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>Along with the original handwritten plain text of K4 and other papers related to the coding, Mr. Sanborn will also be providing a 12-by-18-inch copper plate that has three lines of alphabetic characters cut through with a jigsaw, which he calls &#8220;my proof-of-concept piece&#8221; and which he kept on a table for inspiration during the two years he and helpers hand-cut the letters for the project. The process was grueling, exacting and nerve wracking. &#8220;You could not make any mistake with 1,800 letters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could not be repaired.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

      The oddest part about the whole situation is that CNBC is being spun out into Versant, too, but while they’re losing the NBC peacock logo, they’re just keeping their name, unchanged.

      <p>The five things that were necessary before you could have podcasting: </p>

<ol>
<li>Blogging. </li>
<li>HTTP. </li>
<li>RSS. </li>
<li>MP3. </li>
<li>iPod.</li>

<p>It's pretty simple, but this confluence eludes most tech people and journalists.</p>

      <h1>What podcasting is</h1>

(date: 2025-08-20, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html?title=whatPodcastingIs">Dave Winer's Scripting News</a>)
      <p>
      <p><i>Note: Posted on Facebook eleven years ago. Still relevant today.</i></p>
<p>You couldn't have had podcasting without a lot of things coming together. They all had to be there.</p>
<ol>
<li>Networks of writers who shared links. Blogging.</li>
<li>A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.</li>
<li>Something to attach links and recordings to. RSS.</li>
<li>A standard format for recording. MP3.</li>
<li>Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, none of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. </p>
<p>Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.</p>
<p>Postscript: The EFF filed suit against the patent troll, but didn't listen to what I said here, which is really fucked up because they didn't create podcasting, I did. There's a tremendous lack of respect for generosity in tech, yet without generosity there's no interop, only silos. Either you made billions from something, or you don't exist. That's why I stopped supporting EFF long ago, even though I gave them what was to me a significant amount of money when they started up, and why they get involved in so many wrong-headed ideas.  They don't respect tech, they respect money.</p>

      My mother would have been 93 years old today. She died in 2018, seven years ago. As time goes by, I feel her importance in my life more and more. I find I didn't have a realistic perspective in the living years. But more than any other person in my life, she shaped me -- for better or worse, but mostly better.

<blockquote><p>AIOps refers to the use of LLM-based agents to gather and analyze application telemetry, including system logs, performance metrics, traces, and alerts, to detect problems and then suggest or carry out corrective actions. The likes of <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/10/cisco_live_cloud_control_news/">Cisco</a> have deployed AIops in a conversational interface that admins can use to prompt for information about system performance. Some AIOps tools can respond to such queries by automatically implementing fixes, or suggesting scripts that can address issues...</p></blockquote>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I forgot to bring my portable Pi media server running Jellyfin on a family trip, but had a small selection of my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-i-rip-dvds-and-blu-rays-my-mac-2022-edition">ripped movie and TV show library</a> on my portable SSD.</p>

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

      <h1>Consistent Navigation Across My Inconsistent Websites, Part II</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/consistent-nav-across-inconsistent-sites-pt-ii/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>I refreshed the little thing that let’s you <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/consistent-nav-across-inconsistent-sites/" >navigate consistently between my inconsistent subdomains</a> (<a href="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-video.mp4" >video recording</a>).</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-animation.gif" width="305" height="245" alt="Animated gif of a dynamic-island like control that expands smoothly up when clicked to reveal additional selection options." />

</p><p>Here’s the tl;dr on the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had to remove some features on each site to make this feel right.<ul>
<li>Takeaway: adding stuff is easy, removing stuff is hard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The element is a web component and not even under source control (🤫). I serve it directly from <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/netlify-public-folder-part-i-what/" >my cdn</a>. If I want to make an update, I tweak the file on disk and <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/deploying-with-netlify-shortcuts/" >re-deploy</a>.<ul>
<li>Takeaway: cowboy codin’, yee-haw! Live free and die hard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So. Many. Iterations. All of which led to what? A small, iterative evolution. <ul>
<li>Takeaway: it’s ok for design explorations to culminate in updates that look more like an evolution than a mutation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Want more info on the behind-the-scenes work? Read on!</p>
<h2 id="design-explorations">Design Explorations</h2>
<p>It might look like a simple iteration on what I previously had, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t explore the universe of possibilities first before coming back to the current iteration.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-explorations.png" width="976" height="834" alt="Screenshot of a Figma canvas with lots of artboards too small to see but denoting a lot of iterations." />

</p><h3 id="v0-tabs">v0: Tabs!</h3>
<p>A tab-like experience seemed the most natural, but how to represent it? I tried a few different ideas. On top. On bottom. Different visual styles, etc.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v0.png" width="922" height="668" alt="3 mobile-sized UI mockups of a blog post with different navigation bars." />

</p><p>And of course, gotta explore how that plays out on desktop too.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v0-desktop.png" width="2363" height="752" alt="Three desktop-sized UI mockups of a blog post with different navigation bars." />

</p><p>Some I liked, some I didn’t. As much as I wanted to play with going to the edges of the viewport, I realized that every browser is different and you won&#39;t be able to get a consistent “bleed-like” visual experience across browsers. For example, if you try to make tabs that bleed to the edges, it looks nice in a frame in Figma, and even in some browsers. But it won’t look right in all browser, like iOS Safari.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v0-tabs.png" width="1348" height="550" alt="Mobile UI mockups showing a folder-style segmented tab control. One is in the frame of an iPhone where the control bleeds up into the restricted space where the dynamic island lives as well as down into the website. Whereas the other mockup is in a frame in Figma, so the highlighted tab only bleeds down into the website." />

</p><p>So I couldn’t reliably leverage the idea of a bounded canvas as a design element — which, I should’ve known, has always been the case with the web.</p>
<h3 id="v1-bottom-tabs-with-a-site-theme">v1: Bottom Tabs With a Site Theme</h3>
<p>I really like this pattern on mobile devices, so I thought maybe I’d consider it for navigating between my sites.</p>
<p>But how to theme across differently-styled sites? The favicon styles seemed like a good bet!</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v1.png" width="939" height="682" alt="Mobile-sized mocksups with a bottom tab bar whose active highlight color changes with the active color of each subdomain." />

</p><p>And, of course, what do to on larger devices? Just stacking it felt like overkill, so I explored moving it to the edge.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v1-desktop.png" width="1591" height="758" alt="Desktop-sized mocks with tab controls on the far left of the page and the active site is higlighted according to the site's active theme color." />

</p><p>I actually prototyped this in code, but I didn’t like how it felt so I scratched the idea and went other directions.</p>
<h2 id="v2-the-unification">v2: The Unification</h2>
<p>The more I explored what to do with this element, the more it started taking on additional responsibility.</p>
<p>“What if I unified its position <em>with</em> site-specific navigation?” I thought.</p>
<p>This led to design explorations where the disparate subdomains began to take on not just a unified navigational element, but a unified header.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-1.png" width="899" height="645" alt="Mobile-sized UI mocks for Home, Blog, and Notes on jim-nielsen.com" />

</p><p>And I made small, stylistic explorations with the tabs themselves too.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-2.png" width="885" height="645" alt="Mobile-sized UI mocks for Home, Blog, and Notes on jim-nielsen.com" />

</p><p>You can see how I played toyed with the idea of a consistent header across all my sites (not an intended goal, but ya know, scope creep gets us all).</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-3.png" width="594" height="398" alt="Different header + navigation styles for submdomains on jim-nielsen.com including a hamburger button." />

</p><p>As I began to explore more possibilities than I planned for, things started to get out of hand.</p>
<h2 id="v3-do-more-more-more">v3: Do More. MORE. MORE!!</h2>
<p>Questions I began asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why aren’t these all under the same domain?!</li>
<li>What if I had a single domain for feeds across all of them, e.g. <code>feeds.jim-nielsen.com</code>?</li>
<li>What about icons instead of words?</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v3.png" width="1184" height="659" alt="Four mobile-sized mockups for subdomains on jim-nielsen.com, each one getting a different highlight color." />

</p><p>Wait, wait, wait Jim. Consistent navigation across inconsistent sites. That’s the goal. Pare it back a little.</p>
<h2 id="v4-reigning-it-back-in">v4: Reigning It Back In</h2>
<p>To counter my exploratory ambitions, I told myself I needed to ship something without the need to modify the entire design style of all my sites.</p>
<p>So how do I do that?</p>
<p>That got me back to a simpler premise: consistent navigation across my inconsistent sites.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v4.png" width="1070" height="768" alt="Dynamic-island-like navigational pill for the subdomains on www, blog, and notes subdomains of jim-nielsen.com" />

</p><p>Better — and implementable.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>The implementation was pretty simple. I basically just forked my previous web component and changed some styles. That’s it.</p>
<p>The only thing I did different was I moved the web component JS file from being part of my <code>www.jim-nielsen.com</code> git repository to a standalone file (not under git control) on my CDN.</p>
<p>This felt like one of the exceptions to the rule of always keeping stuff under version control. It’s more of the classic FTP-style approach to web development. Granted, it’s riskier, but it’s also way more flexible. And I’m good with that trade-off for now. (Ask me again in a few months if I’ve done anything terrible and now have regrets.)</p>
<p>Each site implements the component like this (with a different <code>subdomain</code> attribute for each site):</p>
<pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;module&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/shared/jim-site-switcher.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">jim-site-switcher</span> <span class="hljs-attr">subdomain</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;blog&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">jim-site-switcher</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That’s really all there is to say. Thanks to Zach for <a href="https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/114942811780696272" >prodding me to make this post</a>.</p>

      <h1>Classifiers and cosmotechnics</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/08/classifiers-and-cosmotechnics/">Dave Rupert blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>I’ve been playing around with Midjourney for work and the one thing that makes Stable Diffusion cool and useful to me is the <code>--sref</code> flag to summon results in a specific visual style or “style reference” (e.g. <a href="https://midlibrary.io/styles/83450e8">Celestial Swirlscape</a> is <code>--sref 2566192150</code>). They differ a bit from traditional or “artist” styles (e.g. “In the style of Picasso” or “Rip off Studio Ghibli”) but can be that or they can be more generic or compositional like “<a href="https://midlibrary.io/styles/78ed0e">Pink Retronetic Dreamscape</a>”. I’ve read <a href="https://midlibrary.io/midguide/deep-dive-into-midjourney-sref-codes">a deep-dive on SREF codes</a> and it’s still a bit unclear how they work to me. They’re like a hybrid between prompt shorthand and style classification. Curated and collected by humans, but a code generated by machines. I have to imagine there’s some clumped circles on a node graph chart somewhere that determine this… but I don’t know those answers.</p>
<p>The idea of a classifier (human assisted or otherwise) that can suck up and analyze all the art on the internet and end up with a 10-digit number that represents nearly any visual style of imagery I’ve ever seen is mind-bending. Not to mention the ability to overlay that style reference on any image I want in under a minute. “Anime waifu. <code>--sref 3196580341</code>” is the “Tea. Earl gray. Hot” of digital imagery. It feels unreal.</p>
<p>Could we apply a universal classifier to blog posts so that your “longread about cool bugs” and my “longread about cool bugs” have the same <code>--sref</code> tag? And then we retro-actively apply human-readable tag names to this stylistic tag? And then could I subscribe to a feed of those specific types of posts? That might be interesting… or radicalizing.</p>
<p>Design tokens? Could those be a system of classifiers instead of arbitrary language? Probably not. But why not? Web design almost certainly could, if it isn’t already.</p>
<p>While the idea of classifiers tickles the logical computer part of my brain, reducing the entirety of the visual arts down to a set of ten billion categories offends the artist part of my brain. It is odious. There’s an observer effect to it whereby in the act of classifying the art you’ve limited and altered your ability to understand it. And any mimicked generation has an imposter-like, soul-less character to it, no matter the quality. I can’t explain that. Even though I’ve seen the machine generate incredible art beyond anything I’m capable of, I still feel that intangible void on my retinas when I interact with it.</p>
<p>My wife and I were joking about how the algorithm is serving us videos about certain personality quirks that map to (possibly made-up) niche disorders. My wife –who can remember the melody to every guitar solo but can’t remember the words of the songs from her own band– has a diagnosis from Dr. TikTok that she has “polyphonic perception”. My personality quirks all point to my particular flavor of ADHD. How long until our entire personalities are all tied to a collection of niche diagnoses? How long until our brains are all classified by a ten-digit number? That could be incredibly useful for getting help but brings up nature versus nurture questions for me. Did God make me this way or did I dent the packaging?  Can people with <code>--brainSpiceRef 2566192150</code> even apply for this job? How long until the machines build these types of preferences? Myers-Briggs but instead of made by a racist, it’s made by MechaHitler.</p>
<p>When I think about the future I want, it always comes down to one idea: I want <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZvpIE5g5Fo">a pod-like chamber I can walk into</a> that scans my entire body, makes bleep-bloop noises to show that it’s working, and prints out a receipt with a list of all my ailments (cancers, deformities, disorders, and otherwise) and recommends a diet and exercise plan until my next scheduled visit to the pod. Bonus points if it orders groceries accordingly after my entire family has exited the chamber. I’m aware this has “Big Theranos Energy” and is an incredible surface area for conspiracy theories… but it’s the science fiction future I want. Classifiers seem inevitable on that pathway. But how do we preserve our humanity when reducing the human race –who we are and what we create– down to a series of ten-digit codes?</p>

I wrote: I'd love to have is an <b>idea-sharing network</b> where i could drop this idea in a box named "helping the US stay free" and have it find it's way to the right people in Ukraine who are saying "if only I could talk to people in the US trying to figure this out, we know so much about this!" That's the thing. How to connect know-how with the place that needs to know. To make our resistance more effective use the lessons learned in Ukraine over the last decades.

      The purpose of the National Guard occupation of American cities is to control who votes. It doesn’t take much disruption to turn a blue district red. They just allocated <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/big-beautiful-bill-immigration-border-security/">$170 billion</a> to fund ICE. They don't need all that money for border enforcement. It's meant to fund the transformation of the US into a Russian-style oligarchy. That's fear-inducing, but Ukraine has been fighting against becoming a  Russian-style oligarchy for decades, with ups and downs, but so far, considerable success.

It is time once again for the mind-numbing process of feeding 45 disks through the readers to verify their checksums, and yet again this year every single MD5 was successfully verified. Below the fold, the details.<br />

The fields in the table are as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Month</i>: The date marked on the media in Sharpie, and verified via the on-disk metadata.</li>
<li><i>Media</i>: The type of media.</li>
<li><i>Good</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which all MD5 checksums were correctly verified.</li>
<li><i>Bad</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which any file failed MD5 verification.</li>
<li><i>Vendor</i>: the vendor name on the media</li>
</ul>
The drives I use from ASUS and LG report read errors from the CDs and older DVDs but verify the MD5s correctly.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and consumer drives, I'm getting good data from CD-Rs more than 21 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 19 years old. Your mileage may 
vary. Tune in again next year for another episode.<br />
<br />Previously I found a <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/08/optical-media-durability-update.html?showComment=1632161672704#c889599305877938325">NetBSD1.2 CD</a> dating from October 1996. Each directory has checksums generated by <tt>cksum(1)</tt>, all but one of which verified correctly despite a few read errors. So some of the data on that CD is bad after nearly 29 years.<br />

      <h1>2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-xobaque">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-15-an-opt-in-search-engine-xobaque">2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing a search engine that doesn&rsquo;t crawl the web.
I called it <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/xobaque.git/">Xobaque</a>.
You can test it <a href="http://search.transjovian.org/search">here</a>.
(I&rsquo;m currently having problems with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt and therefore this is HTTP only, for the moment.)</p>

<p>Xobaque is entirely opt-in and push based: web admins have total control over what they want to have indexed. The drawback is that web admins have to upload their pages!</p>

<p>I foresee this to be a solution for sites that don&rsquo;t have good local search, like <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a>, or communities, like all the blogs on <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>. If we want to rely less on big search engines, we have to provide our own.</p>

<p>Technically, Xobaque is writen on top of the <a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html#sorting_by_auxiliary_function_results">SQLite FTS5 Extension</a>. This extension does all the heavy lifting: indexing, searching, ranking, highlighting, snippets, boolean operators. Boolean operators! Do you remember those? Good times. The extension is quite amazing, really.</p>

<p>What Xobaque provides is the command-line interface and the web interface. Right now, the command-line interface has a command to initialize an empty database and a command to upload a single page.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of how to use this in a script.</p>

<p>My homepage:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
cd /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki
for line in (/home/oddmu/oddmu list)
  set --local info (string split &quot;	&quot; $line)
  set --local name (string replace --regex '^/home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/' '' $info[1] | string replace --regex '.md' '')
  set --local title $info[2]
  /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
    -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
    -base &quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/&quot; \
    -local &quot;$name&quot; \
    -title &quot;$title&quot; \
    -filename &quot;$name.md&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>(The index file grows from nearly zero to about 40M.)</p>

<p>Emacs Wiki:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for path in (grep --files-without-match '^#FILE ' /home/alex/emacswiki/git/* /home/alex/emacswiki/git/.*)
  set --local name (string replace '/home/alex/emacswiki/git/' '' $path)
  set --local title (string replace '_' ' ' $name)
  /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
    -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
    -base &quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/&quot; \
    -local &quot;$name&quot; \
    -title &quot;$title&quot; \
    -filename &quot;/home/alex/emacswiki/git/$name&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>(The index file grows from about 40M to 290M.)</p>

<p>The alternative to uploading via the command-line, I think, will be feed ingestion. Web site owners can send their feeds to Xobaque and it will index the entries in the feed. If the entries have the full text, that&rsquo;s great. If they have an excerpt, that works, too. You opt-in with whatever you provide.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that this will be a system for friends only, so the upload will be protected by a login. Otherwise, people will be able to upload other people&rsquo;s sites and that violates the opt-in idea.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-15</strong>. I have that vague idea that it would process OPML files like the <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/opml.xml">Planet Emacslife OPML</a> or the three RPG Planet OPML files, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/indie.opml">Indie</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/osr.opml">OSR</a> and <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/other.opml">Other</a>. From the OPML files Xobaque would know a bunch of feeds which it could then use for updates. I have written <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/planet-jupiter.git/">Planet Jupiter</a>, so I know that from 80% to 90% is handling blogs that are down and from 90% to 100% it&rsquo;s all about fiddling with the markup… There&rsquo;s also the question of consent. So perhaps one would have to start a new list of feeds for those people who explicitly consent. And if by chance that covers all the feeds on Planet Emacslife or RPG Planet that&rsquo;d be a reason to laugh and party! 🎉</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-17</strong>. Adding feeds and collections of feeds (via OPML files) works, now. 🎉</p>

<p>The feed import from the net should use ETags and If-Modified-Since headers if possible, but the convenience functions of bot the feed and the OPML library don’t provide this, so I’ll have to roll my own. And then think of parallelising the requests. Go channels ahoy! 😬</p>

<p>And then a web UI for uploads and accounts? 🥺</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-19</strong>. Xobaque now knows how skip feeds that haven’t updated using <code>If-Modified-Since</code> and <code>If-None-Match</code> headers.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-19</strong>. The errors I&rsquo;m finding in the feeds of Planet Emacslife OPML:</p>

<pre><code>Error importing feed https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss: XML syntax error on line 1: illegal character code U+FFFF
Error importing feed https://blog.laurentcharignon.com/index.xml: XML syntax error on line 231: illegal character code U+0008
Error importing feed http://feeds.feedburner.com/emacslife: parsing time &quot;Sat, 9 Aug 2025 18:00:43 GMT&quot; as &quot;Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST&quot;: cannot parse &quot;9 Aug 2025 18:00:43 GMT&quot; as &quot;02&quot;

</code></pre>

<p>But I guess I have 248/253 feeds imported.</p>

<p>Other issues I have noticed: Endless repeats of news items that overwrite each other, only differing in title and description, and no GUID set:</p>

<pre><code> Update http://tromey.com/elpa/news.html
</code></pre>

<p>Then again, the items all have dates set from 2007 to 2010, so perhaps that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p>And now I find:</p>

<pre><code># ./xobaque search alex schroeder
Emacs: Take Two
https://takeonrules.com/2025/06/10/emacs-take-two/emacs-take-two
extend &lt;span&gt;Emacs&lt;/span&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, learning of Alex Schroeder, both involved in &lt;abbr title=&quot;Role Playing Games&quot;&gt;RPGs
</code></pre>

<p>It works! And I really need to strip HTML, here! 😂</p>

      <p>
      <p>A zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/high-severity-winrar-0-day-exploited-for-weeks-by-2-groups/">being exploited</a> by at least two Russian criminal groups:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vulnerability seemed to have super Windows powers. It abused <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/c54dec26-1551-4d3a-a0ea-4fa40f848eb3">alternate data streams</a>, a Windows feature that allows different ways of representing the same file path. The exploit abused that feature to trigger a previously unknown path traversal flaw that caused WinRAR to plant malicious executables in attacker-chosen file paths %TEMP% and %LOCALAPPDATA%, which Windows normally makes off-limits because of their ability to execute code.</p></blockquote>

  <p>If I were to photocopy this article, nobody would argue that my photocopier wrote it and therefore can think. But add enough convolutedness to the process, and it looks a lot like maybe it did and can.</p>
  
  <p>In reality, all we’ve created is a bot which is almost perfect at mimicking human-like natural language use, and the rest is people just projecting other human qualities on to it. Quite simply, “LLMs are doing reasoning” is the “look, my dog is smiling” of technology. In exactly the same way that dogs don’t convey their emotions via human-like facial expressions, there’s no reason to believe that even if computer could think, it’d perfectly mirror what looks like human reasoning.</p>

      I want to switch cell providers, so I used ChatGPT to figure out that Consumer Cellular is the best choice for me. I finally get around to filling in the form, and it complains about my zip code. "No service." Yes I know, there's no cell coverage where I live. I still need a freaking cell phone. Called them, the sales person says maybe it's a problem with your computer. Geez Louise. It's a problem with <i>your</i> computer. How many years have they had to fix this stupid bug. I could see if I was buying a landline. But this is a <i>mobile</i> device. That means it moves. To places with cell coverage.

      What if you made a social network out of RSS? Then your blogroll would be the list of people you follow. Their updates would show up in a reverse chronologic list of posts that would look like something from <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinesnapshot.png">Bluesky</a> or <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinetwitter.png">Twitter</a>. You could view a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timeline.png">list</a> of the people you follow, and expand each person to see their most recent five posts, summarized, with a link to each to read the whole thing. Since there are no limits to the length of a post in RSS there would be no limit to the length of one of these posts, but of course you wouldn't show all the text in the timeline without the reader clicking on something.

It's hard to watch at times, because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes">main character</a> of the show, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is such a horrible person. She lies to everyone about everything, but she's cute and the VCs like her, so they pump hundreds of millions of dollars into her startup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos">Theranos</a>, which was a real company, and made a product that never worked, but she doesn't get around to telling anyone that, including the board of directors, until long after it's too late. I haven't reached the end yet, but I know how it ends, because it's based on a true story. She ends up in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Camp,_Bryan">prison</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> is in, in Texas. The only reason I mention it is that in my tenure in Silicon Valley, about 30 years worth, I saw everything she did, done by other entrepreneurs and VCs, in real life. Only now, in the second Trump administration, its craptitude is maxed out far beyond anything I saw personally. They're selling the biggest lie yet, that they've invented machines that think. This is not true, and it's so big a lie, its too-big-to-fail quotient is far higher than anything we've seen before. ChatGPT should stop pretending to be human because that will destroy real humans who believe it. But the euphoria is so great, they're probably going to continue to insist it is capable of thought, and that leads to something far worse than Theranos, or any of the other billion-dollar scams they have foisted on us previously.

      In August 16 2025 I did a keynote with this title on the FrOSCon conference in Bonn, Germany. The room held a few hundred seats and every single one was occupied with people also filling up the stairs and was standing along the walls. Awesome!

      <h1>Vibe Check №39</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/08/vibe-check-39/">Dave Rupert blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>In the middle of the night on the morning of July 4th, a storm parked over the Texas Hill Country and caused the Guadalupe river to rise more than 25 feet in two hours. 135 dead, including dozens of children from summer camps along the river. As a parent, this is the greatest tragedy you could imagine. My heart goes out to the families and friends who lost a little one that week.</p>
<p>As a Texan, this is yet another tragedy in a growing list of rare but forecastable tragedies where federal, state, and local officials failed Texans. I’m tired.</p>
<p>With that event casting a dark shadow on the summer acknowledged, here’s a recap of the last couple months.</p>
<h2>A trip to the Grand Canyon</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/grandcanyon.jpg" width="1200" height="675" alt="the grand canyon near bright angel trailhead"/>
<p>In late June my family stole away for a quick trip to Arizona. My in-laws bought a vacation place in Flagstaff to escape the Phoenix heat. We wanted to check out the new place and figured we could do something American and tag on a quick trip to the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>On the morning of the second day we arrived at Grand Canyon National Park early. We found a good parking spot steps from the canyon’s edge and told our kids to get out and see the view. I’ve been to the canyon a couple times but nothing can truly prepare you for the enormity and pastel grandeur you’re about to see. I enjoyed re-living the first glimpses through my kids’ collective gasps of awe… and after about 10 minutes they were ready to go home and get on their iPads.</p>
<p>We milled around the park for nearly two hours making frequent stops. We stopped at the Devil’s Watchtower on the way out of the park which I’d recommend. All-in-all, we saw something truly remarkable together and my wife and I felt like we checked off a big “This is good for you and you’ll thank us later” parenting checkbox.</p>
<p>The next day the kids rode back with the grandparents to Phoenix while my wife and I took a short detour to go see Sedona. All these years visiting Arizona and I’d never been. We don’t buy into all the energy crystal woo-woo the town advertises, but it’s a beautiful and inspiring piece of America with incredible vistas and sculpture-like red stone mountains. I’d like to spend more time there.</p>
<p>We had a couple days in Phoenix to hang with cousins and celebrated my great-nephew’s second birthday. He’s a cool dude. Mid-week we headed back to Austin to send the kids to summer camp. That week could have been a great one for my wife and I to enjoy an empty house, but I ended up (over-)working all week.</p>
<h2>Trip to San Diego</h2>
<p>The day after the kids got back from summer camp we packed our bags again and headed to San Diego with my wife’s entire family. The next four days were beach days; digging holes, <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/07/always-buy-the-yamaha/">playing guitar</a>, hitting the smashball, dozing off to books, and chasing a toddler around. I stayed in my solar fortress most of the time to avoid my enemy: The Sun.</p>
<p>But it wouldn’t be a Rupert Family Vacation without some calamities! On the second day my son got the worst sunburn of his life; no blisters, just red. He’d survive… but he didn’t know that. I sympathize because I had tons of sunburns as a kid. When it itches, it sucks.</p>
<p>And then there’s my daughter…</p>
<p>At the end of the week we tagged on a couple more days and visited Austin friends who spend the summer in Encinitas. Our daughters who have been besties since daycare slotted right back into their brand of silly lip sync routines and giggling. To soak up more beach time, we hiked down the cliff to Beacons beach and set up some chairs in the rocks while the girls boogie boarded their hearts out having the time of their life until…</p>
<p>My daughter comes to us holding her arm crying. When she reached for the loose boogie board leash she slammed her hand down and said she felt something fold over her arm and sting her. We walked over to the lifeguard stand and got the bad news, “That looks like a sting ray.”</p>
<p>The untold irony here is all week long my daughter was telling anyone who would listen that her two greatest fears about the ocean were: getting caught in a rip current and getting stung by a stingray. We tried to diffuse those fears but she kept talking about it. And here we were, the prophecy came true.</p>
<p>“I can call a lifeguard truck to meet you at the top of the hill but you have to take care of it now.” Uh-oh. That’s when I knew we were in a serious situation. We said no to the lifeguard truck but needed to submerge her arm in 115ºF water (hot tap water) for 30-90 minutes to neutralize the proteins in the venom. We hiked back up the cliff and walked the three blocks to the house. Tears the whole way.</p>
<p>After a couple hours everything was sore but stable. She’s a tough kid and that was a difficult situation. What a champ.</p>
<h2>We survived: A skunk attack</h2>
<p>Late one night my daughter (who has a sensitive smeller) said “Something smells like skunk!” I caught a faint whiff of it and thought “It’s probably some neighbors smoking weed” and opened the back door to assess the situation and in rushed my two mutts, one of them covered in skunk juice! Yikes!</p>
<p>We did our best to corral them to the garage where we washed them with an internet-recommended concoction. I can’t even describe the degree to how awful this was. The smell infiltrated our house and sulfur burned in the eyes and nose all night long. We spent the next day Fabreezing and disposing of any rogue object the smell might have transferred to: the backdoor mat, collars, one kids sandal, the dead skunk near the trash… Ah, gross.</p>
<p>A skunk attack is not a situation you can control (dogs being dogs) but it’s not one I want to relive any time soon.</p>
<h2>Another school year begins</h2>
<p>This week we strap ourselves into the bobsled and push the sled downhill on an out-of-control course where the breaks do nothing and it sends us crashing into Christmas. Feeling optimistic about this year, but there will be more homework for both our kids which is historically not a strength we operate in as a family. Lord help us.</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Here you go, number perverts. All the dopamine deep-dives and drive-thrus I collected over the summer.</p>
<h3>🧠 <strong>Learning</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sovietology -  Based on a space race analogy I heard at work I made a deep-dive on the Soviet space program which led me to Sovietology and trying to understand how the Soviet central planning system (“cybernetics”) failed its fellow comrades.</li>
<li>ADHD - Been watching a lot of videos on ADHD and trying to understand it more</li>
<li>Minimalism and decluttering - ADHD videos lead me into minimalism and decluttering videos and it makes a difference if you view clutter as stimulus. If I could just get the rest of the family on board…</li>
<li>Drawing - I’d like to be good at drawing, so I spent a lot of learning about shapes, perspectives, sketching, and more</li>
<li>Studio Setups - Because ShopTalk has a YouTube now, I’ve become a little bit obsessed with optimal YouTube setups but I haven’t done anything… yet</li>
<li>Budgeting - After all our summer trips and feeling spent (physically and fiscally), I sat down one weekend and did some budgeting and ingested a lot on the subject.</li>
</ul>
<h3>❤️‍🩹 Health and wellness</h3>
<p>A lot of updates here but still untangling the Gordion knot of stress, anxiety, weight, and ADHD. I’m talking to doctors and making some changes and I believe they are helping even if it’s not fully realized yet.</p>
<h3>📝 <strong>Blogging</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/42C0Bx1">System Collapse</a> <small>★★★</small> - The last book in the Murderbot Diaries. This one was a slog, to be honest. The action at the end was good but the crescendo right before that, the big group project… was disappointing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3SZMflH">The Wrong Stuff</a> <small>★★★★★</small> - A great book about the relative failure of the Soviet Cosmonaut program compared to NASA even though the USSR had many “firsts” they did so without regard to the safety and stability of their program and rockets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/43qaO1z">Space Battleship Yamato</a> <small>★★★½</small> - Got this from Kinokuniya to satiate my retro space manga obsession. It delivered on the space opera promise but had a lot of the early-days manga pitfalls. That wasn’t a deal-breaker for me but could be for some I’m sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/447GMzL">Red Plenty</a> <small>★★★</small> - A historical fictional narrative about site managers and scientists under Khrushchev’s rule. It paints a nice picture about the economics (“cybernetics”) and central planning of that time, but sometimes the narrative was too thick (like Dostoyevsky thick). Reaffirming I’m a non-fiction guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3TZuW4Y">ADHD and Us</a> <small>★★★★</small> - A good book for people in a relationship where one or more partners are neurodiverse. Recommended by my psychiatrist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4o98ggp">A Different Kind of Power</a> <small>★★★★½</small> - Jacinda Arden’s autobiography is a bit hard to read because of how calm, cool, collected, and capable she seems compared to her American contemporary Donald Trump who was nothing but chaos and incompetence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3U1gfOP">Dungeon Crawler Carl</a> <small></small> - [In progress]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/44PvjFy">Moral Ambition</a> <small>★★★★</small> - I enjoyed Bregman’s other books more, but this book certainly is challenging. It asks you to consider how you can make the biggest, moral, positive change and adjust your life towards that goal. That certainly tugs at my heartstrings but is a tough call to action in uncertain times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="">Win Every Argument</a> <small></small> - [In progress]</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/45g0s5b">The Dawn of Everything</a> <small></small> - [In progress]</p>

<h3>📺 Media</h3>
<p>Saw some good movies this period… which is rare.</p>
<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>28 Years Later - Good movie. Lots of zombie dong, or… it’s more accurate to say one notably huge alpha hog.</li>
<li>Superman - I enjoyed a DC movie; a Superman movie! Unbelievable. Has James Gunn saved the DC cinematic universe? Hopefully.</li>
<li>K-Pop Demon Slayers (Netflix) - An wonderful animated film and you can see the foundation of fun from the creative and technical teams come out. Great job Sony Animation.</li>
<li>Fantastic Four: First Steps - The art direction in this movie is incredible… fantastic even. A real cinematic feat. Worth seeing in theaters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TV</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to Wrexham S4 (Hulu) - Up the town. Unreal ending.</li>
<li>Murderbot (Apple TV) - Loved the books… and uh… you can watch the show, if you want to, it’s fine I guess.</li>
<li>Mythic Quest S5 (Apple TV) - Not for everyone but feels algorithmically generated for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Streaming</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Game Changer S7 (Dropout) - This season of Game Changer has managed to outdo itself and that’s an incredible a feat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anime</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Suite Gundam Gquuuuuux (Prime)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Podcasts</strong>
I purged my podcasts and abandoned some of my favorites (like The Adventure Zone), but I think I’m better for it. Now I can focus on the ones I enjoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Books Could Kill…</li>
<li>Maintenance Phase</li>

<h3>🤖 Gunpla</h3>
<p>This hobby isn’t dead yet! I’ve got five or so in the backlog but three of them are practice kits for a larger project I have in mind. In service to that project, I tried my hand at anime cel-shading an Entry Grade RX-78-2. I tried half-a-dozen application techniques and didn’t find a way that I liked. I need to do more research and keep trying.</p>
<h3>🌱 Digital Gardening</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made my homepage tie-dyed for funsies. It’s based off the accent color and changes a bit every day.</li>
<li>Built some automation for my vibechecks, will hopefully post more later.</li>
<li>Added more pentatonic scales to <a href="https://pentablaster.daverupert.com/">Pentablaster</a>… it’s in a messy state right now but I wanted to play with Ethiopian scales. I have plans to fix it up.</li>
<li>Regenerated cover images for my <a href="/stories">stories</a> page using Midjourney. I think I did better this time around.</li>
</ul>
<h3>👾 <strong>Video games</strong></h3>
<p>Mostly puzzles, but I did go reopen the door to a city builder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cities Skylines - I hooked up SteamLink to play my PC games from the shed inside the house on my Mac. Trying to play enough Cities Skylines 1 to justify buying Cities Skylines 2.</li>
<li>Balatro - The joker addiction continues. Feel like if I beat one more stake I’ll be happy and can quit.</li>
<li><a href="https://cluesbysam.com/">Clues by Sam</a> - A daily caper! If you’re not playing this you should be.</li>
<li><a href="https://inkwellgames.com/games/stars">Stars</a> - A sudoku-like puzzler from Inkwell Games</li>
<li><a href="https://inkwellgames.com/games/fields">Fields</a> - A difficult pattern game from Inkwell which I first thought was impossible but now feel like I’m getting the hang of it.</li>

<ol>
<li>The only <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22billionaire-proof%22">billionaire-proof</a> social network will be based on RSS. </li>
<li>The shortest path to being <a href="https://billionaireproof.com/">billionaire-proof</a> for Bluesky is well thought-out inbound and outbound RSS. </li>

<p>We're going to have some interop based on RSS not too far down the road. A network that will only require an RSS feed for entry. It's what we should've built in 2006 and didn't. </p>

      <p>ChatGPT is simply a breakthrough in search. I don't want ChatGPT to be warm and friendly. It should behave like a computer. Only answer questions it's asked. Stop trying to lead the human. I speak from lots of experience trying to develop software with it.</p>

      <h1>Bottomless Subtleties</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/bottomless-subtleties/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Jason Fried writes in his post <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/knives-and-battleships-ac8dc8c2" >“Knives and battleships”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific tools and familiar ingredients combined in different ratios, different molds, for different purposes. Like a baker working from the same tight set of pantry ingredients to make a hundred distinct recipes. You wouldn&#39;t turn to them and say &quot;enough with the butter, flour, sugar, baking powder, and eggs already!&quot;</p>
<p>Getting the same few things right in different ways is a career&#39;s worth of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mastery comes from a lifetime of putting together the basics in different combinations. </p>
<p>I think of Beethoven’s 5th and its famous “short-short-short-long” motif. The entire symphony is essentially the same core idea repeated and developed relentlessly! The same four notes (da-da-da-DAH!) moving between instruments, changing keys, etc.</p>
<p>Beethoven took something basic — a four note motif — and extracted an enormous set of variations. Its genius is in illustrating how much can be explored and expressed within constraints (rather than piling on “more and more” novel stuff).</p>
<p>Back to Jason’s point: the simplest building blocks in any form — music, code, paint, cooking — implemented with restraint can be combined in an almost infinite set of pleasing ways.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/precarious-modern-computing/" >Devine noted</a> (and I constantly link back to): we haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with less.</p>

      Happy for my sister and me, who are both still alive and well. I&#8217;m also happy for the thirty-three years Eleanor and Allen made a life and a family together. They were great people, great parents, great teachers, great friends to many, and much more. Both are still missed. Some links: Their wedding Eleanor Searls Allen [&#8230;]

      <h1 id="2025-08-11-upgrading-debian-bookworm-12-to-trixie-13">2025-08-11 Upgrading Debian Bookworm (12) to Trixie (13)</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Before starting the upgrade, make sure your <code>/boot</code> partition is at least 768 MB in size, and has about 300 MB free. If your system does not have a separate /boot partition, there should be nothing to do. &ndash; <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/release-notes/issues.html#ensure-boot-has-enough-free-space">5.1.5. Ensure /boot has enough free space</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am missing 34M for boot!</p>

<pre><code># df -h | grep boot
/dev/sda2               734M  141M  540M  21% /boot
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m ignoring this for the moment. :(</p>

<p>Deleting files from the last upgrade:</p>

<pre><code>find /etc '(' -name '*.dpkg-*' -o -name '*.ucf-*' -o -name '*.merge-error' ')' -exec rm '{}' ';'
</code></pre>

<p>Purging config files:</p>

<pre><code>apt purge '?narrow(?config-files)'
</code></pre>

<p>Removing old stuff and making space:</p>

<pre><code>apt autoremove
apt clean
</code></pre>

<p>Lots of reading.
Replacing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Types: deb
URIs: https://deb.debian.org/debian
Suites: trixie trixie-updates
Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg

Types: deb
URIs: https://security.debian.org/debian-security
Suites: trixie-security
Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
</code></pre>

<p>And then:</p>

<pre><code>apt update
apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
apt full-upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m ignoring the warnings about directories the upgrade process was unable to delete:
The ones I did check contained scripts and the like.
I would have felt OK to delete directories with generated files, or files modified by me.
But this? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Conflicts I ran into:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/exim4/conf.d/main/03_exim4-config_tlsoptions
</code></pre>

<p>This file showed up as a conflict but it was nothing I remember doing. Install the maintainer version!</p>

<pre><code>/etc/systemd/journald.conf
</code></pre>

<p>I had added <code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code> and <code>MaxRetentionSec=7d</code> because I didn&rsquo;t want to give the log files that much space. So I redid those changes for the maintainer version.</p>

<pre><code>/etc/pam.d/login
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what this is about. Did I comment <code>session    optional   pam_motd.so motd=/run/motd.dynamic</code>? Perhaps I did. Let&rsquo;s go with the maintainer version and see if that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p>To do after the upgrade:</p>

<pre><code>rm /var/log/wtmp* /var/log/lastlog* /var/log/btmp*
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that the sway background image is back.
I had to add a line at the very end of my config file:</p>

<pre><code>#
# Debian
#
# Include all the extra config
include /etc/sway/config.d/*
# Override the background
output * bg &quot;#333333&quot; solid_color
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2025-08-11</strong>. The things that aren&rsquo;t working on the server:</p>

<p>Getting Node.js installed was a pain. It has a separate sources list from NodeSource. ☹️</p>

<p><em>Solved, hopefully.</em></p>

<p>Services that rely on Monit starting a Mojolicious app via Hypnotoad no longer work.
Monit claims &ldquo;File &lsquo;/home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/hypnotoad&rsquo; does not exist&rdquo;. ☹️</p>

<p><em>Rewriting the wrappers as systemd services.</em></p>

<p>My local Emacs can no longer connect to the server via Tramp. It just hangs. <code>ssh</code> and <code>mosh</code> still work, the config files are unchanged. ☹️</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-12</strong>. Ah, if I start Gnome, my old enemy is back: <code>localsearch-3</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at <a href="2018-05-07_Laptop_Fan">2018-05-07 Laptop Fan</a> and trying to disable to crawling:</p>

<pre><code># gsettings get org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files crawling-interval 
-2
# gsettings get org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files enable-monitors
false
</code></pre>

<p>The old <code>tracker</code> package is now a transitional package that depends on <code>tinysparql</code>. Trying to <code>apt remove</code> either of them will attempt to remove <code>gnome-session gnome-sushi tinysparql xdg-desktop-portal-gnome gnome-session-xsession nautilus tracker-extract</code>. Fuuuck.</p>

<p>Looking at the man pages, I get the feeling that <code>localsearch-daemon(3)</code> is what I need kill the processes. But how to disable them?</p>

<pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .service
/etc/systemd/user/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-control-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-writeback-3.service
/usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
/var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/localsearch-3.service.dsh-also
/var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
</code></pre>

<p>OK, some candidates!</p>

<p>The manual page for <code>localsearch-3(1)</code> mentioned that it was started by a <code>.desktop</code> file.
But perhaps I can just disable the service?</p>

<p>Maybe not.</p>

<pre><code># systemctl --user disable localsearch-3
The following unit files have been enabled in global scope. This means
they will still be started automatically after a successful disablement
in user scope:
localsearch-3.service
# sudo systemctl disable localsearch-3.service
Failed to disable unit: Unit localsearch-3.service does not exist
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to do.</p>

<pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .desktop
/etc/xdg/autostart/localsearch-3.desktop
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/localsearch-3.0/extract-modules/libextract-desktop.so
/usr/share/localsearch3/extract-rules/10-desktop.rule
/usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s that first file. But how to disable <em>that</em>?</p>

<p>Ah, I am not alone. With that info I found <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=299586">a discussion on the Arch Linux forum</a> with various strategies being discussed. I will try to change the <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled</code> line to <code>false</code> and see whether that helps. And while I am at it, I will also change <code>X-GNOME-HiddenUnderSystemd</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and I can no longer edit remote files with my Emacs at home. It just hangs there and waits for the prompt or something, I guess.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and that annoying Gnome keyring? <a href="https://www.xmodulo.com/disable-gnome-keyring-linux-desktop.html">How to disable GNOME Keyring on GNOME desktop</a> by Dan Nanni suggests to copy the <code>gnome-keyring-*.desktop</code> files from <code>/etc/xdg/autostart</code> to <code>~/.config/autostart</code> and append the line <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false</code> to each one.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-14</strong>. The chkrootkit mail I get every day has a lot of useless information. One looks like <em>all</em> the dotfiles? Ugh.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-17</strong>. Ah, at the very end of the <code>chkrootkit</code> email is the answer:</p>

<pre><code>cp -a /var/log/chkrootkit/log.today /var/log/chkrootkit/log.expected
</code></pre>

      <p>Cory Doctorow bends over backwards to praise the creators of Bluesky, but also explains why it would be nuts to trust them. Bluesky is the least billionaire-proof system imaginable and they keep saying how they <em>are</em> billionaire-proof. What's so admirable about that Cory (sarcasm, sorry).  And if it weren't for the character limit, I could say how much I admire Cory (I really do, not just saying that, he's stood up for the right things, most of the time and the times he hasn't it's probably just because I haven't had a chance to bend his ear. 😀</p>

I'm working a few hours a day on the integration of writing and timelines built around feeds. Instead of using Bluesky or Mastodon, with their limits, we use WordPress for storage. It has none of their limits, has a high performance open source server back-end, debugged complete API, it's not without problems, but far ahead of where the competition is in terms are reliablity and ease of implementation. <i>To be part of this network, all you need is an RSS feed. </i>Seems pretty openly billionaire-proof wouldn't you say.

<p><a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/connection-refused-status-400-apache-mod-md-and-mod-proxy-fail2ban/240429">On the forum</a>, I learned that Let&rsquo;s Encrypt currently has one primary and 4 secondary centres; the primary and all but one of the secondaries must succeed. So I though, I must be blocking these at the firewall. Let&rsquo;s try to unban them all:</p>

<pre><code># fail2ban-client unban --all
663
</code></pre>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-15-lets-encrypt-1.jpg" alt="The graph shows the number of banned addresses and address ranges dropping from around 700 to zero." /></p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t help. 😭</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s the banger: When I run <code>iptables --list</code> I see a ton of entries in the <code>f2b-butlerian-jihad</code> chain! 😨</p>

<p>This is not good. At one point, the two must have gone out of sync.</p>

<pre><code>iptables --flush f2b-recidive
iptables --flush f2b-butlerian-jihad
iptables --flush f2b-butlerian-jihad-week

ip6tables --flush f2b-recidive
ip6tables --flush f2b-butlerian-jihad
ip6tables --flush f2b-butlerian-jihad-week

      I want a new ChatGPT mode where I drive the work, not the bot. I don't want it giving me answers to questions I didn't ask, because it's trying to navigate in my mind, and it has no information about that, so it's basically always wrong. I keep looking back on problems that took hours to solve because it drove the process and I went along with it. I want to tell it in advance to not make suggestions, to just answer questions. I call this "behave like a computer, not a human." Because it's a fanstastic computer, but not a good partner.

      We&#8217;re planning to ride Amtrak down to Portland for my 40th(!) birthday in October, and do a car-free long weekend. I haven&#8217;t been to Portland since 2003 and I don&#8217;t think my husband&#8217;s ever been! (Open to suggestions! We hate tourist traps and like gardens / parks, outsider art, food with veggie options, science stuff [&#8230;]

      <h1>Just a Little More Context Bro, I Promise, and It’ll Fix Everything</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/more-context-bro/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Conrad Irwin has an article on the Zed blog <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software" >“Why LLMs Can&#39;t Really Build Software”</a>. He says it boils down to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the distinguishing factor of effective engineers is their ability to build and maintain clear mental models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a mental model of what <em>you want</em> to do</li>
<li>Building a mental model of what the <em>code does</em></li>
<li>Reducing the difference between the two</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s kind of an interesting observation about how we (as humans)  problem solve vs. how we use LLMs to problem solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>With LLMs, you stuff more and more information into context until it (hopefully) has enough to generate a solution.</li>
<li>With your brain, you tweak, revise, or simplify your mental model more and more until the solution presents itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>One adds information — complexity you might even say — to solve a problem. The other eliminates it.</p>
<p>You know what that sort of makes me think of? NPM driven development.</p>
<p>Solving problems with LLMs is like solving front-end problems with NPM: the “solution” comes through installing more and more things — adding more and more context, i.e. more and more packages.</p>
<ul>
<li>LLM: Problem? Add more context. </li>
<li>NPM: Problem? There’s a package for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast that with a solution that comes through simplification. You don’t add more context. You simplify your mental model so you need less to solve a problem — if you solve it at all, perhaps you eliminate the problem entirely!</p>
<p>Rather than install another package to fix what ails you, you simplify your mental model which often eliminates the problem you had in the first place; thus eliminating the need to solve any problem at all, or to add any additional context or complexity (or dependency).</p>
<p>As I’m typing this, I’m thinking of that image of the evolution of the Raptor engine, where it evolved in simplicity:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/more-context-bro-rocket-1.jpg" width="540" height="339" alt="Photograph of three versions of the raptor engine, each one getting progressively simplified in mechanical parts." />

</p><p>This stands in contrast to my working with LLMs, which often wants more and more context from me to get to a generative solution:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/more-context-bro-rocket-2.jpg" width="540" height="339" alt="Photograph of three versions of the raptor engine, but the image is reversed showing the engine get progressively complicated in mechanical parts over time. Each engine represents an LLM prompt." />

</p><p>I know, I know. There’s probably a false equivalence here. This entire post started as <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com" >a note</a> and I just kept going. This post itself needs further thought and simplification. But that’ll have to come in a subsequent post, otherwise this never gets published lol.</p>

      <h1>2025-08-15 The liberal democrats in Switzerland</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-fdp">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-15-the-liberal-democrats-in-switzerland">2025-08-15 The liberal democrats in Switzerland</h1>

<p>One of the founding parties of the current state are the liberal democrats. My limited understanding of the situation is that they were all about liberty – against the ancient régime (the semi-feudal system before Napoleon and the French revolution helped us get rid of them) and against the church. My wife still remembers the small-scale feuding betweens catholics and protestants. My father in law still remembers that uneasy peace: going to school as a protestant in a mostly catholic village. His father was very much engaged in that struggle against the powers of the church.</p>

<p>These days, those battles are no longer that important. And so the liberal democrats turned to economic freedom. They turned into the part of bankers and industrialist. They rode that neoliberal devil. And now as it is faltering, a new change is afoot. Sadly, when they last looked for leadership, the only candidate who stood up was a xenophobe. But we already have a party of racists! The Swiss people&rsquo;s party. These people were originally more of a farmer&rsquo;s party but under the influence of billionaire Blocher they also rode that neoliberal horse. Down with taxes! Up with the banks! Down with regulation! Down with the European Union! Yeah, Blocher was a good demagogue.</p>

<p>The liberal democrats liked what they heard about taxes and didn&rsquo;t mind kicking out foreigners and so they worked together. But you know how it is: When in doubt, people prefer the clearer message. And on the non-demagoguery front, there was a strange thing that happened with the Green party. Like in many places, they had a left wing and a right wing. And their differences became so large, that the split! The Greens are now &ldquo;melon green&rdquo;: green on the outside and red on the inside. They work well with the socialists. The right wingers were the green liberals. The rational voice calling for a lowering of taxes.</p>

<p>A while ago there was a session of the liberal democrats where one of the delegates present was muttering against some decisions in favour of the environment. &ldquo;If we continue like this we might as well join the liberal greens!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, and that&rsquo;s the dilemma. Those who want less taxes and don&rsquo;t mind kicking foreigners around can join the Swiss people&rsquo;s party. Those who want less taxes and still save at least some of the planet can join the liberal greens.</p>

<p>Naturally, one of the more famous members of the Anti-Vaccination party, whose star has not been rising in recent months, wants to join the liberal democrats again.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how far this party has fallen.</p>

Then I realized that sometimes in software I'm climbing a cliff that's too tall to climb in one session, so I have to carry a tent and backpack with food and water. I hate this kind of programming more than anything, because it comes from not having a high-level enough runtime to support me in big corner turns. Or not having invested enough time in creating a layer I can build on. Anyway I'm in the middle of one of those corner-turns now. Hell has not broken loose although at times it looks like it might have. I'm being sure not to create another mess that needs to be cleaned up in the future. Not stressful, but I'd rather be doing anything but this. :-)

<p><a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Ashigaru" title="@Ashigaru@dice.camp">@Ashigaru</a> mentioned how D&amp;D 3.0 was really important for him at the time and <a class="account" href="https://metalhead.club/@dereisenhofer" title="@dereisenhofer@metalhead.club">@dereisenhofer</a> mentioned him playing DSA (Das Schwarze Auge, i.e. The Dark Eye). And I thought about my gaming history.</p>

<p>I moved from The Dark Eye 1st ed that I played as a kid and again as a 15-year old to AD&amp;D 1st ed when I was around 16 because a Canadian exchange student said it was the original and obviously it had to better. Some mere months later my group switched to the new AD&amp;D 2nd ed because obviously new had to be better. And then my interest waned.</p>

<p>Years later, I got into M20 because of the blogs, and my players wanted to play the just released D&amp;D 3.5 because obviously new had to better. With the switch to D&amp;D 4 I put my foot down and went with Labyrinth Lord – and lost almost all my players. 🥺</p>

<p>But I found new ones and kept on playing. So for me, D&amp;D 3.5 stands for those special years just before the OSR blogs took off, when I came back to the game.</p>
