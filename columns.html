<h2 id="the-best-job-in-the-world">The best job in the world</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Now that we know the outcome of the 2024 election, not just in numbers
but in what it’s doing to our beloved country and the rest of the world,
it’s interesting to revisit the campaign that journalism ran last year
to force President Biden to step aside. That’s one of the functions of
Facebook, they play back your posts from years ago, so you can see how
things changed, or didn’t.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, last year on this day I
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l">wrote
this</a> on Facebook: “Why don’t journalists cover the Biden base? Do
they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think
they are the base? I thought they weren’t supposed to care who the
nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should
withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this through?”
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B06VVR3DX6/about?ccs_id=add77910-b4f6-4323-80d0-494d4da9650f">Nick
Arnett</a>, a former tech journalist, said in a comment: “Until I read
this, the madness of the Times calling on Biden, but not Trump, to
withdraw didn’t dawn on me.”
</p>
<p>
I had followed his metamorphosis over years from a journalist to a
worker who goes where there are fires or other natural disasters, for
the government, to support the effort to save people’s homes and lives.
I watched him via Facebook, in awe, as he went around the country, not
being paid very much I imagine, but doing good.
</p>
<p>
I learned something important when my father was in the hospital many
years ago, in a coma, after losing a lot of blood and being unconscious
for hours before he was found. He was in a ward in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_Hospital_Medical_Center">Flushing
Hospital</a>, along with a lot of other people in various stages of
incapacity. All were unconscious, unable to feed themselves. Hard to
know if they had any awareness. From an outside perspect they, and my
father included, were lost. Some had been there for years, probably
weren’t ever going to come out of it. We were lucky, my father survived,
after a month, and had seven more years to live.
</p>
<p>
I visited him every day, and got to know the flow of the hospital.
Workers came in and out of the room to attend to these comatose people.
Imagine the kind of support they needed just to keep their bodies
functioning and not wasting away for lack of movement. I thought these
people have the worst jobs imaginable, imagining myself in their shoes.
</p>
<p>
I got to know them, asked about what else they do, how they got here,
where they live, etc. Somehow I got up the courage to ask one of them if
they liked their job, imagining I’d get a New Yorker comment like “You
know, it’s a living.” But what I heard was a complete surprise. “It’s
the best job in the world,” they said, because I can see so clearly how
my work helps real people. He was looking right at me. It hit me, this
man is doing what I can’t do, what my father’s parents, who were long
gone, couldn’t do. <i>Caring.</i> Caring for my dad. Then I got it.
</p>
<p>
Back to Nick, who was and still is, and probably always will be doing
things to help other people, no matter what he does.
</p>
<p>
He was canned in one of the DOGE purges this spring.
</p>
<p>
Now you tell me whether the “Trump base” deserved a chance you wouldn’t
let us have with Biden? Why journalism felt entitled to make this
decision for all of us? When are you going to get the idea that you’re
supposed to help us. Do the right thing. I get so angry at journalism
for getting in the way. Once informed of the facts, it was their job to
get out of the way and let us, the voters, make the decision.

<h2 id="fast-easy-open-social-web">Fast &amp; easy Open Social Web</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
You hear the term
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Open+Social+Web%22">Open
Social Web</a> used in places where things that are social are neither
open or web. They aren’t that far, and here today I’m going to give you
a fast and easy recipe for linking the collection of social twitter-like
sites into a real honest to goodness open social web
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Add inbound RSS feeds. The social site allows a user to specify an RSS
feed that represents their posts. When a new one shows up, it appears in
the timelines of people who are following the user. They can add items
to that feed however they like. It can come from anywhere. That’s 1/2 of
“open.”
</li>
<li>
Add outbound RSS feeds. This gives you the other half. When a new item
shows up in a users feed, however it got there, it appears in their
outbound feed, which can be tied into the input feed of one or more
other sites.
</li>
<li>
Support links in users’ posts. You really can’t claim to be part of the
web if you don’t implement this core feature of the web.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That’s all there is, except this: The feeds have to be good. Don’t be
cheap with the information they contain. Work with other developers to
make sure all the information they need that you have is present in the
outbound feeds you generate. Same with the inbound feeds, be reasonable,
if you can accept certain information and match it up with your service,
then you should do it. Think of the users first.
</p>
<p>
You could try to use ActivityPub or AT Proto to play the role of RSS. I
think you’ll find that’s more work, and not that many people have
mastered these formats. RSS is simple and lightweight and has had 20+
years of burn in. Lots of familiarity, lots of working code.
</p>
<p>
It’s time to stop claiming you are the open social web when it’s so easy
to be the open and on the web.
</p>

<p>
More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers,
since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole
range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter
based on IP numbers won’t catch them. But if we can determine their
autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number
range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.
</p>
<p>
Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other
fediverse instances, I don’t want to block them forever. I want to block
them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter
blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have
ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how
fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I want code that bridges this gap.

<p>
<a href="github.com/WKnak/fail2ban-bloc">fail2ban-bloc</a> tries to
guess (!) IP ranges and bans those using fail2ban. I need to investigate
more.
</p>
<p>
I’m still fascinated by
<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-05-30-asncounter/">asncounter</a>.
It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For
now, it generates an interesting Top 10 list. What’s interesting about
it is that it doesn’t require me to query an external service and leak
IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I used to have the following fish function, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn
    for ip in $argv
        dig +short (string split '.' $ip|tac -|string join '.').origin.asn.cymru.com. TXT
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
What I don’t want to do is write another tool like
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">network-lookup-lean</a> which uses
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> for the same purposes, caches results,
and so on. I want to get rid of this live lookup.

OK, this is bots. Useless random URLs.

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">
Ban all the networks managed by an ASN
</h2>
<p>
I’m going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists,
<code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>. I use these two for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.
</p>
<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little
fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s try it with the ASN 45899!
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>
<p>
For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments
on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are
at it again</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got
a single “it’s already added” response. Before adding the same numbers
to my shell script, therefore:
</p>
<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>
<p>
That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script.
Once this is done:
</p>
<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr 
</code></pre>
<p>
I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to
figure out a way to unban the whole list!
</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-fail2ban">
Integration with <code>fail2ban</code>
</h2>
<p>
Let’s start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs
a filter!
</p>
<p>
In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain
all my jails) I added:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that this jail doesn’t define log paths. I hope that works as
intended.
</p>
<p>
I created a matching filter with no definition in
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it all, and check:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload
OK
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:  6
`- Jail list:   alex-apache, alex-bots, butlerian-jihad, ngircd, recidive, sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
Nice! So now I have a new jail.
</p>
<h2 id="undo-the-banlist">

</h2>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sed 's/ipset add/ipset del/' | sh

I also manually edited my <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> file to
remove the lines I added above. Let’s have fail2ban handle this!
</p>
<h2 id="switch-from-ipset-to-fail2ban-client">

        echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip $cidr
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | less
</code></pre>
<p>
Run it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
3640
</code></pre>
<p>
If you messed up, clear the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload --unban butlerian-jihad
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned
</code></pre>
<p>
Count the entries in the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq length
3640
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-do-we-have">
What do we have?
</h2>
<p>
With <code>asncounter</code> we have a tool to quickly discover if an
ASN is providing services to a bot.
</p>
<p>
With <code>asn-ban</code> we have a tool to quickly add all the IP
networks the ASN is managing to a jail for <code>fail2ban</code>.
</p>
<p>
The jail which we called <code>butlerian-jihad</code> bans the IP
networks for a day.
</p>
<h2 id="what-s-left-to-do">
What’s left to do?
</h2>
<p>
I should check whether this actually works! Let’s see whether the ban
gets lifted after 24h. That’s the main point of this exercise!

<code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data.
This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as
<code>asncounter</code>. I guess that would be
<a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>. See below!
</p>
<p>
I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes
worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies
all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.

<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a
bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges
managed by one or more autonomous systems.
</p>
<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24

</code></pre>
<p>
It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of
<code>asncounter</code> has downloaded. That is to say,
<code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files. I’m
assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.
</p>
<p>
Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as
follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Unbanning works the same way:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP
numbers or ranges added or removed.
</p>
<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">
Identifying suspicious ASN
</h2>
<p>
What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN
should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters
the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to
ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the
IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we
don’t care about and just print the appropriate lines:
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062    31.93   24940   HETZNER-AS, DE
1642    17.12   16276   OVH, FR
</code></pre>
<p>
So do I dare ban those numbers?? I’m not sure! I should figure out a way
to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You
pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it
filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log
lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social | bin/asn-access-log 24940
</code></pre>
<p>
I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent,
FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example),
and on and on. Ugh. It’s not easy to know what to do!
</p>
<p>
I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for
shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest.
The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount
of resources spent OK. Do I? Let’s look at the latest numbers.
</p>
<p>
This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it
hard for me to block these autonomous systems.

<p>
The autonomous systems that show up in the second list but not in the
first list are my prime candidates, like COMCAST and CHINAMOBILE-CN.
</p>
<p>
So how about going after the autonomous systems on the second list that
produce more than 1000 hits in a 2h period.
</p>
<p>
Something like this? I’m going to but this into
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code>
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

<h2 id="summary">
Summary
</h2>
<p>
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code> runs every hour and checks
if there have been any abusive autonomous systems in the last two hours.
If so, they are banned. Note how I’ve added my home IPv4 and IPv6
because I use my site a lot. 😅
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 !MY-HOME-IPV4 !MY-HOME-IPV6 \
| awk '{print $2}' \

| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip \
&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>
This drops the output (the number of new bans) because otherwise the
cron job mails that number to me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two
hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code>
(and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).
</p>
<p>
The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi
server doesn’t trigger the ban hammer.
</p>
<p>
The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don’t ban the
server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I
also had to add my home IP numbers!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds
the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server
log file and prints a report.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected
autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.
</p>
<p>
These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a
config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file
is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>
<p>
The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens
as no logfile is checked. My
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just
this:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get
banned for generating more than 500 hits in 2h. If they are banned, they
are banned for 1h. If they are banned for activity in the last hour
leading up to the ban (more than 500 hits in 1h), the script will find
the same log entries and ban them “again”. This results in no changes in
the jail, since all the networks are already in the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same
file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>
<p>
The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is
banned for a week. I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set
to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an
autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It
sends 400 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than
a feed reader should need, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
after the first hour, nothing happens, as 400 is less than the 500
needed to trigger the system
</li>
<li>
after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the
last two hours is 800
</li>
<li>
after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because
it only made 400 requests in the second hour
</li>
<li>
after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again
</li>
<li>
after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time
</li>
<li>
after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time
</li>
<li>
after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time
</li>
<li>
after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the
<code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the
ASN are banned for a week
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half
this time.
</p>
<p>
Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats
every 7½ weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h
or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see how this goes for a while.
</p>
<p>
I’m already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and
<code>banlist6</code> sets I created for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.

Back when I first encountered the distributed AI bot attacks, I wrote
<a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a> and
began working on <code>ban-cidr</code>. In later posts, I just automated
the work of getting from an IP number to a network range and adding that
to the script. Now that I hopefully have an automatic solution where I
only need to fine-tune the time-windows and the limits, it’s time to
expire all those bans. There are currently over 40,000 of these banned
networks.

<p>
Ugh. They need to go.
</p>
<p>
First, create the two lists. At this level we need two different lists
for IPv4 and IPv6.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
Then define a new version of <code>asn-ban</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    set --local data (asn-networks --json $argv)
    for asn in $argv
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v4[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist $ip
        end
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v6[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist6 $ip
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses the <code>–json</code> option for
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> so that we only need to
call it once and yet we get two lists: one for <code>banlist</code> and
one for <code>banlist6</code>.
</p>
<p>
To ban the offending ASN:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 55836|sh
</code></pre>
<p>
Before I do that, however, I want to finish clearing the existing lists.
</p>
<p>
The reason I call this petty banning is because I’m starting to ban
autonomous systems even though their bots are “well behaved” in as much
as they don’t exceed the thresholds I defined. And yet they seem to be
part of that great parade to honour the CO₂ god, the computation of
useless shit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-06-20</strong>. I’m thinking about alternatives but I think
that’s not worth it. For example: Perhaps it’s important to look at
relative distribution?

<p>
At first I thought, more than a third of all requests for Tencent? I
must block them. But then I saw that it was just 7 requests in 2h. Not
worth it.
</p>
<p>
Here I saw that there were more requests, and an 80% share!

So, I don’t know. And if I don’t care about the relative share of
requests, then I also don’t have to count them per site.

I already wrote a little thing to give me a regular expression for every
site I host! But now I’m not going to use it. I leave it here for you,
dear reader. 😄

<p>Recipe for a fast and easy
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22open%20social%20web%22">open
social web</a>. A lot of interop can be attained quickly by connecting
the input and output of each distinct network to other networks that
don’t currently interop via
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22inbound%20rss%22">inbound</a>
and
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22outbound%20rss%22">outbound
RSS</a>. ActivityPub and AT Proto are not optimal. Too complicated. RSS
is simple and lightweight and has has 20+ years of burn in. Lots of
familiarity, and lots of working code. And WordPress is built around it
and imho that is going to matter. When people get really serious about
interop, and are willing to sacrifice a little personal glory, there’s a
very good compromise available.</p>

<p>Net-net: I would pay money to hear a podcast with Frum and Stewart
interviewing each other. That would be very powerful stuff imho, and
probably very funny, and respectful.</p>

<p>The latest David Frum podcast is about
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-show-tina-brown-iran-nuclear-program/683320/">crazy
tech billionaires</a>. Once again he talks about who he’s willing to
listen to. He’s really smart, thinks about things, and speaks
brilliantly, but cultivates his ignorance and seems somewhat proud of
it. In contrast, I listened to Jon Stewart’s weekly podcast
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/iran-beyond-the-headlines-with-maziar-bahari/id1583132133?i=1000714626073">yesterday</a>
and it was as usual outstanding. Like Frum he thinks and speaks
brilliantly, with the addition of being hilarious at times. In this
episode he talks to an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maziar_Bahari">Iranian
friend</a>, a new perspective we don’t hear often, but fits in with what
I had
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=iran">understood</a>
about Iran. It’s a highly educated country, a good standard of living
and are mired with a repressive government and no options for regime
change. When you hear that talked about on other podcasts and cable news
shows, remember – it’s impossible to change regimes unless the country
has prepared for that. There is no regime-in-waiting in Iran, hasn’t
been one since the 1979 revolution. This is the next danger in the US.
Will there be anything remaining of our political system? It’s almost
all gone now. Funny to listen to the people on TV about surviving the
next 3.5 years – what do they think will happen then? Nothing will
happen, that’s the most likely thing. Back to Frum, what a shame there’s
such a smart guy, so cloistered, and boastful about it. That’s not a
good way to proceed now imho.</p>

<p>I’m working on the next part of linkblogging in
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. I want to really switch
over to the new routine. There was a question of whether I wanted to
push the links to the social sites, Bluesky, Mastodon, etc. I’ve decided
I do, but for the moment only to push to Bluesky. It’s the only one with
a simple enough-enough API or feels worth the effort to me. I’m
basically focusing my politics on Bluesky these days. Also seems there
are people there who are interested in the development I do. I have far
more “followers” on Twitter, but at this point I think most of them are
gone. And Threads dropped off my radar a while back. I’m just not
interested. For me now it’s mostly Bluesky and Facebook.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/06/10/bear.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
have a Google Alerts query for my own name, just to see if any
journalism outlets mention me. When it happens, it’s often to give me
credit for co-creating an app called iPodder, which they say was where
podcasting started. None of that is true. But that’s what journalism
says about me.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand if you ask ChatGPT what role I played in developing
podcasting it gives a more accurate answer.
</p>
<p>
So tell me what the role of journalism is. Hallucinating myths into
fact? That would be my estimate.
</p>
<p>
Here’s <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/28/chatgpt.png">the
ChatGPT result</a>. I actually did a bit more than that, but what they
say is closer to the truth and gives an idea of how things like
podcasting come into existence. A lot of work and struggle against
people’s disbelief, and most of the time it doesn’t work – podcasting is
one of the successes.
</p>
<p>
BTW, the second item in ChatGPT’s list is not true. Adam’s <i>Daily
Source Code</i> came after my own podcast
<i><a href="https://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning Coffee Notes</a>.
</i>I was urging him to do a podast but he didn’t get one going until
after I went first, proving the old adage “People don’t listen to their
friends, they listen to their competitors.” So somewhere along the line
it got confused and it hallucinated just like the journalists. The
actual first podcast was a Grateful Dead song in 2001 which I used to
test Radio UserLand which was the first software to implement
podcasting. There’s a documentary coming out soon and I believe they
have a bit about that, so maybe that’ll get on the record.
</p>
<p>
If this is how history is written btw, I wouldn’t trust <i>anything</i>
in the history books. ;-)

<p>
I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/44p0yFV">Acurite 5-in-1 weather

air in my back yard. It comes with a fancy little LCD display to show
all the stats it transmits over the 433 MHz wireless frequency.

But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I
can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind
speed is above 50 mph, or there’s lightnining less than 10 miles away),
etc.
</p>
<p>
I’ll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now,
just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:

<p>BTW, I think the right way to read Scripting News is getting the
<a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">nightly email</a>. That’s the
pulse. I jot stuff down during the day, mostly in the morning, and later
add links and finish stuff up. The scripting.com feed is updated in
realtime. So you may get many versions of an item over the day, which
might be a problem with feed readers that don’t watch for changes. I
noticed that my changes to a recent podcast
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">shownotes
page</a> don’t flow back out to my podcast client app on Android.
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> btw, records changes, and
they flow through to the timeline. Coupled with
<a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">rssCloud</a>, which is supported in
every WordPress site, makes the whole thing realtime. People assume that
feeds have to perform like a feed reader. But if you have a component
running on the open internet, hooked up via websockets to the client,
you get the flow they get in twitter-like systems. And we didn’t have to
invent anything that didn’t already exist in 2009.</p>

<p>Sending this ad is completely destructive to all the hard work other
teams at Apple have done to make Apple Wallet actually private — and,
more importantly, <em>to get users to believe that it’s
private</em>.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-27, updated: 2025-06-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
We need to talk about data integrity.
</p>
<p>
Narrowly, the term refers to ensuring that data isn’t tampered with,
either in transit or in storage. Manipulating account balances in bank
databases, removing entries from criminal records, and murder by
removing notations about allergies from medical records are all
integrity attacks.
</p>
<p>
More broadly, integrity refers to ensuring that data is correct and
accurate from the point it is collected, through all the ways it is
used, modified, transformed, and eventually deleted. Integrity-related
incidents include malicious actions, but also inadvertent mistakes…

<h2 id="productivity-traps-i-fall-into-regularly">Productivity traps I
fall into regularly</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
There’s some productivity traps I fall into on a regular basis. They all
tie into my personal flavor of ADHD but it’s not totally fair to blame
the ol’ meat-wad brain when I know when, where, and why it happens.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
There’s a Big Thing to do, so I can’t do anything else
</li>
<li>
Boredom in meetings leads internet wanderings
</li>
<li>
I should blog this real quick turns into work avoidance
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
The Big Thing…
</h2>
<p>
One of my ADHD quirks is that if there’s a Big Thing to do that day
(doctor’s appointment, package delivery, big presentation) then 100% of
my brain goes to that important event. I can’t miss it. Nothing else
gets done until The Big Thing gets done.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, after The Big Thing gets done, nothing else gets done either
because my brain –flooded with dopamine– feels an enormous sense of
accomplishment for remembering to do The Big Thing. I did The Big Thing.
The Big Thing is done. Mission accomplished.
</p>
<p>
Completing that big task should free up new brain RAM allocation for the
next task… but it doesn’t work that way. I spent so much energy keeping
the horses in the barn, my brain won’t even consider letting them out
again until much later in the evening. Hands numb from sitting on them
try to grab a new task from the shelf, but can’t.
</p>
<p>
If anyone deals with this and knows how to either a) make The Big Thing
less blocking or b) perform a tactial reset after The Big Thing, I’d
love to know.
</p>
<h2>
Boredom in meetings…
</h2>
<p>
I have a bad habit where I get dopamine starved in a meeting and I
naturally hop over to YouTube and start queuing up interesting videos.
This regrettably creates a backlog of open tabs for me to clear out when
I’m out of the meeting. This isn’t good. It’s so bad because I’ll even
look for other videos to watch <em>while I’m watching a video</em>. Why
do I do this to myself?
</p>
<p>
I need to reprogram my brain to smell boredom and find dopamine another
–more temporary– way. I used to speed cube during meetings, that was
probably my most successful era of doing meetings. I should try and go
back to that. Or 3D print a bunch of fidgets. I bought a big drawing pad
at Five Below and put it next to my desk and have had a little success
sketching during meetings, but YouTube and social media are so damn
convenient.
</p>
<p>
It’s not just video, it happens with blog posts too. One social media
link. Links to another link. Links to another. Now I have 5,000 tabs.
Oof.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/raycast-focus/">Focus</a> tools
to block social media sites has been effective, but any other strategies
I need to know about?
</p>
<h2>
Blog this real quick…
</h2>
<p>
If I ever think about something too much and it’s blogpost-worthy
content, I try to fire up a draft to get the idea out of my head. If I
can create a rough outline in my second brain now, I can come back to it
later… but it’s a worm hole.
</p>
<p>
While the intent is to capture the idea, I naturally switch into writing
mode trying to fill out sentences and shape paragraphs. I think it’s
dopamine starvation again. When I’m writing in my note taking app, I’m
in a fun place where I’m a high functioning adult and the desire to go
back to trudging through thousands of lines of JSON is low in
comparison.
</p>
<p>
Of all these productivity traps, writing a blog post is the least
offensive to me. Writing ideas helps cement knowledge and that’s a good
thing for a knowledge worker. It also keeps a skill I use at work
(writing) sharp. But when it’s a form of escapism from what I actually
need to do, I need to find efficient ways to curb that behavior.
Time-boxing seems like a good idea here.
</p>
<h2>
Here be dragons
</h2>
<p>
I’m sharing these traps in the hope that I become more cognizant and
accountable to myself. I can almost see myself falling down these traps
in a third-person over camera angle. “The Big Thing” probably gets me
the most often, I’d love to overcome it.
</p>
<p>
I’m curious about other brains. Have you found other traps I need to
know about? Do you embrace the chaos and let the day fall apart? Do you
have systems built up to self-correct?

what the Democrats should learn from Mr. Z’s victory in the NYC primary
this week. Here’s what I say. Forget about ever rising from the ashes of
what remains of the party. Right now, the issue is how to defend the
city from the coming war with the US government. They’re already holding
the current mayor hostage. This will be worse than 9-11 and Covid. We
have no leadership. We’re totally fucked, what the Democratic Party does
or doesn’t do, at this point, simply doesn’t matter.</p>

Reuters is

<p>
The notice said the “Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high

data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks
involved with its use.”

The bisse flows into this creek and a few meters below there’s a
continuation on the other side, where water is taken out of the creek to
continue the biss (with different water).

<p>date: 2025-06-25, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I tried an experiment,
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/25/asfarasyoucango.png">go
back</a> as far as I can in archive.org on scripting.com and see where
it gets me. The
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961114163115/http://scripting.com/">first
try</a> got me to a classified ads site I was experimenting with in
mid-November 1996. A few weeks later, on
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224609/http://scripting.com/">December
3,</a> there was a colorful directory that took you to all the sub-sites
on the server, DaveNet,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/">Frontier</a>,
Classified ads, our Midas Website (Macintosh Internet Developers
Association), DocServer, a BBS, and Guestbook.
</p>
<p>
I went digging around in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/">Frontier</a>
part. Lots of stuff there. By then we had been working on Frontier for
eight years. It had been reborn once, from a Mac-focused single-user
scripting environment to a networked one, all because the web had
exploded and Apple didn’t want us making system software for their
platform. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
BTW, some of this stuff is
<a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html">still here</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of paths to try out.
</p>
<p>
This was where my
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224710/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/news.html">blog
home page</a> was then.
</p>
<p>
Then to DaveNet, and in the left margin

<h2 id="inverse-text-sizing-based-on-text-length-with-attr">Inverse
text-sizing based on text-length with attr()</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-25, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Text reflow on the web has an interesting relationship with Responsive
Web Design. As a column gets smaller text wraps and becomes
taller<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.
But for large format display text, that’s not always what you
want<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>.
What I’ve wanted for awhile now is a way to inversely size text based on
the text length (where the font-size gets smaller as the heading gets
longer).
</p>
<p>
I’ve been chasing the white whale of responsive text-sizing for over a
decade and I think I’ve got my best attempt to-date with the new
<code>attr()</code> upgrades that landed in CSS (Chromium-only at time
of writing).

CSS’s <code>attr()</code> function got an upgrade this year where you
can use it independent of <code>content</code> in pseudo-elements. They
also added the ability to cast types to the values. Before that change
all attributes were text strings and if you tried to use it in a
<code>calc()</code> function, CSS would bail because you can’t multiply
a pixel by a text string. With the new upgraded <code>attr()</code>
function you can specify a type in the new <code>type()</code> function
as the second parameter of <code>attr()</code>: <code>attr(foo
type(&lt;number&gt;))</code> .
</p>
<p>
Having these pieces of technology in place lets us mix in HTML
attributes to our CSS math.

  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
We start with an <code>–ideal-cpl</code>, which is a typographic notion
that there’s an ideal line-length at or near 66 characters per line and
perhaps smaller on mobile (source:
<a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/optimal-line-length-for-readability/">UXPin</a>).
Headings are probably less. We take that number and divide it by
<code>–numchars</code> from our <code>data-numchars</code> attribute to
get a ratio to multiply our text by (e.g. <code>45cpl / 60numchars =
0.75</code> or <code>45cpl / 30numchars = 1.5</code>).
</p>
<p>
Then set some min/max variables and chuck it all into a
<code>clamp()</code> function to enforce some limits. Anything under the
<code>–ideal-cpl</code> will clamped to the <code>–max-font-size</code>
and titles over the <code>–ideal-cpl</code> will shrink down until they
hit the <code>–min-font-size</code>.
</p>
<p>
To help with graceful degradation in unsupported browsers (Safari,
Firefox), we need to use the CSSOM <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="property">@property</span></code> syntax to typecast our
<code>–numchars</code> custom property. This is a hint to browsers like
Mobile Safari that <code>–numchars</code> is going to be a
<code>&lt;number&gt;</code> and we can set a fallback value as well.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Property used to provide fallback to other browsers */</span>
<span class="k">@property</span> <span class="n">--numchars</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Hopefully the “magic” here is pretty easy to understand but for
completion’s sake, you’ll need to add <code>data-numchars</code> to your
HTML to make this work.
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">data-numchars=</span><span class="s">"71"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

Templating languages can help. Here’s what I do in my Liquid templates
for Jekyll:
</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="ruby">
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">numchars</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"{{ title.size }}"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">{{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="p">}}</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/h1&gt;

</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
If you don’t have access to your template but somehow have access to
JavaScript, you can do something this:
</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="js"><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">querySelectorAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">h1</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">forEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">el</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> 
    <span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataset</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">numchars</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">textContent</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
I’ve went ahead and rolled this technique out on my entire site and made
a <a href="/all-titles">All Titles</a> page where I can tweak variables
to my liking. The result is I get to keep my chonky headlines on mobile,
but almost no heading wrap more than three lines. One improvement might
be to use more CSS math to snap to different short/medium/long sizes, so
its less cacophonous… but on my site you only see one display title at a
time, so it’s less of a big deal.

<p>
With all that in place, we have a HTML/CSS-based solution for responsive
text-sizing with minimal overhead, no JS required, no extra DOM, and a
graceful degradation to older browsers. I intentionally kept this dumb
to allow for text wrapping, but
<a href="https://codepen.io/paulirish/pen/YPXyxeZ">Paul Irish forked
me</a> to make a <code>contenteditable</code> demo work edge-to-edge
like Kizu’s <a href="https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width/">Fit-to-Width</a> or

Impressive. There’s lots of ways to resize text responsively and I’ve
added another one to the pile, so here’s a little guide with how I’m
thinking about all the options.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you want <em>exact</em> edge-to-edge text-sizing I’d probably
recommend Kizu’s clever Fit-to-Width technique.
</li>
<li>
If you (and your designers) are okay with not-so-exact edge-to-edge
sizing, Paul’s approach seems like a good candidate.
</li>
<li>
Don’t forget about SVG. Converting display text to outlines in Figma and
exporting as SVG is also a nice option for exact fitting text one-offs,
but doesn’t localize well.
</li>
<li>
If you want text to scale-inversely to its length but still wrap, use
the approach in this post.
</li>
<li>
If you want text to be a bit more fluid between breakpoints, use
<code>clamp()</code> + <code>vw</code> units.
</li>
<li>
If you want text to scale based on it’s parent’s width like a vector,
then <strong>DON’T USE</strong> FitText and use
<code>clamp(var(–min-font-size), 10cqi, var(–max-font-size))</code> with
a CSS container instead.
</li>
<li>
If you want strict typographic control at every breakpoint, use
<code>rem</code> or <code>px</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lots of options for scalable type out there that give type-setting
control freak nerds nightmares, have fun!

<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve enjoyed using Ubuntu Server&#39;s GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it&#39;s a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead,
and it doesn’t even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!
</p>
<p>
So I thought I’d write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu
Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven’t
found a similar guide elsewhere:
</p>
<h2>
Install OpenSSH
</h2>
<p>
Open Terminal and enter the commands:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>
<p>
OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu’s default configuration. You can edit the
configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make
sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).
</p>
<h2>
Import your GitHub public keys
</h2>

I make thumbnails for YouTube</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;
height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe,
.embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute;
top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</p>
<p>
My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects
crowds like those on HN might find interesting.
</p>
<p>
Technical audiences don’t often enjoy the feeling of being ‘bamboozled’,
especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.
</p>
<p>
Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early
days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was
harder (but not impossible) to ‘game the system’ and introduce

Herve</a> is a developer at Automattic. Here’s

said</a> about yesterday’s
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">podcast</a>.
He liked the idea of WordPress as the OS of the open social web. Glad
that resonated. It has so much more than the other possible platforms.
The others couldn’t even realistically claim to be part of the web. They
don’t support writers very well. We’re going to build slowly and
deliberately around this idea, always staying open for competitors,
because that’s the most important thing about the web, beyond its
simplicity, it <i>never</i> locks its users in. That’s a deal-stopper.
As I’ve learned how WordPress works internally, I immediately saw that
they embraced the concepts of the web not just as words, but in their
practice. I never hit a wall that kept me out of doing something they
already did. And they also appear to never break users and developers.
That’s one of the basic rules of the web, it’s an unchanging thing, no
one can break it because everyone is a
<a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/">guest</a>. Anyway, there is
only one web. Keep that in mind. Nothing exclusive about it.</p>

only DESQview/X had been launched when Quarterdeck starting talking
about it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Liam on Linux</p>
A response to an
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44353673">HN
comment</a>…<br /><br />The PC press had rumours of Quarterdeck’s
successor to DESQview, Desqview/X, from around 1987-1988.
<p>
That is roughly when I entered the computer industry.<br /><br />Dv/X
was remarkable tech, and if it had shipped earlier could have changed
the course of the industry. Sadly, it came too late. Dv/X was rumoured
then, but the state of the art was OS/2 1.1, released late 1988 and the
first version of OS/2 with a GUI.
</p>
<p>
Dv/X was not released until
<a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/desqview/desqview-x-1x">about 5Y
later</a>… 1992. That’s the same year as Windows 3.1, but critically,
Windows 3.0 was in 1990, 2 years <i>earlier</i>.
</p>
<p>
Windows 3.0 was a result of the flop of OS/2 1.x.
</p>
<p>
OS/2 1.x was a new 16-bit multitasking networking kernel – but that
meant new drivers.
</p>
<p>
MS discarded the radical new OS, it discarded networking completely
(until later), and moved the multitasking into the GUI layer, allowing
Win3 to run on top of the single-tasking MS-DOS kernel. That meant
excellent compatibility: it ran on almost anything, can it could run
almost all DOS apps, <i>and multitask them</i>. And thanks to a
brilliant skunkworks project, mostly by one man, David Weise, assisted
by Murray Sargent, it combined 3 separate products (Windows 2,
Windows/286 and Windows/386) into a single product that ran on all 3
types of PC and took good advantage of all of them. I wrote about its
development here:
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3…</a>
</p>
<p>
It also did bring in some of the GUI design from OS/2 1.1, mainly from
1.2, and 1.3 – the Program Manager and File Manager UI, the proportional
fonts, the fake-3D controls, some of the Control Panel, and so on. It
kept the best user-facing parts and threw away the fancy invisible stuff
underneath which was problematic.
</p>
<p>
Result: smash hit, redefined the PC market, and when Dv/X arrived it was
doomed: too late, same as OS/2 2.0, which came out the same year as
Dv/X.
</p>
<p>
If Dv/X had come out in the late 1980s, before Windows 3, it could have
changed the way the PC industry went.
</p>
<p>
Dv/X combined the good bits of DOS, 386 memory management and
multitasking, Unix networking and Unix GUIs into an interesting value
proposition: network your DOS PCs with Unix boxes over Unix standards,
get remote access to powerful Unix apps, and if vendors wanted, it
enabled ports of Unix apps to this new multitasking networked DOS.
</p>
<p>
In the ’80s that could have been a contender. Soon afterwards it was
followed by Linux and the BSDs, which made that Unix stuff free and ran
on the same kit. That would have been a great combination – Dv/X PCs
talking to BSD or Linux servers, when those Unix boxes didn’t really
have useful GUIs yet.
</p>
<p>
Windows 3 offered a different deal: it combined the good bits of DOS,
OS/2 1.x’s GUI, and Windows 2.x into a whole that ran on anything and
could run old DOS apps and new GUI apps, side by side.
</p>
<p>Networking didn’t follow until Windows for Workgroups which followed
Windows 3.1. Only businesses wanted that, so MS postponed it. Good
move.<br /> <br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95984" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<blockquote>
<p>
The vast majority of the attack was delivered in the form of User
Datagram Protocol packets. Legitimate UDP-based transmissions are used
in especially time-sensitive communications, such as those for video
playback, gaming applications, and DNS lookups. It speeds up
communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is
transferred. Unlike the more common Transmission Control Protocol, UDP
doesn’t wait for a connection between two computers to be established
through a handshake and doesn’t check whether data is properly received
by the other party. Instead, it immediately sends data from one machine
to another…

<h2 id="wordcamp-canada-in-october">WordCamp Canada in October</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m keynoting the <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/">WordCamp
Canada</a> conference in October in Ottawa. It’s the first conference
I’ve attended since before the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
The timing is ideal, and the location is significant. As an American, I
don’t want to try to attract people from around the world to a meeting
in my country. Right now, I wouldn’t come here if I didn’t live here.
</p>
<p>
I’m also not happy with the tech industry of the US. I’d like a fresh
start, a return to our roots, with the assumption that the people
control their destiny and the role of developers is to give them to the
tools to try out new ideas.
</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> I’ve created a
product <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">for writers</a>, filling a
need that’s been there since the beginning of the web, using the
practices in writing tools we learned in the 80s. It doesn’t have the
artificial <a href="https://textcasting.org/">limits</a> imposed by
Twitter et al. I think they’re senseless. So we’re going to blow that
door wide open. No character limits. Simple styling. Links. Editable.
</p>
<p>
And it’s also a product for developers. There’s no lock-in anywhere in
this stack. So you can make a different style of editor. Or play with
new ways to view timelines.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to take discourse in a different direction too. A good design
for the social web shouldn’t require intense moderation. The reward for
spammers is practically nil. Also, it’ll be good for small groups in a
way that Twitter et al never have been.
</p>
<p>
So far I haven’t invented any new formats. We’re building on what works
now. WordPress is a remarkably deep product, so deep it could be used as
operating system. and that’s exactly how I’ve chosen to view it and it
works incredibly well. Some of what we’re building on is based on work I
did with Joseph Scott of Automattic in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22joseph%20scott%22">2009</a>,
believe it or not.
</p>
<p>
And as a bonus we get a great bridge into ActivityPub, from the great
work Automattic is doing in bridging WordPress to ActivityPub. Think
about it and you’ll see how connections in and out of WordPress can
facilitate a lot of interop, not just via RSS, but any format that comes
along that people want to use.
</p>
<p>
We’ll have a lot to talk about in October!

<h2 id="rss-on-a-timeline">RSS on a timeline</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
More on the vision for WordLand and RSS.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is the
editor of a
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22twitter-like%22">twitter-like</a>
system built around
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. It saves your
writing to WordPress, where it is published on a website and via RSS.
You don’t have to use WordLand or WordPress, because RSS is an open
format. <i>Any editor that generates RSS is part of the network.
</i>Designed to be simple.
</p>
<p>
All that’s missing is a timeline viewer, and that’s what I’m working on
now. It’s coming together pretty nicely, imho. Not an easy project,
though on the surface it looks like it should be. Also there’s nothing
proprietary about my timeline viewer. There could be a thousand of them.
Anyone who has written an RSS feed reader will have all the low-level
bits they need.
</p>
<p>
Hoping to have all the connections working by the end of the summer.
</p>
<p>
Once done, it will be the completion of the vision for RSS as the
foundation of the open social web, the place that all the open formats
agree on, so we can get on with interop and say goodbye to lock-in. It
can be done, I’m almost 100 percent sure of that now. Still have a
little ways to go. As they say – <i>still diggin!</i>
