<h2 id="on-iot-devices-and-software-liability">On IoT Devices and
Software Liability</h2>

<p>
Smart Device Manufacturer Liability and Redress for Third-Party
Cyberattack Victims
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks
against both their users and third parties. While users are generally
able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection
legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party
victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these
cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and
yet un-remediated bug in the smart device’s code, this lacuna is
unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the
Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the
Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for
third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the
manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway,
which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care
can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer
of the smart device is proposed…

<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>I love politics and I love this country, but I don’t love cold
weather. To this Texan, there’s cold, and there’s Iowa cold. For me,
it’s the wind, the bitter wind blowing across the plains that just cuts
you. I’ve spent my fair share of Januaries in the Hawkeye State
reporting on the Iowa caucuses, and I can safely say there is no such
thing as too much clothing. But stand by, because forecasters say this
coming Monday may be the coldest ever for a caucus, with temperatures
predicted to be below zero — all for an event that requires Iowans to
leave the warm confines of their homes to participate in a presidential
nominating contest.</p>

This is the famous

hype cycle</i></a> and it certianly appears that autonomous vehicles are
currently in the <i>Trough of Disillusionment</i>. Whether they will
eventually soar up to the <i>Plateau of Productivity</i> is unknown, but
for now it is clear even to practitioners that the hype bubble they have
been riding for years has burst.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I try to
catch up with the flood of reporting on the autonomous vehicle winter
triggered by the bursting of the bubble.<br />

<h3>
Cruise
</h3>
The most obvious symptom is the implosion of General Motors’ Cruise
robotaxi division. Brad Templeton worked on autonomy at Waymo and is an
enthusiast for the technology. But in
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2023/12/28/robocar-2023-in-review-the-fall-of-cruise/"><i>Robocar
2023 In Review: The Fall Of Cruise</i></a> he acknowledges that things
aren’t going well:<br />
<blockquote>
Looking at 2023 in review for self-driving cars, one story stands out as
the clear top story of the year, namely the fall of General Motors’
“Cruise” robotaxi division, which led to a pause of operations for
Cruise over the whole USA, a ban on operations in California, the
resignation of the founder/CEO and much more. That was actually the most
prominent component of the other big story of the year, namely the
battle between San Francisco and both Cruise and Waymo.<br /> <br />
Even this serious mistake should not have and perhaps would not have
driven Cruise to its fate. The bigger mistake was they did not want to
talk about it. They were eager to show the car’s recorded video of
events to the press, and to officials, but only over Zoom. They did not
mention the dragging, even when asked about it. I did not ask to see the
part of the video after the crash, but others who did see it say it
ended before the dragging. The DMV states they were not shown the
dragging, and Cruise did not tell them about it, including in a letter
they sent shortly after the events. Cruise insists they did show the
full video to the DMV, and the DMV insists otherwise, but there is
little doubt that they were not open about what was obviously the most
important part of the chain of events when it came to understanding the
role of the robotaxi in the calamity. Cruise was very eager to show that
the initial crash was not their fault, but didn’t want to talk at all
about their own serious mistake.
</blockquote>
Laura Dobberstein reports on part of the aftermath in
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/gms_cruise_sacrifices_9_execs/"><i>GM’s
Cruise sheds nine execs in the name of safety and
integrity</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
GM’s self-driving taxi outfit, Cruise, has dismissed nine execs –
including its chief operating officer – after staff withheld information
regarding an incident in which a woman was injured by one of the firm’s
robotaxis.<br /> <br /> “Today, following an initial analysis of the
October 2 incident and Cruise’s response to it, nine individuals
departed Cruise. These include key leaders from Legal, Government
Affairs, and Commercial Operations, as well as Safety and Systems,” a
Cruise spokesperson told <i>The Register</i>.<br /> <br /> “As a
company, we are committed to full transparency and are focused on
rebuilding trust and operating with the highest standards when it comes
to safety, integrity, and accountability and believe that new leadership
is necessary to achieve these goals,” the spokesperson added.
</blockquote>
It isn’t just the executives who are feeling the pain, as Hayden Field
and Michael Wayland report in
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/gms-cruise-laying-off-900-or-24percent-of-its-workforce.html"><i>GM’s
Cruise laying off 900 employees, or 24% of its workforce: Read the memo
here</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cruise on Thursday announced internally that it will lay off 900
employees, or 24% of its workforce, the company confirmed to CNBC.<br />
<br /> The layoffs, which primarily affected commercial operations and
related corporate functions, are the latest turmoil for the robotaxi
startup and come one day after Cruise
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/gms-cruise-dismisses-nine-key-leaders-amid-safety-probe.html">dismissed
nine “key leaders”</a> for the company’s response to an Oct. 2 accident
in which a pedestrian was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise self-driving car
after being struck by another vehicle.<br /> <br /> The company had
3,800 employees before Thursday’s cuts, which also follow a round of
contractor layoffs at Cruise last month.
</blockquote>
Templeton’s main argument is that Cruise mishandled the PR problem
resulting from their vehicle dragging an injured pedestrian. They
certainly did, in particular by apparently concealing information from
the Dept. of Motor Vehicles. But the PR problem they faced is generic to
autonomous vehicles. They are marketed as being safer than human drivers
and, statistically, this may even be true. Waymo certainly makes a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/human-drivers-crash-a-lot-more-than-waymos-software-data-shows/">plausible
claim</a>. But although “safer” implies it does not mean “safe”, so
serious crashes will inevitably occur.<br /> <br /> When they do the
company’s PR department is in a no-win situation. The reporters who call
asking for the company’s reaction know that the company has a vast
amount of detailed information about what happened, logs and video. But
the PR people don’t, and even if they did they don’t have the skills to
interpret it. Given the nature of the AI driving the vehicle, it will
take considerable time for the engineers to find the bug that was the
root cause.<br /> <br /> The honest thing for the PR people to say is
“we don’t have the details, we’ll get back to you when we do”. Reporters
are likely to hear this as buying time for a cover-up.<br /> <br /> The
wrong thing for them to do is to give the reporters what little they
know, and spin it in ways that minimize the company’s fault. Later, when
the full details emerge, they will have been shown to have been covering
up the worst. Next time, even if they are honest, they won’t be
believed.<br /> <br /> The PR problem is even worse because it is
fundamentally asymmetric. The marketing pitch is that, statistically,
autonomous vehicles cause less accidents than humans. But the public
will never know about accidents that would have happened were a human
driving, but were averted by the AI driver. They will know about
accidents that did happen because the AI driver did something that a
human would not have, as with the Uber and Cruise incidents. When set
against the expectation of airline-level safety, this is an insuperable
problem.<br /> <br /> In
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport"><i>Driverless
cars were the future but now the truth is out: they’re on the road to
nowhere</i></a>, Christian Wolmar who has a book about the autonomous
winter entitled
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driverless-Cars-Road-Nowhere-Perspectives/dp/1913019217/"><i>Driverless
Cars: On a Road to Nowhere?</i></a> points out that Cruise isn’t the
first robotaxi company felled by an accident. That would be Uber:<br />
<blockquote>
Right from the start, the hype far outpaced the technological advances.
In 2010, at the Shanghai Expo, General Motors had produced a video
showing a driverless car taking a pregnant woman to hospital at
breakneck speed and, as the commentary assured the viewers, safely. It
was precisely the promise of greater safety, cutting the terrible
worldwide annual roads death toll of 1.25m, that the sponsors of
driverless vehicles dangled in front of the public.<br /> <br /> And
that is now proving their undoing. First to go was Uber after an
accident in which one of its self-driving cars killed Elaine Herzberg in
Phoenix, Arizona. The car was in autonomous mode, and its “operator” was
accused of watching a TV show, meaning they did not notice when the car
hit Herzberg, who had confused its computers by stepping on to the
highway pushing a bike carrying bags on its handlebars. Fatally, the
computer could not interpret this confusing array of objects.<br />
<br /> Until then, Uber’s business model had been predicated on the idea
that within a few years it would dispense with drivers and provide a
fleet of robotaxis. That plan died with Herzberg, and Uber soon pulled
out of all its driverless taxi trials.
</blockquote>
In her
<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/12/self-driving-cars-hit-the-wall.html"><i>review
of Wolmar’s book</i></a> Yves Smith makes two good points:<br />
<blockquote>
Wolmar describes how this Brave New World has stalled out. The big
reason is that the world is too complicated. or to put it in Taleb-like
terms, there are way too many tail events to get them into training sets
for AI in cars to learn about them. The other issue, which Wolmar does
not make explicit, is that the public does not appear willing to accept
the sort of slip-shod tech standards of buggy consumer software. The
airline industry, which is very heavy regulated, has an impeccable
safety record, and citizens appear to expect something closer to
that…particularly citizens who don’t own or have investments in
self-driving cars and never consented to their risks.
</blockquote>
It isn’t just Cruise that is figuring out that
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html"><i>Robotaxi
Economics</i></a> don’t work. Rita Liao’s
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/"><i>Facing
roadblocks, China’s robotaxi darlings apply the brakes</i></a> reports
that they don’t work in China either:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite years of hype and progress in self-driving technologies, the
widespread availability of robotaxis remains a distant reality. That’s
due to a confluence of challenges, including safety, regulations and
costs.<br /> <br /> The last factor, in particular, is what has pushed
China’s robotaxi pioneers toward more opportunistic endeavors. To become
profitable, robotaxis need to eventually remove human operators. Though
China recently
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/china-autonomous-vehicle-driving-regulation/">clarified
rules around the need for human supervision</a>, taxis without a driver
behind the wheel are allowed only in restricted areas at present. To
attract customers, robotaxi services offer deep discounts on their paid
rides.<br /> <br /> Once the subsidies are gone and initial user
curiosity wanes, who’s willing to pay the same amount as taxi fares for
a few fixed routes?<br /> <br /> Struggling to address that question,
China’s robotaxi startups have woken up to the money-burning reality of
their business.
</blockquote>
So they are pivoting to a
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/">viable
product</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One logical path to monetize self-driving technology is to sell a less
robust version of the technology, namely, advanced driver assistance
systems (ADAS) that still require human intervention.<br /> <br />
Deeproute, which is backed by Alibaba, significantly scaled back its
robotaxi operations this year and plunged right into supplying ADAS to
automakers. Its production-ready solution, which includes its smart
driving software and lidar-powered hardware, is
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/05/autonomous-driving-darling-deeproute-ai-sets-sight-on-europe-carmakers/">sold
competitively at $2,000</a>. Similarly, Baidu is “downgrading the tech
stacks” to find paying customers on its way up what it calls the “Mount
Everest of self-driving.”<br /> <br /> “The experience and insight
gleaned from deploying our solutions in [mass-produced] vehicles is
being fed into our self-driving technology, giving us a unique moat
around security and data,” a Baidu spokesperson said.
</blockquote>
Not a good year for the robotaxi concept, the thing that was supposed to
distinguish Tesla’s cars from everyone else’s because they would earn
their owners money while they slept.<br />
<h3>
Tesla
</h3>
As usual, when it comes to self-driving Tesla’s story is worse than
almost everyone else’s. Elon Musk famously claimed that
<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-worth-zero-without-fsd-why-he-is-completely-wrong-191416.html">Tesla
is worth zero without Full Self Driving</a>. But although this is
typical Musk BS, but unlike some other utterances it contains a kernel
of truth. Tesla is valued as a <i>technology</i> company not a
<i>car</i> company. Thus it is critical for Telsa that its technology be
viewed as better than those of other car companies; anything that
suggests it is limited or inadequate is a big problem not just for the
company but also for Musk’s personal wealth.<br /> <br /> I believe this
is why Tesla hasn’t implemented effective driver monitoring nor
geo-fenced their systems. And why members of the Musk cult are so keen
on defeating the driver monitoring system with weights on the steering
wheel and smiley-face stickers on the camera. Depending upon what you
believe, the technology is either groundbreaking autonomy or a below
average Level-2 driver assistance system (Mercedes has fielded a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/mercedes-benzs-level-3-autonomous-driving-system-takes-over-in-heavy-traffic/">Level
3 system</a>). The congnitive dissonance between the pronouncements of
the cult leader and the reality of continually being “nagged” about the
limits of the technology is too hard for the cult members to take.<br />
<br /> The <i>Washington Post</i> team of Trisha Thadani, Rachel Lerman,
Imogen Piper, Faiz Siddiqui and Irfan Uraizee has been delivering
outstanding reporting on Tesla’s technology. They started on Octoober
6<sup>th</sup> with
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/"><i>The
final 11 seconds of a fatal Tesla Autopilot crash</i></a>, in which a
Tesla driver enabled Autopilot in conditions for which it was not
designed, and set the speed to 14mph above the limit. Then on December
10<sup>th</sup> they followed with
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/"><i>Tesla
drivers run Autopilot where it’s not intended — with deadly
consequences</i></a> and
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/"><i>Why
Tesla Autopilot shouldn’t be used in as many places as you
think</i></a>.<br /> <br /> They recount a 2019
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">crash
in Florida</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A Tesla driving on Autopilot crashed through a T intersection at about
70 mph and flung the young couple into the air, killing Benavides Leon
and gravely injuring Angulo. In police body-camera footage obtained by
The Washington Post, the shaken driver says he was “driving on cruise”
and took his eyes off the road when he dropped his phone.<br /> <br />
But the 2019 crash reveals a problem deeper than driver inattention. It
occurred on a rural road where Tesla’s Autopilot technology was
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/">not
designed to be used</a>. Dash-cam footage captured by the Tesla and
obtained exclusively by The Post shows the car blowing through a stop
sign, a blinking light and five yellow signs warning that the road ends
and drivers must turn left or right.
</blockquote>
Note that, just like the repeated
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-opens-formal-probe-tesla-autopilot_n_611a651de4b0f7bc26a7eef4">crashes
into emergency vehicles</a>, the victims did not volunteer to debug
Tesla’s software. And also that the Autopilot system was driving 15mph
above the speed limit on a road it wasn’t designed for, just like the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">2019
Banner crash</a> into a semi-trailer. As I wrote about
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-3.html">that
crash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is typical of Tesla’s disdain for the law that, although their cars
have GPS and can therefore know the speed limit, they didn’t bother to
program Autopilot to obey the law.<br /> …<br /> Again, Tesla’s disdain
for the safety of their customers, not to mention other road users,
meant that despite the car knowing which road it was on and thus whether
it was a road that Autopilot should not be activated on, it allowed
Banner to enable it.
</blockquote>
Federal regulators have known there was a problem for more than seven
years, but they
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">haven’t
taken effective action</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Nor have federal regulators taken action. After the 2016 crash, which
killed Tesla driver Joshua Brown, the National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) called for limits on where driver-assistance technology
could be activated. But as a purely investigative agency, the NTSB has
no regulatory power over Tesla. Its peer agency, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the Department
of Transportation, has the authority to establish enforceable auto
safety standards — but its failure to act has given rise to an unusual
and increasingly tense rift between the two agencies.
</blockquote>
The reason may be that car manufacturers “self-certify”
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">conformance
with safety standards</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">string
of Autopilot crashes</a> reveals the consequences of allowing a rapidly
evolving technology to operate on the nation’s roadways without
significant government oversight, experts say. While NHTSA has several
ongoing investigations into the company and specific crashes, critics
argue the agency’s approach is too reactive and has allowed a flawed
technology to put Tesla drivers — and those around them — at risk.<br />
<br /> The approach contrasts with federal regulation of planes and
railroads, where crashes involving new technology or equipment — such as
recurring issues with Boeing’s 737 Max — have resulted in sweeping
action by agencies or Congress to ground planes or mandate new safety
systems. Unlike planes, which are certified for airworthiness through a
process called “type certification,” passenger car models are not
prescreened, but are subject to a set of regulations called Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which manufacturers face the burden to
meet.
</blockquote>
And Tesla’s self-certification is self-serving.<br /> <br />
Self-certification would work well if the penalty for false
certification was severe, but the NTHSA has declined to impose
<i>any</i> penalty for Tesla’s manifestly inadequate system. It seems
that the team’s reporting finally drove the NHTSA to do <i>something</i>
about the long-standing problems of Autopilot. Reuters reported that
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/13/tesla-recall-us-autopilot"><i>Tesla
recalls more than 2m vehicles in US over Autopilot system</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla is recalling just over 2m vehicles in the United States fitted
with its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system to install new
safeguards, after a safety regulator said the system was open to
“foreseeable misuse”.<br /> <br /> The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) has been investigating the electric automaker led
by the billionaire Elon Musk for more than two years over whether Tesla
vehicles adequately ensure that drivers pay attention when using the
driver assistance system.<br /> <br /> Tesla said in the recall filing
that Autopilot’s software system controls “may not be sufficient to
prevent driver misuse” and could increase the risk of a crash.<br />
…<br /> Separately, since 2016, NHTSA has opened more than three dozen
Tesla special crash investigations in cases where driver systems such as
Autopilot were suspected of being used, with 23 crash deaths reported to
date.<br /> <br /> NHTSA said there might be an increased risk of a
crash in situations when the system is engaged but the driver does not
maintain responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to
intervene or fails to recognize when it is canceled or not.
</blockquote>
The obfuscation is extraordinary — “forseeable misuse”, “may not be
sufficient” and “could increase”. There is no “foreseeable”, “may” nor
“could”; multiple people have already <i>died</i> because the system
<i>was</i> abused. When Tesla is sued about these deaths, their
<i>defense is that the system was abused</i>! I believe the system is
specifically <i>designed</i> to allow abuse, because preventing abuse
would puncture the hype bubble.<br /> <br /> Fortunately from the
NTHSA’s point of view the recall is pure kabuki, posing no risk from
Musk’s attack-dog lawyers and
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/buttigieg-defends-safety-agency-appointment-after-musk-claims-bias/">cult</a>
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/tesla-missy-cummings-nhtsa-elon-musk.html">members</a>
because the over-the-air update is cheap and doesn’t actually fix the
problem. The <i>Washington Post</i>’s headline writers didn’t understand
this whan they captioned the team’s timeline
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall-timeline/"><i>How
Tesla Autopilot got grounded</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Now, more than 2 million Tesla vehicles are
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/">receiving
a software update</a> to address “insufficient” controls to combat
driver inattention while in Autopilot mode. Here’s how the recall
unfolded, according to documents from Tesla, safety officials and
reporting by The Washington Post.
</blockquote>
The team did understand that Autopilot hadn’t been “grounded”. In
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/"><i>Recalling
almost every Tesla in America won’t fix safety issues, experts
say</i></a> they lay it out:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla this week agreed to issue a remote update to 2 million cars aimed
at improving driver attention while Autopilot is engaged, especially on
surface roads with cross traffic and other hazards the driver-assistance
technology is not designed to detect.<br /> <br /> But the recall — the
largest in Tesla’s 20-year history — quickly drew condemnation from
experts and lawmakers, who said new warnings and alerts are unlikely to
solve Autopilot’s fundamental flaw: that Tesla fails to limit where
drivers can turn it on in the first place.<br /> …<br /> Tesla has
repeatedly acknowledged in user manuals, legal documents and
communications with federal regulators that Autosteer is “intended for
use on controlled-access highways” with “a center divider, clear lane
markings, and no cross traffic.”
</blockquote>
The <i>Washington Post</i>’s Geoffrey A. Fowler checked on the result of
the kabuki, and wrote
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/31/tesla-autopilot-recall-test/"><i>Testing
Tesla’s Autopilot recall, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should
you</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last weekend, my Tesla Model Y received an over-the-air update to make
its driver-assistance software safer. In my first test drive of the
updated Tesla, it blew through two stop signs without even slowing
down.<br /> <br /> In December, Tesla issued its largest-ever recall,
affecting almost all of its 2 million cars. It is like the software
updates you get on your phone, except this was supposed to prevent
drivers from misusing Tesla’s Autopilot software.<br /> <br /> After
testing my Tesla update, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should
you, knowing that this technology is on the same roads you use.<br />
<br /> During my drive, the updated Tesla steered itself on urban San
Francisco streets Autopilot wasn’t designed for. (I was careful to let
the tech do its thing only when my hands were hovering by the wheel and
I was paying attention.) The recall was supposed to force drivers to pay
more attention while using Autopilot by sensing hands on the steering
wheel and checking for eyes on the road. Yet my car drove through the
city with my hands off the wheel for stretches of a minute or more. I
could even activate Autopilot after I placed a sticker over the car’s
interior camera used to track my attention.
</blockquote>
Fowler concludes “I found we have every reason to be skeptical this
recall does much of anything”. Good job, Tesla!<br /> <br /> As a final
note Rishi Sunak, the UK’s tech-bro Prime Minister is naturally
determined to make the UK a leader in autonomous vehicles with his new
legislation on the subject. But, being a tech-bro, he has no idea of the
fundamental problem they pose. Wolmar does understand it,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport">writing</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the UK, Tesla will fall foul of the legislation introduced into
parliament last month, which prevents companies from misleading the
public about the capability of their vehicles. Tesla’s troubles have
been compounded by the revelations from ex-employee Lukasz Krupski who
claims the self-drive capabilities of Teslas
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67591311">pose a risk to
the public</a>. Manufacturers will be forced to specify precisely which
functions of the car – steering, brakes, acceleration – have been
automated. Tesla will have to change its marketing approach in order to
comply. So, while the bill has been promoted as enabling the more rapid
introduction of driverless cars, meeting its restrictive terms may prove
to be an insuperable obstacle for their developers.
</blockquote>
<p>Tesla’s stock market valuation <i>depends</i> upon “misleading the
public about the capability of their vehicles”.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>date: 2024-01-09, updated: 2024-01-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This is an old piece of malware—the Chameleon Android banking
Trojan—that now disables biometric authentication in order to
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-malware-chameleon-disables-fingerprint-unlock-to-steal-pins/">steal
the PIN</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The second notable new feature is the ability to interrupt biometric
operations on the device, like fingerprint and face unlock, by using the
Accessibility service to force a fallback to PIN or password
authentication.
</p>
<p>
The malware captures any PINs and passwords the victim enters to unlock
their device and can later use them to unlock the device at will to
perform malicious activities hidden from view.

Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, updated: 2024-01-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Last month, I convened the Second Interdisciplinary Workshop on
Reimagining Democracy
(<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2023/">IWORD 2023</a>) at the
Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center. As with
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/">IWORD 2022</a>, the goal
was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to
talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first
century.
</p>
<p>
My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the
mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were
democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies,
it would look very different. Representation would look different.
Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation
would look different. Everything would look different, because we would
have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to
worry about…
