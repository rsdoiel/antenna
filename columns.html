UI-Design friends, I need some guidance and the Apple HIG does not have
much for me here (it just says do this, but not how).

<p>
Godot validates that certain values on a form are acceptable before
letting you proceed. I have replicated this behavior, but I hate the way
that it looks.

<p>
It is a blob of red text saying, this is what is wrong. What are good
iPadOS idioms that people use?

I decided to see whether this bot was scraping my pages, too. Here’s how
to use <a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> to see who’s
doing it:
</p>
<pre><code>grep &quot;Firefox/72&quot; /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | tail -n 100 \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup \
 &gt; result.log
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s look at the organisations hosting that bot:

<p>
Every fucking second‽
</p>
<p>
Now, a decision needs to be made:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I could ban all the requests this bot makes by banning the specific user
agent string.
</li>
<li>
I could ban the networks that host this bot on the premise that they’ll
probably also host other harmful bots.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Guess which option I’m taking?
</p>
<p>
Remember: <a href="2023-10-04-search">2023-10-04 Search engines, the
deal is off!</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For a while it seemed that we all benefited from search engines –
authors and readers both. These days, you’ll find that search results
are full of garbage sites. Big sites with the most flatulent of pages
explaining in great detail why the thing you’re looking for is important
and how to do it, clearly optimized for an ad company and not for a
reader. Big sites that have a gazillion answers are preferred over small
and individual sites. Perhaps that’s easier. Perhaps it allows them to
diffuse responsibility for the garbage, I don’t know. The effect is, in
any case, that there is no benefit to search engines for small site
authors, either. I was unable to find my own pages on the search
engines. If you you are a small site owner and you think you can find
your own pages on Google and Bing, I suspect that’s because they track
you. Try it on a different computer, anonymously. Perhaps you won’t find
yourself, either.
</p>
<p>
In any case, if I can’t get anything in return, both as a reader and as
an author, I feel that the deal is off. Why let them feed on my words
for free? Nay, at a cost, since they are keeping my website busy,
producing CO₂ and heating the planet for no benefit at all.
</p>
<p>
Better to block them all.

Will the NYT make it through the election without running an editorial
that says <i>clearly</i> if we elect this mad king fascist and give him
nukes and our military, and our industrial might, and what remains of
our virtue, then we deserve the hell that will rain down on us. If this
were a Hollywood movie, we’d be waiting for the climax, but I have a
feeling they will exit existence with a whimper.

<p>Bloggers, here’s an idea. When you write a piece you’re proud of, end
it with a sentence like this: “And that’s why I have a blog.” It plants
a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might
help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We’ve had a lot of mud
slung at us, let’s start undoing that.</p>

<p>There’s this great story in the Fargo TV series where one of the
villains says there’s a point when an animal that has been captured,
relaxes when it realizes that it is no longer a being and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1msLSfeSc&t=25s">has become
food</a>. “At some level food it knows it’s food.” Evolution has been
kind to us that way. At what point in last night’s game did you realize
that the Mets were no longer a baseball team and had become food?</p>

our lovable slumping Mets last night. It was a sad sight. One to forget
as soon as possible. And don’t forget folks, there’s always next year.
If I were the Dodgers, I’d expect the Mets to win tonight, and the
Dodgers will probably begrudgingly go along with it. Otherwise we’d have
to destroy Citi Field as we did when the Yankees celebrated their World
Series victory in 2000 on the field of Shea Stadium. I was actual there
the night that will live in infamy. Back then at first I objected to the
destruction of our shrine to the glory of past Mets teams, but then I
realized we could never again rise to the peak of Mets philosophy in a
chapel so soiled by the infidels. So if you don’t mind Dodgers, we’d
like to keep Citi Field, so we won’t object if you let our Metsies win
tonight’s game. The song for tonight’s game is

of the things that makes me want to see Automattic stick around and grow
is that they have a really large codebase that has been scaled, debugged
and maintained for over 20 freaking years. And the most important thing
– they don’t break users. The code I wrote to run against WordPress in
the 00s still runs today. To me as a developer this speaks very loudly.
It means it’s safe to develop here. It means there’s discipline in their
development organization. Most companies don’t do this, but the ones who
do, have earned my deep respect. For all of Microsoft’s sins, they were
incredibly good at this too. It’s why I liked working with them, and
also why we laughed at each others’ jokes if you can believe that. In
some ways all the open source stuff is too complicated. I understand the
concept of “development org” – so I look at it that way. I dig around
their codebase, see how they do things, and figure it’ll work out pretty
well if I just do it that way. Because the last people they’re going to
break are themselves. What I see on their latest APIs is maturity and
completeness. They didn’t rush off to the next thing before finishing. I
found that in their Calypso API, which I’ve been building on. Honestly
this is my kind of platform, it’s what Manila’s API would look like
today probably if we had continued developing it. I’ll see if I can find
the docs around here somewhere. Long time ago. ;-)</p>

made the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple">reallySimple
package</a> for Node.js because I wanted to make it as easy as possible
to read feeds in Node apps. It should be as easy as reading a file. Give
it the URL of a feed, get back a JavaScript object that’s as simple as
feeds are. It can read RSS, Atom and RDF feeds, but you get the same
object regardless of what form the feed was in. I’m up for creating some
example apps if you’re interested. There is a very simple
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/example">Hello
World app</a> included in the package and a set of
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos">demo
apps</a>. It’s MIT-licensed, so you can do whatever you want with the
code. It would lovely to see it ported. The idea is to plant some seeds
in the Node.js world to make it easy for developers to try out new ideas
with feeds, figuring the easier it is, the more people will do it. Be
creative. Blow our minds! :-)</p>

”At Qualcomm, we are dedicated to pioneering leading technology and

decision to pause this product and the support of it, indefinitely.

question has come up in various contexts, is a Substack feed a blog?
Yes, I think it can be. For some reason people thought I’d say no. In
2003, I compiled a list of
<a href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">things
that make a blog a blog</a>, and it’s not about the software you use,
rather it’s about who’s writing it, and whether they’re being edited.
Now it’s a different question to ask if I would use it. I would not.
Because it forces you to use their editor. And that’s a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pernicious">pernicious</a> form
of lock-in. It might sound like a small thing, but it means you can’t
easily try out something new. You are not available to other software
developers as a possible user, so no software will be designed for you.
I know how well that kind of system works. And that’s probably why they
lock you into using their editor. If I can’t switch without breaking
everything, I’m not going there.</p>

<a href="https://tormentnexus.substack.com/p/is-ai-going-to-save-us-or-kill-us">asks</a>
if AI will save us or kill us. It could both save and kill us. That’s
what’s so disturbing about evolving. We live such short lives, people
aren’t really designed to evolve, but because of medicine and other
tech, we are often forced to do it. Evolution can come many ways. Losing
a job may force you to evolve. The dissolution of a marriage. Having
life-saving surgery with a long recovery saves you for sure, but it
might also kill you because you can’t go back to being the person you
were before. There might not be a path back. One thing’s for sure we
<i>need</i> saving. We can’t survive without radical change. We’re on a
path that doesn’t work. Is there any way for us to change radically
without a complete collapse? Well, actually kind of looks like we might
have been given a path out through AI. But it means we must give up
control. But here’s the funny thing about that. We aren’t giving up
anything because no one has any control. That’s a political question in
the US, can one person become a mad king and thus gain complete control.
But he’s 78 and not in good health, and that control could only last a
few years at most. We will need saving from that. If somehow we could
configure AI so it did what humans can’t and won’t do, at least our
civilization might have a way forward if not our species. Just some
random thoughts. Maybe unthinkable, but they occur to me anyway, which
is why I have a blog. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<a href="https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113322998712983125">WordPress/Mastodon
blog</a> at my kitchen table. This morning I wrote about why I don’t
believe in the Ya Gotta Believe, a baseball slogan coined by a 1973 Mets
pitcher Tug McGraw. It’s on-topic because the Mets are in a challenging
series with the Dodgers for the National League championship. No matter
how it turns out, this is a historic year for the Mets, and no matter
how it turns out I won’t love the Mets any less if they lose. I think
true believers believe in that – love – without any expectations, win or
lose, or maybe <i>even more</i> if they lose. BTW, I know the rendering
of the post isn’t complete on Mastodon, and there are errors. I’m
working with the people at Automattic at getting this right. I’m glad to
see that Mastodon has the flexibility to do that. Anyway, I believe in
the things I believe in, not because I “gotta.” I don’t like the slogan
because it doesn’t reflect how I feel about the team. My philosophy is
respectful (in a way) of the teams the Mets beat, because I understand
that their fans don’t love them any less because they lost. If anything
I think the better slogan for the Mets would be this:

what was supposed to be a town hall meeting suddenly stop taking
questions and just dancing (badly) for the better part of an hour.   A
mere 20 years ago, well within living memory, less than five seconds of
screaming were enough to end Howard Dean’s political career.  My, how
times change.But the truly astonishing thing</p>

the Yankees may win the

<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A long time ago I ran a free service
<a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/faq">called</a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/http://weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a>.
It was the <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">early days</a> of
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+weblogs.com">blogs</a>.
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> didn’t exist
yet, so there was no way to find out which blogs had new stuff other
than going through your blogroll and clicking links.
</p>
<p>
So I built a simple server, running in
<a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>, that handled pings.
When you updated your blog, you’d send a message to weblogs.com saying
your blog updated. It would then read the HTML of the blog and verify
that it changed, and it would be added to a list of blogs that updated,
in reverse chronologic order. It also published an XML version of the
update list called
<a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/changesXml">changes.xml</a>,
so if you wanted to run a search engine off the list, you could do that
too.

There were several ways to send a ping. You could go to a web page and
enter the URL of your blog. Or you could save the URL as a bookmark and
click the bookmark when you updated. Or if you used blogging software
like our Manila or Radio UserLand, or later EditThisPage.com or
weblogs.com (which eventually hosted blogs itself), it could ping on
your behalf, automatically.
</p>
<p>
Aside: Here’s a
<a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/historyOfWeblogs">snapshot</a>
of the weblogs.com site, preserved.
</p>
<p>
A number of search sites appeared. And we were happy, until another
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati">developer</a>, funded
by venture capitalists, who expected a return on their investment, built
on our open and free
<a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/changes.xml">changes.xml</a>
list, started asking for and receiving pings on their own, and (key
point) they didn’t make their change list public. This struck me as
highly un-weblike and unfair, but they could do it and we had to live
with it.
</p>
<p>
Based on what Matt has been saying it sounds to me like it’s something
like our experience. Except weblogs.com was a short term thing, and not
a business, and it didn’t last twenty years, and it didn’t have a
payroll to support.
</p>
<p>
But it still felt wrong that they weren’t giving back as they received.
If it had persisted like WordPress has, it would have eventually been a
seriously diseconomic and unsustainable problem. And I can imagine I
might write about it publicly as Matt has and maybe even get a famous
lawyer like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Katyal">Neal
Katyal</a> to advise me. And here we are.
</p>
<p>
Have we heard anything from the other side, or anyone who is familiar
with what their position might be. Do they not feel obligated to support
the continued development of WordPress or maybe there’s another issue we
haven’t heard about.
</p>
<p>
I can’t imagine that Matt would make such a big deal out of this if it
weren’t actually a big deal. He probably knew in advance how disruptive
this would be. And I imagine the others knew it would be too and counted
on him not wanting to make a fuss.
</p>
<p>
I have gotten embroiled in these kinds of things in the past, and I
don’t like it. I love to make software and make users happy and then
make more software, round and round. Anything that involves lawyers is
not me doing what I was made to do.
</p>
<p>
And I do see a silver lining. As with twitter-like systems, I now see
the possibilty to help WordPress serve writers better in the future.
Before this, people didn’t think change was possible in the WordPress
world, like they didn’t see the possibility of change with Twitter. But
now Twitter has quite a bit of viable competition. I know that WordPress
could be better tuned for writers, and the product has a very nice API
that would make it possible for lots of writing tools to flourish. It is
a strong platform that’s debugged, scaled, documented and worked on for
a long time, and they don’t tend to break users. And where commercial
vendors like Facebook and Twitter often have excellent technology,
ultimately they are run by execs and bankers who don’t believe in being
open, where this is something that has been deeply ingrained in the
WordPress culture from the beginning and would be hard to change and
that’s a good thing for users and developers.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the exciting part – between WordPress and Twitter lies a product
that would bring the web back to life. Imagine a twitter-like system
with the writers features of WordPress. Amazingly, we are on the cusp of
that being a reality.
</p>
<p>
There’s lots of opportunity to better serve writers here, and that’s
what I love to do, and honestly I think Ghost and Substack have left
themselves open to a writing environment built on WordPress that doesn’t
try to lock users in. And at the same time, I think we can use this
platform to help all the twitter-like services to support all kinds of
writing, not just severely limited tweets typed into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>. Somewhere along the line they got the wrong idea that taking
features out of the web was a good thing. I want to bring these features
back so we can get going again with the web as a writer’s platform.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I don’t need to think anyone is right or wrong here, and I don’t
think anyone else should either. I think this platform is very nicely
open and we can do lots of interesting new stuff here. I hope to open a
new thread here, focused on writers and the web. It’s been too long.

The <i>Washington Post</i> has a long and detailed

about the operation that’s well worth reading (alternate version

<p>
The sales pitch came from a marketing official trusted by Hezbollah with
links to Apollo. The marketing official, a woman whose identity and
nationality officials declined to reveal, was a former Middle East sales
representative for the Taiwanese firm who had established her own
company and acquired a license to sell a line of pagers that bore the
Apollo brand. Sometime in 2023, she offered Hezbollah a deal on one of

2024-10-15 Nuclear artificial intelligence
</h1>
<p>
When my wife was a kid, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened. The
next year, she had leukaemia, spent months in a clean room, spent years
with chemo and recovery. Nuclear energy will always be personal.
</p>
<p>
Also, I grew up in two A zones and one C zone around nuclear reactors.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The plant has been operating since September 1969. … Beznau 2 operated
under temporary licenses until 3 December 2004, when the Swiss Federal
Council removed the limitation. –

<p>
I guess they just discovered it was suddenly safe?

</blockquote>
<p>
Lucky how close the borders are! Half the people at risk can’t complain
because they can’t vote. Strange how this seems to be a popular nuclear
power plant building strategy in densely populated, fragmented political
landscapes.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The last significant change to the KKG was the construction of a new
storage facility for spent rods. –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6sgen_Nuclear_Power_Plant">Gösgen</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s right. There is no solution for the spent rods for all Swiss
nuclear power plants. Whenever they start digging the locals launch
political movements to stop it. The solution was ingenious: now such
protest must happen at the federal level, not at the local level. And
this is how we’ll force that pesky radioactive waste repository on
somebody. Genius.
</p>
<p>
I don’t even want to talk about nuclear energy vs other types of energy.
Just use less fucking energy. As long as I see energy being wasted, I
don’t feel like I need to accept new power plants into my life. Let
alone nuclear power plants.
</p>
<p>
Let alone artificial intelligence.

<p>
Nuclear energy for artificial intelligence:

Google has become the latest tech giant to seek nuclear power as a
source for its datacenters and other operations. …

Olbermann podcast</a>. I’ve seen video of a recent press interview where
Trump said he’s use the military to arrest and in some cases kill
Americans, starting with but not limited to Hispanics. This is not being
reported in the major news orgs. We can’t wait for them to fix it, we
have to create new channels for news flow that have credibility and
work, and we need it before the election. People need at least have a
<i>chance</i> of understanding what they are voting for.</p>

Perfectl in an
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/persistent-stealthy-linux-malware-has-infected-thousands-since-2021/">impressive
piece</a> of malware:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The malware has been circulating since at least 2021. It gets installed
by exploiting more than 20,000 common misconfigurations, a capability
that may make millions of machines connected to the Internet potential
targets, researchers from Aqua Security said. It can also exploit
CVE-2023-33246, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10
that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming
platform that’s found on many Linux machines.
</p>
<p>
The researchers are calling the malware Perfctl, the name of a malicious
component that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency. The unknown
developers of the malware gave the process a name that combines the perf
Linux monitoring tool and ctl, an abbreviation commonly used with
command line tools. A signature characteristic of Perfctl is its use of
process and file names that are identical or similar to those commonly
found in Linux environments. The naming convention is one of the many
ways the malware attempts to escape notice of infected users…

why doesn’t Netflix buy <a href="https://metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a>
and integrate their ratings aggregator in their user interface. I
predict I’d watch far more stuff on Netflix than I do now. Or Apple TV,
Max, Hulu, Disney, etc. The idea that such a valuable resource is not
part of the user experience is crazy imho. What a waste. What reminded
me of this is Plex has integrated the equivalent of Bingeworthy in their
service, which is also a good idea and will glue communities of users to
you. The idea is to systematize recommendations. If I know a specific
friend liked a movie or a show is valuable information for me, not just
advertisers.</p>

<strong>Einheiten bilden</strong>: Gleichartigen Kreaturen werden nach
belieben eingeteilt.
</p>
<p>
Ein oder zwei Einheiten pro Spielerinnen und Spieler ist ein gute
Anfang.
</p>
<p>
Trefferpunkte berechnen: Man multipliziert Anzahl Kreaturen, Anzahl
Trefferwürfel pro Kreatur und durchschnittlichen Trefferpunkten pro
Trefferwürfel (4½).
</p>
<p>
40 Banditen haben beispielsweise 40 × 4.5 = 180 Trefferpunkte. Auf der
Tabelle unten hat es viele vorberechnete Werte.
</p>
<p>
Initiative, Bewegung, Angriffe und so weiter funktionieren wie immer.
Rüstungsklasse, Bewegungsrate, Moral und Rettungswürfe bleiben
unverändert.
</p>
<p>
Im Nahkampf kann eine Einheit, welche mit mehreren Gegnern im Kontakt
ist, alle gleichzeitig angreifen!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gewicht</strong>: Schaden wird von Angreifer und Verteidiger
nach untenstehender Tabelle gewichtet, da in der Masse und wegen dem
Gelände nie alle gleichzeitig angreifen können: Der Schaden wird mit dem
Gewicht des Angreifers multipliziert und durch das Gewicht des
Verteidigers geteilt.
</p>
<p>
40 Banditen haben ein Gewicht von ×6. Landen sie einen Treffer und
würfeln 4 Schaden teilen sie 4 × 6 = 24 Schaden aus. Ein Bandit mehr und
das Gewicht würde auf ×7 steigen.
</p>
<p>
Haben die Banditen mit TW 1 noch 53 Trefferpunkte, sieht man in der
Tabelle, dass es 11–20 Banditen mit Gewicht ×5 sind.
</p>
<p>
Die genaue Anzahl ist im Kampf egal. Wer es genau wissen will: 53/4.5 ≈
12 (aufrunden).

Steht eine Einheit mit mehreren Gegnern im Kontakt, können alle Gegner
gleichzeitig angegriffen werden.
</p>
<p>
Spielercharaktere und ihr Gefolge werden von ihrer Einheit gedeckt.
Erleidet die Einheit Schaden, nehmen Spielercharaktere und Gefolgsleute
zuletzt Schaden.
</p>
<p>
Spielercharaktere und ihr Gefolge greifen wie immer mit eigenen
Trefferwürfen und Zaubern an. Zauber werden auf Trefferpunkte
umgerechnet. Zaubersprüche wie <em>Donnerkeil</em> oder
<em>Feuerball</em>, werden genau so gegen Einheiten verwendet.
</p>
<p>
Schlafen 10 Banditen mit je 1 TW ein, so entspricht das 10 × 4.5
Schaden. Der genaue Wirkungsbereich der Zauber und die Marschordnung der
einzelnen Kreaturen werden vernachlässigt.
</p>
<p>
Wenn eine Einheit ihr erstes Mitglied oder die Hälfte ihrer Mitglieder
verliert, muss ein Moralwurf bestanden werden. Spielercharaktere
verleihen ihrer Einheit den Charisma Bonus für Moralwürfe. Die
Moralwürfe sind wichtig! Ist der Moralwurf misslungen, gilt die Einheit
als gebrochen. Sie weicht zurück, sucht Deckung und hört auf zu kämpfen.
</p>
<p>
Spielercharaktere oder Gefolgsleute in gebrochenen Einheiten können
diesen wieder Mut zusprechen. Pro Einheit kann dies nur eine Person pro
Runde versuchen. Das Ermutigen einer Einheiten kann jede Runde
wiederholt werden. Einer ermutigten Einheit steht ein erneuter Moralwurf
zu. So oder so kann die Einheit diese Runde sonst nichts tun.
</p>
<p>
Erleidet eine gebrochene Einheit erneut Schaden, flieht sie vom
Schlachtfeld. Alle weiteren Einheiten im Nahkampf erhalten einen freien
Angriff mit einem +2 Bonus.

<p>The common denominator between journalism, business and politics is
that none of them have any respect for people. To rise in influence,
money or power you have to give up imagination, and be ruled by
cynicism. If you don’t believe this, show me a journalist who listens, a
business that makes products for thinkers, or a politician who lets
individual people lead them.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Well we know who the Mets are facing, starting tomorrow, in the National
League championship series.
</p>
<p>
Last time we played the Dodgers in the postseason we
<a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2015_NLDS2.shtml">kicked
their ass</a>. And now they have the nerve to show up again. Geez some
people never learn.
</p>
<p>
And we haven’t forgotten how
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRbFJo83mlg">Chase Utley</a>
broke <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Tejada">Rubin
Tejada’s</a> leg,
<a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/11/baseballGotUglyLastNight.html">deliberately</a>,
basically ending his major league career. We thought he should have been
arrested for that, no kidding – it was a vicious un-baseball assault. He
and the Dodgers showed
<a href="https://dodgers.mlblogs.com/off-day-report-mattingly-addresses-utley-tejada-a2ba255e751f">no
remorse</a>.

<p>
<div class="divInlineImage">

The Jankees are playing Cleveland in the ALCS, and while some people
with limited imaginations wish for a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series">Subway Series</a>
betw the the two NY teams, I do not. I have a rule, I always root for
the team the Jankees are playing. Thus I hope to see a World Series
between the Mets and so-called “Guardians.” And of course the Mets would
be heavily favored in that contest because the Cleveland team has
changed their name to something impossible to pronounce, ethically. When
you change your name, like
<a href="http://scripting.com/2015/09/21/silverLiningMetsBook.html#aIWPAT">tearing
down your stadium</a> (something that took the Mets a long time to
recover from) you basically put a hex on your team making it virtually
impossible for your philosophy to prevail. So Mets v Guardians, while
not necessarily what I predict, rather is something I <i>hope</i>
<i>for</i>, and as long as the game is played with philosophy, that’s
the real victory! So get em METS and never forget there’s always next
year. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span>

<p>
BTW, the reason there’s such a confluence of power between WordPress and
Mastodon is this.
</p>
<p>
WordPress has a
<a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js">complete,
debugged, deployed, scaled and frozen API</a>. It’s been around since
2016 or so.
</p>
<p>
In contrast Mastodon, while they’re doing excellent work, is trying to
wrangle an already large community into a set of consistent interfaces.
It’s very hard for an outsider like myself to approach, esp when you’re
overloaded with your own work (which we all are).
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Automattic has a small team whose only job is to make
WordPress work with Mastodon.
</p>
<p>
So I can build software that works with Mastodon without venturing into
the rough seas of Mastodon-land. I can stay on the cruise-liner, which
is the WordPress API.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t even know they had this API until last summer. My jaw dropped
when I first saw it. It even works with Node.js. And now that I’m on the
other side, I haven’t hit any insurmountable obstacles or had to wait
for something to be decided.
</p>
<p>
This is the proper way to build interop. Implementors make things work,
not W3C committees (I say that with decades of experience with this,
btw).
</p>
<p>
I thought it deserved an explanation.
</p>

<p>
But there’s still a lot of power in that festering ball of 1980s code.
</p>
<p>
In 6 weeks in 2016, I drafted, wrote, illustrated, laid out and
submitted a ~330 page technical maintenance manual for a 3D printer,
solo, entirely in MS Word from start to finish. I began in Word 97 &amp;
finished it in Word 2003, 95% of the time running under WINE on Linux…
and 90% of the time, using it in Outline Mode, which is a
<em>vastly</em> powerful writer’s tool which the FOSS word has nothing
even vaguely comparable to.
</p>
<p>
But as a novice… Yeah, what the tweet said. It’s a timeless classic
IMHO.
</p>
Some Emacs folks told me Org-mode is just as good as an outliner. I’ve
tried it. This was my response.<br /><br />
<p>
Org mode compared to Word 2003 Outline View is roughly MS-DOS Edlin
compared to Emacs. It’s a tiny fragmentary partial implementation of 1%
of the functionality, done badly, with a terrible <em>terrible</em> UI.
</p>
<p>
No exaggeration, no hyperbole, and there’s a reason I specifically said
2003 and nothing later.<br /><br />
<div class="status__action-bar">
 
</div>
</p>
<div class="status__content status__content--with-action" tabindex="0">

class="status__content__text status__content__text--visible translate"

<p>
I’ve been building and running xNix boxes since 1988. I have often tried
both Vi and Emacs over nearly 4 decades. I am unusual in terms of old
Unix hands: I cordially detest both of them.
</p>
<p>
The reason I cite Word 2003 is that that’s the last version with the old
menu and toolbar UI. Everything later has a "ribbon" and I find it
unusable.
</p>
<p>
Today, the web-app/Android/iOS versions of Word do not have Outline
View, no. Only the rich local app versions do.
</p>
<p>
But no, org-mode is not a better richer alternative; it is vastly
inferior, to the point of being almost a parody.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
It’s really not. I tried it, and I found it a slightly sad crippled
little thing that might be OK for managing my to-do list.
</p>
<p>
Hidden behind Emacs’ <em>awful</em> 1970s UI which I would personally
burn in a fire rather than ever use.
</p>
<p>
So, no, I don’t think it’s a very useful or capable outliner from what I
have seen. Logseq has a better one.
</p>
<p>
To extend my earlier comparison:
</p>
<p>
Org-mode to Word’s Outline View is Edlin to Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Logseq to Outline View is MS-DOS 5 EDIT to Emacs: it’s a capable
full-screen text editor that I know and like and which works fine. It’s
not very powerful but what it does, it does fine.
</p>
<p>
Is Org-mode aimed at something else? Maybe, yes. I don’t know who or
what it’s aimed at, so I can’t really say.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
Word Outline Mode is the last surviving 1980s outliner, an entire
category of app that’s disappeared.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://outliners.com/default.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no" class="status-link unhandled-link" title="http://outliners.com/default.html"><span
class="invisible">http://</span><span>outliners.com/default.html</span></a>
</p>
<p>
It’s a good one but it was once one among many. It is, for me,
<em>THE</em> killer feature of MS Word, and the only thing I keep WINE
on my computers for.
</p>
<p>
It’s a prose writer’s tool, for writing long-form documents in a human
language.
</p>
<p>
Emacs is a programmer’s editor for writing program code in programming
languages.
</p>
<p>
So, no, they are not the same thing, but the superficial similarity
confuses people.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
I must pick a fairly small example as I’m not very familiar with Emacs.
</p>
<p>
In Outline Mode, a paragraph’s level in the hierarchy is tied with its
paragraph style. Most people don’t know how to use Word’s style sheets,
but think of HTML. Word has 9 heading levels, like H1…H9 on the Web,
plus Body Text, which is always the lowest level.
</p>
<p>
As you promote or demote a paragraph, its style automatically changes to
match.
</p>
<p>
(This has the side effect that you can see the level from the style. If
that bothered you, in old versions you could turn off showing the
formatting.)
</p>
<p>
As you move a block of hierarchical text around the outline all its
levels automatically adopt the correct styles for their current
location.
</p>
<p>
This means that when I wrote a manual in it, I did <em>no formatting by
hand</em> at all. The text of the entire document is
<em>automatically</em> formatted according to whether it’s a chapter
heading, or section, or subsection, or subsubsection, etc.
</p>
<p>
When you’re done Word can automatically generate a table of contents, or
an index, or both, that picks up all those section headings. Both assign
page numbers "live", so if you move, add or delete any section, the ToC
and index update immediately with the new positions and page
numbers.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
I say a small example as most professional writers don’t deal with the
formatting at all. That’s the job of someone else in a different
department.
</p>
<p>
Or, in technical writing, this is the job of some program. It’s the sort
of thing that Linux folks get very excited about LaTeX and LyX, or for
which documentarians praise DocBook or DITA, but I’ve used both of those
and they need a<em>vast</em> amount of manual labour – and <em>very</em>
complex tooling.
</p>
<p>
XML etc are also <em>extremely</em> fragile. One punctuation mark in the
wrong place and 50 pages of formatting is broken or goes haywire. I’ve
spent days troubleshooting one misplaced <code>:</code>. It’s horrible.
</p>
<p>
Word can do all this automatically, and most people <em>don’t even know
the function is there.</em> It’s like driving an articulated lorry as a
personal car and never noticing that it can carry 40 tonnes of cargo!
Worse still, people attach a trailer and roofrack and load them up with
stuff… <em>because they don’t know their vehicle can carry 10 cars
already</em> as a built in feature.
</p>
<p>
I could take a sub sub section of a chapter and promote it to a chapter
in its own right, and adjust the formatting of 100 pages, in about 6 or
8 keystrokes. That will also rebuild the index and redo the table of
contents, automatically, for me.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
All this can be entirely keyboard driven, or entirely mouse driven,
according to the user’s preference. Or any mixture of both, of course.
I’m a keyboard warrior myself. I can live entirely without a pointing
device and it barely slows me down.
</p>
<p>
You can with a couple of clicks collapse the whole book to just chapter
headings, or just those and subheadings, or just all the headings and no
body text… Any of 9 levels, as you choose. You can hide all the lower
levels, restructure the whole thing, and then show them again. You can
adjust formatting by adjusting indents in the overview, and then expand
it again to see what happened and if it’s what you want.
</p>
<p>
You could go crazy… zoom out to the top level, add a few new headings,
indent under the new headings, and suddenly in a few clicks, your 1 big
book is now 2 or 3 or 4 smaller books, each with its own set of
chapters, headings, sub headings, sub sub headings etc. Each can have
its own table of contents and index, all automatically generated and
updated and formatted.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
I’m an xNix guy, mainly. I try to avoid Windows as much as possible, but
the early years of my career were supporting DOS and then Windows. There
is good stuff there, and credit where it’s due.
</p>
<p>
(MS Office on macOS also does this, but the keyboard UI is much
clunkier.)
</p>
<p>
Outliners were just an everyday tool once. MS just built a good one into
Word, way back in the DOS era. Word for DOS can do all this stuff too
and it did it in like 200kB of RAM in 1988!
</p>
<p>
Integrating it into a word processor makes sense, but they were
standalone apps.
</p>
<p>
It’s not radical tech. This is really old, basic stuff. But somehow in
the switch to GUIs on the PC, they got lost in the transition.
</p>
<p>
And no, LibreOffice/Abiword/CalligraWords has nothing even resembling
this.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
There are 2 types of outliner: intrinsic and extrinsic, also known as
1-pane or 2-pane.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner#Layout" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no" class="status-link unhandled-link" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner#Layout"><span
class="invisible">https://</span><span
class="ellipsis">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner</span><span
class="invisible">#Layout</span></a>
</p>
<p>
There are multiple 2-pane outliners that are FOSS.
</p>
<p>
But they are tools for organising info, and are almost totally useless
for writers. <br /> <br />There are almost no intrinsic outliners in the
FOSS world. I’ve been looking for years. The only one I know is LoqSeq,
but it is just for note-taking and it does none of the
formatting/indexing/ToC stuff I mentioned. It does handle Markdown but
with zero integration with the outline structure.
</p>
<p>
So it’s like going from Emacs to Notepad. All the clever stuff is gone,
but you can still edit plain text.<br /><br />

Plan 9 is Unix but more so. You write code in C and compile it to a
native binary and run it as a process. All processes are in containers
all the time, and nothing is outside the containers. Everything is
virtualised, even the filesystem, and everything really is a file.
Windows on screen are files. Computers are files. Disks are files. Any
computer on the network can load a program from any other computer on
the network (subject to permissions of course), run it on another
computer, and display it on a third. The whole network is one giant
computer.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
You could use a slower workstation and farm out rendering complicated
web pages to nearby faster machines, but see it on your screen.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
But it’s Unix. A binary is still a binary. So if you have a slow Arm64
machine, like a Raspberry Pi 3 (Plan 9 runs great on Raspberry Pis), you
can’t run your browser on a nearby workstation PC because that’s x86-64.
Arm binaries can’t run on x86, and x86 binaries can’t run on Arm.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Wasm (<strong>W</strong>eb <strong>AS</strong>se<strong>M</strong>bly)
is a low-level bytecode that can run on any OS on any processor so long
as it has a Wasm runtime. Wasm is derived from asm.js which was an
earlier effort to write compilers that could target the Javascript
runtime inside web browsers, while saving the time it takes to put
Javscript through a just-in-time compiler.

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filters) is a language for configuring
firewall rules, that’s been extended into a general programming
language. It runs inside the Linux kernel: you write programs that run
<em>as part of the kernel</em> (not as apps in userspace) and can change
how the kernel works on the fly. The same eBPF code runs inside any
Linux kernel on any architecture.

Going back 30 years, Java runs compiled binary code on any CPU because
code is compiled to JVM bytecode instead of CPU machine code… But you
need a JVM on your OS to run it.

<div>
 
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
All these are bolted on to another OS, usually Linux.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
But the concept works better if integrated right into the OS. That’s
what Taos did.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>

Programs are compiled for a virtual CPU that never existed, called VP.

They are translated from that to whatever processor you’re running on as
they’re loaded from disk into RAM. So <em>the same binaries</em>  run
natively on any CPU. X86-32, x86-64, Arm, Risc-V, doesn’t matter.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Very powerful. It was nearly the basis of the next-gen Amiga.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
But it was a whole new OS and a quite weird OS at that. Taos 1 was very
skeletal and limited. Taos 2, renamed Int<strong>e</strong>nt (yes, with
the bold), was much more complete but didn’t get far before the company
went under.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Inferno was a rival to Java and the JVM, around the time Java appeared.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
It’s Plan 9, but with a virtual processor runtime built right into the
kernel. All processes are written in a safer descendant of C called
Limbo (it’s a direct ancestor of GoLang) and compiled to bytecode that
executes in the kernel’s VM, which is called Dis.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Any and all binaries run on all types of CPU. There is no "native code"
any more. The same compiled program runs on x86, on Risc-V, on Arm. It
no longer matters. Run all of them together on a single computer. 
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Running on a RasPi, all your bookmarks and settings are there? No
worries, run Firefox on the headless 32-core EPYC box in the next
building, displaying on your Retina tablet, but save on the Pi. Or save
on your Risc-V laptop’s SSD next to your bed. So long as they’re all
running Inferno, it’s all the same. One giant filesystem and all
computers run the same binaries.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
By the way, it’s like 1% of the size of Linux with Wasm, and simpler
too.
</div>
<div>
