<p>I think I figured out why the AI companies want to do web browsers.
It’s so that they can create an application development platform for
people who want to write apps that run inside a new environment where
the OS is a LLM. Lots of interesting possibilities. Imagine how the OS
API might work. You could restructure a database by explaining in
English how you want it restructured. In the freaking code. Could we
bury Algol-like languages the same way we buried assembly and machine
languages? Do we have the courage to imagine such things?</p>

On my recent visit to London I was struck by how many of the
advertisements in the Tube were selling AI. They fell into two groups,
one aimed at CEOs and the other at marketing people. This is typical,
the pitch for AI is impedance-matched to these targets:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The irresistible pitch to CEOs is that they can “do more with less”, or
in other words they can lay off all these troublesome employees without
impacting their products and sales.
</li>
<li>
Marketing people value plausibility over correctness, which is precisely
what LLMs are built to deliver. So the idea that a simple prompt will
instantly generate reams of plausible collateral is similarly
irresistible.
</li>
</ul>
In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html"><i>The
Back Of The AI Envelope</i></a> I explained:<br />
<blockquote>
why Sam Altman et al are so desperate to run the “drug-dealer’s
algorithm” (<i>the first one’s free</i>) and get the world hooked on
this drug so they can supply a world of addicts.
</blockquote>
You can see how this works for the two targets. Once a CEO has addicted
his company to AI by laying off most of the staff, there is no way he is
going to go cold turkey by hiring them back even if the AI fails to meet
his expectations. And once he has laid off most of the marketing
department, the remaining marketeer must still generate the reams of
collateral even if it lacks a certain something.<br /> <br /> Below the
fold I look into this example of the process Cory Doctrow called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The first thing to note is that
the pitch is working. The discourse is full of CEOs talking their book.
For example we have Matt Novak’s
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/billionaires-convince-themselves-ai-is-close-to-making-new-scientific-discoveries-2000629060"><i>Billionaires
Convince Themselves AI Chatbots Are Close to Making New Scientific
Discoveries</i></a> recounting the wisdom of Travis Kalnick:<br />
<blockquote>
“I’ll go down this thread with [Chat]GPT or Grok and I’ll start to get
to the edge of what’s known in quantum physics and then I’m doing the
equivalent of vibe coding, except it’s vibe physics,” Kalanick
<a href="https://youtu.be/Z0k-4wyH5vk">explained</a>. “And we’re
approaching what’s known. And I’m trying to poke and see if there’s
breakthroughs to be had. And I’ve gotten pretty damn close to some
interesting breakthroughs just doing that.”
</blockquote>
Then there are the programmers extolling “vibe coding” and how it
increases their productivity. CEOs who buy this pitch are laying off
staff left and right. For example, Jordan Novote reports that
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html"><i>Microsoft
laying off about 9,000 employees in latest round of cuts</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Microsoft said Wednesday that it will lay off about 9,000 employees. The
move will affect less than 4% of its global workforce across different
teams, geographies and levels of experience, a person familiar with the
matter told CNBC.<br /> …<br /> Microsoft has held several rounds of
layoffs already this calendar year. In January, it cut less than 1% of
headcount based on performance. The 50-year-old software company slashed
more than 6,000 jobs in May and then at least 300 more in June.
</blockquote>
How well is this likely to work out? Evidence is accumulating that AI’s
capabilities are over-hyped. Thomas Claiburn’s
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/03/ai_models_potemkin_understanding/"><i>AI
models just don’t understand what they’re talking about</i></a> is an
example:<br />
<blockquote>
Asked to explain the ABAB rhyming scheme, OpenAI’s GPT-4o did so
accurately, responding, “An ABAB scheme alternates rhymes: first and
third lines rhyme, second and fourth rhyme.”<br /> <br /> Yet when asked
to provide a blank word in a four-line poem using the ABAB rhyming
scheme, the model responded with a word that didn’t rhyme appropriately.
In other words, the model correctly predicted the tokens to explain the
ABAB rhyme scheme without the understanding it would have needed to
reproduce it.<br /> <br /> The problem with potemkins in AI models is
that they invalidate benchmarks, the researchers argue. The purpose of
benchmark tests for AI models is to suggest broader competence. But if
the test only measures test performance and not the capacity to apply
model training beyond the test scenario, it doesn’t have much value.

As far as I know the only proper random controlled trial of AI’s
productivity increase comes from Model Evaluation and Threat Research
entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089"><i>Measuring the
Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open-Source Developer
Productivity</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature
projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience.
Each task is randomly assigned to allow or disallow usage of early 2025
AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers primarily use Cursor
Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. Before starting
tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time
by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI
reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI
actually increases completion time by 19%–AI tooling slowed developers
down.
</blockquote>
David Gerard
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/07/11/ai-coders-think-theyre-20-faster-but-theyre-actually-19-slower/">notes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Even the devs who liked the AI found it was bad at large and complex
code bases like these ones, and over half the AI suggestions were not
usable. Even the suggestions they accepted needed a lot of fixing up.
</blockquote>
This might be why Ashley Stewart reported that
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-internal-memo-using-ai-no-longer-optional-github-copilot-2025-6"><i>Microsoft
pushes staff to use internal AI tools more, and may consider this in
reviews. ‘Using AI is no longer optional.’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Julia Liuson, president of the Microsoft division responsible for
developer tools such as AI coding service GitHub Copilot, recently sent
an email instructing managers to evaluate employee performance based on
their use of internal AI tools like this.<br /> <br /> “AI is now a
fundamental part of how we work,” Liuson wrote. “Just like
collaboration, data-driven thinking, and effective communication, using
AI is no longer optional — it’s core to every role and every
level.”<br /> <br /> Liuson told managers that AI “should be part of
your holistic reflections on an individual’s performance and impact.”

threatened. If the tools were that good, people would pay for them. But
<a href="https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-consumer-ai/">Menlo
Ventures</a> found that only 3% of consumers pay anything. They are
happy to use free toys but they have other spending priorities.
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/only-8-of-americans-would-pay-extra-for-ai-according-to-zdnet-aberdeen-research/">Other

Force-Feeding of AI on an Unwilling Public</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Has there ever been a major innovation that helped society, but only 8%

Gioia didn’t want AI but as an Office 365 user
<a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-force-feeding-of-ai-on-an-unwilling">he
didn’t have that option</a>:<br />

AI is now bundled into <i>all</i> of my Microsoft software.<br /> <br />
Even worse, Microsoft recently

Microsoft didn’t ask their customer whether they would pay for AI,
because the answer would have been no.
<a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-force-feeding-of-ai-on-an-unwilling">Gioia
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This is how AI gets introduced to the marketplace—by force-feeding the
public. And they’re doing this for a very good reason.<br /> <br /> Most
people won’t pay for AI voluntarily—just 8% according to a recent
survey. So they need to bundle it with some other essential product.
</blockquote>
As I discussed in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html"><i>The
Back Of The AI Envelope</i></a>, the AI giants running the drug-dealer’s
algorithm are losing money on every prompt.
<a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-force-feeding-of-ai-on-an-unwilling">Gioia
has noticed this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s another reason why huge tech companies do this—but they don’t
like to talk about it. If they bundle AI into other products and
services, they can <i>hide the losses</i> on their income
statement.<br /> <br /> That wouldn’t be possible if they charged for AI
as a standalone product. That would make its profitability (or, more
likely, loss) very easy to measure.<br /> <br /> Shareholders would
complain. Stock prices would drop. Companies would be forced to address
customer concerns.<br /> <br /> But if AI is bundled into existing
businesses, Silicon Valley CEOs can pretend that AI is a moneymaker,
even if the public is lukewarm or hostile.

Salesforce is another company that has
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/06/18/salesforce-ai-agents-dont-work-but-were-charging-6-more-for-ai-anyway/">spotted
this opportunity</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Yesterday Salesforce announced that prices on a pile of their services
are going up around 6% — because AI is just that cool.<br /> <br />
Salesforce’s stated reason for the price rise is “the significant
ongoing innovation and customer value delivered through our products.”
But you know the actual reason is because f- you, that’s why. What are
you gonna do, move to SAP? Yeah, didn’t think so.
</blockquote>
One problem is that the technology Salesforce is charging its customers
for doesn’t work well in Salesforce’s application space. Salesforce’s
own researchers developed a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18878">new bechmark suite called
CRMAArena-Pro</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena with nineteen expert-validated tasks
across sales, service, and ‘configure, price, and quote’ processes, for
both Business-to-Business and Business-to-Customer scenarios. It
distinctively incorporates multi-turn interactions guided by diverse
personas and robust confidentiality awareness assessments. Experiments
reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58% single-turn success on
CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to approximately
35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more
tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated
business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit
near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting
can improve this, it often compromises task performance.

To
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/06/18/salesforce-ai-agents-dont-work-but-were-charging-6-more-for-ai-anyway/">summarize
the results</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The agent bots had 58% success on tasks that can be done in one single
step. That dropped to 35% success if they had to take multiple steps.
The chatbot agents are also bad at confidentiality:<br />
<blockquote>
Agents demonstrate low confidentiality awareness, which, while
improvable through targeted prompting, often negatively impacts task
performance. These findings suggest a significant gap between current
LLM capabilities and the multifaceted demands of real-world enterprise
scenarios.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
Despite the fact that most consumers won’t pay the current prices, it is
inevitable that once the customers are addicted, prices will go up
spectacularly. But the wads of VC cash may not last long enough, and
things can get awkward with the customers who are paying the current
prices, as
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/07/09/cursor-tries-setting-less-money-on-fire-ai-vibe-coders-outraged/">David
Gerard reports</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
You could buy 500 Cursor requests a month for $20 on the “Pro” plan.
People bought a year in advance.<br /> <br /> In mid-June, Cursor
offered a new $200/month “Ultra” plan. But it also changed Pro from 500
requests to $20 of “compute” at cost price — the actual cost of
whichever chatbot vendor you were using. That was a lot less than 500
requests.<br /> <br /> You could stay on the old Pro plan! But users
reported they kept hitting rate limits and Cursor was all but
unusable.<br /> <br /> The new plan Pro users are getting surprise
bills, because the system doesn’t just stop when you’ve used up your
$20. One guy ran up $71 in one day.<br /> <br /> Anysphere has looked at
the finances and stopped subsidising the app. Users suddenly have to pay
what their requests are actually costing.<br /> <br /> Anysphere says
they put the prices up because “new models can spend more tokens per
request on longer-horizon tasks” — that is, OpenAI and Anthropic are
charging more.
</blockquote>
The CEO who laid off the staff faces another set of “business risks”.
First, OpenAI is close to a monopoly; it has around 90% of the chatbot
market. This makes it a single point of failure, and it
<a href="https://status.openai.com/incidents/01JXCAW3K3JAE0EP56AEZ7CBG3/write-up">does
fail</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On June 9 at 11:36  PM PDT, a routine update to the host Operating
System on our cloud-hosted GPU servers caused a significant number of
GPU nodes to lose network connectivity. This led to a drop in available
capacity for our services. As a result, ChatGPT users experienced
elevated error rates reaching ~35% errors at peak, while API users
experienced error rates peaking at ~25%. The highest impact occurred
between June 10 2:00  AM PDT and June 10 8:00  AM PDT.
</blockquote>
Second, the chatbots present an attractive attack surface. David Gerard
reports on a
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/08/10/microsofts-copilot-studio-ai-leaks-your-business-info-internally-and-externally/">talk
at Black Hat USA 2024</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Zenity CEO Michael Bargury spoke at Black Hat USA 2024 on Thursday on
how to exploit Copilot Studio:
<ul>
<li>
Users are encouraged to link “public” inputs that an attacker may have
control over.
</li>
<li>
A insider — malicious or just foolish — can feed their own files to the
LLM.
</li>
<li>
If you train the bot on confidential communications, it may share them
with the whole company.
</li>
<li>
63% of Copilot bots are discoverable online, out on the hostile
internet. Bargury fuzzed these bots with malformed prompts and got them
to spill confidential information.
</li>
</ul>
Bargury demonstrated intercepting a bank transfer between a company and
their client “just by sending an email to the person.”
</blockquote>
<p>So the technology being sold to the CEOs isn’t likely to live up to
expectations and it will cost many times the current price. But the way
it is being sold means that none of this matters. By the time the CEO
discovers these issues, the company will be addicted.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="the-pyramid-of-merit">The Pyramid of Merit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/building-a-pyramid.jpg" alt="1890s engraving of slaves building a pyramid" width="600" height="450">
<p>
There’s one quote from
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Elites-America-After-Meritocracy/dp/0307720462">Twilight
of the Elites</a> (Chris Hayes, 2013) that has stuck with me since
reading the book earlier this year. In sharing his experience attending
the prestigious test-in Hunter College High School in Manhattan, Hayes
acknowledges that the idea (and social stratification and skin tone) of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_College_High_School#Concerns_about_admission_policies">merit
begins to homogenize over time</a>. In one sentence he laid bare the lie
of meritocracy and it cut deep for me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The pyramid of merit has come to mirror the pyramid of wealth and
cultural capital.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the tech and venture capital space there’s ample criticisms of
meritocracy out there dispelling the head-slap-inducing claims made by
ill-informed tech bros who have found themselves in positions of power.
I’d be lying if I said meritocracy didn’t appeal to me at least on some
level; rewarding highly skilled labor with higher pay accordingly
appeals to my sense of fairness… but then I hear about
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2023/">CEOs earning
290⨉ the average worker</a> and the whole system begins to crumble for
me. Sure, they assume some risk… but never seem to suffer the same
consequences. Despite its aroma of enlightened empirical fairness,
meritocracy is ultimately a tool for protecting the status quo.
</p>
<p>
You can see it with your own eyes. Merit goes to the already wealthy.
Merit magically awards itself to people from the same fraternal
organization. Merit goes to people of similar net worth, who look the
same, talk the same, believe the same, joke the same, and have the same
education. Merit goes to symmetrical acne-free faces, shampoo model
hair, designer scents, six pack abs, and strong jaw lines because those
people <em>must</em> have earned it through hard work and not surgery,
drugs, photoshop, or genetic lottery.
</p>
<p>
This year has poured a gallon of salt into this festering wound for me
as my own country’s government tries to set “meritocracy” against
“diversity, equity, and inclusion” –as if they’re opposed concepts,
rather than the latter being a framework to recognize and correct
pre-existing biases– then proceeding to nominate the most inept,
corrupt, and deceitful people to perhaps ever occupy a government role.
A cabinet full of regressive billionaires, cowboy cosplayers, and
conservative television hosts papering over their racism with a flimsy
banner of meritocracy. The entire administration is an insidious heist
to enrich a small cabal of already wealthy families and we’ll be paying
for this televised crime spree for generations.
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to fall into the trap of comparing DEI and meritocracy.
Instead, I think we can examine meritocracy based on its merits; its an
entirely gameable system that is for sale, prone to in-group biases, and
often nullifies its own intent. Merit then will always mean money when
its for sale. Plain and simple.
</p>
<p>
Diversity then… of people, wealth, cultures, and thought… is an
antidote. A Darwinian cure to prevent groupthink and corruption that
flourish in meritocratic systems. You and I remember the old truths, the
old dreams, the old habits of loving thy neighbor. We’d do good to
protect diversity, encourage it, and nourish it.

<p>
Law journal
<a href="https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol108/iss2/5/">article</a>
that looks at the
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_sto.html">Dual_EC_PRNG
backdoor</a> from a US constitutional perspective:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: The National Security Agency (NSA) reportedly paid and
pressured technology companies to trick their customers into using
vulnerable encryption products. This Article examines whether any of
three theories removed the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that this be
reasonable. The first is that a challenge to the encryption backdoor
might fail for want of a search or seizure. The Article rejects this
both because the Amendment reaches some vulnerabilities apart from the
searches and seizures they enable and because the creation of this
vulnerability was itself a search or seizure. The second is that the
role of the technology companies might have brought this backdoor within
the private-search doctrine. The Article criticizes the doctrine­
particularly its origins in Burdeau v. McDowell­and argues that if it
ever should apply, it should not here. The last is that the customers
might have waived their Fourth Amendment rights under the third-party
doctrine. The Article rejects this both because the customers were not
on notice of the backdoor and because historical understandings of the
Amendment would not have tolerated it. The Article concludes that none
of these theories removed the Amendment’s reasonableness requirement…

Microsoft is using engineers in China to help maintain the Defense

personnel—leaving some of the nation’s most sensitive data vulnerable to
hacking from its leading cyber adversary, a ProPublica investigation has
found.

<p>
Back in the mists of time,
<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2015/10/zipfs-law/">I wrote about
a peculiar property of words</a> called Zipf’s Law. The idea is quite
simple: the frequency at which different words occur in any large body
of work, ordered from the most common to the least common, follows a
predictable pattern. This is true across languages, and even in some
texts, such as that in the Voynich Manuscript, that we haven’t yet
