Sargent’s podcast</a> gave me an idea. The oppressor in a fascist state
doesn’t need you to love them, so long as you don’t love anyone else.
The NYT isn’t trying to make us love Trump, that’s impossible. But they
are trying to make us not fall in love with Harris. I doubt they foresaw
that possibility. But our feelings about Harris are very much love. The
NYT is our only master, they must think. There’s no room for us to love
someone else, because we might listen to them. In a sense they respond
like a first born child on the arrival of their little sister or
brother. I don’t know. As I said it doesn’t matter why. That’s their
problem. Our problem is to get them out of the way.</p>

<h2 id="the-status-of-twitters-api">The status of Twitter’s API</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The Twitter API still works, with some serious limits. Not easily
incorporated into products, but useful for individuals with developer
accounts. Not an insurmountable hurdle, it seems, though I was a
developer from before. A few bullet points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My linkblog now reliably works on
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew">Threads</a>, in addition to
<a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave">Mastodon</a>,
<a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>,
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">RSS</a> and
<a href="https://linkblog3.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>.
</li>
<li>
I was confused about the status of the Twitter API, but it turns out
it’s still there, and there is a
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2">package</a> that
connects to it for Node apps.
</li>
<li>
It took me a few hours to add
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js#L543">support
for Twitter</a> in my
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main">textcasting</a>
server app which is how my software connects to all the various
services.
</li>
<li>
I should probably add a plugin abilitiy for textcasting so that other
services could easily be added, without modifying the core app. Totally
doable. It’s already factored that way internally.
</li>
<li>
I should probably write
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md">some
docs</a> for it too. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</li>
<li>
Anyway, the
<a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api">deal
with Twitter</a> is that it’s free for up to 1500 posts per month, as I
read it, which seems manageable for one person (me), but no way is it
enough for a community of users.
</li>
<li>
Why connect to Twitter? People are there. Until they aren’t we’re going
to need a way to push stuff to Twitter.
</li>
</ul>

the investigation into
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/310">getting
UserTalk running</a> in 2024 has been a trip. The last time I did any
work on this code, or even in this area of computer science, was approx
1990. It comes right back, like riding a bike. I saw a tremendous amount
of potential fun here, but I had to move on to runtime, object database,
verbs, user interface – for Frontier. In the 34 years between then and
now – a lot of software has been written, and I’m only looking at a
fraction of it, limited to stuff that runs in Node, the browser and
Electron. And I have to say I’m totally enjoying reading about what
they’ve done. I’m learning about evolution of technology, a facet of
development I am extremely drawn to, in a whole new way, as if viewed
through a tunnel in time.

<p>
This is a big deal. A US Appeals Court
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/us-appeals-court-rules-geofence-warrants-are-unconstitutional/">ruled</a>
that geofence warrants—these are general warrants demanding information
about all people within a geographical boundary—are unconstitutional.

The decision seems obvious to me, but you can’t take anything for
granted.

All you have is “Delete and Redraft”. But that orphans all replies,
undoes all boosts, forgets all likes and removes posts from bookmarks.
“Delete and Redraft” is a sledge hammer. “Edit post” is a delicate
quill. And you don’t get to have it. YOLO! (You only live once.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>No filtering</strong>. You can mute and block and all that, but
when everybody is posting about Monsterdon, the European Song Contest,
the US elections, Caturday or Wordle, you can’t filter those hashtags.
You must endure the enthusiasm of the people you are following. (I think
the developers are implementing things, but it does not seem to have an
effect in the front-ends I use, so who knows.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Limited federation</strong>. This one is hard to spot. You want
to follow this account and that account and it all seems to work until
you go back and find that for one account, your follow request seems to
hang in limbo, waiting. You cancel, and follow again. It seems to work.
Come back later, back in limbo again, waiting. If you check the log,
you’ll find errors about signatures failing and what not. I have no
idea. There are currently
<a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+signature">8
open issues containing the word ‘signature’</a>. Something is not
working and you’ll have to have an alt (a separate account) on a
different server that doesn’t have this issue. That makes me sad. 😥

<strong>No automatic post expiry</strong>. You’ll have to use something

<strong>No front-end</strong>. There is no front-end. I use apps like
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@tootapp">Toot!</a> on my phone and
<a href="https://semaphore.social/">Semaphore</a> on the web. I don’t
need anything fancy. And for the non-fancy options, I have

Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">toot</a> for the

die as a result of the bans, and many more who will be severely injured,
and all will have their freedoms severely restricted. 2. He’s lying.
When Congress passes a national abortion ban he’ll sign it and boast

0.9C. That’s considering only actually implemented policies. Pledged
emissions cuts go even deeper. Is it enough? No. But we’ve gone from

<p>The raucous roll call of states at the 2024 Democratic National
Convention on Tuesday, as everybody danced to DJ Cassidy’s state-themed
music, Lil Jon strode down the aisle to cheers for Georgia, and
different delegations boasted about their states and good-naturedly
teased other delegations, brought home the real-life meaning of E
Pluribus Unum, “out of many, one.” From then until Thursday, as a sea of
American flags waved and attendees joyfully chanted “USA, USA, USA,” the
convention welcomed a new vision for the Democratic Party, deeply rooted
in the best of traditional America.</p>
