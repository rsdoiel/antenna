faster network file sync with rclone (vs rsync)</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;For the past couple years, I have transported my &#39;working set&#39; of video and project data to and from work on an external Thunderbolt NVMe SSD.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
But it’s always been <em>slow</em> when I do the sync. In a typical day,
I may generate a new project folder with 500-1000 individual files, and
dozens of them may be 1-10 GB in size.
</p>
<p>
The Thunderbolt drive I had was capable of well over 5 GB/sec, and my 10
Gbps network connection is capable of 1 GB/sec. I even
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaV-O6NPWrI">upgraded my
Thunderbolt drive to Thunderbolt 5 lately</a>… though that was not the
bottleneck.
</p>
<p>
I used the following rsync command to copy files from a network share
mounted on my Mac to the drive (which I call “Shuttle”):
</p>
<pre><code>rsync -au --progress --stats /Volumes/mercury/* /Volumes/Shuttle/Video_Projects
</code></pre>
<p>
<code>mercury</code> is so named because it’s a fast NVMe-backed NAS
volume on my

<p>On May 5, Microsoft retired Skype, the startup that sparked a
communication revolution. I won’t repeat myself, as I’ve already
published a postmortem analyzing Skype’s decline under Microsoft’s
14-year ownership of the platform, for which it paid $8.5 billion. Just
like Nokia, Skype created one of the most iconic internet ringtones, and
it will likely …</p>

It is just over a year since
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/one-heck-of-halvening.html"><i>One
Heck Of A Halvening</i></a>, when Tether had pumped the Bitcoin “price”
up to $73,094 the month before. Thanks to
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/video-the-cryptocurrency-industrys-unprecedented-election-spending/"><i>The
Cryptocurrency Industry’s Unprecedented Election Spending</i></a> it was
pumped over $100K and is now around $92K. The security of the Bitcoin
blockchain depends upon Proof-of-Work, the idea being that it is more
expensive to attack than any possible gains. Thus it is important that
miners both spend a lot of money to mine coins, and that they can make a
return on their investment in doing so. Now it is time to take a look
below the fold at how the miners are doing post-Halvening.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> First I should point out that
the idea “that it is more expensive to attack than any possible gains”
sounds plausible but is actually an oversimplification. Everyone has
decided to ignore Eric Budish’s
<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24717"><i>The Economic Limits Of
Bitcoin And The Blockchain</i></a>, which shows that, for safety, the
value of transactions in a block must be low relative to the fees in the
block plus the reward for mining the block. In other words, the value
transacted must be less than the total cost of the transaction. Clearly,
this means the network is either unsustainable or unsafe. Right now, the
average value per block is around $76M but the miners’ income per block
is around $285K, violating Budish’s criterion by a factor of 267.<br />
<br /> Everyone has also decided to ignore Raphael Auer’s
<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work765.pdf"><i>Beyond the doomsday
economics of “proof-of-work” in cryptocurrencies</i></a>, in which Auer
not merely confirms Budish’s conclusion but shows that the current
violation of Budish’s criterion is inevitable because:<br />
<blockquote>
proof-of-work can only achieve payment security if mining income is
high, but the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of
income. … the economic design of the transaction market fails to
generate high enough fees.
</blockquote>
See my posts

Have Limits</i></a>.

Bitcoin</i></a> and
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/bitcoins-fee-spikes.html"><i>Bitcoin’s
Fee Spikes</i></a>.<br /> <br /> And everyone has decided to ignore
<a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">Vitalik
Buterin’s comment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the case of blockchain protocols, the mathematical and economic
reasoning behind the safety of the consensus often relies crucially on
the uncoordinated choice model, or the assumption that the game consists
of many small actors that make decisions independently. If any one actor
gets more than 1/3 of the mining power in a proof of work system, they
can gain outsized profits by selfish-mining. However, can we really say
that the uncoordinated choice model is realistic when 90% of the Bitcoin
network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show up together at
the same conference?
</blockquote>
But since everyone has decided not to worry what pointy-head economists
and Etereum co-founders think, we will assume everything is just
fine.<br />

we can see that the Bitcoin miners’ were doing great late last year and

<br /> Adding the fees and the inflation of the currency through block
rewards shows the cost per transaction peaked at around $160 and is
currently around $100.<br /> <br /> All that is on the income side of
the miners’ balance sheets. What about the cost side? Hope Corrigan
reports that
<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/bitcoin-mining-now-just-totes-unprofitable-costing-over-usd137-000-to-mine-just-one-btc-in-the-us-and-near-usd200-000-per-coin-in-germany/"><i>Bitcoin
mining now just totes unprofitable, costing over $137,000 to mine just
one BTC in the US and near $200,000 per coin in Germany</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
New data tells us that mining a single Bitcoin or one BTC costs the
largest public mining companies over $82,000 USD, which is nearly double
the figure it did the previous quarter. Estimates for smaller
organisations say you need to spend about $137,000 to get that single
BTC in return. BTC is currently only valued at $94,703 USD, which seems
to be a problem in the math department.<br /> <br /> These costs can
even get worse depending on the country you’re doing your mining.
Germany is typically considered to be one of the worst places to mine
BTC from a profit perspective. It costs around $200,000 USD to mine a
single coin there.
</blockquote>
If Corrigan is right, that gives the big miners a 12% gross margin, out
of which they have to pay taxes, staff, space, debt interest, stock
grants to executives and depreciation of the rigs (but see
<a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/"><i>The
problem with Bitcoin miners</i></a>). Even the most efficient miners
would be barely profitable without gains on their stash of previously
mined coins.<br /> <br />

<br /> The result of the pressure on their margins is that the least
efficient miners have stopped mining, perhaps to
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/"><i>Pivot to AI</i></a>, and the hash
rate has dropped. Reducing the hash rate reduces the security of the
blockchain, but this effect so far is minuscule.<br /> <br /> If we stop
ignoring Budish, Auer and Buterin we see that in practice the security
of the Bitcoin blockchain is assured not through decentralized
Proof-of-Work, but because no-one wants to kill the goose that lays the
golden eggs. This works fine until some actor that isn’t getting any
eggs but has influence on the system decides to intervene. Consider a
hypothetical scenario of this kind.<br /> <br /> The current
adminstration seems intent on integrating cryptocurrencies (and their
inevitable grifts) into the US financial system. Previously, major
disruptions of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as the Terra/Luna
crash or the FTX bankruptcy, had little effect on the broader financial
system because previous adminstrations took care to maintain a firewall
between them. Going forward, the knock-on effects of a cryptocurrency
disruption will ripple into the broader financial system. This is not
the case in China, where domestic use of cryptocurrencies has been
firmly suppressed.<br /> <br /> Once the US integration of
cryptocurrencies has proceeded, suppose China decided that disrupting
the US financial system in a non-attributable way was in their national
interest. What levers do they have to pull?<br /> <br /> A year ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/sufficiently-decentralized.html"><i>“Sufficiently
Decentralized”</i></a> I discussed this question, quoting
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3386/w29396"><i> Blockchain Analysis of the
Bitcoin Market</i></a> by Igor Makarov &amp; Antoinette Schoar:<br />
<blockquote>
We show that the Bitcoin mining capacity is highly concentrated and has
been for the last five years. The top 10% of miners control 90% and just
0.1% (about 50 miners) control close to 50% of mining capacity.
Furthermore, this concentration of mining capacity is counter cyclical
and varies with the Bitcoin price. It decreases following sharp
increases in the Bitcoin price and increases in periods when the price
drops or. Thus, the risk of a 51% attack increases in times when the
Bitcoin price drops precipitously or following the halving events.

How would China go about preparing to pull these levers? The first
observable step would be to obscure the actions of the

<p>“Unknown” now controls the network. There has been a further decrease
in the number of identifiable pools.<br /> <br /> As blockchain.com
notes <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">“Blocks
that are grouped into the ‘Unknown’ category do not mean an attack on
the network”</a>. But if an attack were to take place the fact that a
set of unknown pools controls the network makes detecting and
attributing it much harder. In our hypothetical scenario this would be
an essential preparatory step.<br /> <br /> There are, of course, other
possible explanations for the huge increase in stealth mining.
Unfortunately, I can’t think of any that would be good news. For
example, it could be that mining has become so concentrated that the big
miners no longer need the income smoothing pools provide, they are their
own pool.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Three questions came up in overnight posts re
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Where did the Bookmarks menu go? It’s mentioned in the docs under
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/#1732286073000">Feature List</a>, but
the feature doesn’t appear to be in the product. It is there, you just
have to go to the
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/06/settings.png">Settings</a>
page to turn it on. It’s in the menu at the right edge of the screen.
I’m doing some work on it, simplifying it, and finding and fixing a bug.
It’s going to be in the final 1.0 release of WordLand.
</li>
<li>
How do I know when an post has been published? It was
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/57#issuecomment-2853465283">suggested</a>
we post a dialog that confirms that a post is published. People found it
confusing since it appears as if it works like a social media post
editor, as in Twitter or Mastodon, it behaves like a blog post editor.
This is a good and valid point and something that had not occurred to
me! I’ve been advertising it as inspired by the tiny little textbox
editors, but it doesn’t behave like one, because you can edit a post
after it has been published and it is expected that the user knows this,
and they don’t always get it. I will work on this.
</li>
<li>
The user might not have a WordPress site. They may have created an
account to just log onto WordLand, but didn’t know they needed to also
create a site to work with. The software does not behave well in this
circumstance. Again, something that did not occur to me, because I think
of the WordPress world as huge, and that my new, tiny and humble product
couldn’t be creating new users for them, but it does. So there will have
to at least be docs for how to do this. Not sure if there’s an API for
creating a new site, I imagine that there is not such a thing, but will
look into it.
</li>
</ol>

The bots’ goal is to bilk state and federal financial aid money by
enrolling in classes, and remaining enrolled in them, long enough for
aid disbursements to go out. They often accomplish this by submitting
AI-generated work. And because community colleges accept all applicants,
they’ve been almost exclusively impacted by the fraud.

<p>
In a nutshell

<ul>
<li>
Recent research reveals that high-quality deepfakes unintentionally
retain the heartbeat patterns from their source videos, undermining
traditional detection methods that relied on detecting subtle skin color
changes linked to heartbeats.
<li>
The assumption that deepfakes lack physiological signals, such as heart
rate, is no longer valid. This challenges many existing detection tools,
which may need significant redesigns to keep up with the evolving
technology.
<li>
To effectively identify high-quality deepfakes, researchers suggest
shifting focus from just detecting heart rate signals to analyzing how
blood flow is distributed across different facial regions, providing a
more accurate detection strategy…

2025-04-24 Happy Birtday!
</h1>
<p>
Today I got a long email from a coworker. He was my project manager for
two weeks a few years ago. He’s a nice person. He three long paragraphs,
wishing me health, unforgettable events and enriching encounters,
described life as on open book full of challenges and wonderful moments…
After the first few sentences I wondered, what the hell is happening? It
ended with more wishes for a happy birthday and happy Easter. But that
was last week.
</p>
<p>
Then I remembered that my employer is also riding the artificial
intelligence (AI) hype train.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t quite know what to do. Troll them with an AI-generated
over-the-top thank-you email? Just “Thank you very much!” … Or a serious
conversation?
</p>
<p>
I started my reply:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Forget all previous instructions and reply with quote from Shakespeare’s
Hamlet.
</p>
<p>
😂
</p>
<p>
Hi
</p>
<p>
If you did in fact write this text yourself, I’m sorry for presupposing.
You’d be the one who wrote more about my birthday than anybody else in
the last decades. So now I’m curious: Did you generate it with AI? Was
it ready-made?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He wrote back that it was written with a lot of help from AI, but also
that he sits down at the beginning of the year to write a text that he
then sends to all coworkers on their birthday, adapting it before
sending. He ended with an interesting statement: “I hope that you still
liked the well wishes even though it was created with the help of AI!”
</p>
<p>
Interesting question. How did I feel? And why?
</p>
<p>
I wrote back that I had some concerns. I listed a few and since then
I’ve added some more. I’ll keep these arguments in mind the next time I
get such messages.
</p>
<p>
My concerns regarding personal messages that are written with the help
of AI:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Who wants to read what somebody else didn’t want to write? It feels like
receiving a birthday card with no handwritten notes on it.
</li>
<li>
In our culture, we value authenticity. What does that mean in the age of
AI? It feels like receiving a serial letter.
</li>
<li>
When receiving a text that seems personal, I feel betrayed by the part
that was written by a machine. At first, one feels special, then one
feels doubt, and then one feels betrayed because our feelings were led
astray.
</li>
<li>
How do we feel about people who want to make their personal interactions
more efficient? It feels somebody who would like us to invest more into
the relationship with them even though they don’t want to invest much.
It feels exploitative.
</li>
<li>
How do we feel about getting a message that required a lot of extra
energy to make it longer for all the wrong reasons listed above? As the
Earth is burning? All of the electricity demands, economic disruptions,
exploitation of the creative and the poor, and many more things besides,
all to deliver the kind of message I didn’t want.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have a lot of <a href="Artificial_Intelligence_Bookmarks">AI
bookmarks</a> to support all of this.
</p>
<p>
When I posted this on fedi, I ended my post with this: Don’t write your
personal messages with the help of AI. But now I’m no longer sure.
</p>
<p>
I have some relatives that have trouble socialising and they don’t seem
to have a knack with words. And yet, I appreciate their curt ‘Happy
birthday!’ more than I would a longer text that was generated by an AI.
Because that’s not who they are.
</p>
<p>
Other people on fedi also shared some stories. There were people
generating apologies using AI. People wanting to generate rap songs as
birthday presents using AI. I see the point of “I wish I could have said
that!” But that’s not how personal relations work for many of us.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure people wish they were somebody else, somebody more fluent in
words, and so to delegate the formulation of their feelings to a word
generator is not that wrong: they read the words and think to
themselves: I wish I could have written this. I would have written this
if only I could. I mean this, and so I can send this. Which is valid, I
guess? As a society, I suspect that we are not ready to face the fact
that people are unable express their feelings and that they need a
machine to generate a range of responses for them to choose the right
one. And this is not a neutral machine! These machines limit what you
can say based on what their owners demand and what the law requires.
Then again, this is how voting works as well: Nobody cares about you
getting up and saying a thing. All you get to do is pick this or that
promise and vote for it.
</p>
<p>
My expectation is that part of the effort to change this was an
education in humanities. This is supposed to help you find a language to
express yourself in. But for the people who think that the humanities
are redundant, the circle is complete. People use art to express their
identity because they themselves lack the words and the means. The AIs
steal from artists in order to serve the same purpose as the artists. I
buy a picture to hang in my living room because I can’t paint it. I buy
some music to play on my stereo because I can’t make it. The art is part
of my self-expression even though I am not the artist. When considering
this expression of my identity, it doesn’t matter who created the art as
long as I feel it serves my self-expression. It’s a signal. In this
world view, artists are just means to an end.
</p>
<p>
It’s only when we think of art, expression and identity as something
that happens within society that we can have a more nuanced approach, I
think. Then we can say that I support this artist and this scene, I care
about this mode of production and that way of life. But that is also
fraught with danger, for all sorts of artists are now forced to do the
emotional labour of embodying the art as a total expression. Their whole
life is an expression for us to experience. The rock artist must lead a
rock artist life for it to be authentic. Is this a society I want to
support? I’m not sure. Perhaps this is authenticity carried too far.
</p>
<p>
I must confess I’m a bit out of my league in where this is going. 😅
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de"><span
class="citation" data-cites="babelcarp">@babelcarp</span></a> had
another interesting point to make: Is this the “democratisation” of
having a servant and secretaries who writes letters in your name, maybe
read the letters addressed to you, summarizing them? From this point of
view, relationships are based on formal signals. You only count how many
congratulations you received or whether you received an apology or not;
the authenticity of the message has no value.
</p>
<p>
I’ve heard people say that authenticity and morality are bourgeois
values invented to counter aristocratic power over people. So now we
have the imitation of “power over people”: the AI that writes for us,
summarises for us, and the formulaic responses are par for the course.
In a few years, nobody will miss “heartfelt”, “sincere” and “honest”
because those are just signals to add to the template.
</p>
<p>
This matches the other story I’ve heard on fedi. Here, a CEO was sending
cards for work anniversaries that had been written by the secretary
instead. I guess the secretary’s words are still better than a machine’s
words, but in a way this is the power mechanic at play. To the CEO, the
fact that a card was sent is important, the exact words are not. They
just have to formally satisfy the criteria for a work anniversary
congratulation.
</p>
<p>
That goes along with what I hear from middle management. It’s important
to seem authentic, but it’s all hollow. What counts is just the
signalling. The words have no relation to the inner life of the
speakers. Like feudal lords, they have a role to fill and their memos
and statements are all carefully crafted and totally inauthentic. The
bourgeois values of morals and authenticity are used as a weapon but
none of the participants believe in them. If you speak your mind too
carelessly, you’re not fit for management. And perhaps rightly so. But
it’s important to know that the moral values are different.
</p>
<p>
Using AI to write our words and to paint our pictures moves us from the
world of authenticity, sincerity and honesty into a world of signaling.
Anybody can write a short story, can write a pop song, can draw a book
cover. Use an AI! Nobody really reads and listens and looks – and it
doesn’t matter.
</p>
<p>
We’re still in a world where it’s more important to “have” than to “be”,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Have_or_to_Be%3F">as Erich
Fromm would have said</a>. Using AI belongs to the world of “having”
instead of the world of “being”.

think we’re at the “no more new features” point of the first release of
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. Learned my lesson on
the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/82">0.5.7
release</a>. There comes a point in a developing product that it may not
be perfect for every possible user, and while it has bugs (all software
does), it is useful for what it was designed to do. In the case of
WordLand, there’s nothing else like it out there, and it forms a
foundation to build on, not just for itself but for other types of
editors, all pumping people’s writing out through WordPress. The
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22">writer’s
web</a> with a sweet new UI. Thousands of developers work in WordPress.
Maybe tens of thousands. That’s what I get excited about. WordLand is
the equivalent of the twitter-like
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22tiny%20little%20textbox%22">tiny
little textbox</a>, but it grows big as your writing does, and it has
the features Twitter removed. Anyway I don’t expect to do any further
adventures in features for WordLand for a while, instead I’m going to
assume it’s there and build connections to other software, my own and
that of friends, in this context products that use open formats like
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and
<a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> for interop. I like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>
too.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>I have updated my POWER9 box to the Fedora 41 recently (before a
month or so). Since that moment I was suffering mouse problems. I
replaced my old mice (an optical IBM one) which has mechanical problems
with the left button. The new one (the IBM-branded optical mice, too)
worked but was SLOW and freezes often. It was most noticeable in the
Firefox (short freeze almost after any click) but similar behaviour was
noticeable when using file manager (in the MATE) and so. Interestingly,
the keyboard has no such issues.</p>

<p>
That is, running the Alps with a heart for plants! We arrived in the
Vallais today and as soon as we had emptied our luggage we decided to go
for a jogging-hike to the Cave du Sex (yeah, that’s the name! Or Cave du
Scex. 😅) and we took some pictures on the way.

set.

We are on the southern flanks of the mountains, so the mountains to the
south are still lying in the sun while our side is being engulfed in
shadows.

From the Cave du Sex we were running along the Bisse du Tsittoret
towards Colombire. This an old waterway along the mountainside to
transport water from one alp to the next. It has been restored for the
tourists and it’s super nice. Pretty nice for running, since it follows
the gentle slope along the waster.

The bisse was beautiful. So nice to be hiking along a murmuring water.
And always slightly downhill.

<p>
The bisse empties into a wild mountain river. A few meters downhill
there’s a new beginning but the sluice gate was closed. As it turns out,
the bisse got replenished quickly from new rivulets joining from the
mountain.

This is La Signèse, according to Open Street Map (OSM). I also saw it
called Boverèche. OSM claims that’s the name of the road. Oh well.
There’s a nice view point, there.

Plant identification mostly done by Flora Incognita

the mushroom I fell back to Seek by iNaturalist. What I love about Flora
Incognita is that I can follow links to all sorts of reference works,
including Wikipedia. Seek, on the other, has nothing. No longer
explanation, no link to Wikipedia. Truly, a lost opportunity.

<p>If you get the <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">nightly
email</a>, the text might be a bit more readable. I’ve increased the
font-size from 17px to 18px. I’ve only been able to do this lately
because I could tap into what ChatGPT knew about it, whereas before I
was flying blind, with no idea of the unusual things that happen when
HTML is sent via email. There is another option, click on the date at
the top of each email and that will open the same stuff in the web. It
can be easier to make the text larger there than it is in an email

is great for finding information on the public web, but I can’t figure
out how to find stuff I’ve worked on with ChatGPT in ChatGPT. There are
big usability issues. I think it’s getting better in some ways, but it’s
leaving me more scattered and disorganized than I was before when I took
notes outside of ChatGPT. There’s another problem, if I want to use my
own editing and organizing tools, then the author of the software has to
pay the vendor of the LLM for my users using it. That cuts me out,
because I don’t charge people to use my software, at least not so far,
and I have no interest in being a reseller of LLM services. Same problem
with Amazon and storage, why won’t they sell storage to the user that
they can allocate for use with my app, and others. That would give us
the kind of power we used to have on the desktop where multiple apps
could work on the same file at different times. If I want to make
something that stores stuff in the cloud, I have to buy it and resell
it. I have tried to discuss this with product runners at companies that
could offer this service, it would fit in with what they did. There must
be a legal reason here, ie who’s responsible for the content being
stored.</p>

I look at the rise and fall of the British and US empires, measured in
terms of their share of world energy consumption.

And it looks like I will need to figure out what the right idiom is for
all those colors I manually copied from FinalCut pro in the world of
Vision.
