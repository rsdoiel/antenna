<p>I asked ChatGPT for two sentences on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">Innovator’s
Dilemma</a> – “[It] describes how successful companies can fail by
focusing too heavily on sustaining innovations—improvements to existing
products for current customers—while ignoring disruptive innovations
that initially serve smaller markets but eventually overtake the
mainstream. These disruptions often seem inferior at first, so
established companies dismiss them, leaving space for new entrants to
rise and dominate.”</p>

run on top of WordPress, basically turning WP into an OS. I thought it

was the right idea. We need fewer runtimes. If you can merge two
runtimes, go for it. Anyway, this is all related to the “open social
web” – in fact it’s central to it. We’ve got all these philosophically
compatible platforms that are technologically unable to work with each
other. But what if they all were really on the web? What could we build
then? Everything. We would go back to the potential the web had before
Twitter and Google Reader split the blogging world in two. I swear the
answer is make it so that all these networks can do
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html">inbound</a> and
outbound RSS and build on the reality of the open social web, not just
the hype.</p>

<h1 id="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more">

<p>
This is a continuation of <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">2025-06-16 Ban
autonomous systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
I kept wondering why the “recidive” jail never found any repeated
offenders from the “butlerian-jihad” jail. I think I know why, now. The
“recidive” jail uses the following:
</p>
<pre><code>failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)s(?:\s*fail2ban\.actions\s*%(__pid_re)s?:\s+)?NOTICE\s+\[(?!%(_jailname)s\])(?:.*)\]\s+Ban\s+&lt;HOST&gt;\s*$
</code></pre>
<p>
Far to the right, it uses <code>HOST</code> and that only matches a
single IP number. If you examine the regular expression generated and
scroll over far enough to the right, you’ll see the named groups
<code>&lt;ip4&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ip6&gt;</code>.
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get recidive failregex
The following regular expression are defined:
`- [0]: ^(?:\[\])?\s*(?:&lt;[^.]+\.[^.]+&gt;\s+)?(?:\S+\s+)?(?:kernel:\s?\[ *\d+\.\d+\]:?\s+)?(?:@vserver_\S+\s+)?(?:(?:(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+[\[\(]?(?:fail2ban(?:-server|\.actions)\s*)(?:\(\S+\))?[\]\)]?:?|[\[\(]?(?:fail2ban(?:-server|\.actions)\s*)(?:\(\S+\))?[\]\)]?:?(?:\[\d+\])?:?)\s+)?(?:\[ID \d+ \S+\]\s+)?(?:\s*fail2ban\.actions\s*(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+)?NOTICE\s+\[(?!recidive\])(?:.*)\]\s+Ban\s+(?:\[?(?:(?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P&lt;ip4&gt;(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})|(?P&lt;ip6&gt;(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}::?|::){1,7}(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}|(?&lt;=:):)))\]?|(?P&lt;dns&gt;[\w\-.^_]*\w))\s*$
</code></pre>
<p>
I decided to create an additional jail.
</p>
<p>
In my own <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> I added a second
jail:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h

[butlerian-jihad-week]
logpath = /var/log/fail2ban.log
enabled = true
findtime = 1d
bantime = 1w
maxretry = 5
</code></pre>
<p>
The first one uses the filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> which remains
empty. Remember, entries are added to this jail via a cron job discussed
in an <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">earlier post</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
The second one uses a new filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad-week.conf</code> defining
the date pattern and the regular expression to detect “failures” (i.e. a
hit).
</p>
<pre><code>[Init]
# 2025-06-29 01:17:08,887 fail2ban.actions [543]: NOTICE  [butlerian-jihad] Ban 1.12.0.0/14
datepattern = ^%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%M:%%S

[Definition]
failregex = NOTICE\s+\[butlerian-jihad\] Ban &lt;SUBNET&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The important part is that this uses <code>&lt;SUBNET&gt;</code> instead
of <code>&lt;HOST&gt;</code>. If you scroll over to the right, you’ll
find a new <code>&lt;cidr&gt;</code> group:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week failregex
The following regular expression are defined:
`- [0]: NOTICE\s+\[butlerian-jihad\] Ban \[?(?:(?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P&lt;ip4&gt;(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})|(?P&lt;ip6&gt;(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}::?|::){1,7}(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}|(?&lt;=:):)))(?:/(?P&lt;cidr&gt;\d+))?\]?
</code></pre>
<p>
And it seems to be working.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-1.jpg" alt="The Munin graph shows how the butlerian-jihad-week jail immediately jumps to 3000 members" />
</p>
<p>
I had to restart this particular jail a few times. Using
<code>–unban</code> makes sense because those deserving of a new ban
will be discovered immediately as the <code>findtime</code> was set to
one day up above.
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client restart --unban butlerian-jihad-week
</code></pre>

<strong>2025-07-05</strong>. Two days later.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-07-06</strong>. Hm. I made a change to Emacs Wiki search,
hoping to get rid of the DuckDuckGo dependency:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I made the page title match much more prominent
</li>
<li>
I switched the search from GET to POST
</li>
<li>
I count the search via GET as a bot (since it’s no longer doable via the
user interface)
</li>
<li>
I reinstated the old full-text search (essentially a grep within Perl)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was hoping that it would have very little effect. At about the same
time, however, load started creeping up. The question is whether this is
caused by so many search requests or not. There aren’t many search
requests in the logs, and the process monitors don’t show unusually
activity for the Emacs Wiki processes. Therefore, I think the answer is
that the problem lies elsewhere. But where?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-3.jpg" alt="Somewhere around the 3rd of July load minimum seems to raise up from 0.5 to 1.0" />
</p>
<p>
This virtual server has two cores so load should remain below 2.0,
ideally.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-4.jpg" alt="Somewhere around the 3rd of July the number of hosts banned for a week goes up from 2000 to more than 7000" />
</p>
<p>
Is it the processing of all the bans? I don’t think so, since the
firewall had many thousands of banned networks before.
</p>
<p>
Is it the extra cron jobs monitoring the logs? I don’t think so because
there’s no 15min or 20min periodicity to see.
</p>
<p>
And note how load does come back down to 0.5 for a very short moment
around midnight from the 4th to the 5th and in the early morning hours
of the 6th.
</p>
<p>
How strange.

is a hit. But the docs aren’t clear enough. It has no user interface,
it’s a package you can include in a Node app that calls back to you when
a new item comes in from one of the feeds you’ve told it to watch. It’s
a totally teeny little framework for a feed reader, you get all the
standard stuff tucked away out of site, you write the functionality you
want to implement. It would be a good thing to turn over to your AI
programming partner. It’s for people who want to add a feed reader to
something else.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-05, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<div>
Apple macOS is a UNIX™. It’s the best-selling commercial Unix of all
time. I wonder if how many old-school Unix folks consider all Mac users
in the 21st century to be their brothers-in-arms? Not many, I’d guess.
<br /><br />When it happened, many Unix folks don’t consider it a
<em>real</em> Unix. Even thought just a few years later, and AIUI after
spending a <em>lot</em> on the exercise, Apple got the UNIX™ branding.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Now, by contrast:
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
I’ve spent proper time trying to get some rough estimates on Linux
distro usage. Ubuntu is cagey but claims ITRO low double-digit millions
of machines fetching updates. Let’s say circa 20M users.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Apparently, over 95% on LTS and the vast majority on the default GNOME
edition. (Poor sods.)
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
The others are cagier still, but Statistica and others have vaguely
replicable numbers.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
My estimates are:
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
~2x as many Ubuntu as Debian users
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Between them they are about 2/3 of Linux users
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
All Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora derivatives are about 10% of the market.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Comparing them to Steam client numbers, Arch is much of the rest: the
gap between ~75% Debian family and ~10% RH family.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
In China, the government has been pushing Linux <em>hard</em> for 8-9
years. Uniontech (Deepin) is one of the biggest and last November
boasted 3M paid users. 
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Is that all? 
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Kylin is also big but let’s guess it’s #2.  
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
So, if, optimistically, 10% pay, then that’s only 20-30M, comparable to
Ubuntu in ROTW.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Maybe Kylin (also a Debian BTW, they both are) brings it to 50M. 
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
ChromeOS is a Linux. It’s Gentoo underneath. Google sells hundreds of
millions. Estimated user base is 200-300M and probably a lot more.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Chromebooks outsold Macs (by $ not units, so 10x over) in the US by 2017
and worldwide by 2020.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Which means there are, ballpark, order of magnitude scale, 10x as many
ChromeOS users as all other Linuxes put together.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
The year of Linux came 5-6 years ago.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
But it’s the <em>wrong kind</em> of Linux so the Penguinisti didn’t even
notice.

<p>This is the outline of a sketch of something deep, maybe, possibly.
Don’t expect greatness from it.<br /><br />DON’T start in with "just let
people like what they like". Not interested. I have a point, a question,
here. I am not interested in your grumbling.<br /><br />A 1990s Britpop
band called Oasis are touring the UK right now. Apparently it’s the most
massively sold-out tour <em>ever</em> or something. My preferred radio
station, BBC 6music, is absolutely full of Oasis. I had to turn it off
for most of yesterday.<br /><br />Today there was a report from a radio
music journalist I like, Matt Everitt, from the first gig in Cardiff
last night. Apparently it was a big success. The crowd was "mad for it",
throwing (very expensive) beer at each other from the first song, and so
on. This is exactly the sort of thing I hate about that kind of gig, and
Oasis fans…<br /><br />But as an experienced music journo – I loved his
Glastonbury report – he noted things I’d not  thought of. <br /><br />No
original material.<br />Set list published in advance.<br />Same set
list for the whole tour.<br /><br />No new material: well, it’s a
cash-in tour, that’s blatant. The band only reunited for the
tour. <br /><br />Set list: I hadn’t thought of that. Everitt, Radcliffe
and Maconie debated this. The unique experience of a gig where, given
the costs, given the price, every fan present knew every word of every
song? Live music isn’t always like this.  <br /><br />And whether fans
would <em>enjoy</em> them getting more familiar and looser and
experimental as it went on, or, would they resent it and want a faithful
rendition?<br /><br />I <em>detest</em> Oasis and its music. The singer
can’t sing. I lack the musical vocab The melodies are trite and simple,
like a playground "na-na-nee-na-na" chant. The words are mostly
meaningless: they <em>sound</em> like they’re expressive, but from my
minimal exposure, they’re not. The musicians are competent enough: the
riffs are boring and stale and derivative, but they’re played
well.<br /><br />We are in the 2nd quarter of the 21st century now.
Since the middle of this week, we are closer to 2050 than
2000.<br /><br />This band, this tour, reminds me of some other things
I’ve hated in the first quarter of C21.<br /><br />The all-female
<em>Ghostbusters</em> reboot. I am a big fan of groups of women and
girls reclaiming stuff. I like women in art, in music, in comedy,
whatever. But that film was <em>awful</em>. It failed to get any of the
whipcrack tight repartée of the first film, but it was full of
incomprehending imitation of it.<br /><br />The script of Ghostbusters
was a work of art. It’s immensely quotable. It is full of gags. GB2 was
all right, it has moments. GB3 – nothing. Zip. Zero. <br /><br />It’s a
copy without comprehension. It’s not a cover version – I like a good
cover. A near unique thing about Oasis is that almost any cover version
of any Oasis song will be <em>sung better than Liam Gallagher can
sing</em> so it will be better in some aspects. (Also true of Bob Dylan,
for my money, but he can write, at least. Can’t sing, can’t play, but
can write.) <br /><br />Then Ghostbusters 4 <em>Afterlife</em> came out
and I liked it a lot. It isn’t great but it’s fun, it’s entertaning, it
has some good dialogue. It skips over the flat empty GB3 and hearkens
back to the original funny two. GB 5 <em>Frozen Empire</em> is…
diverting. Weak, the seam is nearly mined out now, but it had moments.
Still better than 3.<br /><br />GB3 reminded me of a performer I’m
conflicted about: Ricky Gervais. I find his comedy awful: he’s an actor,
trying to role-play a comedian. He wanders the stage behaving like a
stand-up comedian but he isn’t one, he’s just pretending. It’s abhorrent
to me. But some people seem to love it. <br /><br />I hated the original
<em>Office</em> TV show. Can’t watch more than 2 minutes, partly because
of Gervais’s gurning. But, like a Dylan cover, the American remake is
doable, because it lacks the irritant of the original. I don’t like it,
never watched a whole episode, but the clips are tolerable to amusing.
(I think it’s a "comedy of manners" which is not a genre I care for at
all. Maybe these are modern versions of Laurence
Sterne?)<br /><br />However – however – Gervais’s jokes about and
comments about atheism are <em>good</em>. Religious folks many not know
but there is a thriving meme subculture of atheists making jokes about
religions – all of them – and the meaner, the nastier, the
funnier. <br /><br />Gervais is often mean-spirited, I suspect, but when
he directs it at religion, I find him funny and quotable. I do not want
to see the act but it makes for good memes, good
quotes.<br /><br />(Maybe it’s all about who is the target? Of course
all the religious folks squeal about persecution, but always remember,
when they were in charge, they tortured heretics to death. Now they are
not but they are still destroying lives and their churches are still
billionaire-level rich. Don’t forget, don’t forgive.)<br /><br />It
suddenly reminds me of "AI". LLM-bot generated averaged
staleness.<br /><br />I now keep seeing people using bot-slop cartoons
to illustrate original blog posts, soc.net comments, articles, etc. I
see people in 1980s home-computer fora using bot-slop photos of children
waving home computers at one another in the playground. <br /><br />I am
aware of the subgenre of short video-clips of disaster scenes. River
floods, tidal waves (post Banda Aceh, the first tsunami on video and at
its time the most-filmed natural disaster ever, I believe), ships
sinking, animal attacks, etc.<br /><br />But now I am seeing bot-slop
versions. This morning I saw a bot-slop video that starts with a real
rogue wave hit shore, then it’s followed by a blatantly fake one. If it
were real, hundreds would have died. That’s a nasty form of
"entertainment". <br /><br />I have been bot-slop tiktok length videos
of impossibly huge whales, boats in impossibly still seas. There are
plenty of Chinese ones of impossibly thin girls with impossibly long
legs. <br /><br />If people are making them, then audiences must be
consuming this. Liking and sharing and bloody subscribing or
whatever.<br /><br />Oasis does a roleplay of a comeback tour, with a
fixed setlist. I am sure Liam G still can’t sing the meaningless lyrics,
the riffs will still be poor Beatles ripoffs, but the fans won’t care
it’s all totally choreographed. It’s more of the same and that’s what
they wanted.<br /><br />Gervais filled theatres for his curious roleplay
of comedy. Maybe he is as mean-spirited "punching down" at other
subgroups and the audiences <em>like</em> that, and it only so happens
that when it aligns with the religious-mockery I find funny, I get on
with that bit and that bit alone.<br /><br />GB3 filled cinemas. People
lapped it up. Friends of mine defended it to me. They could not name a
single joke, quote a single punchline, but they liked
it.<br /><br />Now, this stale derivative incomprehending-cover-version
work, which Oasis and Gervais and the GB3 team hand-created, now this
can be automated.<br /><br />And audiences lap it up.<br /><br />In my
business, it applies to code. Bots can generate awful code on industrial
scale, and many programmers are embracing it. Presumably they wrote
awful code anyway.<br /><br />Entire companies are leaning in to
it.<br /><br />Some programmers are despairing. <br /><br />I thought
this essay made some good points:<br /><br />«<br />The rise of Whatever
<br />»<br /><br /><a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2025/07/03/the-rise-of-whatever/">https://eev.ee/blog/2025/07/03/the-rise-of-whatever/</a><br /><br />It’s
illustrated with that weird furry stuff that’s so prevalent now, which
squicks me a bit, but try to ignore it.<br /><br />Why is it that some
people are happy with poor quality second or third generation fakery,
while it repels others?<br /><br />And what is it going to do with us
now that many simply cannot tell, they don’t care enough to
notice?<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=lproven&ditemid=310263" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<h2 id="rss-activitypub">RSS ==&gt; ActivityPub</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’d love to see a bridge from
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html">RSS</a> to
ActivityPub. I’ve asked people at various companies if they’d do this.
I’m happy to help with the software but operating the service is
something for a trusted company to do.
</p>
<p>
I think this would go all the way to putting the “open” in open social
web, because people who already know how to build RSS feeds would be
able to quickly write apps that hook into AP networks. And of course it
wouldn’t have to be limited to RSS, it could build on Atom and RDF
equally well.
</p>
<p>
It think it’s tragic that it’s taking Ghost, for example, so long to get
their service up fully, and it suggests that smaller devs don’t stand a
chance. I can’t wake up one day and have an idea of something that would
work well with Mastodon, for example, and have a prototype running the
next day.
</p>
<p>
If you think this is a good idea, post a link to this post somewhere
developers live, and let’s see if we can get a cooperative project up
and running.
</p>
<p>
And if you don’t like RSS, Atom or RDF, invent an orthogonal format and
we can work with that too. I know people have strong feelings about this
stuff, not a problem.
</p>
<p>
PS: I asked
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/114796352889094954">Tim Bray</a>
to comment, and he
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/114796687727557412">responded</a>.
Sounds good. We’ve known each other for decades, going back to the early
days of XML.

<p>How odd on Independence Day a law goes into effect that funds a
secret police for the US. The goal is to flow people from inside the
United States into concentration camps, and ostensibly deport them to
other countries. It may turn out to be easier and less expensive to just
gas them and burn the bodies right here in the USA. I listened to this

and health care as most of the other news orgs have been doing. They
were puzzled why the Repubs didn’t seem to care if it hurt their
electorate, but they didn’t state the obvious answer. They <i>don’t</i>
care. Remember

<h1 id="2025-06-16-ban-autonomous-systems">
2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems
</h1>
<p>
More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers,
since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole
range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter
based on IP numbers won’t catch them. But if we can determine their
autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number
range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.
</p>
<p>
Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other
fediverse instances, I don’t want to block them forever. I want to block
them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter
blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have
ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how
fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I want code that bridges this gap.

<p>
<a href="github.com/WKnak/fail2ban-bloc">fail2ban-bloc</a> tries to
guess (!) IP ranges and bans those using fail2ban. I need to investigate
more.
</p>
<p>
I’m still fascinated by
<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-05-30-asncounter/">asncounter</a>.
It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For
now, it generates an interesting Top 10 list. What’s interesting about
it is that it doesn’t require me to query an external service and leak
IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I used to have the following fish function, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn
    for ip in $argv
        dig +short (string split '.' $ip|tac -|string join '.').origin.asn.cymru.com. TXT
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
What I don’t want to do is write another tool like
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">network-lookup-lean</a> which uses
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> for the same purposes, caches results,
and so on. I want to get rid of this live lookup.

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">
Ban all the networks managed by an ASN
</h2>
<p>
I’m going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists,
<code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>. I use these two for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.
</p>
<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little
fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s try it with the ASN 45899!
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>
<p>
For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments
on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are
at it again</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got
a single “it’s already added” response. Before adding the same numbers
to my shell script, therefore:
</p>
<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>
<p>
That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script.
Once this is done:
</p>
<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr 
</code></pre>
<p>
I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to
figure out a way to unban the whole list!
</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-fail2ban">
Integration with <code>fail2ban</code>
</h2>
<p>
Let’s start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs
a filter!
</p>
<p>
In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain
all my jails) I added:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that this jail doesn’t define log paths. I hope that works as
intended.
</p>
<p>
I created a matching filter with no definition in
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it all, and check:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload
OK
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:  6
`- Jail list:   alex-apache, alex-bots, butlerian-jihad, ngircd, recidive, sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
Nice! So now I have a new jail.
</p>
<h2 id="undo-the-banlist">

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sed 's/ipset add/ipset del/' | sh

<p>
I also manually edited my <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> file to
remove the lines I added above. Let’s have fail2ban handle this!
</p>
<h2 id="switch-from-ipset-to-fail2ban-client">

        echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip $cidr
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | less
</code></pre>
<p>
Run it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
3640
</code></pre>
<p>
If you messed up, clear the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload --unban butlerian-jihad
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned
</code></pre>
<p>
Count the entries in the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq length
3640
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-do-we-have">

<p>

<p>
With <code>asn-ban</code> we have a tool to quickly add all the IP
networks the ASN is managing to a jail for <code>fail2ban</code>.
</p>
<p>
The jail which we called <code>butlerian-jihad</code> bans the IP
networks for a day.
</p>
<h2 id="what-s-left-to-do">

<p>
I should check whether this actually works! Let’s see whether the ban
gets lifted after 24h. That’s the main point of this exercise!
</p>
<p>
<code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data.
This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as
<code>asncounter</code>. I guess that would be
<a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>. See below!
</p>
<p>
I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes
worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies
all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.

ASN networks without an external service

<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a
bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges
managed by one or more autonomous systems.
</p>
<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
85.208.96.0/24
85.208.97.0/24
85.208.99.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of
<code>asncounter</code> has downloaded. That is to say,
<code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files. I’m
assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.
</p>
<p>
Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as
follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Unbanning works the same way:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP
numbers or ranges added or removed.
</p>
<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">
Identifying suspicious ASN
</h2>
<p>
What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN
should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters
the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to
ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the
IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we
don’t care about and just print the appropriate lines:
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062    31.93   24940   HETZNER-AS, DE
1642    17.12   16276   OVH, FR
</code></pre>
<p>
So do I dare ban those numbers?? I’m not sure! I should figure out a way
to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You
pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it
filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log
lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social | bin/asn-access-log 24940
</code></pre>
<p>
I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent,
FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example),
and on and on. Ugh. It’s not easy to know what to do!
</p>
<p>
I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for
shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest.
The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount
of resources spent OK. Do I? Let’s look at the latest numbers.
</p>
<p>
This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it
hard for me to block these autonomous systems.

What’s the situation without fedi traffic, keeping in mind that I will
most likely not be able to block fedi hosters?

<p>
The autonomous systems that show up in the second list but not in the
first list are my prime candidates, like COMCAST and CHINAMOBILE-CN.
</p>
<p>
So how about going after the autonomous systems on the second list that
produce more than 1000 hits in a 2h period.
</p>
<p>
Something like this? I’m going to but this into
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code>
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

Summary
</h2>
<p>
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code> runs every hour and checks
if there have been any abusive autonomous systems in the last two hours.
If so, they are banned. Note how I’ve added my home IPv4 and IPv6
because I use my site a lot. 😅
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 !MY-HOME-IPV4 !MY-HOME-IPV6 \

| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip \
&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>
This drops the output (the number of new bans) because otherwise the
cron job mails that number to me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two
hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code>
(and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).
</p>
<p>
The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi
server doesn’t trigger the ban hammer.
</p>
<p>
The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don’t ban the
server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I
also had to add my home IP numbers!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds
the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server
log file and prints a report.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected
autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.
</p>
<p>
These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a
config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file
is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>
<p>
The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens
as no logfile is checked. My
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just
this:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get
banned for generating more than 500 hits in 2h. If they are banned, they
are banned for 1h. If they are banned for activity in the last hour
leading up to the ban (more than 500 hits in 1h), the script will find
the same log entries and ban them “again”. This results in no changes in
the jail, since all the networks are already in the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same
file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>
<p>
The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is
banned for a week. I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set
to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an
autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It
sends 400 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than
a feed reader should need, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
after the first hour, nothing happens, as 400 is less than the 500
needed to trigger the system
</li>
<li>
after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the
last two hours is 800
</li>
<li>
after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because
it only made 400 requests in the second hour
</li>
<li>
after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again
</li>
<li>
after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time
</li>
<li>
after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time
</li>
<li>
after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time
</li>
<li>
after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the
<code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the
ASN are banned for a week
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half
this time.
</p>
<p>
Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats
every 7½ weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h
or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see how this goes for a while.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: This doesn’t actually work, as I discovered
later. See <a href="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more">a follow-up post</a>
for how to ban repeated offenders.
</p>
<p>
I’m already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and
<code>banlist6</code> sets I created for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.

<p>
Back when I first encountered the distributed AI bot attacks, I wrote
<a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a> and
began working on <code>ban-cidr</code>. In later posts, I just automated
the work of getting from an IP number to a network range and adding that
to the script. Now that I hopefully have an automatic solution where I
only need to fine-tune the time-windows and the limits, it’s time to
expire all those bans. There are currently over 40,000 of these banned
networks.

<pre><code>ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | wc -l

ipset list banlist6 | tail -n +9 | wc -l

So slowly, over time, I’m planning to remove these.
</p>
<pre><code>for ip in (ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | head -n 1000); ipset del banlist $ip; end

</code></pre>
<p>
Ugh. They need to go.
</p>
<p>
First, create the two lists. At this level we need two different lists
for IPv4 and IPv6.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
Then define a new version of <code>asn-ban</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    set --local data (asn-networks --json $argv)
    for asn in $argv
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v4[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist $ip
        end
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v6[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist6 $ip
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses the <code>–json</code> option for
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> so that we only need to
call it once and yet we get two lists: one for <code>banlist</code> and
one for <code>banlist6</code>.
</p>
<p>
To ban the offending ASN:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 55836|sh
</code></pre>
<p>
Before I do that, however, I want to finish clearing the existing lists.
</p>
<p>
The reason I call this petty banning is because I’m starting to ban
autonomous systems even though their bots are “well behaved” in as much
as they don’t exceed the thresholds I defined. And yet they seem to be
part of that great parade to honour the CO₂ god, the computation of
useless shit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-06-20</strong>. I’m thinking about alternatives but I think
that’s not worth it. For example: Perhaps it’s important to look at
relative distribution?
</p>
<pre><code>site-log transjovian | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null

3   15.79   396982  GOOGLE-CLOUD-PLATFORM, US
total: 19
</code></pre>
<p>
At first I thought, more than a third of all requests for Tencent? I
must block them. But then I saw that it was just 7 requests in 2h. Not
worth it.
</p>
<p>
Here I saw that there were more requests, and an 80% share!
</p>
<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null

<p>
But when you look at it, Alibaba is just fetching
<code>robots.txt</code> all the time. I don’t know who runs this bot.
It’s clearly a waste of CO₂. And yet… not worth it.
</p>
<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | asn-access-log 45102 | log-request | rank-lines
    172 /robots.txt

<p>
So, I don’t know. And if I don’t care about the relative share of
requests, then I also don’t have to count them per site.
</p>
<p>
I already wrote a little thing to give me a regular expression for every
site I host! But now I’m not going to use it. I leave it here for you,
dear reader. 😄
</p>
<pre><code>awk '/^MDomain/ {split($0, sites)

Once you build a surveillance system, you

control</a> who will use it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A hacker working for the Sinaloa drug cartel was able to obtain an FBI
official’s phone records and use Mexico City’s surveillance cameras to
help track and kill the agency’s informants in 2018, according to a new
US justice department report.
</p>
<p>
The incident was disclosed in a justice department inspector general’s
audit of the FBI’s efforts to mitigate the effects of “ubiquitous
technical surveillance,” a term used to describe the global
proliferation of cameras and the thriving trade in vast stores of
communications, travel, and location data…

The power of Doctors Under Attack comes in the unhurried way it chooses
to unfurl its thesis. There is no clear manipulation, no central
villain. What there is, however, is an unceasing timeline of horrors. We
are shown doctors doing their best in overwhelmed hospitals with no
water or electricity, racing to treat wounds that have already begun to
rot. We are shown them coming under what seem like targeted attacks,
being detained in black sites where they will be tortured and
interrogated. There is footage of a gang rape by soldiers. We are shown
children, injured and dead, in vast numbers. –

This report investigates the corporate machinery sustaining Israel’s
settler-colonial project of displacement and replacement of the
Palestinians in the occupied territory. While political leaders and
governments shirk their obligations, far too many corporate entities
have profited from Israel’s economy of illegal occupation, apartheid and
now, genocide. The complicity exposed by this report is just the tip of
the iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private
sector accountable, including its executives. International law
recognizes varying degrees of responsibility – each requiring scrutiny
and accountability, particularly in this case, where a people’s
self-determination and very existence are at stake. This is a necessary
step to end the genocide and dismantle the global system that has
allowed it. –

internally is mostly pipes connected to other pipes, each adding a

things you can do to it, those would be names of pipes. I have to ask
ChatGPT what it thinks about this, but I am also asking my human
friends. BTW I expect this seems so natural because our minds probably
work that way too, internally, below our conscious awareness.</p>

<h1 id="2025-07-02-cloudflare-no">
2025-07-02 Cloudflare? No.
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de"><span
class="citation" data-cites="babelcarp">@babelcarp</span></a> asked me
about Cloudflare. I think their efforts to block bots and other forms of
distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks are commendable and
interesting. But at the same time, I don’t want to use them.
</p>
<p>
Whatever tech they are using to identify bots is proprietary. Is it the
list of user agents? The behaviour of certain IP numbers or networks? I
mean, I try to do the same thing, right? But using their solution costs
money and puts me at their mercy. This is problematic even if they give
me their protection for free. If I can no longer defend myself, I’ll be
happy to accept their help. But until then, I’m going to look for other
ways.
</p>
<p>
As a society, handing over control over vast swaths of the web to a
single US company is problematic, too. Sure, this gives them great power
to find bots and analyse their behaviour across a gazillion websites.
But when Cloudflare is down, a large part of the public Internet is
down, too. If they censor a country, a company, or an individual,
everybody using their service automatically partakes in the action.
</p>
<p>
Those problems remain even if Cloudflare decided to share their
blocklists. Everybody would have an auto-update on short notice, like
every 15min at least. And therefore, we’d all accept their decisions. If
the US president decides that Canada or Greenland or Ukraine or Iran or
Palestine needs to be blocked, Cloudflare will have to comply. And
without human oversight, everybody using their services will be an
accomplice.
</p>
<p>
What I think would be best is more people experimenting and documenting
approaches to the problem. We need to find solutions, collectively.
<a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/">Anubis</a> relies on proof-of-work
and JavaScript. This is not ideal for the environment and it’s not ideal
for browsers without JavaScript.
<a href="https://iocaine.madhouse-project.org/">Iocaine</a> uses various
ways of identifying bots and feeds them auto-generated drivel in order
to poison their data sources.
<a href="https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/">Nephentes</a> is a similar
tarpit. These solutions are also not ideal for the environment. But
process is exactly what we need: More people researching ways to keep
the web free.
</p>
<p>
I wish Cloudflare would share their techniques of keeping the web free.
But that, of course, is a bad idea under capitalism.
</p>
<p>
People using Cloudflare need to weigh the costs and benefits. The ease
of use and the ubiquity is a boon. You will never walk alone. It might
cost money and a little bit of independence, but it keeps the websites
up, so the primary goal is achieved.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, I’m not there, yet. I’ve had a few days of downtime but my
websites are also not very important. So I can keep on experimenting and
documenting approaches to keeping the web free.

<h2 id="ubuntu-disables-spectremeltdown-protections">Ubuntu Disables
Spectre/Meltdown Protections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, updated: 2025-07-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A whole class of speculative execution attacks against CPUs
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/01/spectre_and_mel_1.html">were
published</a> in 2018. They seemed pretty catastrophic at the time. But
the fixes were as well. Speculative execution was a way to speed up
CPUs, and removing those enhancements resulted in significant
performance drops.
</p>
<p>
Now, people are rethinking the trade-off. Ubuntu
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/intel-compute-runtime/+bug/2110131">has
disabled</a> some protections, resulting in 20% performance boost.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
After discussion between Intel and Canonical’s security teams, we are in
agreement that Spectre no longer needs to be mitigated for the GPU at
the Compute Runtime level. At this point, Spectre has been mitigated in
the kernel, and a clear warning from the Compute Runtime build serves as
a notification for those running modified kernels without those patches.
For these reasons, we feel that Spectre mitigations in Compute Runtime
no longer offer enough security impact to justify the current
performance tradeoff…

For years, Elon Musk has been promising that Teslas will operate

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://fortune.com/2015/12/21/elon-musk-interview/">December

from complete autonomy, complete—safer than a human. However regulators
will take at least another year.”

<a href="https://electrek.co/2018/03/11/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-self-driving-next-year/">March

But finally, on June 22<sup>nd</sup>, Tesla’s robotaxi revolution
arrived. Never one to miss an opportunity to
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-trillion-dollar-robotaxi-gamble-is-here-2000618771">pump
the stock with bullshit</a>, Musk:<br />
<blockquote>
envisions a future fleet, including a new “Cybercab” and “Robovan” with
no steering wheels or pedals, that could boost Tesla’s market value by
an astonishing $5 trillion to $10 trillion. On June 20, Tesla was worth
$1.04 trillion
</blockquote>
As usual, there are plenty of cult members
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-trillion-dollar-robotaxi-gamble-is-here-2000618771">lapping
up the BS</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“My view is the golden age of autonomous vehicles starting on Sunday in
Austin for Tesla,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. “I believe it’s a
trillion dollar valuation opportunity for Tesla.”
</blockquote>
Dan Ives obviously only sipped 10-20% of Musk’s CoolAid. Others
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-trillion-dollar-robotaxi-gamble-is-here-2000618771">drank
deeper</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Investor Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest predicts robotaxis could account for
90% of Tesla’s profits by 2029. If they are right, this weekend’s launch
was existential.
</blockquote>
Tesla’s net income from the trailing 12 months is
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/financials/">around
$6.1B</a> and falling. Assuming, optimistically, that they can continue
to sell cars at the current rate, Cathie Woods is assuming that robotaxi
<i>profits</i> would be around $60B. Tesla’s net margin is around 6%, so
this implies revenue of almost $1T in 2029. Tesla charges $4.20/ride
(ha! ha!), so this implies that they are delivering 231B rides/year, or
around 23,000 times the rate of the entire robotaxi industry currently.
Woods is projecting that in four year’s time Tesla’s robotaxi business
will have almost as much revenue as Amazon ($638B), Microsoft ($245B)
and Nvidia ($130B) <i>combined</i>.<br /> <br /> Liam Denning’s analysis
in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-06-27/tesla-s-800-billion-robotaxi-dream-is-finally-facing-reality"><i>Tesla’s
$800 Billion Robotaxi Dream Is Finally Facing Reality</i></a> is only
somewhat less optimistic:<br />
<blockquote>
“On generous assumptions, Tesla’s core EV business, generating 75% of
gross profit but with falling sales, might be worth roughly $50 per
share, only 15% of the current price. Much of the remainder relates to
expectations around self driving. RBC Capital, for example, ascribes 59%
of its price target, or $181 per share, to robotaxis and a further $53
to monetizing Full Self Driving technology. Combined, that is a cool
$815 billion based on double-digit multiples ascribed to modeled revenue
— not earnings — 10 to 15 years from now because, after all, it relates
to businesses that barely make money today.”
</blockquote>
This all seems a tad optimistic, given the current state of Tesla’s and
the competition’s robotaxi offerings. Brad Templeton says
“<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/06/22/tesla-misses-robotaxi-launch-date-goes-with-safety-drivers/">pay
no attention to the person in the passenger seat</a>”:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla’s much-anticipated June 22 “no one in the vehicle” “unsupervised”
Robotaxi launch in Austin is not ready. Instead, Tesla is operating a
limited service with Tesla employees on board the vehicle to maintain
safety.<br /> …<br /> Having an employee who can intervene on board,
commonly called a safety driver, is the approach that every robocar
company has used for testing, including testing of passenger operations.
Most companies spend many years (Waymo spent a decade) testing with
safety drivers, and once they are ready to take passengers, there are
typically some number of years testing in that mode, though the path to
removing the safety driver depends primarily on evaluation of the safety
case for the vehicle, and less on the presence of passengers.<br />
<br /> In addition to Musk’s statements about the vehicle being
unsupervised, with nobody inside, in general the removal of the safety
driver is the biggest milestone in development of a true robotaxi, not
an incremental step that can be ignored. As such, Tesla has yet to meet
its goals.<br />
</blockquote>
Seven-and-a-half years after Musk’s deadline for “complete autonomy” the
best Tesla can do is a small robotaxi service for invited guests in a
geofenced area of Austin with a safety driver in daylight. Waymo has
<a href="tesla_robotaxi_austin">100 robotaxis in service in Austin</a>.
Three months ago
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/03/07/robotaxis-mostly-waymo-are-giving-13-million-ridesmonth--why/">Brad
Templeton reported that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet, announced recently that they
are now providing 200,000 self-driving taxi rides every week with no
safety driver in the car, only passengers.<br /> …<br /> In China,
though, several companies are giving rides with no safety driver. The
dominant player is Baidu Apollo, which reports they did 1.1 million
rides last quarter, which is 84,000 per week, and they now are all
no-safety-driver. Pony.AI claims 26,000 per week, but it is not clear if
all are with no safety driver. AutoX does not report numbers, but says
it has 1,000 cars in operation. WeRide also does not report numbers.
</blockquote>
It turns out that the safety driver is necessary. Craig Trudell and Kara
Carlson’s
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/tesla-robotaxi-videos-show-speeding-driving-into-wrong-lane"><i>Tesla
Robotaxi Incidents Draw Scrutiny From US Safety Agency</i></a> reports
on the first day of the robotaxi revolution:<br />
<blockquote>
US auto safety regulators are looking into incidents where Tesla Inc.’s
self-driving robotaxis appeared to violate traffic laws during the
company’s first day offering paid rides in Austin.<br /> …<br /> In one
video taken by investor Rob Maurer, who used to host a Tesla podcast, a
Model Y he’s riding in enters an Austin intersection in a left-turn-only
lane. The Tesla hesitates to make the turn, swerves right and proceeds
into an unoccupied lane meant for traffic moving in the opposite
direction.<br /> <br /> A honking horn can be heard as the Tesla
re-enters the correct lane over a double-yellow line, which drivers
aren’t supposed to cross.<br /> <br /> In two other posts on X, initial
riders in driverless Model Ys shared footage of Teslas speeding. A
vehicle carrying Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor, reached 35 miles per
hour shortly after passing a 30 miles per hour speed limit sign, a video
he posted shows.
</blockquote>
Tesla’s level of incompetence is not a surprise. Tesla added
“(Supervised)” to FSD in the US. They aren’t allowed to call the
technology
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">“Full

<blockquote>
But immediately after that rollout, Tesla drivers started
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/27/tesla-drivers-are-racking-up-fines-using-fsd-in-china/">racking
up fines</a> for violating the law. Many roads in China are watched by
CCTV cameras, and fines are automatically handed out to drivers to break
the law.<br /> <br /> It’s clear that the system still needs more
knowledge about Chinese roads in general, because it kept mistaking bike
lanes for right turn lanes, etc. One driver racked up 7 tickets within
the span of a single drive after driving through bike lanes and crossing
over solid lines. If a driver gets enough points on their license, they
could even have their license suspended.
</blockquote>
Why did Tesla roll out their $8K “Intelligent Assisted Driving” in
China? It might have something to do with
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
BYD recently pushed a software update giving
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/10/byds-most-affordable-evs-smart-driving-upgrade-free/">smart
driving features to all of its vehicles – for free</a>.
</blockquote>
There are already many competing robotaxi services in China.
<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/china-robotaxis-baidu-tesla-driverless-vehicles-4670506">For
example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Baidu is already operating robotaxi services in multiple cities in
China. It provided close to 900,000 rides in the second quarter of the
year, up 26 per cent year-on-year, according to its latest earnings
call. More than 7 million robotaxi rides in total had been operated as
of late July.
</blockquote>
That was a year ago. It isn’t just Waymo that is in a whole different
robotaxi league than Tesla. And lets not talk about the fact that BYD,
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/04/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-6.html">Xiaomi</a>
and others outsell Tesla in China because their products are better and
cheaper. Tesla’s response? Getting the White House to put a

I should have done more research for this post, then I would have found
out that, unlike Tesla’s CyberCab, Waymo’s custom robotaxi is real. This
morning I drove alongside a test vehicle in Palo Alto. Wikipedia has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo#Waymo">the
details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In July 2024, Waymo began testing its sixth-generation robotaxis which
are based on electric vehicles by Chinese automobile company Zeekr,
developed in a partnership first announced in 2021.
</blockquote>
Zeekr is a brand of the Chinese company
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely">Geely</a>. Waymo plans to
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/waymo-to-double-robotaxi-production-at-arizona-plant-by-end-of-2026.html">buiid
their robotaxi at</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The “Waymo Driver Integration Plant,” a 239,000 square foot facility
outside of Phoenix, will assemble more than 2,000 Jaguar I-PACE
robotaxis, the Alphabet company said in a statement. Waymo will add
those self-driving vehicles to its existing fleet that already includes
around 1,500 robotaxis.<br /> <br /> The plant will be “capable of
building tens of thousands of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year,”
when it is fully built out, Waymo said. The company also said it plans
to build its more advanced Geely Zeekr RT robotaxis that feature its
“6th-generation Waymo Driver” technology later this year at the plant.
</blockquote>
<p>It seems likely that Waymo will be offering unsupervised rides in a
custom robotaxi before Tesla can do it in a Model Y.<br /></p>

<h2 id="my-new-linkblog-feed">My new linkblog feed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is the address of my linkblog feed:
<a href="https://dave.linkblog.org/">dave.linkblog.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s kind of interesting to have the top page of a site be a
feed. I don’t hide the XML-ness of it. I never supported the
obfuscation, it’s confusing, makes people not trust RSS, imho.
</p>
<p>
I think the feed is pretty stable now, so if you want to subscribe, go
ahead. I haven’t redirected from the old feed yet, probably should do
that soon, since it more or less has stopped updating.
</p>
<p>
This is all managed in <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>
and therefore is part of the WordPress ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
I felt it was time to do a definitive linkblog, since as far as I could
tell no one has tried to explain what it is: basically, a feed where the
&lt;link&gt; element of each &lt;item&gt; points to some other site.
That’s the basic difference.
</p>
<p>
Also a linkblog feed should specify the channel-level &lt;image&gt;
element, which is used as the avatar for the feed when it appears in a
twitter-like timeline.
</p>
<p>
I think the only other product that is open to feeds being part of the
open social web is
<a href="https://about.flipboard.com/press/announcing-surf-the-first-browser-for-the-open-social-web/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Surf</a>
from Mike McCue’s company, Flipboard. I asked ChatGPT to
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6863cadb-46ec-8012-9ec8-c5e67595f954">brief
me</a> on how it works with feeds, and saw that we’re more or less doing
the same thing, except I’m not trying to work with the output from
Twitter, Bluesky, etc. Even when they have outbound RSS feeds they
aren’t good enough to be part of the social web defined by feeds.
</p>
<p>
I only want really good feeds. It’s time to stop being so careless about
what we transmit to the world. If we want an open web we’re all going to
have to be good gardeners. It’s like a food system where all the food is
grown by family farmers and I’m running a restaurant, and only want the
good stuff, and we want it to look good too! :-)
</p>
<p>
PS: Another thing, the feed items must have working
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt">guids</a>.
All software that runs on feeds should be able to depend on this.
</p>
<p>
PPS: Linkblogs aren’t the only kinds of feeds that will be used in this
RSS-based feediverse. Scripting News will work with it. You would be
able to read this post in this new medium (not yet delivered, btw).

<h2 id="do-a-backup-now">Do a backup now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Advice from a longtime developer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you think “I should do a backup,” do it. Now, don’t wait.
</li>
<li>
Make it really easy to do a backup. Choose a menu item that’s always
available when you’re working.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The reason is karma. God hears all your thoughts. When that thought pops
into your head and you don’t do a backup, or don’t do it soon enough, He
crashes your data, and you think “I should have done a backup when I
thought of doing it.” Even this doesn’t please Him. At that moment it’s
even more urgent that you do a backup.
</p>
<p>
My hippie uncle taught me this. God has a terrible sense of humor, and
thinks it’s really funny when you have a good thought and ignore it.
When something didn’t work he would say that’s God goofing on me.
</p>
<p>
In this case, we’re talking about is the Programmer God. There are all
kinds of gods, a
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html">baseball
god</a>, a basketball god, and very specifically a Knicks god. That god
has the absolutely worst sense of humor of them all and by worst I mean
best.

<p>
American democracy runs on trust, and that trust is cracking.
</p>
<p>
Nearly half of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, question
whether elections are
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651185/partisan-split-election-integrity-gets-even-wider.aspx">conducted
fairly</a>. Some voters accept election results only
<a href="https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/rule-law-united-states">when
their side wins</a>. The problem isn’t just political polarization—it’s
a creeping
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/10/29/elections-in-america-concerns-over-security-divisions-over-expanding-access-to-voting/">erosion
of trust</a> in the machinery of democracy itself.
</p>
<p>
Commentators blame ideological tribalism,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/business/media/election-disinformation-2024.html">misinformation
campaigns</a> and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/opinion/social-media-polarization-democracy.html">partisan
echo chambers</a> for this crisis of trust. But these explanations miss
a critical piece of the puzzle: a growing unease with the digital
infrastructure that now underpins nearly every aspect of how Americans
vote…

They do and they’re right to, the same way we were concerned how the

invasion of the Marines and hijacking of the National Guard.
</p>
<p>
Right now the NYC mayor is a hostage of the US govt. Not in a position
to help. An inexperienced first term NY mayor, have we seen that before?
How does the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io7hOfnMldY">NYPD

<p>
But think about the context the next mayor will govern in.

The thing about NY that people might not understand is that the politics
are dirty and fucked up. Dems tend to elect handsome young heros who

<p>
Now that we know the outcome of the 2024 election, not just in numbers
but in what it’s doing to our beloved country and the rest of the world,
it’s interesting to revisit the campaign that journalism ran last year
to force President Biden to step aside. That’s one of the functions of
Facebook, they play back your posts from years ago, so you can see how
things changed, or didn’t.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, last year on this day I
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l">wrote
this</a> on Facebook: “Why don’t journalists cover the Biden base? Do
they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think
they are the base? I thought they weren’t supposed to care who the
nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should
withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this through?”
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B06VVR3DX6/about?ccs_id=add77910-b4f6-4323-80d0-494d4da9650f">Nick

“Until I read this, the madness of the Times calling on Biden, but not
Trump, to withdraw didn’t dawn on me.”
</p>
<p>
I had followed his metamorphosis over years from a journalist to a
worker who goes where there are fires or other natural disasters, for
the government, to support the effort to save people’s homes and lives.
I watched him via Facebook, in awe, as he went around the country,
<s>not being paid very much I imagine, but</s> doing good.
</p>
<p>
I learned something important when my father was in the hospital many
years ago, in a coma, after losing a lot of blood and being unconscious
for hours before he was found. He was in a ward in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_Hospital_Medical_Center">Flushing
Hospital</a>, along with a lot of other comatose people. All were
unconscious, unable to feed themselves. Hard to know if they had any
awareness. From an outside perspective they, and my father included,
were lost. Some had been there for years, probably weren’t ever going to
come out of it. We were lucky, my father survived, after a month, and
had seven more years to live.
</p>
<p>
I visited him every day, and got to know the flow of the hospital.
Workers came in and out of the room to attend to these comatose people.
Imagine the kind of support they needed just to keep their bodies
functioning and not wasting away for lack of movement. I thought these
people must have the worst jobs imaginable, imagining myself in their
shoes.
</p>
<p>
I got to know them, asked about what else they do, how they got here,
where they live, etc. Somehow I got up the courage to ask one of them if
they liked their job, imagining I’d get a New Yorker comment like “You
know, it’s a living.” But what I heard was a complete surprise. “It’s
the best job in the world,” he said, because I can see so clearly how my
work helps real people. He was looking right at me. It hit me, this man
is doing what I can’t do, what my father’s parents, who were long gone,
couldn’t do. <i>Caring.</i> Caring for my dad. Then I got it.
</p>
<p>
Back to Nick, who was and still is, and probably always will be doing
things to help other people, no matter what he does.
</p>
<p>
He was canned in one of the DOGE purges this spring.
</p>
<p>
Now you tell me whether the “Trump base” deserved a chance you wouldn’t
let us have with Biden? Why journalism felt entitled to make this
decision for all of us? When are you going to get the idea that you’re
supposed to help us. Do the right thing. I get so angry at journalism
for getting in the way. Once informed of the facts, it was their job to
get out of the way and let us, the voters, make the decision.
</p>
