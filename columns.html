Injection Defenses Against LLM Cyberattacks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, updated: 2024-11-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research:
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20911">Hacking Back the AI-Hacker:
Prompt Injection as a Defense Against LLM-driven Cyberattacks</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being harnessed to
automate cyberattacks, making sophisticated exploits more accessible and
scalable. In response, we propose a new defense strategy tailored to
counter LLM-driven cyberattacks. We introduce Mantis, a defensive
framework that exploits LLMs’ susceptibility to adversarial inputs to
undermine malicious operations. Upon detecting an automated cyberattack,
Mantis plants carefully crafted inputs into system responses, leading
the attacker’s LLM to disrupt their own operations (passive defense) or
even compromise the attacker’s machine (active defense). By deploying
purposefully vulnerable decoy services to attract the attacker and using
dynamic prompt injections for the attacker’s LLM, Mantis can
autonomously hack back the attacker. In our experiments, Mantis
consistently achieved over 95% effectiveness against automated
LLM-driven attacks. To foster further research and collaboration, Mantis
is available as an open-source tool: …

Really interesting research:
“<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-yan.pdf">An
LLM-Assisted Easy-to-Trigger Backdoor Attack on Code Completion Models:
Injecting Disguised Vulnerabilities against Strong Detection<a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code
com-<br /> pletion tasks, providing context-based suggestions to boost
developer productivity in software engineering. As users often fine-tune
these models for specific applications, poisoning and backdoor attacks
can covertly alter the model outputs. To address this critical security
challenge, we introduce CODEBREAKER, a pioneering LLM-assisted backdoor
attack framework on code completion models. Unlike recent attacks that
embed malicious payloads in detectable or irrelevant sections of the
code (e.g., comments), CODEBREAKER leverages LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for
sophisticated payload transformation (without affecting
functionalities), ensuring that both the poisoned data for fine-tuning
and generated code can evade strong vulnerability detection. CODEBREAKER
stands out with its comprehensive coverage of vulnerabilities, making it
the first to provide such an extensive set for evaluation. Our extensive
experimental evaluations and user studies underline the strong attack
performance of CODEBREAKER across various settings, validating its
superiority over existing approaches. By integrating malicious payloads
directly into the source code with minimal transformation, CODEBREAKER
challenges current security measures, underscoring the critical need for
more robust defenses for code completion…

I really hoped that I wouldn’t have to extend the link list on Trump I
started <a href="2016-11-14_Trump">back in 2016</a> because I didn’t
understand how he could win.
</p>
<p>
Then again, I also didn’t understand why Bush got re-elected. I just
read a 20 year old blog post of mine:
<a href="2004-11-09_USA">2004-11-09 USA</a> where I was grappling with
it.

<a class="account" href="https://mstdn.social/@mattwilcox" title="@mattwilcox@mstdn.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mattwilcox">@mattwilcox</span></a> said it
best:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fascism is the inevitable result of a society with large imbalances of
personal security. Which in a capitalist society means large imbalances
of wealth.
</p>
<p>
If your society allows some people to be mega secure and untouchable,
while also allowing large portions of it to feel very insecure… you will
become a fascist society, eventually.
</p>
<p>
Do not allow this. Do not allow excessive wealth stratification. It.
will. Destroy. Your. Civilisation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The best defence against many divisive issues is to solve them. To leave
festering wounds invites further prodding by the troll armies. Start
small but start early, because soon the prodders are in power, prodding
ever harder until it all falls apart.
</p>
<p>
Remember that these days, all dictators are voted in. The elections may
be a farce, but it’s always a legal farce. The people in power may be
the most corrupt criminals but ever and always they are the ones
fighting corruption. It’s just that the corruption of their enemies is
always uncovered and punished whereas their own is hidden in plain
sight, know to all.
</p>
<p>
Look around at the countries around you. Erdoğan is still in power.
Putin is still in power. Dictatorships may end eventually, but they take
a fucking long time to fall. If it takes forty years, I won’t be around
to see it. It’s hard to wait them out.
</p>
<p>
If you meet somebody thinking about a civil war with armed militia doing
this or that, I’d say forget about all of that. In the real world,
revolts that are not decisive inevitably lead to warlordism. Organised
armed forces will shoot all the wanna-be resistance to bits. The police
will beat the unarmed resistances into submission.
</p>
<p>
I take solace in the fact that when Stalin was dying and calling for
help in his office, the attendants just didn’t listen. They didn’t open
the door and the fucker died alone.

<p>Final note (I think). The pain you feel at first may abate. It did
for me. I had pushed down memories of 2020 and 2021. It was a horror
show, and Trump was the main character. So the first thing I had to deal
with is that I don’t want to remember that. Too painful. But once I
realized that’s not where we are right now, it’s a totally different
situation, that’s when the creative impulse rose as the pain receded. We
have one short term thing to do – keep the campaign running, and long
term we have to recognize division we add, and counteract it. We are the
party that welcomes everyone regardless or race, religion, country of
origin, age or gender. <i>All</i> of them. No exceptions. The election
result represents big change. And it’s a
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html">good
time</a> to make more changes.</p>

2024-10-27 Upgrading GoToSocial from 16.0 to 17.1
</h1>
<p>
Here’s something to watch out for, if you’re like me: Disable all the
infrastructure that watches over your processes. In my case, the problem
was Monit. It checks the website every five minutes and if it fails to
connect for three times in a row it restarts the server, breaking the
migration. 😭
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl stop gotosocial
# prevent systemctl from restarting it
systemctl disable gotosocial
# prevent monit from interrupting the migration with a restart!
monit unmonitor gotosocial
# backup!
mkdir backup
cp sqlite.db backup/
</code></pre>
<p>
Now you’re ready to extract the new version over the old one, compare
your config file with the example provided, and start it again.
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl enable gotosocial
systemctl start gotosocial
journalctl --unit gotosocial --follow
</code></pre>
<p>
Don’t be like me and start Monit because my Monit config checks the URL
every five minutes and restarts GoToSocial if the site is not up. Which
is a big problem if migration takes more than a handful of minutes.
</p>
<p>
I ended up with a borked migration restart loop and ended up stopping it
all again, overwriting the borked database file with the backup, and
redoing it.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23GoToSocial">#GoToSocial</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-10-28</strong>. Another thing to note for the GoToSocial
upgrade is that I ran 16.0 using a systemd MemoryMax of 200M; today the
upgraded instance with 17.1 ran fine for a while and then locked up. A
restart didn’t bring it back. It remained stuck after a log message
saying “compiling WebAssembly”. I increased MemoryMax to 300M, no
change. I increased it to 500M and the instance came up. Just in case
you’re as memory-stingy as I am…
</p>
<p>
In order to avoid future compilation,
<a class="account" href="https://gts.superseriousbusiness.org/@dumpsterqueer" title="@dumpsterqueer@superseriousbusiness.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dumpsterqueer">@dumpsterqueer</span></a>
pointed me at this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You can instruct GoToSocial on where to store the Wazero artifacts by
setting the environment variable
<code>GTS_WAZERO_COMPILATION_CACHE</code> to a directory, which will be
used by GtS to store two smallish artifacts of ~50MiB or so each
(~100MiB total). –
<a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/configuration/#gts_wazero_compilation_cache">Configuration
Overview</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ll try that.
</p>
<p>
It looks like a side-effect of GoToSocial implementing the direct
messages API is that the Toot! App I’m using is showing me all my former
direct messages using it’s special user interface (those bubbles on the
right hand side). I have to open every single one of them to dismiss it.
🤨
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-10-29</strong>. Today I read that the botsin.space instance
was shutting down. I figured I might start thinking about creating a
second account for my blog on my own instance. I tried to run
<code>./gotosocial admin account create</code> a few times, forgetting
this or that parameter. And then I noticed that the replies I saw
scrolling by always ended in an error message. In fact, there were more
such error messages in my log files: “database disk image is malformed”
😱
</p>
<p>
The <code>.recover</code> command didn’t work when I tried it:
</p>
<pre><code># sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.recover&quot; | sqlite3 new.db
sql error: SQL logic error (1)
</code></pre>
<p>
So then I tried the following:
</p>
<pre><code>monit unmonitor gotosocial
systemctl stop gotosocial
sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.dump&quot; &gt; db.sql
mkdir backup
mv sqlite.db backup/
sudo -u gotosocial sqlite3 sqlite.db &lt; db.sql
gzip backup/sqlite.db
gzip db.sql
</code></pre>
<p>
Some errors that I saw:
</p>
<p>
A few lines about accounts with no account_uri even though that was a
NOT NULL column.
</p>
<p>
Many, many such lines:
</p>
<pre><code>no such table: sqlite_stat4
</code></pre>
<p>
Then this one:
</p>
<pre><code>NOT NULL constraint failed: conversations.thread_id (19)
</code></pre>
<p>
I started to feel bad about the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
I aborted the operation. The gzip command hadn’t finished, yet. I
restored the old database file.
</p>
<pre><code>mv backup/sqlite.db .
systemctl start gotosocial
</code></pre>
<p>
As it turns out, now my GoToSocial instance seems to be unreachable. The
service starts, <code>htop</code> shows processes churning. The log
shows i/o timeouts and “No Content: wrote 0B” log messages scrolling by.
Oof! 😓
</p>
<p>
Looking at the timestamps again, it seems that the recovery command left
a <code>sqlite.db-shm</code> and a <code>sqlite.db-wal</code> file in
place.
</p>
<pre><code>-rw-r--r--     1 gotosocial gotosocial 10445488128 29. Okt 22:47 sqlite.db
-rw-r--r--     1 gotosocial gotosocial       32768 29. Okt 23:19 sqlite.db-shm
-rw-r--r--     1 gotosocial gotosocial      341992 29. Okt 23:19 sqlite.db-wal
</code></pre>
<p>
That can’t be right. So I’m going to stop <code>gotosocial</code>, move
these two files away, and start it again.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, no luck.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps there is a database recovery going on? I can’t tell. This time
around I see the typical startup messages, something about “recovered
queued tasks”, about 12 requests that look like regular requests, and
then nothing.
</p>
<p>
I’ll let it run for a bit.
</p>
<p>
I restarted it again. It seems to work?
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-10-30</strong>. The database is still corrupt in some way.
There are a lot of errors. Here are two examples:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

dereference status author … : enrichAccount: error putting in database:

There’s something about these authors that’s not working.
</p>
<p>
The code in <code>account.go</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>// This is new, put it in the database.
err := d.state.DB.PutAccount(ctx, latestAcc)
if err != nil {
    return nil, nil, gtserror.Newf(&quot;error putting in database: %w&quot;, err)
}
</code></pre>
<p>
I feel that this is where things are going wrong. Something about the
accounts table.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to make an offline copy of the <code>sqlite.db</code> file.
Sadly the <code>.recover</code> doesn’t work on my laptop, either.
</p>
<pre><code>$ sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.recover&quot; &gt; data.sql
sql error: SQL logic error (1)
</code></pre>
<p>
Not looking good! I’m going to try the dump.
</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.dump&quot; &gt; data.sql
sqlite3 recovery.db &lt; data.sql 2&gt;&amp;1 |tee recovery.log
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s look at the log file and list the errors!

I ended up filing
<a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues/3499">an
issue</a>.
</p>
<p>
And then, later that day, I used <code>.dump</code>. This time around,
there was a <code>COMMIT</code> at the end of the dump, so no change was
required.
</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.dump&quot; &gt; data.sql
tail data.sql  # verify that there is a COMMIT at the end
sqlite3 recovery.db &lt; data.sql 2&gt;&amp;1 |tee recovery.log
rsync --archive --itemize-changes recovery.db &quot;sibirocobombus.root:/home/gotosocial/sqlite.db&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
The recovery log showed all the errors mentioned above, and I used the
new database anyway.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-10-31</strong>. Currently the instance is locking up every
few minutes, as far as I can tell. 😰
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-11-06</strong>. The instance has been stable these days!

<p>Also to the Twitter founders, amassing that much power and
centralizing it as Twitter did, had a cost that we’re paying now. But
it’s very hard to stop when the juggernaut is rolling. I understand, but
in the future we have to think about this more clearly. <b>When a medium
becomes too big and centralized, there’s trouble ahead</b>. It was
accidental that Trump was the one to take advantage of this to route
around journalism and go direct, but it was not accidential that Musk
did.</p>

<p>Speaking of Musk, maybe he will temper Trump’s desire for
retribution. It may be a vain hope, but I’ll cling to it anyway. Doing
business in a world of retribution might not be too conducive to the
creativity needed to run innovative tech businesses. A climate of fear
doesn’t inspire great software. I know the quality of products Musk
makes, I own and love my Tesla Model Y. Best car I’ve ever owned or
driven.</p>

<p>Ben Thompson wrote in his
<a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> newsletter: “What is
fascinating is how this fundamentally transforms any attempt to evaluate
the Twitter acquisition. From a business perspective it’s a massive
failure, and might always be: Musk paid too much for Twitter as it was,
and in the intervening years the flight of advertisers from the platform
has made it worth even less. From a Musk Inc. perspective, however, X
played a pivotal role in ensuring that the incoming administration will
do whatever Musk needs at the exact moment that SpaceX is gaining the
capabilities to actually make a trip to Mars, if only the FAA in
particular will give him the freedom to do so. That alone is almost
certainly worth $44 billion to Musk!” I wrote in 2017, that
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">some
Repub would buy Twitter</a>, and it would merge and thus transform
politics and tech. This was obvious, but for some reason I was the only
one who saw it. We could have headed this off, if people would just
listen. I beg you to listen to people you don’t usually listen to. The
NYT will never hire someone like me to write on their op-ed page, so if
you only accept your input from people with legit credentials, you’ll
miss insights like this. We’re paying a heavy price for this now. When I
begged people to listen they came back with the balance sheet valuation
of Twitter, but they were leaving the most important asset off the
balance sheet, the dollar value of being able to elect a president. Musk
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a140612">didn’t</a> miss

<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/election-day-special-edition-feat-james-carville/id1523896927?i=1000675748922">yesterday’s
Trippi podcast</a> with Carville as the only guest was the <b>best
podcast</b> I’ve ever heard. I recommended it yesterday as
inspirational. Now that we know the outcome of the election, it’s a
marker of where we were before the results were known. A world that no
longer exists. But like stories written in 2016, the markers are useful
to see where we once were and how we got here, and what we can learn
from what happened between. I wish it had turned out the way these two
great friends thought it should have. But it didn’t. But there was a
hint that they knew what wouldn’t work this time. No spoilers.</p>

was right</a>. There’s no reason to make one whole gender the scapegoat

<p>First thing – <b>Don’t shut down the campaign</b>. We must keep
communicating with the electorate, independent of what they get from the
news orgs. The Harris campaign did an exemplary job. Why shut it down.
Keep setting the agenda. Help keep us organized. Preserve the
perspective and expectation of democracy in the US. Change the message
from raising money, to keeping us all in touch with the opposition (ie
us). This is the mistake we made in every election since we had the web
to organize. The Repubs, almost by accident, never stopped organizing.
And now that Musk, who will be part of the new administration, owns
Twitter, you can be sure they will stay and get more organized. We can
do it too! We have to stop making this mistake of going back to zero
after election, whether we win or lost.</p>

Azure cloud users that a Chinese controlled botnet is engaging in
“highly evasive” password spraying. Not sure about the “highly evasive”
part; the techniques seem basically what you get in a distributed
password-guessing attack:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Any threat actor using the CovertNetwork-1658 infrastructure could
conduct password spraying campaigns at a larger scale and greatly
increase the likelihood of successful credential compromise and initial
access to multiple organizations in a short amount of time,” Microsoft
officials wrote. “This scale, combined with quick operational turnover
of compromised credentials between CovertNetwork-1658 and Chinese threat
actors, allows for the potential of account compromises across multiple
sectors and geographic regions.”…

<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I went on a road trip to Montana with Rod Clark, a
photographer friend. On the way back, we stopped in Wells, NV, to get
food at Sher-E-Panjab Dhaba, a converted truck stop diner that serves
good old-fashioned Punjabi food. When paying for our lunch, I got into a
conversation with the guy behind …</p>

<p>
If you use GoToSocial, like I do, then your posts do not expire.
Mastodon, on the other hand, has that feature.
</p>
<p>
Now, you could use <a href="Mastodon_Archive">Mastodon Archive</a>. But
that makes you archive your toots before expiring them.
</p>
<p>
No good!
</p>
<p>
I want them gone. So here’s a tiny Python script, built on the shoulders
of the Mastodon.py library. It deletes and unboosts ten posts older than
eight weeks that you haven’t pinned.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to run it from a cron job every hour, deleting up to 240
toots per day. The reason is that the deletion rate limits are super
strict. So you have to be slow about it.
</p>
<p>
Now, I could not be arsed to write yet another oAuth workflow. So here’s
the deal: Use <code>toot</code> to login. It’s a great client for the
command line and it comes with a separate text-based user-interface.
</p>
<p>
Gomphotherium uses the <code>toot</code> config file to log in. 😬
</p>
<p>
It’s probably full of bugs. At least it’s short.

So I decided I wanted to gzip the PDF files (“pre-compress”) them. I
found the answer I was looking for in
<a href="https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/serving-pre-compressed-files-using/">Serving
pre-compressed files using Apache</a> by François Marier. Sometimes
searching for stuff is hard just because you don’t know what it’s
called. 😅
</p>
<pre><code>AddEncoding gzip gz
Options +Multiviews
SetEnv force-no-vary
Header set Cache-Control &quot;private&quot;
&lt;FilesMatch &quot;\.pdf\.gz$&quot;&gt;
ForceType application/pdf
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
OK, time to gzip them all!
</p>
<pre><code>for d in 2*; cd /home/alex/campaignwiki.org/1pdc/$d; echo $d; gzip *.pdf; end
</code></pre>
<p>
Aaaaand … the gains are abysmal! 😓

<strong>2024-11-04</strong>. I started looking at Ghostscript to reduce
filesize. The result of using <code>-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook</code> is
disappointing. The first PDF I opened had text in the original turned to
a badly pixelated image.
</p>
<p>
I started reading
<a href="https://ghostscript.com/blog/optimizing-pdfs.html">Optimizing
PDFs</a> on the Ghostscript blog and my head started smoking.
</p>
<p>
I ended up writing the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/markdown-links">markdown-links</a> to turn the filenames
into Markdown links for the wiki page
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/zip-original">zip-original</a> to create the first zip
file of the originals
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/shrink-pdfs">shrink-pdfs</a> to shrink all the PDFs using
<code>pdf-shrink</code>
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/pdf-shrink">pdf-shrink</a> reduce the images in a PDF
files to 150dpi (ebook quality)
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/zip-dir">zip-dir</a> to create the zip file of the shrunk
files for upload
</li>
<li>
<a href="1pdc/upload-dir">upload-dir</a> to upload the files to the site
itself

</p>

<p>
My invocation is less elaborate (w/o the threshold, filter settings,
etc.), but similar in that I also downsample images to 150 dpi. In
addition, I have <code>-dSubsetFonts=true -dCompressFonts=true</code>,
but since I use this for my own LaTeX-generated documents, I guess I
could drop this.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I didn’t look into fonts because I don’t mind people using weird fonts;
for the moment images are a bigger problem than fonts.
</p>
<p>
Then I went through my local directories and called
<code>pdf-shrink</code> on them all, regenerated the zip file containing
the year’s entries and gzipped the individual files.
</p>
<p>
As I was going through the files for 2024 I noticed that sometimes the
filenames betray different names (from email senders, I presume),
leaking privacy related information. I wanted to make sure that the
filenames reflected the authors of the works and that made me realize
two things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
not every entry has the license URL clearly visible
</li>
<li>
not every entry has the author names clearly visible
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Then again, anonymous works are OK, but it would have saved me some time
if it said “anonymous” somewhere. 😏
</p>
<p>
In any case, if you publish PDF files somewhere, here’s what I’m
planning to do from here on out:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
add copyright information and the license (if any), i.e. a date or at
least a year and the names of all the people that have rights to the
work (text, art, layout, editing, maps, and so on)
</li>
<li>
add the work’s title and the names of the all the people to the PDF’s
metadata (“properties”)
</li>
<li>
put the work’s title, data or version and the name of the main author
(your name?) into the filename
</li>
</ol>

I’ve been
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2018/03/artificial_intellige.html">writing
about</a> the possibility of AIs automatically discovering code
vulnerabilities since at least 2018. This is an ongoing area of
research: AIs doing source code scanning, AIs finding zero-days in the
wild, and everything in between. The AIs aren’t very good at it yet, but
they’re getting better.
</p>
<p>
Here’s some
<a href="https://zeropath.com/blog/0day-discoveries">anecdotal data</a>
from this summer:

<blockquote>
<p>
Since July 2024, ZeroPath is taking a novel approach combining deep
program analysis with adversarial AI agents for validation. Our
methodology has uncovered numerous critical vulnerabilities in
production systems, including several that traditional Static
Application Security Testing (SAST) tools were ill-equipped to find.
This post provides a technical deep-dive into our research methodology
and a living summary of the bugs found in popular open-source tools…

I could preview Godot for iPad today, but there is a UIKit bug that
crashes it after you run the game.

So either I have to rewrite the NavigationShell/Sidebar/Inspector, or I
have to cross my fingers for Apple to fix the bug.

The other day I asked a famous blogger who uses RSS if he would be
willing to share his list of feeds, so others could subscribe to them.
He declined, for good reason, there was private stuff in the list he
couldn’t share. I certainly understand that. Then I realized, as often
is the case, that I could do myself what I had been asking others to do.
And in fact I already was sharing my OPML subscription lists, but people
who didn’t use <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> wouldn’t
know
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/04/whereTheOpmlLinkIsInFeedland.png">how
to find</a> them. So I decided to make it easier. On
<a href="https://lists.opml.org/">lists.opml.org</a> I’ve got a link to
the
<a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/podcasts.opml">lists
of podcasts</a> I’m subscribed to. That list should update every hour
for any additions or removals from this list. I don’t update the list
very often, fwiw. And I make no warranties about the quality of the
podcasts, or when the feeds in the list update. And maybe this will give
other people an idea that they might want to do this as well. Let me
know if you do, I’d love to see what you do.</p>

<h2 id="rebooting-the-news">Rebooting the news</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
My opinion: At this point it doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either
way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.
</p>
<p>
After the election if we still have freedom of speech, we should reboot
news around the simple idea of news written by experts. They must know
the basic rules of journalism, imho that’s much easier than the
know-nothing journalist posing as everyman with a
<a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">view
from nowhere</a>, trying to understand what they’re writing about. They
don’t have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That
system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn’t
been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This
election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked,
doesn’t work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to
interested readers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen">Jay Rosen</a> and I
did a <a href="https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">series of podcasts</a>
in the early teens called Rebooting the News. This was the basic
premise. I believe more than ever that this is the best path for news
going forward.
</p>
<p>
They did this at Wired for a while. I was invited to be a columnist when
my main qualification was that I was an accomplished software developer.
I think that’s the way to go. Experts sharing their perspectives on
current events.
</p>
<p>
Before Twitter existed, in 2002, I proposed to the NYT that they offer a
blog to anyone who is quoted in a NYT article. If they had done this,
the NYT would be what Twitter became, and it wouldn’t now be owned by
Elon Musk, for the benefit of humanity. I wish they had done it. It
would have been a real moneymaker. And good for the flow of knowledge.

polls, I learned how they work and how much they are a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija">Ouija board</a>, where the
reports are tuned up based on the pollsters assumptions about who are
the real voters, and account for the limited people who can be polled.
They’re trying to estimate what millions of people will do by talking
with a few hundred. So they read each others’ work, and try not to be
too far off the consensus. It’s at best an art, at worst they’re just
press releases designed to get the ad money to flow in certain
directions. Don’t overlook that the money is flowing to the same
businesses that are choosing which polls to report on. Most of what the
news orgs report on, it makes it into a sport like the NBA or MLB, but
there at least there’s objective news to report on, you know – the score
of each game, how many runs were scored, who got injured, fired, traded.
In politics, there is no objective news, and if there were, the
journalists we have don’t report it. There’s a lot of inputs that are
connected to the outputs, conflicts of interest everywhere. Even so, the

Doctorow</a>: “I will never again devote my energies to building up an
audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to
that audience at will.” It’s a good practice, and while I completely
support it, I am part of several communities that could remove me
without recourse. I do it because I value the people in the community,
and feel that life is too short to wait for everyone to get it right.
</p>
<p>
Doctorow was writing about Bluesky, and once again, on Bluesky a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7ygxnh7ce2a">discussion</a>
starts on what it would take for Bluesky to attract developers, and each
time I am told that they have done enough, and I go away thinking that
their pitch is a scam, and they’re building value in a user base that
they will sell. They certainly could do it, and for all we know the
founders may have already sold some of their stock in the
<a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">latest
investment round</a> which valued the company at $x billion. (I did a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bluesky+investment+round+%2415m">search</a>
to find the evaluation but it appears to have not been announced.)
</p>
<p>
I gave them a roadmap, again, of how to demonstrate that they’re open,
and finally
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7zvw43d752a">concluded</a>
that the only way to <i>really</i> do it is to “provide a download that
you can install on any popular operating system to get an instant blue
sky network, running on its own without any help from anyone else. Then
you can claim to be really open and until then there will be a lot of
confusion.” (And I was generous at that. More accurately, people with
experience in tech will be certain this is yet another deal where the
founders get rich, where the users are the product and have read too
much into their promise of being open.)
</p>
<p>
I’m still on Bluesky but I expect them to be another Twitter, which btw
had an open API too, and it’s pretty good, but they never offered the
option of people running their own twitters. That would have been good
protection against a Musk buying them out and turning us into pawns in
his plan for world domination. Do we really want to help someone else
build one of those?
</p>
<p>
In early 2017 I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">observed</a>
that Twitter had just been used to route around journalism and elect a
president. This value wasn’t on their balance sheet as an asset. I felt
its stock was vastly underpriced. Exactly as it turned out when Musk
bought it. Everyone still thinks he paid too much, at this moment it
could possibly gain him control of part of the US government’s $6
trillion per year budget early next year, and if they start selling the
assets of the government he could be in the best position to buy them at
pennies on the dollar, or take a percentage of each saleAt this point it
doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for
the last time in this election.. He could probably start borrowing
against it the day after the election is called for Trump.
</p>
<p>
In the title I ask if a Musk could buy Bluesky, it’s possible they have
a way to prevent that in the design of their corporation, that’s why
it’s a question. But if the price were right maybe the founders would
sell out even if they didn’t have to.

usually vote, particularly young ones, to turn out for Trump.</p>
