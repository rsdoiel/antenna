feel like crap today, the Knicks were blown out by the Indiana team, the

water in Game 4, tie series 2-2.” Yeah. I don’t know how we recover from
this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. “It’s
been a great season, but we’re tired. We’re headed to the beach, we’ll
see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support.” I would nod my
head and say “Yeah that makes sense.” Whatever. I may spend today
sleeping it off. Next game is tomorrow night. Yes, they will play, for
sure, and I will watch.</p>

Insecurity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, updated: 2024-05-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Back in the 1960s, if you played a 2,600Hz tone into an AT&amp;T pay
phone, you could make calls without paying. A phone hacker named
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper">John Draper</a>
noticed that the
<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/capn-crunch-whistle">plastic
whistle</a> that came free in a box of Captain Crunch cereal worked to
make the right sound. That became his hacker name, and everyone who knew
the trick made free pay-phone calls.
</p>
<p>
There were all sorts of related hacks, such as faking the tones that
signaled coins dropping into a pay phone and faking tones used by repair
equipment. AT&amp;T could sometimes change the signaling tones, make
them more complicated, or try to keep them secret. But the general class
of exploit was impossible to fix because the problem was general: Data
and control used the same channel. That is, the commands that told the
phone switch what to do were sent along the same path as voices…

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Import
unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-made-switch-aperture-photos&quot;&gt;migrate my photo library from Apple&#39;s now-defunct Aperture to Photos&lt;/a&gt;, so I could take advantage of Apple&#39;s iCloud Photo Library (don&#39;t worry, I still have three full complete local backups, plus a separate cloud backup besides Apple&#39;s iCloud originals).&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models,
their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like
Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work
with the new camera models.
</p>
<p>
I don’t envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple’s official
successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits
as a semi-decent library organizer), they’ve <em>generally</em> done
well supporting new camera models. The compatibility list for
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105094">macOS Sonoma, iPadOS
17, and iOS 17</a> is a testament to that effort.

<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>Friends, This weekend, tens of thousands of students are graduating
from American colleges and universities. Some graduation ceremonies have
been cancelled or at least inconvenienced by student protests. Just so
there’s no confusion, let me state clearly that I’m deeply opposed to
Hamas. I was appalled by the atrocities it committed on October 7 that
left 1,200 Israelis dead and took 134 people as hostages, including
babies, children, women, and older people. And I firmly believe in
Israel’s existence and its right to protect itself.</p>

<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was
based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their
executive editor in a recent
<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>,
who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not
reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion
leaders, to determine what they cover, that’s marketing, not journalism.
Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over
another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is
not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my
readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept
this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their
responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the
tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the
climate?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">
2024-05-12 What do about the climate?
</h1>
<p>
The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way
out of this uncertainty? What should or
<a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?
</p>
<p>
Before we even start, let me just say that I’m never interested in
debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It’s real, it’s
here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.
</p>
<p>
The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green,
on all levels of government. And by “green” I mean the most radical
green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends
on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a
one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have
no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something
about local politics, and so on.
</p>
<p>
On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we’re not
sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn’t help much against the
climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many
plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean?
How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The
oil spills? And here’s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop!
I need to stop because there’s no “thinking it through” when things are
so complex unless you’re a scientist working on it. I hope the
scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the
research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and
individuals know what to tackle first.
</p>
<p>
This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly
wrong. They don’t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used
to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid
of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting
involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric
vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency
vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also:
get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing
something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then
medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build
railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special
permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society
with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are
precious.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I
fear.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.
</p>

The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate
Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there’s an answer if anybody is
claiming that we don’t know what to do. But also: there’s your answer if
you’re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top
need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what
little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a
very small number of people that have actually read this report, let
alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.

<p>
This is why a public “chain of trust” needs to lead from interviews with
public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social
media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with
people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance,
hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders
trust in people.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of
choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or
for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we
need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a>
right.
</p>
<p>
(We don’t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we
cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to
go.)

European Song Contest 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Chris Heilmann’s blog</p>
<p>Yesterday was the final of Eurovision. Lots of people use this as an
opportunity to post pictures of dead babies. I get it, we live in pretty
rough times. But the ESC is not an official European vote, or political
platform. So how about we concentrate on the real elections going on. We
have enough […]</p>
