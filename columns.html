with it. Heather Cox Richardson interviews Barack Obama. Are we in one

Graph metadata, when it would be much more efficient for them to support
it on their end. I would be happy to give them the code. It’s not that
complicated. But translating the OG format, which for crying out loud is
a huge standard, into their arcane format which is only supported by
Bluesky, is going in the wrong direction, and frankly is ridiculously
arrogant. Show a little humility. Facebook is huge, and the format isn’t
just used by Facebook, everyone uses it.</p>

Cybersecurity Fears Affect Confidence in Voting Systems</h2>

<p>
American democracy runs on trust, and that trust is cracking.
</p>
<p>
Nearly half of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, question
whether elections are
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651185/partisan-split-election-integrity-gets-even-wider.aspx">conducted
fairly</a>. Some voters accept election results only
<a href="https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/rule-law-united-states">when
their side wins</a>. The problem isn’t just political polarization—it’s
a creeping
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/10/29/elections-in-america-concerns-over-security-divisions-over-expanding-access-to-voting/">erosion
of trust</a> in the machinery of democracy itself.
</p>
<p>
Commentators blame ideological tribalism,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/business/media/election-disinformation-2024.html">misinformation
campaigns</a> and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/opinion/social-media-polarization-democracy.html">partisan
echo chambers</a> for this crisis of trust. But these explanations miss
a critical piece of the puzzle: a growing unease with the digital
infrastructure that now underpins nearly every aspect of how Americans
vote…

Wittes</a>: “It’s remarkable how many non-New Yorkers seem to care who
the mayor of New York City is.”
</p>
<p>
They do and they’re right to, the same way we were concerned how the
Governor of California and Mayor of Los Angeles would react to the
invasion of the Marines and hijacking of the National Guard.
</p>
<p>
Right now the NYC mayor is a hostage of the US govt. Not in a position
to help. An inexperienced first term NY mayor, have we seen that before?
How does the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io7hOfnMldY">NYPD
respond</a> to that?
</p>
<p>
Then there was the
<a href="https://www.newyorkalmanack.com/2019/01/lindsays-snowstorm-a-rising-star-falls-to-earth-in-queens/">snowstorm</a>
that derailed John V Lindsay, a heroic and transformative mayor. NY is a
tough place to govern even when the US government isn’t aiming to regime
change the place.

</p>
<p>
But think about the context the next mayor will govern in.
</p>
<p>
The thing about NY that people might not understand is that the politics
are dirty and fucked up. Dems tend to elect handsome young heros who
when they have to deal with NYPD and the sanitation workers, the
teachers union, and the federal government, also the ancient
infrastructure, melt.

<p>date: 2025-06-29, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Now that we know the outcome of the 2024 election, not just in numbers
but in what it’s doing to our beloved country and the rest of the world,
it’s interesting to revisit the campaign that journalism ran last year
to force President Biden to step aside. That’s one of the functions of
Facebook, they play back your posts from years ago, so you can see how
things changed, or didn’t.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, last year on this day I
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l">wrote
this</a> on Facebook: “Why don’t journalists cover the Biden base? Do
they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think
they are the base? I thought they weren’t supposed to care who the
nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should
withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this through?”
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B06VVR3DX6/about?ccs_id=add77910-b4f6-4323-80d0-494d4da9650f">Nick
Arnett</a>, a former tech journalist, said in a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l?comment_id=399566229765683">comment</a>:
“Until I read this, the madness of the Times calling on Biden, but not
Trump, to withdraw didn’t dawn on me.”
</p>
<p>
I had followed his metamorphosis over years from a journalist to a
worker who goes where there are fires or other natural disasters, for
the government, to support the effort to save people’s homes and lives.
I watched him via Facebook, in awe, as he went around the country,
<s>not being paid very much I imagine, but</s> doing good.
</p>
<p>
I learned something important when my father was in the hospital many
years ago, in a coma, after losing a lot of blood and being unconscious
for hours before he was found. He was in a ward in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_Hospital_Medical_Center">Flushing
Hospital</a>, along with a lot of other comatose people. All were
unconscious, unable to feed themselves. Hard to know if they had any
awareness. From an outside perspective they, and my father included,
were lost. Some had been there for years, probably weren’t ever going to
come out of it. We were lucky, my father survived, after a month, and
had seven more years to live.
</p>
<p>
I visited him every day, and got to know the flow of the hospital.
Workers came in and out of the room to attend to these comatose people.
Imagine the kind of support they needed just to keep their bodies
functioning and not wasting away for lack of movement. I thought these
people must have the worst jobs imaginable, imagining myself in their
shoes.
</p>
<p>
I got to know them, asked about what else they do, how they got here,
where they live, etc. Somehow I got up the courage to ask one of them if
they liked their job, imagining I’d get a New Yorker comment like “You
know, it’s a living.” But what I heard was a complete surprise. “It’s
the best job in the world,” he said, because I can see so clearly how my
work helps real people. He was looking right at me. It hit me, this man
is doing what I can’t do, what my father’s parents, who were long gone,
couldn’t do. <i>Caring.</i> Caring for my dad. Then I got it.
</p>
<p>
Back to Nick, who was and still is, and probably always will be doing
things to help other people, no matter what he does.
</p>
<p>
He was canned in one of the DOGE purges this spring.
</p>
<p>
Now you tell me whether the “Trump base” deserved a chance you wouldn’t
let us have with Biden? Why journalism felt entitled to make this
decision for all of us? When are you going to get the idea that you’re
supposed to help us. Do the right thing. I get so angry at journalism
for getting in the way. Once informed of the facts, it was their job to
get out of the way and let us, the voters, make the decision.
</p>
<p>
