to tell the truth. Your reputation gets destroyed by their lies if you

<h2 id="harris-makes-me-proud">Harris makes me proud</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I am so impressed with how well the new Democratic Party is running this
campaign. Latest innovation, they’re going to do at least one public
rally during the convention, so everyone can be part of the celebration,
and I plan to watch every minute of it. What I don’t want to witness is
what the journalists try to provoke. I’ve been to two DNCs and later
heard what they were talking about on CNN, and my god they invented
crises that simply didn’t exist. Who’s going to have time to call them
out because no one at the convention is watching TV.
</p>
<p>
I heard on a podcast yesterday that it’s weird that Harris is polling as
well as the
<a href="https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2021/11/23/the-generic-ballot-what-to-know-why-its-so-important">generic</a>
Democrat, which they felt was odd because she’s not a white man, which
made me think that in 2024, she is the face of the Democratic Party.
Obama and Hillary Clinton knocked down those barriers, and now it would
feel strange if the candidate at the top of the ticket were not
interracial and female.
</p>
<p>
I’m proud that my country has nominated such an attractive group of
talented people with such fierce competence and humility. For these
moments I wish I had a new graphic to put in the margin to symbolize the
United States. We’re strong, and we win, and when we don’t we get back
up and fight. Uncle Sam is a great symbol. But we’ve yet to create the
interracial and female version that symbol.
</p>
<p>
One more thing, there are a lot of white male voters to be courted and
welcomed back into the fold. Trump has had the advantage there, but it
doesn’t have to be that way. A hand reached out in brotherhood could
turn this election into the kind of landslide we need to cleanse our
political system its flirtation with fascism.

<h1 id="2024-08-14-web-applications">
2024-08-14 Web applications
</h1>
<p>
For my own peace of mind, I have resolved to no longer think of websites
as “websites”. Instead, there are <em>web documents</em> and <em>web
applications</em>. I find it easier to accept to use a browser like
Firefox like a virtual computer for web applications. Many of the
websites these days are in fact web applications.
</p>
<p>
There’s no point in railing against web applications. I like to write
web applications! And I use many of them myself, too. Things like
<a href="Face_Generator">Face Generator</a>, <a href="Text_Mapper">Text
Mapper</a> or <a href="Hex_Describe">Hex Describe</a> are impossible to
do as documents. In an emergency, you could have a form that then
generates a PDF to download, maybe? But is that really preferable? I
don’t think so.
</p>
<p>
And don’t get me started on writing native graphical user-interface
applications. It takes so much energy to get it right. It gives me a
headache. I tried. Take a look at
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/gridmapper-local.git/">Gridmapper
with Common Lisp and SDL2</a>, if you want. Compare it with regular
<a href="Gridmapper">Gridmapper</a>. Is that really preferable? I don’t
think so.
</p>
<p>
And the reverse is also not cool. I wrote a text user interface tool to
generate maps, which can then be downloaded as SVG files. Give
<a href="Hex_Populate">Hex Populate</a> a try, it works over SSH. Is
that really preferable? I don’t think so.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried Gemtext for a long time. I was very much into
<a href="Gemini">Gemini</a>. But these days I no longer think it’s the
answer. It’s like a piece of performance art: the doing of it is a
statement. People who step into it are confounded, their beliefs
challenged. It’s good art! It’s interesting technology. But it’s not a
replacement for <em>web applications</em>. It’s not even a good format
for <em>web documents</em>! I want inline emphasis – bold, italics, code
– and accessible tables with captions and cell navigation, and
row-spans, and column-spans. I tried writing code that translated
Wikipedia tables into ASCII tables to be used as pre-formatted text in
Gemtext. It’s hard to do well with the sizing of columns, the line
wrapping in cells, the limited space available in a terminal, and when
you’ve solved all of that, it’s still hell for people with bad eye-sight
or cognitive problems trying to understand what they’re seeing. It’s
terrible. You could of course do away with all tables. But is that
really preferable? I don’t think so.
</p>
<p>
And so… there’s that bifurcation in the road. For this site, for most of
the pages that I think of as <em>web documents</em>, I write (or
generate) HTML that doesn’t require fonts or scripts. If one uses
browsers such as eww, links2, w3m, lynx or dillo, it should just work. I
wasn’t going to convert the corporate web, anyway.
</p>
<p>
I still serve my site as Gemini and Gopher. But I do it as a political
statement, as a piece of performance art.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I swallow my pride and

<h2 id="ezra-klein-and-nate-silver">Ezra Klein and Nate Silver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I had another morning of driving around so I listened to a bunch of
podcasts about how the campaign is going, all good news for Democrats
which of course makes me happy. The last podcast I listened to was
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-nate-silver.html">Ezra
Klein’s interview with Nate Silver</a>. I only listened to the first 20
minutes because I ran out of time. I may pick it up later on my
afternoon walk (it’s a gorgeous day in the mountains).
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/13/trafficUptight.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">They
talked about their bond as old school bloggers. I didn’t know either of
them when they were starting out, which is kind of sad – most of the
bloggers I heard from in that period were mad at me the way they are mad
at Elon Musk now. Both Silver and Klein campaigned for Biden to step
aside, which I felt it was inappropriate – for Silver who was/is a
trusted polling analyst, and Klein who is a columnist for the NYT. I had
already listened to Klein’s interview with Nancy Pelosi. But I really
don’t like that both of them crossed a line I felt they had no business
crossing, becoming an advocate rather than a journalist. I can’t thikn
about either of them without thinking about that. But I listened anyway,
because I’m interested in both, and esp the combination.
</p>
<p>
The discussion was interesting and even agreeable until Klein asked
Silver about his relationship with Peter Thiel. I had read that Silver
was connected to Thiel in some way. Before they moved on neither
commented on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape">Thiel’s
funding</a> of the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that destroyed Gawker. I don’t
know how they can both, for their careers, which depend on free speech,
still have a kind word for Thiel. I never liked Gawker, they made fun of
me, and others, in horrific ways, that weren’t even based on facts, the
kind of bullshit pre-teens make up about people when they can’t think of
anything else to say. Even though they hurt me, embarrassed me, aroused
my hate, even if I had the kind of money Thiel has, I never in a million
years would use that money to destroy them.
</p>
<p>
Thiel’s wealth is a weapon aimed at all our freedom. This is something
imho that has to at least be <i>mentioned</i> when a journalist talks
about Thiel, and neither of them did. I guess they feel safe from
Thiel’s attacks, perhaps because they have adjusted their writing so as
to never risk offending him, which totally undermines their integrity,
if so. A good way to prove that’s not true would be to never mention him
without saying his behavior the Hulk Hogan vs Gawker was reprehensible.
</p>
<p>
I still listened, even though they provoked my ire in a very fundamental
way. I’d be interested in hearing from them, as a fellow old school
blogger, if they justify Thiel’s funding of the Hogan lawsuit and if so,
how. But I expect that both of them consider themselves in an elite
class and wouldn’t deign to explain themselves, or the truth is
something they don’t want disclosed. Either way, to be blogger-blunt,
they both suck.
</p>
<p>
Update: I listened to more of the interview. I think these guys need to
get out more. The reason Harris is having such a strong response is that
we the voters are desperate to not have another term for Trump. We
understand the stakes in the election. You always try to reduce it to
numbers, when the facts are available at a more human level. The reason
we love Kamala is born of desperation. Stop talking to each other, you
already know why we care, because underneath it all <i>you</i> care
because you’re human and you come from America too. And btw about VCs, I
know a lot about them, I’m assuming at some point Klein will leave the
NYT to make millions with Thiel, and I imagine Silver is already doing
that, but you both have the disease. You assume great money makes people
interesting. It can make them dangerous.

on the ancient-manuscript scholars who are applying their techniques to
the Voynich Manuscript.
</p>
<p>
No one has been able to understand the writing yet, but there are some
new understandings:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Davis presented her findings at the medieval-studies conference and
<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/56/article/754633/pdf">published them
in 2020</a> in the journal <i>Manuscript Studies</i>. She had hardly
solved the Voynich, but she’d opened it to new kinds of investigation.
If five scribes had come together to write it, the manuscript was
probably the work of a community, rather than of a single deranged mind
or con artist. Why the community used its own language, or code, remains
a mystery. Whether it was a cloister of alchemists, or mad monks, or a
group like the medieval Béguines—a secluded order of Christian
women—required more study. But the marks of frequent use signaled that
the manuscript served some routine, perhaps daily function…

<h1 id="2024-08-11-serving-bare-git-on-the-web">
2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web
</h1>
<p>
In the old days, I used <code>cgit</code> to render my git repositories
on the web. It’s simple to set up since it’s a CGI script. This is ideal
for URLs that get very few hits. When nobody is requesting the URL, the
CGI script isn’t running and no resources are being used. When a URL is
requested, however, the CGI script loads, the interpreter loads, the
libraries load, the script executes… It’s an expensive end-point! And
you know how it is. The web is full of leeches and bad bots, crawlers
and idiots. Having an expensive end-point means it needs protection.
</p>
<p>
For I while I thought that <code>legit</code> was the answer. It was
nice and fast and all that. But recently, <code>git clone</code> no
longer worked. It calls <code>git upload-pack</code> as an intermediate
workaround for
<a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/1062">#1062</a>. This
was failing for some reason, however. I tinkered with it for a while but
didn’t get anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Then I started thinking about
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a>’s post on
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos">hosting git
repos</a>. I made some changes to my Apache config and now <code>git
clone</code> works again.
</p>
<p>
The key is that you need a <code>post-update</code> hook that calls
<code>git update-server-info</code>. Each git repository already comes
with a <code>post-update.sample</code> hook containing the necessary
code, so I needed to loop over all the bare repositories I had and
rename the example hook.
</p>
<p>
Using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>for d in *.git
    sudo -u git mv $d/hooks/post-update.sample $d/hooks/post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Sadly, this is not good enough.
</p>
<p>
In order to generate an <code>index.html</code> file for every
repository, I need a hook that regenerates it. If you know how to
determine whether regeneration can be skipped, I’d love to hear how to
that.
</p>
<p>
This hook also updates or adds the <code>AddDescription</code> lines I
need.
</p>
<p>
I prepared a hook that I wanted to install in every repository and saved
it as <code>~/post-update</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is what it looks like, using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

git update-server-info

# create index.html
set branch (git branch --show-current)
set template (cat /home/git/.readme.html | string collect)
set title (basename (pwd))
set body (git show $branch:README.md | cmark --to html | string collect)
printf &quot;$template&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &quot;$body&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &gt; index.html

# update description
set description (cat description)
sed --in-place=~ --expression &quot;/ $title/d&quot; /home/git/.htaccess
printf &quot;AddDescription \&quot;$description\&quot; $title\n&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/git/.htaccess
</code></pre>
<p>
(I need the title twice, once for the title and once for the reminder on
how to clone.)
</p>
<p>
I turn Markdown into HTML using <code>cmark</code>. Common Mark is the
closest we have to a standard, I guess.
</p>
<p>
The template <code>/home/git/.readme.html</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;format-detection&quot; content=&quot;telephone=no&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
html { max-width: 70ch; padding: 1ch; margin: auto; }
body { hyphens: auto; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://src.alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
%s&lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/%s&lt;/mark&gt;
      &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
So now I needed to distribute the <code>post-update</code> hook to every
repository and run it once. I wrote yet another Fish script,
<code>~/recreate-index</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for d in /home/git/*.git
    echo $d
    cd $d
    cp ~/post-update hooks/
    chown git:git hooks/post-update
    chmod 775 hooks/post-update
    sudo -u git git hook run post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m currently hosting 95 repositories according to <code>ls -d
/home/git/*.git | wc -l</code>. Some of these don’t have a
<code>README.md</code> file. Should I ever touch them again, I’ll have
to investigate.
</p>
<p>
Now, for the Apache web server – I changed my site to the following:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin alex@alexschroeder.ch
    ServerName src.alexschroeder.ch
    Include conf-enabled/blocklist.conf
    SSLEngine on
    DocumentRoot /home/git
   &lt;Directory /home/git&gt;
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>/home/git</code> directory has an <code>.htaccess</code> file
that starts out containing the following:
</p>
<pre><code>HeaderName .top.html
IndexOptions SuppressIcon SuppressSize FancyIndexing HTMLTable IgnoreCase
IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
IndexHeadInsert &quot;&lt;meta name=\&quot;viewport\&quot; content=\&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\&quot;&gt;&quot;
IndexOptions Charset=UTF-8
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>.top.html</code> file contains a fragment to add to the top of
the index:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body { max-width: 80ch }
table { overflow-x: auto }
td { padding: 0.5ex 1em 0 0; white-space: nowrap }
td:nth-child(3) { white-space: wrap }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hello!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm Alex Schroeder.
  These are my source code repositories. You can find out more about me on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. There, you'll also find a page
  listing ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As for the git repositories, you should be able to clone them as they are.
  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmu.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For more about this setup, see
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos&quot;&gt;How to host git repos&lt;/a&gt;

<strong>2024-08-12</strong>. I wondered about links from the README to
local files. Right now, linking to images and files hosted in the same
repository doesn’t work since they don’t exist in the raw repository.
The question then becomes, as far as I am concerned, whether this README
is supposed to speak to developers or end-users? If it is for
developers, then pictures, screenshots, PDF files and all of that don’t
need to be linked from the repository. If you are interested in these
things, do a <code>git clone –depth 1</code> and investigate locally.
</p>
<p>
If the repository is for the end users, however, things are harder. The
<code>post-update</code> hook should extract all the local files linked
to from the README. Something like the following, perhaps:
</p>
<pre><code>for file in (printf &quot;%s\n&quot; $body | /home/oddmu/oddmu links - | egrep -v '^(https?:|mailto:|/)')
    set dir (dirname $file)
    if test ! -d $dir
        mkdir -p $dir
    end
    echo $file; sudo -u git git show $branch:$file &gt; $file
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses <a href="oddmu">oddmu</a> to extract the links from a Markdown
file, creates the necessary directories and checks out the files.
</p>
<p>
But if the files are no longer linked from the README, they are not
deleted. If a directory is linked from the README (I have done this!
🤦), the checkout won’t work.
</p>
<p>
I think the better way forward is to move this information elsewhere.
The README is not the documentation.
</p>
<p>
And with that, I think I did it! Serving git repositories from static
files. A single directory per project containing the bare git data and a
single <code>index.html</code> file. No more gazillion end points for
crawlers to lose themselves.

<p>When Google tells you it’s easy to convert a site to HTTPS they’re
wrong. It’s an insurmountable job for scripting.com. 30 years of writing
is on that domain, lots of different runtimes on lots of different

All that breaks when you flip the switch. I can’t walk away from a big

<p>date: 2024-08-12, updated: 2024-08-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>

Interesting paper:
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13843">Generative AI Misuse: A
Taxonomy of Tactics and Insights from Real-World Data</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Generative, multimodal artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers
transformative potential across industries, but its misuse poses
significant risks. Prior research has shed light on the potential of
advanced AI systems to be exploited for malicious purposes. However, we
still lack a concrete understanding of how GenAI models are specifically
exploited or abused in practice, including the tactics employed to
inflict harm. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of GenAI misuse
tactics, informed by existing academic literature and a qualitative
analysis of approximately 200 observed incidents of misuse reported
between January 2023 and March 2024. Through this analysis, we
illuminate key and novel patterns in misuse during this time period,
including potential motivations, strategies, and how attackers leverage
and abuse system capabilities across modalities (e.g. image, text,
audio, video) in the wild…

My sister just got back from two months in Europe and returned bearing
gifts, including this adorable onesie for our baby in utero that I just
had to share 😅 I couldn’t help but quip, “Ah, a country I’ve never been
to!” (in good humour – it’s super cute, I was very appreciative!) but
seriously, I guess I do have some Irish heritage, and therefore, so does
our baby, so it still works. It’s a gorgeous onesie in any case 😂

<p>Idea for a neat product from Automattic or really anyone: Configure
WordPress for writing a book, hook it up to an AI service that can
always turn that site into prose, reorganized into chapters, however
you’d like, on demand, in an instant. You could use an outliner to
arrange the table of contents and it could automatically generate a back
of the book index. Technologically I think today’s AI is ready to do
this, just needs to be packaged. Charge a fair price for the service,
esp at the beginning it would totally be worth it. Who knows where it
would lead. I bet a lot of writers would use it, I certainly would.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_13_Pro">iPhone 13 Pro</a>
and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6">Pixel 6 Pro</a>.
The latter is my main phone, and I prefer it to the Apple phone, not
sure why, it’s what I use for most things. I need the iPhone because I
use an Apple Watch. Lately there’s been some trouble with the screen on
the Pixel 6, on certain gestures, the right edge lights up in bright
green and then immediately returns to normal. I’m thinking the display
may be about to fail? It might be time for a new phone. So I went to the
Pixel site to see what they have that’s new and found that they’re
announcing a new phone, the
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ac8f1461-9923-43da-87b9-b951ff2f32b2">Pixel
9</a>, on Tuesday. So I immediately, of course, dropped the idea of
buying an upgrade today, why not wait till the new version is out. I
looked over the teaser, guessing that AI figures big in this release.
Not sure how I feel about that because the last thing I want to do is
switch over to Google’s AI from my beloved ChatGPT. Kind of the same
thing I see happening with Threads re Twitter.</p>
