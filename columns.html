<blockquote>
<p>
A malware campaign uses the unusual method of locking users in their
browser’s kiosk mode to annoy them into entering their Google
credentials, which are then stolen by information-stealing malware.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the malware “locks” the user’s browser on Google’s login
page with no obvious way to close the window, as the malware also blocks
the “ESC” and “F11” keyboard keys. The goal is to frustrate the user
enough that they enter and save their Google credentials in the browser
to “unlock” the computer.
</p>
<p>
Once credentials are saved, the StealC information-stealing malware
steals them from the credential store and sends them back to the
attacker…

<h2 id="a-hello-world-for-bluesky">A Hello World for Bluesky?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First, a couple of examples/case studies.
</p>
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>About ten years ago I was trying to figure out how to get started
with Node.js. I knew a little JavaScript, but nothing I read about Node
made it click. It’s server software, so there must be a way to write an
HTTP server? From there, I read all the details about the power it has,
but what I needed was a Hello World script.
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22">Brent
Simmons</a> gave me the script, and step by step
<a href="https://inessential.com/2013/12/09/getting_started_with_web_services_using_.html">instructions</a>
on how to write it.
</p>
<p>
I followed his steps, and it worked, and of course I wrote a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/01/29/imBecomingANodejsDeveloper.html">blog
post</a> about it. That was the key I needed that unlocked what Node is,
and helped me see what I could do with it. The first thing I did was
factor out some of the bits so I could make it even simpler and then I
built. I just wanted a few lines of code that created a server and
responded to requests. All I needed was a Hello World to get me going.
</p>
<p>
Now Brent knew that I knew the basics of HTTP servers, we both worked
together on a huge app that had as a small part of it a full HTTP
server, thanks to
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wes+felter%22">Wes
Felter</a> who wrote it, no one asked him to, one day he showed up with
a server that ran in
<a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. I was ecstatic.
That’s the key. If you have something that isn’t truly new, that might
have some analogies in other worlds, if you want people in those other
worlds to know how to get started, give them the beginning. The first
step.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Another example. How I learned to create and edit a website. It was
1994. I loved the web the way I love ChatGPT today. I knew how to use
it, but I didn’t know how to make it. Everyone told me it was really
simple and they sent me links to all the docs, but they made no sense,
because they talked about things I didn’t understand. What I really
needed was a way to make a web page that was as simple as the one Brent
provided for Node-based HTTP servers, with tools and concepts I knew how
to use. I found one, a service provided by
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howIDoNewThings.html">Ohio
State University</a>. You emailed a message to them and they put it “on
the web” and sent you back a link to the page. Click the link and
there’s what you typed. I tried <i>Hello World</i> and got back a link
to a page that said Hello World. So I tried something more complicated,
I did a view source of Hotwired.com’s home page, and copy and pasted it
into an email. That worked too (with broken images because the urls were
relative).
</p>
<p>
Everything I’ve ever learned how to do required me to first understand
it at this level.
</p>
<p>
Okay here we are in 2024, and I want to understand what Bluesky is. I
know how to use it, but I don’t know how to <i>make</i> it. But I would
be surprised if it is any more complicated that writing a web content
management system that uses feeds, something I’ve done many times. I
know the components of a message, have iterated over it for the last
thirty years. I even wrote the spec that defines them in RSS 2.0. We’re
all doing the same thing over and over and Bluesky is no different. I
hear there’s some nice design for the protocol, but right now I don’t
care. I want my Hello World. The minimal code I need to add a node to
the network defined by Bluesky and I want to see what it can do with the
same kind of aha moment I had with the web. I want it to work when I try
it, and I want it to reveal what Bluesky is beyond what I can see from
using it. I want to begin to understand the opportunities for interop.
</p>
<p>
Why do I ask? For one, I’m a student of this stuff, and I want to
understand. But I also am very active in this area, and
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop">interop
is my product</a> (really read that piece, I mean it, and I think it’s
Bluesky’s product too). I’m into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">working
together</a> – it happens so infrequently. So here I’m also trying to
show not just you how to explain what you do for a curious but
time-limited developer, but I want to make this a this.how document that
explains how to do it for everyone, hoping that we as an art and
industry start explaining ourselves better to each other, because we
absolutely need to do this much better imho, ymmv, mmlm, etc.
</p>
<p>
To summarize – assume I know how the web works. I’ve worked with the
structures and protocols for systems that are very much like Bluesky.
Don’t try to explain the design of the protocol, just use it to solve a
problem that I will understand because I use the product and I have
developed lots of stuff like it. It should be possible to show us, to
teach us, what your product does.
</p>
<p>
PS: It could take a few days to put a Hello World together. Because once
you do the first iteration, you may think of a more direct way to
illustrate the idea, and you should do it, iterate until it works, until
you can’t make it any simpler.
</p>
<p>
PPS: And if you don’t want to do it, that’s okay too. I just thought it
was worth the effort to explain what’s needed to foster a greater
understanding of what you’re doing and what the opportunities for
interop are.

no doctor would treat you for a serious illness until you got a court
order saying it was due to rape, incest or the life of the mother.
Judges with the power of life and death. In some states with the death
penalty judges have the power to sentence people to death, but not for
having a well-accepted medical procedure. But that’s the situation women
with a troubled pregnancy are in, if they live in the wrong state. From
the patient’s point of view, I have a slight inkling about what this is
like because twice in my life I’ve needed health care to save me from
imminent death. The health care system never hesitated to help. But what
if they had said “we can’t admit you until a judge rules that we can.”
In the new USA, abortion is like a pardon, something only the government
can grant. Forget about juries of our peers. It raises so many
questions. If a woman is about to miscarry are they even allowed to
admit her to the hospital, or does she have to wait until she is
actually dying? If you can check her in, what are the limits of the
treatment they can provide? Aspirin? Blood? Oxygen? Surgery? And btw,
medicine has advanced a <i>lot</i> since before Roe v Wade. Whatever
practices they had for avoiding abortion can’t apply now. This is the
kind of thing no society should change the way we changed it as an edict
handed down by judges who are subject to corruption. We are learning
about a serious flaw in our system of government.</p>

Pager Attacks and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, updated: 2024-09-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Israel’s brazen attacks on Hezbollah last week, in which hundreds of
pagers and two-way radios exploded and killed at least 37 people,
graphically illustrated a threat that cybersecurity experts have been
warning about for years: Our international supply chains for
computerized equipment leave us vulnerable. And we have no good means to
defend ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Though the deadly operations were stunning, none of the elements used to
carry them out were particularly new. The tactics employed by Israel,
which has neither confirmed nor denied any role, to hijack an
international supply chain and embed plastic explosives in Hezbollah
devices have been used for years. What’s new is that Israel put them
together in such a devastating and extravagantly public fashion,
bringing into stark relief what the future of great power competition
will look like—in peacetime, wartime and the ever expanding …

Dewayne Hendricks, my friend of nearly four decades, passed away last
Friday at age 74. His
<a href="https://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/140305-slides.pdf">mentors</a>
were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster
Fuller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran">Paul
Baran</a>. He was a pioneer of wireless Internet connectivity, a serial
entrepreneur, curator of an influential e-mail list, and for the last 30
years on the organizing committee of the
<a href="https://amw.org">Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop</a>.<br />
<br /> For someone of his remarkable achievements he has left very
little impression on the Web. An example is his
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewayne-hendricks-b118">Linkedin
profile</a>. Below the fold I collect the pieces of his story that I
know or have been able to find from his other friends. If I can find
more I will update this post. Please feel free to add information in the
comments.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3>
Wayne State University
</h3>
Dewayne was a student at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_State_University">Wayne
State</a>, where he got into systems programming for the IBM 370. They
ran the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan
Terminal System</a> on a 512K 370/155. He tried to run the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle_upon_Tyne">University
of Newcastle</a>’s CMTS, an experimental version of MTS that didn’t use
dynamic address translation, and ran into performance problems. He
worked with Larry Chace at the University of Illinois to get it running
on their 1+2M 360/75. After Chace rewrote it to swap pages to their 2301
drum storage it ran well.<br />
<h3>
Southern Illinois University
</h3>
While at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Illinois_University">Southern
Illinois Univerity</a> in the ’70s he worked for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster
Fuller</a> and continued his involvement in IBM systems programming, now
for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)">VM/370</a>.
Melinda Varian, historian of that era of IBM’s groundbreaking
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)">SHARE</a> user
group, wrote in
<a href="https://www.leeandmelindavarian.com/Melinda/25paper.pdf"><i>VM
and the VM Community: Past, Present, and Future</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Dewayne Hendricks reported at SHARE XLII, in March, 1974, that he had
successfully implemented MVT-CP handshaking for page faulting, so that
when MVT running under VM took a page fault, CP would allow MVT to
dispatch another task while CP brought in the page. At the following
SHARE, Dewayne did a presentation on further modifications, including
support for SIOF and a memory-mapped job queue. With these changes, his
system would allow multi-tasking guests actually to multi-task when
running in a virtual machine. Significantly, his modifications were
available on the Waterloo Tape.<br /> <br /> Dewayne became the chairman
of the Operating Systems Committee of the SHARE VM Project. Under his
guidance, the Committee prepared several detailed requirements for
improvements to allow guest systems to perform better. At SHARE XLV, in
1975, the Committee presented IBM with a White Paper entitled Operating
Systems Under VM/370, which discussed the performance problems of guests
under VM and the solutions that customers had found for these problems.
Many of the solutions that Dewayne and others had found, such as PAGEX,
made their way into VM fairly quickly, apparently as the result of
customers’ persistence in documenting them. By SHARE 49, Dewayne was
able to state that, “It is now generally understood that either MFT or
MVT can run under VM/370 with relative batch throughput greater than 1.”
That is to say, they had both been made to run significantly faster
under VM than on the bare hardware. Dewayne and others did similar work
to improve the performance of DOS under VM.

<h3>
Amateur Radio
</h3>
Dewayne was a major figure in developing and sustaining the use of
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">amateur packet
radio</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He has been involved with radio since receiving his amateur radio
operator’s license as a teen. He currently holds official positions in
several national non-profit amateur radio organizations and is a
director of the Wireless Communications Alliance, an industry group
representing manufacturers in the unlicensed radio industry.
</blockquote>
In
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">particular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Back in 1986, he ported the popular KA9Q Internet Protocol package to
the Macintosh, allowing the Macintosh platform to be used in packet
radio networks. Today, thousands of amateur radio operators worldwide
use the NET/Mac system he developed to participate in the global packet
radio Internet. This system continues to be developed and deployed by
the amateur radio service.
</blockquote>
Dewayne was a member of the
<a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/who-we-are/">Amateur Radio Digital
Communications Grants Evaluation Team</a> from 2021 to his death. ARDC
grants around <a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/">$5M/year</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
ARDC makes grants to projects and organizations that are experimenting
with new ways to advance both amateur radio and digital communication
science. Experimentation by amateur radio operators has benefited
society in many ways, including the development of the mobile phone and
wireless internet technology. ARDC envisions a world where all such
technology is available through open source hardware and software, and
where anyone has the ability to innovate upon it. To see examples of the
types of grants we make, go to

<h3>
Tetherless Access
</h3>
One of the many ahead-of-their-time companies Dewayne started was
Tetherless Access. He co-founded it with Charlie Brown in 1990 to
develop wireless Metropolitan Access Networks. It went public in 1996 on
NASDAQ and folded two years later. The idea was to use the 900MHz
unlicensed spectrum to distribute Internet connectivity from a base
station via point-to-point links, in contrast to Metricom’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Ricochet</a>
service, started by Dewayne’s mentor Paul Baran, which four years later
used mesh network technology in the same spectrum.<br /> <br />

<h3>
NSF Projects
</h3>
Dewayne was involved in a number of NSF funded experiments in using
wireless to
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">connect remote
communities</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior to forming Dandin Group, he was the General Manager of the
Wireless Business Unit for Com21, Inc. He joined Com21 following an
opportunity to participate as the Co-Principal Investigator in the
National Science Foundation’s Wireless Field Tests for Education
project. The project sucessfully connected remote educational
institutions to the Internet. The test sites ranged from rural primary
schools in Colorado, USA to a University in Ulaan Bataar, Mongolia.
</blockquote>
Com21 was founded by Dewayne’s mentor Paul Baran.<br /> <br />

<blockquote>
Tetherless Access was one of the first companies to develop and deploy

Amara Angelica reported that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000307045638/http://www.techweek.com/articles/8-23-99/wireless.htm"><i>Tonga
first to go wireless for telecommunications</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“We’re replacing the entire existing telecom infrastructure with a
wireless IP [Internet protocol] network,” says Dewayne Hendricks, CEO of
Fremont-based Dandin Group and former general manager of Com21’s
wireless business unit. “Since the country is a monarchy, there was only
one guy to convince, Crown Prince Tupouto’a, and then we just went for
it.”<br /> <br /> Hendricks’ firm plans to replace Tonga Telecom’s aging
landline system—which still uses mechanical relays—with a broadband
wireless network for data, video and telephony (using voice over IP). It
will run at 30Mbps with user access at 2Mbps and 10Mbps by the end of
next year. “We can get all the spectrum we want,” Hendricks says.<br />
<br /> The prince’s objective, Hendricks says, is to convert the
country’s largely agricultural workforce, which has an astonishing 95
percent literacy rate, into knowledge workers, such as programmers. The
government launched the Royal School of Science for Distance Learning
last year, using Internet connections to allow students to take courses
at international universities. There are just fewer than 100,000 people
in Tonga scattered across 170 islands.<br /> <br /> “We’re going to an
Internet-style mesh network,” says Hendricks. MMDS, which some carriers
are using to deliver broadband services, won’t scale well for an IP
network, he says. Hendricks, a technical advisor to the FCC on
ultrawideband (UWB) technology, is considering UWB for the network.
</blockquote>
<a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">Tonga had</a> about 11,000
households and 6,500 phone customers, with an 8-year wait to get a
phone. The goals of the project were to deliver 30Mbit/s IP to each home
for a customer end budget of $450.<br /> <br />
<h3>
FCC Technological Advisory Council
</h3>
Dewayne was one of the inaugural members of the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000818002106/http://www.fcc.gov/oet/tac/members.html">Federal
Communications Commission’s Technological Advisory Council</a>, launched

Wired Article
</h3>
In the January 2002 edition of <i>Wired</i>, Brent Hurtig’s
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/"><i>Digital
Cowboy</i></a> focused on Dewayne’s work on the reservation:<br />
<blockquote>
At Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation in North Dakota, he’s installing
a wireless network. In its initial form, the system will meet FCC
requirements governing frequency, power, and transmission technology.
But not for long. Hendricks’ mission is to build the best system
possible - even if it’s illegal - and he intends to use every tool at
his disposal. Should the FCC crack down, the tribal leaders will hoist
the flag of Native American sovereignty, asserting that they can do
whatever they want with the sky above their reservation.
</blockquote>
Dewayne’s work on the reservation, in Tonga and elsewhere was an attempt
to demonstrate the problems with the obsolete US
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">spectrum allocation
policy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s no sensible reason why Americans shouldn’t have inexpensive,
ubiquitous, high-performance broadband access, Hendricks says. Using
technologies that are already available or in fast-track development,
everyone could enjoy reliable, fully symmetrical wireless at T1 speed or
better. No more digital divide. No more last-mile problem. No more
compromises. The only things standing in the way are the FCC, Congress,
and “other people who just don’t get it.”
</blockquote>
<h3>
EE380 Talks
</h3>
Dewayne gave three talks to Stanford’s EE380 symposium. The first one
was apparently “in the ’90s on wireless MANs” of which I have so far
found no record.<br /> <br /> The second was on 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2000
entitled
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/000503.html"><i>Wiring
Tonga: From the Ground Up and the Sky Down</i></a>. The abstract
was:<br />
<blockquote>
One of the biggest barriers today standing in the way of deployment of
advanced wireless communications systems turns out not to be the
technology, but restrictions related to regulatory policies. This
presentation will discuss the nature of these barriers and how they have
affected the development of wireless data systems over the years.<br />
<br /> The speaker will also discuss on-going work in which he is
involved to use advanced wireless technology to deploy multiservice IP
systems as part of infrastructure-development projects in the Kingdom of
Tonga and with Native American groups in the US, and how such projects
are able to deal with the limitations imposed by conventional regulatory
barriers.
</blockquote>
The slides are <a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">here</a>.<br />
<br /> The third was on 5<sup>th</sup> March 2014 and entitled
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/140305.html"><i>Inventing

<blockquote>
From a future historical perspective, are we descendants of Icarus? Is

<li>
Massive dotcom data stalker economy built on mining of terabytes
personal data.

<li>
Ubiquitous criminal penetration of financial and identity networks, on
our devices, in the cloud.

<li>
Pervasive state intruders at all levels and every encrypted hardware and

Humans eventually conquered the barriers to flight and learned to build
durable and resilient aircraft. Similarly, humans must learn to build a
more reliable, private and secure Internet for communications,
innovation and commerce. We will share our thoughts on how we might go
about the design of a more durable and resilient Internet:<br />
<ul>
<li>
How prepared is the Internet for future human benefit?
</li>
<li>
What are the attributes of a future more durable internet?

What are the existing assets that could be harnessed?

<li>
What needs to be developed?

<h3>
dewayne-net
</h3>
For many years Dewayne with impeccable taste curated dewayne-net, an
e-mail list to which he sent links, most he found but some contributed
by his friends. A typical e-mail would have the title of the linked
post, a link, and enough of the content to encourage recipients to read
the whole thing. The last e-mails were two on 19<sup>th</sup> August, as
it happens both links that I had sent him earlier. I have been one of
the more frequent contributors, although only perhaps 20% of my
contributions passed the curatorial filter. Prof. Dave Farber’s
<a href="https://ip.topicbox.com/groups/ip">IP list</a> is a similar and
I believe even longer-standing list; he and Dewayne exchanged links
fairly often.<br /> <br /> As an example of the list in full flow, lets
take April 2022. That month he sent 66 e-mails, many about the COVID
pandemic and the war in Ukraine, obviously both top of mind at the time.
But they included topics including satellite tracking of commercial
aircraft, the Kessler syndrome, the problems of the US patent system,
cybercrime, microplastics, banned math textbooks in Florida, and Elon
Musk’s purchase of Twitter. I am already greatly missing this window
into Dewayne’s eclectic set of interests.<br /> <br />

case was lost. I expected at that point they’d apologize and refund the
money. That was a week ago. Just got an email saying want me to return
the case when it arrives. It’s never going to arrive. Luckily this is a
cheap product, just $38. If it had happened with the $1300 phone, that
would be a pretty big problem. It’s amazing that a company the size and
age of Google doesn’t have a procedure for dealing with products that
are lost (or more likely stolen) in transit. I’ve been through this with
Amazon, they knew what to do, because UPS does lose packages, esp ones
that look like they have phones in them. Anyway I have a fairly large
credit with Google. I don’t dare use it to purchase anything else, given
how incompetent they are at dealing with fairly common customer
problems.</p>

in San Diego, I attended Scripps and lectured on cot death for three
months as a guest. Scripps at the time was involved with IBM in
developing a line-of-sight optical network, which worked brilliantly on
campus. It was confined to a couple of experimental computer labs, but
you had to keep your fingers off the mouse or keyboard, or your machine
would overload with web pages if browsing. I believe it never made it
into the world of computers for ordinary users, as the machines of the
day could not keep up.</span>

until I learned of <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/">Ubuntu MATE</a>.
The University had a pre-release copy of Ubuntu MATE 14.10, along with a
podcast from Alan Pope and Martin Wimpress, and before I could turn
around I had it on my Asus. It was simple, everything worked, and it

in 2015, my wife became very unwell after a shopping trip. Getting in
touch with some medical friends, they were concerned she’d had a heart
attack. This was near the mark: she had contracted a virus which had
destroyed a third of her heart muscle. It took her a few years to die,
and a miserable time it was for her and for us both. After the funeral,
I had rented out my house and bought a Toyota motorhome, and I began
traveling around the country. I ran my Asus through a solar panel hooked
up to an inverter, a system which worked well and kept the beast
going.</span>

looked at my battered old faithful, my many-times-rebuilt Asus, and
decided the time had come. I started building. Maximum RAM and video

Bluetooth chipsets, sound cards, etc. Then, I got it sent to New
Zealand, as I was due back the next day.</span>

next Metabox was described as a Windows 10 machine, but I knew that it
would run Tux beautifully – and so it did. A few tweaks around the ACPI
subsystem and it computed away merrily, with not a BSOD in sight. A
friend of mine who had popped in for a visit was so impressed with it
that he ordered one too, and that arrived about three months later. A
quick wipe of the hard drive (thank you, Gparted!), both these machines
are still running happily, with not a cloud on the horizon.</span>

wife was running Windows 11 and had already blown it up once, needing a
full reset (which, to my surprise, worked), I proceeded to charge it for
the recommended 24 hours, and next day, switched it on. “Hello” it said,
in big white letters, and then the nonsense began… a torrent of unwanted
software proceeded to fill up one of my 8TB NVMe drives, culminating
after many reboots with a Chatbot, an AI “assistant”, and something
called “Co-pilot”. </span>

the “Bike Angels” System for Moving Bikeshares</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
I always like a good hack. And
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/citi-bike-scam-nyc.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">this
story</a> delivers. Basically, the New York City bikeshare program has a
system to reward people who move bicycles from full stations to empty
ones. By deliberately moving bikes to create artificial problems, and
exploiting exactly how the system calculates rewards, some people are
making a lot of money.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At 10 a.m. on a Tuesday last month, seven Bike Angels descended on the
docking station at Broadway and 53rd Street, across from the Ed Sullivan
Theater. Each rider used his own special blue key -­- a reward from Citi
Bike—­ to unlock a bike. He rode it one block east, to Seventh Avenue. He
docked, ran back to Broadway, unlocked another bike and made the trip
again…

BTW, to be clear, I have no interest in working on twitter-like systems.
</p>
<p>
It’s been like a prison to writers, we’re stuck with this huge divide,
with crap on both sides.
</p>
<p>
These things exist, they have a jumble of APIs and ways to integrate.
</p>
<p>
And we’ve been playing by the rules laid down by Twitter (ev, biz and
jack) for 18 freaking years. That’s enough.

<p>
This will never get sorted out until people realize it needs sorting
out.

This is the second week of our holidays. We stayed in Zürich and decided
to live as if we’re on a trip: hikes, runs, activities (today:
cycling!), restaurants, museums or concerts. I told myself that we can
spend the hotel budget on cultural events and train rides and suddenly
everything seems possible where until now I would have hesitated. Is it
really worth that much money? But since we’re not paying for the hotel …
I convinced myself that it’s OK.

<p>Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting “both
sides,” how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens
specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course
individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he
<i>doesn’t</i> threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very
revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for
you all to get in sync with the actual American history that’s being
made.</p>

line of code, a call to <i>new Date ()</i> in JavaScript, that was
behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The
