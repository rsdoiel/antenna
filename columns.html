<h2 id="webdav-no-more">2024-09-08 WebDAV no more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-10, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-09-08-webdav-no-more">
2024-09-08 WebDAV no more
</h1>
<p>
I must have implemented <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a> two
or three times in the last decade or two. Just now I used
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_dav.html">mod_dav
for Apache</a> to enable WebDAV for some directories.
</p>
<p>
In theory, it’s great. You can treat the web server as a file server,
connecting to it and using your regular file manager and text editor,
using your favourite shell to do things. And if your website already
uses permissions to restrict access to some locations, you can use the
same config files to handle the making of changes.
</p>
<p>
In practice, however, the operating systems all have such brittle
implementations that none of the solutions I had in production ever
worked well. It doesn’t matter whether it’s Windows’ File Explorer,
macOS’ Finder, the Gnome virtual file system via Nautilus or something
else. The only thing that works is the command-line client
<a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>. It’s the best.
It works. Sooner or later, however, I realize that cadaver is probably
not the tool I can expect non-technical people to use. It has the same
user-interface as the old ftp command-line client.
</p>
<p>
I wonder what the issue is. WebDAV is 25 years old. It seems to me that
something about the process or the spec must have set it up for failure.
Perhaps it was a complex protocol?
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2518">RFC 2518</a> for
WebDAV is from February 1999,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> for
HTTP/1.1 is from June 1999. Perhaps the move from HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1
too away all the thunder. There was the DotCom craze and Web 2.0 and
what not. Nobody had time for WebDAV? Nobody had a business model for
WebDAV? People used FTP and SSH and all that for remote file access,
there was no point doing it using web technology? Or perhaps there
wasn’t just one library to rule them all and in the darkness bind them?
</p>
<p>
In any case, I think I need to write this down so I don’t fall for it
again in two years. I’ve been falling for it since 2005. Every wiki of
mine gets WebDAV support … Looking at my blog it seems that
<a href="2021-10-18_WebDAV_is_tricky">the last time</a> I spent five
days to get this right. This time around I’m just tired.
</p>
<p>
Time to disable <code>mod_dav</code> again.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23WebDAV">#WebDAV</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-10</strong>. Another option would be an explicit list of
endorsed clients like
<a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>,
<a href="http://rei.to/carotdav_en.html">CarotDAV</a>,
<a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>,
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/DAV">hDAV</a>,
<a href="https://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a>, … But I have only used
<code>cadaver</code> myself.

They went from the worst team ever to World Champions in record time.

back then to get from Flushing to the Bronx to go to school, and in the
Bronx, when the Mets won, everyone was smiling. If you’ve ever been to
NYC you know how unusual that is. And in the Bronx, which is of course
where the always-hated Yankees were HQ’d. Ed Kranepool

<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Are the Apple announcements like great reunions for people who have been
going to these things regularly for 20+ years? If so, I can see the
value in it.
</p>
<p>
I went to a reunion at Berkman,
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/08/222335.html">after 20
years</a>, and it was great, made me wonder why we didn’t do it every
year for the last 20. When you get a group of people together who do
great things in a special moment, you should see them from time to time.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">But
I have a feeling there’s a lot of turnover at the Apple events. In any
case, I stopped going to them somewhere in the mid-90s, or more
accurately they stopped inviting me. Yeah I was disruptive, but only in
comparison to how well-behaved the other journos were (at that time I
was writing for Wired).
</p>
<p>
The press was in awe of Apple and other Valley companies. I enjoyed that
for a very brief period when my company went public after I had a hit
Mac product. Then I became something of a pariah, because I
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">started blogging</a> and believe
me the icons of the Valley for the most part <i>did not like it.</i>
They were accustomed to fawning attention and rewritten press releases.
But because I was an insider, I had an idea where the bodies might be
buried, and I wrote about it.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Woz</a> liked it.
I was popular at the parties, I guess.
</p>
<p>
BTW, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Roizen">Heidi
Roizen</a> once observed that I took a date to an Apple announcement
(the one where Steve came back). There weren’t many people there, maybe
20 or 25.
</p>
<p>
Jeff Jarvis wrote in the foreword to his
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-We-Weave-Internet-Misanthropes/dp/1541604121">upcoming
book</a> that I’m like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig">Zelig</a> of tech. This is
what he meant, imho. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
We’re coming up on the 30th anniversary of my blog, one month from
tomorrow. You won’t hear anyone from tech applauding, and you probably
won’t hear anything from the old bloggers. But I have something special
in mind myself. Hopefully it’ll come together in the next month, or
sooner. :-)
</p>
<p>
Let’s go back to 1994, by looking to the future. You won’t need an
invite, btw. It’ll open to everyone.

Threatens to Force Companies to Break Encryption</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, updated: 2024-09-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In 2018, Australia passed the Assistance and Access Act, which—among
other things—gave the government the
<a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/australias-assistance-and-access-act">power</a>
to force companies to break their own encryption.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Assistance and Access Act includes key components that outline
investigatory powers between government and industry. These components
include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Technical Assistance Requests (TARs): TARs are voluntary requests for
assistance accessing encrypted data from law enforcement to teleco and
technology companies. Companies are not legally obligated to comply with
a TAR but law enforcement sends requests to solicit cooperation. …
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="peering-in-the-social-web">Peering in the social web</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A very practical issue.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l3njg5jhft2k">BlueSky</a>
has a 300 character limit, which is less than the other services I
cross-post to, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mastodon: 500 (using mastodon.social as benchmark)
</li>
<li>
Threads: 500
</li>
<li>
Twitter: 10000 (assume paying the montly fee)
</li>
<li>
RSS: no specific limit
</li>
<li>
WordPress: no specific limit
</li>
<li>
BlueSky: 300
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This will be a problem when we eventually get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering">peering</a> working
cross-network among twitter-like systems.
</p>
<p>
It looks to me, just eyeballing this list, that 500 is a good place to
start, although I don’t think ultimately there should be any specific
limits.
</p>
<p>
We saw that clearly when RSS 0.91 was the most recent version, there
were limits in the Netscape doc, but they were ignored by content
sources, which is why I took them out in the 0.92 and 2.0 versions.
</p>
<p>
Peering is simpler than federation. It would enable people to send
messages across these boundaries, but wouldn’t handle the engagement
features, likes, replies, forwarding. It’s what many people are starting
to do now, by hand. There’s no way to put it off, imho – the Bluesky
limit is already hard to deal with.
