<p>While there are several areas where Apple maintained consistent
excellence in 2024, I can’t think of a single area where Apple levelled
up. Not one. That feels like a problem.</p>

<h2 id="i-bought-some-tea">2025-02-07 I bought some tea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-02-07-i-bought-some-tea">
2025-02-07 I bought some tea
</h1>
<p>
I buy tea about once a year. I also buy a lot of coffee but I have never
compared the two. Probably a mistake. At one point I weighed the coffee
beans for my Mokka pot and got 17g. I make two of these per day. That’s
about 12.5kg per year and probably costs CHF 250.- per year, plus coffee
in coffee houses and restaurants.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, taking pictures of the labels with my phone, relying on the
optical character recognition so I can copy and paste this into
<a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de"><span
class="citation" data-cites="babelcarp">@babelcarp</span></a>’s
<a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/">Babel Carp</a>, “a
Chinese Tea Lexicon”, and reading the entriss is how I also spend extra
time with the tea.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ye Lai Xiang (50g / CHF 41.50),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E5%87%A4%E5%87%B0%E5%8D%95%E4%B8%9B&amp;define=1">凤凰单丛</a>,
Phoenix Single Bush, descended from Shuixian trees growing in
Fenghuanshan, i.e., the Phoenix Mountains in Chao An, called 夜来香 or
Nocturnal Fragrance, maybe due to roasting over lychee wood (although
last time I bought it wasn’t nearly as strong as I remembered I still
want back that lychee fragrance)
</li>
<li>
Ya Shi Xiang Dong Pian (50g / CHF 55.00), another 凤凰单丛, this one
being
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%B8%AD%E5%B1%8E%E9%A6%99%E5%86%AC%E7%89%87&amp;define=1">鸭屎香冬片</a>
or “Smells Like Duck Shit” – this is confusing! – from Taiwan
</li>
<li>
Gang Kou Cha Meer Oolong (100g / CHF 55.00),
<a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%B8%AF%E5%8F%A3%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">港口茶</a>,
harbour tea from Pingtung in Taiwan
</li>
<li>
Jinggu 2016 ( 357g / CHF 180.00),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%99%AE%E6%B4%B1%E7%94%9F%E9%A5%BC%E5%8F%A4%E6%A0%91%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">普洱生饼古树茶</a>,
Pu Er Shen Bing Gu Shu Cha, i.e., raw Pu Er from old trees in 景谷,
Jinggu; this one is the cheapest I could get, being neither from the
east nor west of the Mekong river from from further north; they had
cakes from 2015 up to 2024, all at the same price, and I didn’t know
which ones to pick so I picked an older one – was this a good choice?
</li>
<li>
Jin Jiang Hui Ming (50g / CHF 40.00),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%87%91%E5%A5%96%E6%83%A0%E6%98%8E&amp;define=1">金奖惠明</a>,
green tea grown by the She Zu; it got a gold medal in 1915! 😄 Huiming
is the name of a local temple
</li>
<li>
Tama Ryokucha Hinpyoukai (50g / CHF 35.00),
</li>
<li>
Gen Mai Bancha (125g / CHF 17.50)
</li>
<li>
Hojicha (70g / CHF 13.50)
</li>
<li>
Shincha Yame (100g / CHF 40.00)
</li>
<li>
Sencha Hoshino (50g / CHF 42.50)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some everyday tea like Genmaicha and Hojicha; some Sencha; some green
tea from China, and a Pu Er cake. I am an absolutely clueless buyer of
tea and essentially I just know that my price range goes up to around
CHF 60.-/50g.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, in my hubris I wrote
<a href="2024-10-22-chinese-tea">preparing Chinese tea for
beginners</a>. In a way, I fee like you can’t do this journey all in one
go, so I wrote what I thought was important to me when I got started and
I’m hoping to read more from people further along.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have books or articles to recommend.

The malware in question uses optical character recognition (OCR) to

have been downloaded more than 242,000 times. Kaspersky says: “This is
the first known case of an app infected with OCR spyware being found in

<p>The AI world would have done much better with a president like Biden
than we will with Trump. AI is a very potent tool for surveillance.
Completely changes the game. And if it were just Trump and not Musk we’d
have a chance, but Musk and Thiel fully understand the power, and
probably already have all the code written, they just need the database
records to scan and now they have all of them. Eventually we’ll be
talking about the “peaceful uses of AI” as we do about nuclear tech. But
just saying that will get you punished.</p>

saw a bit on CNN that was like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_scream">Dean Scream</a>, an
extended clip of how awkward Chuck Schumer is at a rally. It was used to
shame a Democrat who was doing a great job of explaining the danger, Sen
Murphy of Connecticut. I switched to basketball in disgust, thinking
these people, CNN, they are
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk">not serious
people</a>. This problem isn’t on the Dems, it’s on all of us, and it
always was. To pin it on the Dems is to say it’s hopeless because right
now they’re just our representatives in Congress and some of our state
governments. We have a big problem and we probably can’t dig out of it,
but if we have any hope at all, orgs like CNN have to stop being such
idiots. Every so often I see a spark of brilliance over there, and then
one of these things happens. What’s more depressing, Trump or CNN? CNN
by a lot. And the NYT and all the rest of the broken media. We are all
in the same boat.</p>

I’ve had nuclear energy on the mind recently — a product of watching
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/"><cite>Oppenheimer</cite></a>,
perhaps, and also the
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c805mjxe2y9o"><abbr class="initialism">UK</abbr>
government’s newfound interest in nuclear power</a> in the interest of
combatting climate change. Apropos of all that, then, I was happy to
appear on
<a href="https://amsecast.libsyn.com/building-the-empire-of-the-sum-with-keith-houston">a
recent episode of AMSEcast</a>, the podcast of the
<a href="https://amse.org/">American Museum of Science and Energy</a> in
Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The episode was hosted by the museum’s director,
the genial Alan Lowe, who was kind enough to let me rabbit on at length
on the subjects of counting, calculators, and computers. I really
enjoyed talking to Alan, and I hope you enjoy listening too!

I think Indie did her first full back-to-front roll and neither Viv nor
I saw it 😭 She was with Viv and he said he put her on a blanket behind
him “just for a minute”, then turned around. Next thing he knew, she was
crying so he turned back around and she was flat on her face! He’s now
arguing that it was an “assisted” roll because “the blanket wasn’t
even”, so we still have the milestone of her first roll on a completely
flat surface with no assists to witness… 😅

<h1 id="2025-02-06-discord-for-role-playing-games">
2025-02-06 Discord for role-playing games
</h1>
<p>
Discord really works well for my gaming. I even pay them. 😬 And as far
as finding new players goes: essentially there are some generic servers,
some servers for particular games or publishers, and for your tables. So
you “look for games” in the first two category of servers and then you
send interested parties an invite to the server for your table(s).
</p>
<p>
It’s a bit weird but it works for me.
</p>
<p>
I don’t use Discord as a chat or forum in the first two kinds of
servers. Way too many people and crazy amount of text flying by! But on
those small gaming table server? 🥰
</p>
<p>
I just look the other way when they ask me about my activities shat they
can share what music I listen to and what games I play. No way!
</p>
<p>
One thing that Discord does better than IRC is help handle the dizzying
amount of channels per server (i.e. per publisher, rule set or gaming
table); their specific rules; their independent admins; their roles;
their selective visibility: channels for certain roles only, for certain
people only, group chat (ephemeral private channels); their local bots
and automations; media uploads; muting for channels and servers, for
certain time periods only or until you reverse your decision. All of
this is great.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you can self-host an IRC server and a web frontend like The Lounge
(which I do) and you can get close: many channels, but all are equal:
there is no formal grouping, no independent moderation, no independent
roles, no independent bots. It’s all one big soup. And if you add some
rules via nickserv and chanserv, it might get you all the way but is
still quite arcane. What a difference Discord makes. Plus effortless
voice chat. 🥰
</p>
<p>
Yes, voice chat and video chat, on top of all that.
</p>
<p>
Now, you might think: what a shill! But really: I self-host the
inferior-but-free options. I write my bot to connect to both (!) IRC and
Discord and free content from the black void that is the endless Discord
archives. But I also want things to just work. My time is more precious
than the €10 (?) I spend every month. And I had to take down Jitsi
because it was too resource intensive. The alternative would have been
to upgrade my lousy server and spend more time sysadminning and I don’t
want to.
</p>
<p>
So self-hosted IRC has voice and video only if I leech Jitsi from
somebody else, as far as I am concerned.
</p>
<p>
So I don’t know where to go from here. I just pay them for the service.
And I look the other way when they disallow other clients. 😓
</p>
<p>
But then again: I used Bitlbee for a long time. I even wrote a plugin
that lets you connect to your fedi instance as if it was an IRC server
and another kind soul wrote a plugin that does the same for Discord. And
then you start to realize how unusable this is. I’m on maybe two dozen
servers? My account has access to 200+ channels, all of the active, all
of them need some sort of mapping to IRC channels? It’s hell.
Notifications were out of control. I stopped doing it. So: is Discord
shit, or the IRC clients? I don’t know. But I know that Discord is not
all bad. It’s definitely not bad as an idea of how to organize a
gazillion people.
</p>
<p>
But I do look the other way when I think about tracking and AI training
and data brokering.🖕I don’t even know if they do it but these are the
days of zero trust and fucking corpo greed maggot CEOs so it doesn’t
really matter what they do specifically because I don’t trust any
company to do the right thing. Maybe I’d trust them if they were a
non-profit association.
</p>
<p>
Anyway. Just putting this out there because with Discord I’m playing
three or four times a week and I only don’t play more because I do want
to get out every now and then. 😆

Reminder to all feminists

<p>
If you accept trans people being defined by their reproductive role…<br>
Then men can define all woman by their reproductive role
</p>
<p>
If you accept that trans teenagers are too young to make decisions about
their bodies…<br> Then men can decide teenage girls are too young to
make decisions about their bodies
</p>
<p>
If you accept medical gatekeeping of trans people’s access to
hormones…<br> Then doctors can restrict any woman’s access to HRT and
birth control
</p>
<p>
If you accept stripping trans people of legal protections…<br> Then men
can strip women of legal protections
</p>
<p>
This is the truth of “trans rights are human rights”.<br> Regardless of
your personal feelings on whether trans people are “really” the gender
they say they are, the exact same human rights protecting us also
underlie women’s liberation– bodily autonomy, dignity, equality of
opportunity, and protection from harm.<br> And so many men are desperate
for those rights to disappear.

Do 1000 profiles of federal workers being attacked by Musk.
</p>
<p>
Don’t use real names. Have AI provide real-looking photos of fictitious
people. Explain what they do. Don’t focus on their lives. Make readers
think of what life will be like without them.
</p>
<p>
We should have done this a long time ago, when Reagan said, arrogantly,
the government is the problem.
</p>
<p>
That should have been rebutted, strongly and regularly.
</p>
<p>
We need to learn what they actually do, all of them, at least understand
what we’re going to live without.
</p>
<p>
I asked ChatGPT to try it out. “I want to tell a story about a typical
person who works for the US government. It shouldn’t be a glamorous job,
but an important one. It should improve people’s lives, health,
happiness, fulfillment. Pick the role at random, as well as gender, age,
race, geography. Write a 100 word job description, and provide a
realistic looking profile picture. Nothing about their personal life, or
actual name, but it’s okay to talk about the required education and
experience for the job.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s what it came back with: “An Environmental Health Officer (EHO)
plays a crucial role in safeguarding public health by identifying and
mitigating environmental hazards. Employed by federal agencies such as
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EHOs conduct inspections of
facilities like restaurants, swimming pools, and nursing homes to ensure
compliance with health regulations. They investigate complaints related
to air and water quality, noise, and waste management, and implement
measures to prevent disease outbreaks. A bachelor’s degree in
environmental health or a related field is typically required, with many
positions preferring candidates with a master’s degree. Professional
certification, such as Registered Environmental Health Specialist
(REHS), is often preferred. Strong analytical skills, attention to
detail, and the ability to communicate effectively are essential for
success in this role.”

Regulation of cryptocurrencies was an issue in last November’s US
election. Molly White documented the immense sums the industry devoted
to electing a
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-70/">crypto-friendly
Congress</a>, and converting Trump’s skepticism into enthusiasm. They
had two goals, pumping the price and avoiding any regulation that would
hamper them ripping off the suckers.<br /> <br /> Back in November of
2022 I added an entry to this blog’s list of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/impossibilities.html"><i>Impossibilities</i></a>
for
<a href="https://datafinnovation.medium.com/the-compliance-innovation-trade-off-72b9f8026f56"><i>The
Compliance-Innovation Trade-off</i></a> from the team at ChainArgos. It
started:<br />
<blockquote>
<i>tl;dr: DeFi cannot be permissionless, allow arbitrary innovation and
comply with any meaningful regulations. You can only choose two of those
properties. If you accept a limited form of innovation you can have
two-and-a-half of them.</i><br /> <br /> Fundamental results in logic
and computer science impose a trade-off on any permissionless system’s
ability to both permit innovation and achieve compliance with
non-trivial regulations. This result depends only on long-settled
concepts and the assumption a financial system must provide a logically
consistent view of payments and balances to users.<br /> <br /> This is
a semi-technical treatment, with more formal work proceeding elsewhere.
</blockquote>
Two years later, the “more formal work” has finally been published in a
peer-reviewed Nature Publishing journal,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/"><i>Scientific Reports</i></a>,
which claims to be the 5<sup>th</sup> most cited journal in the world.
Jonathan Reiter tells me that, although the publishing process took two
years, it did make the result better.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I
discuss
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-84612-9"><i>Tradeoffs
in automated financial regulation of decentralized finance due to limits
on mutable turing machines</i></a> by Ben Charoenwong, Robert M. Kirby
&amp; Jonathan Reiter.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br />
This team were pioneers in applying fundamental computer science
theorems to blockchain-based systems, starting in April 2022 with
<a href="https://datafinnovation.medium.com/the-consequences-of-scalable-blockchains-8c4d23c6af4d"><i>The
Consequences of Scalable Blockchains</i></a> in which they showed that
implementing an Ethereum-like system whose performance in all cases is
guaranteed to be faster than any single node in the network is
equivalent to solving the great unsolved problem in the theory of
computation, nicknamed P vs. NP. And thus that if it were implemented,
the same technique could break all current cryptography, including that
underlying Ethereum.<br /> <br /> But, I believe, they were not the
first. That appears to have been Tjaden Hess, River Keefer, and Emin Gün
Sirer in
<a href="https://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/28/ethereum-soft-fork-dos-vector/"><i>Ethereum’s
DAO Wars Soft Fork is a Potential DoS Vector</i></a> (28<sup>th</sup>
June 2016), which applied the
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting
problem</a>” to “smart contracts” when analyzing possible defenses
against DOS attacks on a “soft fork” of Ethereum proposed in response to
“The DAO”.<br /> <br /> Charoenwong <i>et al</i>’s abstract
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We examine which decentralized finance architectures enable meaningful
regulation by combining financial and computational theory. We show via
deduction that a decentralized and permissionless Turing-complete system
cannot provably comply with regulations concerning anti-money
laundering, know-your-client obligations, some securities restrictions
and forms of exchange control. Any system that claims to follow
regulations must choose either a form of permission or a
less-than-Turing-complete update facility. Compliant decentralized
systems can be constructed only by compromising on the richness of
permissible changes. Regulatory authorities must accept new tradeoffs
that limit their enforcement powers if they want to approve
permissionless platforms formally. Our analysis demonstrates that the
fundamental constraints of computation theory have direct implications
for financial regulation. By mapping regulatory requirements onto
computational models, we characterize which types of automated
compliance are achievable and which are provably impossible. This
framework allows us to move beyond traditional debates about regulatory
effectiveness to establish concrete boundaries for automated
enforcement.
</blockquote>
They summarize the fundamental problem for the automation of
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">DeFi
regulation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
DeFi features some computationally challenging properties: (1)
Turing-complete programming, (2) permissionless access to both transact
and publish code and (3) selectively immutable code. The permissionless
mutability of the system combined with the Turing completeness motivates
our inquiry. A system running Turing-complete code where updates can be
published permissionlessly cannot make any guarantees about its future
behavior, a conclusion from early work on Universal Turing Machines
(UTM).
</blockquote>
Despite this, they show that if it is possible to enforce
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">less-than-Turing-complete
programming</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it is possible to construct both (1) classes of algorithms that can make
credible promises and (2) restricted update mechanisms that enable
credible promises. In other words, DeFi platforms can provide compliant
services like traditional centralized providers through fully automatic
mechanisms.
</blockquote>
What exaxctly do they mean by
“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">compliant</a>”?<br />
<blockquote>
Consider an economy modeled as a Turing Machine, where the machine’s
state corresponds to the state of the real economy. We formalize
compliance as a property of system state transitions that can be
verified mechanically, following Theorem 5.8.5 of Savage. Specifically,
a compliant system is one where no sequence of permitted operations can
result in a state that violates predefined regulatory constraints set by
an external regulator.
</blockquote>
They translate this into
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">economic
terms</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For example, if a regulation prohibits transactions with certain
addresses, compliance means no sequence of permitted operations can
transfer value to those addresses, either directly or indirectly.
Similarly a regulator may impose requirements on intermediaries
transacting in certain assets or products akin to depository receipts
for those assets. Compliance would then require ensuring one does not
unknowingly transact in “products akin to depository receipts” for a
given list of assets.
</blockquote>
Because they model regulated systems in terms of states and the
transitions between them, they can apply
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">results from
compputer science</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This formulation maps to well-known results in computability, such as
the Halting Problem and the more general impossibility known as Rice’s
Theorem: No algorithm exists to determine from the description of a
[Turing Machine] whether or not the language it accepts falls into any
proper subset of the recursively enumerable languages. In other words,
we cannot categorize arbitrary programs into specific subsets
automatically and reliably. In financial regulation, the canonical
“proper subset” is a ban on interacting with a given address:
interactions involving a banned address are forbidden, and the
acceptable subset of states includes no such transfers.
</blockquote>
They proceed to use cryptocurrency “mixers” as an example. They explain
that Rice’s Theorem means that because any general description of
“mixers” defines a “proper subset” of all programs, and thus there is no
automatic or reliable method by which a “smart contract” can be assessed
against the general description.<br /> <br /> Of course, as Justice
Potter Stewart famously said
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">I know
it when I see it</a>”. Human regulators will have no difficulty in
recognizing a “smart contract” as a mixer, if only because in order to
function it needs liquidity. To attract it the “smart contract” needs to
advertise its service. So can the regulators ban interactions with the
specific addresses of the mixers they recognize? Charoenwong <i>et
al</i> make <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">two
arguments</a><br />
<blockquote>
First, this severely limits the regulator’s power from regulating a
mutable set of protocols to only specific ones. In other words, what is
often called “principles-based” regulations (as opposed to rules-based
regulations) are impossible. We cannot ban “mixers” generally – we can
only ban “mixers A, B and C.” In some sense, this is akin to banning
specific means of murder rather than simply banning murder, no matter
the means.
</blockquote>
Then they introduce the time element inherent in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">human
regulation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Second, and more importantly, we cannot enforce even these more
straightforward rules reliably. Consider these steps:<br />
<ol>
<li>
Deploy a new, confusingly-coded, “mixer” labeled X
</li>
<li>
Send funds to the mixer X
</li>
<li>
Withdraw from the mixer X and feed into the mixer A
</li>
<li>
Withdraw from the mixer A and feed into the mixer X
</li>
<li>
Withdraw from the mixer X and spend freely
</li>
</ol>
This procedure works because we cannot identify arbitrary mixers, so we
are free to deploy and then use them before they get put on the banned
list. As a result, the regulator cannot even ban all interaction with
enumerated mixers – it can only reliably ban some forms of interaction.
This result is a severe limit on regulatory power.<br /> <br /> If we
consider that compliance exists in an automated form, operating on
publicly available data in real-time, anyone accepting that final
transfer must operate in a compliant fashion. If, instead, the plan is
to decide these things later based on non-mechanical analysis, we are
simply operating a conventional legal system with some more computers
involved. Concretely, if that last transfer can be ruled illegal after
the fact, it was never an automated financial system.
</blockquote>
This result generalizes to services other than mixers. Rice’s Theorem
means it isn’t possible to ban a class of services, and banning
individual services identified by humans will always be behind the
curve.<br /> <br /> The authors illustrate the application of their
result with real-world examples of
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">regulatory
failure</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
These case studies-The DAO, Beanstalk Finance, Compound, Terra/LUNA, and
MakerDAO-collectively illustrate the practical manifestations of our
paper’s theoretical findings. Each example demonstrates a different
facet of the challenges in implementing reliable, automated compliance
mechanisms in decentralized, Turing- complete systems. From governance
attacks to stablecoin collapses and liquidation issues, these incidents
underscore the impossibility of guaranteeing specific regulatory
outcomes without compromising system flexibility or introducing external
interventions.
</blockquote>
The authors argue that there are two ways to construct a system that
does allow automated regulation, by making it permissioned rather than
permissionless, or by enforcing a non-Turing-complete language for the
“smart contracts”. In practice many cryptocurrencies are permissioned —
in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/04/decentralized-systems-arent.html"><i>Decentralized
Systems Aren’t</i></a> I pointed out that:<br />
<blockquote>
The fact that the coins ranked 3, 6 and 7 by “market cap” don’t even
claim to be decentralized shows that decentralization is irrelevant to
cryptocurrency users.
</blockquote>
There are many examples of cryptocurrency systems that claim to be
decentralized but are actually permissioned. Patrick Tan described one
in
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/binance-built-a-blockchain-except-it-didnt-5759224ba7aa"><i>Binance
Built a Blockchain, Except it Didn’t</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For all its claims of promoting decentralization, Binance runs two
“blockchains” that are not just highly centralized, but regularly alter
history, undermining one of the core tenets of the blockchain —
immutability.
</blockquote>
The authors’ example of a
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">non-Turing-complete
language</a> is:<br />
<blockquote>
Consider a scripting language where we cannot have variables. A simple
“splitting the tab” contract might look like:<br />
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNRgz5Wcc3tXJJfFQUQ_9jJ06vS-o0TmbHdKvoPx8SvkaNsqwBBE6o8wpoH2TNeqxoQAbVEQYBQft94zKcBy7HO8DsoVxzJm1-Vk9M5ukqAX8L-e8YeF4P9Zlk25GUb82lLgII5ImDaSnPyTYyYgXkZbVfJTKVE7PDHx6WSevfYhyphenhyphenlNaX9TKNksAX_p4uq/s1292/SplitTheTab.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" data-original-height="392" data-original-width="1292" height="121" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNRgz5Wcc3tXJJfFQUQ_9jJ06vS-o0TmbHdKvoPx8SvkaNsqwBBE6o8wpoH2TNeqxoQAbVEQYBQft94zKcBy7HO8DsoVxzJm1-Vk9M5ukqAX8L-e8YeF4P9Zlk25GUb82lLgII5ImDaSnPyTYyYgXkZbVfJTKVE7PDHx6WSevfYhyphenhyphenlNaX9TKNksAX_p4uq/w400-h121/SplitTheTab.png" width="400" /></a>
This is dangerous if we have a regulation that certain addresses cannot
be paid. The issues raised surrounding the DAO hack, discussed above,
apply here. But what if the only way to transfer a token is to call
SendTo and that function looks like:<br />
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEis5GTH5H1GMc41uu95_FzidtecuhCDVSrGfzDFlImPZX5Am8tgq4CT5ibQO6wg-NIlMt4aNhXQM4J70GV1O_dJd498TvSXBrW8xHqPX9J_lo80o2Gn60aSQJL6LB4z6gmf0aCD9gQYskTDlzIUKcg7bFGepYe2-nL_xnSR1tcdxnXLVA-RU6y8AId0zSYC/s1014/SendTo.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="530" data-original-width="1014" height="167" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEis5GTH5H1GMc41uu95_FzidtecuhCDVSrGfzDFlImPZX5Am8tgq4CT5ibQO6wg-NIlMt4aNhXQM4J70GV1O_dJd498TvSXBrW8xHqPX9J_lo80o2Gn60aSQJL6LB4z6gmf0aCD9gQYskTDlzIUKcg7bFGepYe2-nL_xnSR1tcdxnXLVA-RU6y8AId0zSYC/w320-h167/SendTo.png" width="320" /></a>
There is no issue if a function only calls RealSendTo from SendTo. In
such cases, the regulator’s responsibility is to maintain the
BannedList, and the system is permissioned.
</blockquote>
Their example of a system that is not-Turing-complete is not useful,
because it requires BannedList to be a constant. As they point out, if
the system is to be useful, BannedList must be a variable that is
updated by the regulator, and thus the system is permissioned. It may
well be that, because BannedList is a variable, that the system is
Turing-complete after all. I can’t do the analysis to determine if this
is the case, but it is known that even a small number of variables makes
a system Turing-complete.<br /> <br /> Thus the paper is somewhat
misleading, in the sense that it reads as if regulated systems can be
either permissioned <b>or</b> not-Turing-complete, but it fails to
provide an example of a system that is permissionless and
not-Turing-complete. The example that looks as if it is going to be
not-Turing-complete but permissionless seems to be permissioned
<b>and</b> not-Turing-complete.<br /> <br /> I would argue somewhat
differently:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Charoenwong <i>et al</i> show that a permissionless, Turing-complete
system cannot be regulated.
</li>
<li>
In the real world no-one is going to cripple their system by making it
not-Turing-complete.
</li>
<li>
Even if a not-Turing-complete system could be built it isn’t clear that
it would be useful.
</li>
<li>
In essence, the regulatory act of enforcing that a system is, and
remains, not-Turing-complete <i>is</i> permissioning the system.
</li>
<li>
Thus in practice permissionless systems cannot be regulated.

Even if it were possible to regulate real-world cryptocurrencies, there
no longer appears to be any political support for doing so. And thus
Michael P. Regan reports on
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-04/a-sunday-night-flash-crash-in-the-most-insane-casino-ever-created"><i>A
Sunday Night Flash Crash in the ‘Most Insane Casino Ever
Created’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a major flash crash in Ether as leveraged positions were liquidated
served as a stark reminder of how digital-asset markets still lack
almost all of the guardrails installed on traditional markets over the
years due to various misadventures that hurt investors. The
second-largest token was down a bit as traditional markets opened for
trading Monday morning in Asia, reacting to concerns about US tariffs
against Canada and Mexico. Then in a matter of minutes its losses
extended to about 27%, before quickly recovering.<br /> …<br /> There’s
no indication that any of that is likely to change anytime soon. So
Sunday night’s price action in Ether – and similar dives in a slew of
other altcoins and memecoins – serves as a reminder that for better or
worse this asset class still exists far outside of the padded walls of
traditional markets, regardless of how much tradfi embraces it.

<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: mrusme blog</p>
<p>“Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital city of
Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The city is built along the shores of Hakata
Bay, and has been a center of international commerce since ancient
times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as
it is the nearest point among Japan’s main islands to the Asian
mainland. Although humans occupied the area since the Jomon period, some
of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka
area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period. Because of
the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great distance from the
social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo),
Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has
persisted to the present.”</p>

<h2 id="the-bots-are-at-it-again">2025-01-23 The bots are at it
again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-23-the-bots-are-at-it-again">
2025-01-23 The bots are at it again
</h1>
<p>
For a while I just appended new graphs and data to
<a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>. This
time around I feel it’s worse. There are so many bots that I can’t even
do the WHOIS lookup any more. Or perhaps I just managed to block so few
that I never realized how many more there were. In any case, now that
I’m speeding things up, there are more bots to block.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback,
no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script
full of firewall commands.</strong>
</p>
<p>
It needs ipset and iptables access:
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.
</p>
<p>
I blocked another 4669 networks.
</p>
<p>
What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access
log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that
it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word,
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a
summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5
requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks
with a single request only.
</p>
<p>
That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient
because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no
individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and
even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn’t help against the
next 85% of requests because they are all unique.
</p>
<p>
Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their
success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little
jousting I’m doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are
turning the web to shit.
</p>
<p>
Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded
all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.
</p>
<p>
Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these
leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger
machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their
scam.
</p>
<p>
I keep shouting “CO₂ for the CO₂ god!” and that’s part of it, yes…
Sadly!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is
unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught.
While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this shit.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this whole generation.
</p>
<p>
Time passes.
</p>
<p>
Let me count how many entries I added today.
</p>
<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>
<p>
I think it’s about time to add some fail2ban code. If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service
provider out there.
</p>
<p>
Right now load is below 4, so that’s not too bad for 2 cores. The sites
are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:
</p>
<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>
<p>
But today:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" />
</p>
<p>
I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server
and didn’t run the script! 😱
</p>
<p>
I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>,
<code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took
care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my
server without the firewall rules.
</p>
<p>
Grrr.
</p>
<p>
They said we’re running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I’m trying to
block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that
there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may
Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the
web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails,
their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses
until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage
they are wreaking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots
and so I looked at the last run. Let’s take the last run:
</p>
<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |
------------------------------:|-----------:|
                       unknown |          4 |
                38.188.60.0/24 |          3 |
                201.46.36.0/22 |          3 |
                45.225.53.0/24 |          2 |
              170.246.119.0/24 |          2 |
               45.178.110.0/23 |          2 |
</code></pre>
<p>
The top hitting network I blocked in the last run had made just
<em>three</em> suspicious requests!
</p>
<p>
There is more info below:
</p>
<pre><code>38.188.60.0/24
38.188.60.92 38.188.60.70 38.188.60.70
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.92 | 24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:11:58:47 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1730419325&amp;rcidonly=profh&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:12:01:02 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=2013-11-08&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.3478.83 Safari/537.36
ipset add banlist 38.188.60.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP
numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
38.188.60.92
</li>
<li>
38.188.60.70
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the
last 3 days for the page “Comments on VimMode”.
</p>
<p>
Let’s check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request
belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?
</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over
24h.
</p>
<p>
The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to
train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it’s a denial of service attack.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages
about making it all persistent:
</p>
<p>
<code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.
</p>
<p>
<code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.
</p>
<p>
<code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>. This file is about 1MB and pretty
much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.
</p>
<p>
And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.
</p>
<p>
You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after
running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on
a reboot.

All I’ll say is that I fear something like Nepenthes will just tie up
too many resources of mine (RAM, file handles, bandwidth). “CO₂ for the
CO₂ god!” But perhaps I’m wrong? I should investigate.

There is no way that something like Nephentes would ever be deployed at
a scale so large that it would create considerable additional emissions.

For now, I keep returning a 410 “Gone” response to self-identified bots
and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the
firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from
fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And
I’m not expiring the bans, unfortunately.

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How
to build Ollama to run LLMs on RISC-V Linux</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;RISC-V is the new entrant into the SBC/low-end desktop space, and as I&#39;m in possession of a HiFive Premier P550 motherboard, I am running it through my usual gauntlet of benchmarks—partly to see how fast it is, and partly to gauge how far along RISC-V support is in general across a wide swath of Linux software.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
From my first tests on the
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/risc-v-business-testing-starfives-visionfive-2-sbc">VisionFive
2 back in 2023</a> to today, RISC-V has seen quite a bit of growth,
fueled by economics, geopolitical wrangling, and developer interest.
</p>
<p>
The P550 uses the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC, and while it doesn’t have a
<em>fast</em> CPU, by modern standards, it is fast enough—and the system
has enough RAM and IO—to run most modern Linux-y things. Including
llama.cpp and Ollama!
</p>
<h2>
Compiling Ollama for RISC-V Linux
</h2>
<p>
I’m running Ubuntu 24.04.1 on my P550 board, and when I try running
Ollama’s simple install script, I get:

week’s Ezra Klein podcast</a>. It made me wonder if any of the readers
of my blog voted for Trump. I can’t imagine too many did, unless they’ve
been willing to overlook my strenuous support for any option that
opposes him. However if any of you are still here, I’d like you to know
that what’s happening now is exactly what we thought <i>would</i>
happen. If you agree that this is unacceptable, maybe we can use that as
common ground to work together to get our country back from the chaotic
authoritarian mess that Elon Musk is turning it into. He makes Trump
look like an absolute moderate. Certainly no one who voted for Trump
with any kind of appreciation for the American system, where your vote
and mine matter, can stand by and not object to what he’s doing to our
system of government. If not now, keep this in mind as Musk’s chaos
becomes more and more real.</p>

<li>
You don’t have to compute gradients to break an AI system.

AI red teaming is not safety benchmarking.

Automation can help cover more of the risk landscape.

The human element of AI red teaming is crucial.

possibly was a bit hasty in
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/04.html#a204729">declaring the
coup over</a> yesterday. I’m sure there will be new restraining orders
from the courts telling Musk to stop, and so far Trump has been obeying
those, so there’s some hope when that happens he’ll order Musk to stop,
and then we’ll find out who the boss is and how our new post-coup
reality works. The shock of Trump’s
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo">plan for
Gaza</a>, announced yesterday may get even the most “loyal” Repubs in
Congress to think again about what hell they hath wrought on they
country they all grew up in. I have some faith that American values are
installed in their personal operating systems, somewhere in there is the
remnant of the ideals of the Constitution. So I might have missed the
mark, I hope I did. Meanwhile I wonder if Musk’s wonderboys have managed
to penetrate the military, and if they’re planning on giving them orders
about how to restrain the anti-Musk protests that are starting to break
out around the country. Oh mama we live in

<p>Shortly after 1:00 this morning, Vittoria Elliott, Dhruv Mehrotra,
Leah Feiger, and Tim Marchman of Wired reported that, according to three
of their sources, “[a] 25-year-old engineer named Marko Elez, who
previously worked for two Elon Musk companies [SpaceX and X], has direct
access to Treasury Department systems responsible for nearly all
payments made by the US government.”</p>

<h2 id="borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">2025-01-31 BorgBackup
for the laptop and the server</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-31-borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">
2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago I mentioned the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-01-27-rsync-sqlite">rsync-based
backup script</a> I use to copy data from the server to the laptop.
</p>
<p>
The backup script that makes backups of my laptop (including the backup
from the server) to external disks is different, however.
</p>
<p>
My actual backup uses external disks. I have two of them. One of them is
always at the office. Every now and then (not often enough!) I make a
backup to the external disk I have at hand and then I carry it to the
office and bring the other one back. That is, the laptop and the two
external disks are never in the same location.
</p>
<p>
The two external disks I use are “known backup disks”. When I plug them
in, BorgBackup immediately starts making a backup. I discussed this
setup <a href="2017-12-24_Borg_Backup">back in 2017</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m just going to repost the stuff and I don’t think there have been any
significant changes.
</p>
<p>
Run commands and create files as root.
</p>
<p>
Either use <code>sudo</code> for every command you run, or use
<code>sudo su</code> once and do everything as root. No matter how you
do it, the danger zone awaits!
</p>
<h2 id="mnt-backup">
<code>/mnt/backup</code>
</h2>
<p>
Create the mount point on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-fstab">
<code>/etc/fstab</code>
</h2>
<p>
Any disk labeled “Backup” will be mounted as <code>/mnt/backup</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show 0 0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-40-backup-rules">
<code>/etc/backups/40-backup.rules</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/40-backup.rules \
      /etc/udev/rules.d/40-backup.rules
</code></pre>
<p>
The file content:
</p>
<pre><code>ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;bdi&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;/devices/virtual/bdi/*&quot;, TAG+=&quot;systemd&quot;, ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}=&quot;automatic-backup.service&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This makes sure that the service <code>automatic-backup</code> starts
whenever an external disk gets plugged into the laptop.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-automatic-backup-service">
<code>/etc/backups/automatic-backup.service</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/automatic-backup.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/automatic-backup.service
</code></pre>
<p>
The service does nothing except start the <code>run.sh</code> shell
script.
</p>
<pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/backups/run.sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-backup-disks">
<code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
</h2>
<p>
The <code>run.sh</code> below runs for every external disk plugged in.
It’s important to only make backups to known backup disks, however.
</p>
<p>
The known backup disks are identified by their <code>uuid</code> in the
<code>backup.disks</code> file.
</p>
<p>
To list the disk labels and their <code>uuid</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>lsblk -o+uuid,label
</code></pre>
<p>
Add the <code>uuid</code> to the <code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
file.
</p>
<p>
This is the content of the file identifying my backup disks, for
example:
</p>
<pre><code># generate using: lsblk -o+uuid,label
7c478832-5d7f-43d3-9b79-20cfc67fb0e6
bb1c034e-dd21-48e7-a496-1b95685a094d
156cf4df-aa58-421e-b3d0-583fe6fdff4a
</code></pre>
<p>
If you create your copy of the file, your uuids will be different!
</p>
<p>
When you run <code>lsblk -o+uuid,label</code> you’ll also see the device
itself. In my case, that’s <code>/dev/sdb</code>. Create a BorgBackup
repository on the new disk, mount it, create the directory and
initialize the repository.
</p>
<p>
When initializing the repository, you’re asked for a passphrase. You
will need it for the <code>run.sh</code> script.
</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/sdb /mnt/backup
mkdir /mnt/backup/borg-backups
borg init --encryption=repokey --progress /mnt/backup/borg-backups/backup.borg
umount /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<p>
Make sure the disk has the correct label! You can do this from the
command-line but I used
<a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/">Disks</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-run-sh">
<code>/etc/backups/run.sh</code>
</h2>
<p>
Now we’re ready for the actual script. It checks whether a known backup
disk is mounted under <code>/mnt/backup</code> and if so, it creates a
new archive in the repository.
</p>
<p>
Don’t forget to search for <code>BORG_PASSPHRASE</code> and change it to
whatever you used when you ran <code>borg init</code> above!
</p>
<p>
Hide the passphrase from everybody else and to make it executable:
</p>
<pre><code>chmod 0700 run.sh
</code></pre>
<p>
This the content of the shell script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -ue

# The udev rule is not terribly accurate and may trigger our service before
# the kernel has finished probing partitions. Sleep for a bit to ensure
# the kernel is done.
#

<p>
Check the log while the backup is being written:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --follow --unit automatic-backup

<p>
Make sure the backup disk is identified correctly and look at the sizes
of the archives. If they’re too small, check whether the archives
contain the right files!

<strong>2025-02-04</strong>. A reader sent me an email saying: “you may
want to call <code>borg compact</code> after <code>borg prune</code> in
order to actually free up the disk space corresponding to the pruned
archives. Otherwise your backup repo will keep growing in size.”
</p>
<p>
Good point. I think in my case it doesn’t matter because I don’t use the
disk space for anything else (and surely Borg will reuse it). But who
knows. Your situation might be different.

warning. As easily as Musk can turn off government websites, he can turn
off our sites. He could turn off all .com or .org sites. He’ll probably
do it just that way. Only one domain will work in the future, x.com.
Goodbye Google, Amazon, your drug store. Bubye. Not sure if moving your
DNS to Europe or Asia will make a difference. He’s taking advantage of
centralization, and will try to make it more centralized. Totally
centralized. A journalist couldn’t report this, because what proof do I
have? It’s because there’s a pattern here. And it’s pretty obvious the
tools he’s using.</p>

<p>I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment
on Bluesky and found that they have a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22">Suggested
User List</a> that recommended the usual people who get in the way of
telling the story that’s really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my
stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created
influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter,
people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We’re living with
their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely
manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have
to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them
has run its course, don’t you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw
an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika
stickers on Teslas. That’s nice. The reason you can get away with that
is that you’re attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course
<i>publicly owned</i> now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed,
so quickly.</p>

happening in the US is like when a person who is a lifetime smoker gets
cancer and stops smoking. You hope the cancer doesn’t kill you, and
swear to never smoke again if you’re lucky enough to survive it.
</p>
<p>
We didn’t appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of
government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time,
when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start
trying to get their attention, which hasn’t happened yet, it’s going to
be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the
forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt
we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not.
</p>
<p>
The prognosis isn’t good. But we should get our shit together asap
because it’s our only hope.
</p>
<p>
PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own
responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.

2025-02-04 Degrowth
</h1>
<p>
I posted a picture from our living room on fedi and noticed that the
book
<a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/who-is-afraid-of-degrowth">Who is
Afraid of Degrowth</a> by Céline Keller was visible on the coffee table.
And a bit later,
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.nz/@aimee" title="@aimee@mastodon.nz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aimee">@aimee</span></a> shared a link to
the <a href="https://degrowth.net/">International Degrowth Network</a>,
specifically to their values and principles:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of
degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a
sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to
justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide
variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at
once for something to qualify as “degrowth”. –
<a href="https://explore.degrowth.net/degrowth/values-principles/">Values
&amp; Principles: Explore degrowth</a>

<p>
I really like the two lists. Might be useful as a checklist before doing
things. There’s more on the site, of course.

<p>date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting
<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem">analysis</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED
AI Elections Project
(<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html">source</a>
for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political
content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case,
we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating
similar content without AI.
</p>
<p>
We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content
produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em>
AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the
supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify
interventions…

managing accordingly. A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of
the problem and if they’re good, do something brilliant, but misses out
on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely
discipline myself to get anything done, because that’s how I’m built.
Given a chance I will always put my head down and focus on one thing

<p>Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just
do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he’s making
it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would
be if what he was doing wasn’t so blatantly outrageous. We never voted
for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference,
thinks their own vote should count. That’s going to be a massive hurdle
for them to get over.</p>

<p>
This is yet another story of commercial spyware being
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware">used
against</a> journalists and civil society members.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a
possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it
had “high confidence” that the 90 users in question had been targeted
and “possibly compromised.”
</p>
<p>
It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers,
Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp
said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the
alleged attacks…

<p>I’m 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his
software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the
government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your
passport. And if you try to arrest him, he’ll stop paying interest on
the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve
currency of the world. He won’t just control the US government, he will
control the world economy.</p>

I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency.
If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air),
you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less
taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in
people’s pockets, and you’d need less welfare (again, hands), less red
tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.
</p>
<p>
I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the
government should be to absorb inefficiencies.
</p>
<p>
As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at
lowering the costs of goods and services
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and
creating
jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> …
there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly
scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather
than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should
understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas
than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government
helps:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I
sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the
bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know
what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement
plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society,
<a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people
are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn’t nudge
companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even
though
<a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification
is 3× more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its
sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave
too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for “once
in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every year now. The “more
efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect
the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes,
rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We
pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for
insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate
it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption.
And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up
with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably
need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the
time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful
of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law)
that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected
users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance
marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would
be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to
create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank
and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our
country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire
trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for
more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need
and it manifests at a nation-state level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan
and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also
think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the
time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart
go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown
filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking
lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There’s no
way a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains
equals less traffic. We know adding new
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten
million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate
creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is
folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know
what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially.
What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private
schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor
force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school
closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system
exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn
and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups,
and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more
efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and
classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality
goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too.
You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those
numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only
billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes
foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like
curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider…
these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries
power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money
in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead
of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient
question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under
Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically,
our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for
cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and
then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well,
you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a
government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen
overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were
fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war
about it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can
do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die
hard, I guess, because I’m still thinking about efficiency… but from the
opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb
inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and
kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure.
Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems
you need data and transparency.
</p>
<p>
The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game.
It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner
levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those
systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward
them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow
co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips.
Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people
who already have money. Sheesh.

<h1 id="2025-02-02-dungeons-and-wilderness-and-politics">
2025-02-02 Dungeons and Wilderness and Politics
</h1>
<p>
Last year, I wrote that <a href="2024-08-19-rpg-intrigue">I’d like to
see a system for how to run an intrigue as a party</a>. I think the core
of that idea is in this paragraph:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1–3 is for dungeons, 4–6 is for the
wilderness and 7–9 is for politics. Doesn’t that sound fantastic? What
sort of rules would you find in that third book? You would not get to
name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land but by taking over
an existing position of power – through intrigue. Oust the abbot, kick
out the bishop, marry into the baron’s family, take over the guild. With
the help of your friends. Without resorting to combat, but with dice
rolling.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjmurray">Brad J. Murray</a> saw this
and started writing a document, riffing on the idea. He invited me to
collaborate, I wrote some more, but then it didn’t go anywhere. I’m not
sure what to do next. It’s already much better than that vague idea I
had, but it’s not ready to be turned into a 20 page pamphlet. I feel
that it’s getting closer, though.
</p>
<p>
Since we weren’t doing anything with the document, I figured I might as
well post what we have. Perhaps you want to run with it? Make a copy,
make some changes, let us know?
</p>
<p>
Here goes.
</p>
<h2 id="premise">
Premise
</h2>
<p>
Traditional dungeon and/or dragon games progress character in levels:
discrete units of capability. Each is a steady increase in power, almost
entirely in terms of how big a thing you can kill (or how easily you can
kill a smaller thing). This creates a certain kind of play arc that can
become tedious as you realise that narratively the same thing is
happening, it’s just that the fights take longer. At least when it’s
executed weakly, and it is very easy to execute it weakly.
</p>
<p>
Instead of a power scale, levels can be grouped into a thematic
progression where you gain more power but the context in which you
execute the power changes. In order to progress into the next tier, you
must accomplish something that leads naturally into that tier.
</p>
<p>
The tiers are: from levels 1 through 3 you are in dungeons. Small(ish)
set piece events in a structure full of enemies and loot. You acquire
things, you kill things, and maybe you make some alliances within the
dungeon context. The launching point of your dungeon excursions – a
hamlet, a city, or what-have-you may reward you but certainly
appreciates you and also keeps you informed of dungeons that need your
attention.
</p>
<p>
From levels 4 through 6 you are in the wilderness. The enemies are a
little more random and of more widely ranging power. Sometimes you need
to fight but often you need to hide or run. You are trying to get from
safe place to safe place navigating distinctly unsafe places between.
You are acquiring knowledge of multiple communities, places, enemies and
friends.
</p>
<p>
From levels 7 through 9 you are a leader. Your interests are political.
You have gone from wandering between communities and serving them to
attempting to create one or lead an existing one. Your interest is the
well-being and even growth of a community in the context of a world with
many desperate communities surrounded by dangerous wilderness. You will
likely need to hire some dungeoneers and couriers. Pest control and
deadly mail carriage.
</p>
<p>
At level 10 you turn into a patron or nemesis for the players of your
next campaign.
</p>
<p>
Within a tier you become more powerful but in your tier context. In the
wilderness you might become a little better at fighting but mostly you
get better at navigating and hiding and planning. You become a rider of
exotic mounts and become known for your successes. And maybe your
failures. And in your political years you likely don’t get better at
fighting at all but at organizing and communicating and planning and
execution. You learn how to determine who you can trust and who you
can’t.
</p>
<h2 id="level-1-3-the-dungeon-years">
Level 1-3: The Dungeon Years
</h2>
<p>
You will fight things for treasure and, eventually, to serve the needs
of someone else.<br> You will learn fighty things – how to defeat
enemies and locate traps.<br> You will develop a relationship with a
home community.<br> You will learn new tactics, new spells, new powers.
</p>
<h3 id="making-the-home-community">
Making the home community
</h3>
<p>
A handful of non-player characters, representative of surface factions.
They need things from the dungeon. This results in retrieval missions,
rewards, and rumours regarding the mission. Players see the community
leaders they are helping (by selling them their loot) grow in power and
manoeuvre, but likely they don’t care.
</p>
<h3 id="making-a-dungeon">
Making a dungeon
</h3>
<p>
The dungeons contain things that are useful to the patrons in the home
community. The dungeon also has factions and faction leaders, like the
home community, but these factions are there to be exploited by the
players. Ally with these humanoids against these other humanoids or
against the common enemies further down, those nightmare caricatures of
our fellow humans – more cruel, more greedy, more hungry than we are.
The dungeon is the terrible mirror of our fears.
</p>
<p>
(Needs more advice.)
</p>
<h3 id="moving-on">
Moving on
</h3>
<p>
At some point, the need arises to get help from a neighbouring
community. A higher level magic-user is required to break a curse, cure
a disease, reverse a petrification, or raise a dead comrade. This
requires a trip overland and automatically ends the dependence on
dungeon adventures.
</p>
<h2 id="level-4-6-the-wilderness-years">
Level 4-6: The Wilderness Years
</h2>
<p>
You will travel in the service of communities and eventually be sought
for service and advice.<br> You will learn desperate things — how to
avoid danger, how to ambush, and how to survive the environment.<br> You
will make connections with communities.<br> You will learn to act
strategically, where to fight and where to yield, where to go and when
to go.
</p>
<h3 id="making-connected-communities-and-maps">
Making connected communities and maps
</h3>
<p>
Distribute the following on the map:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Powerful people</strong>: Give them names, titles and retainers
including spells and magic items. Some of them must have skills and
spells such that somewhere between level 3 and 4 players need to travel.
Breaking curses over here, curing diseases over there, a sage to
identify a powerful magic item in that other place.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Settlements</strong>: Give them names, a small number of
interesting buildings such as defensive structures and temples, and note
the number of people ready to fight in case of a battle. The coming war
will end wilderness exploration and those numbers will be important.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ruins</strong>: Create more dungeons, big or small. Since
dungeon exploration is no longer the core activity, think of these more
as lairs. Most have just three to five zones that may or may not map to
“rooms” with monsters and treasure. Dragon lairs, giant fortresses,
bandit camps, druid covens, troll caves. The monsters are big and
powerful, with area attacks like dragons, or large damage output, like
giants, with the potential to destroy buildings and settlements, or they
are contagious and hard to kill like undead and lycanthropes, or they
are numerous and nefarious, taking hostages and setting ambushes.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Legendary items</strong>: As a consequence of treasure
allocation for the above, some powerful magic items enter the sandbox
and it’s good to have them on a separate list so that there can be
rumours and quests pointing players towards them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following create three separate, overlapping and contradicting
networks of loyalties, providing for endless conflict and shifting
alliances between powerful people.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Magic schools</strong>: This is where players get to learn
higher level spells from legendary magic users. If you know their names,
you can name their spell books (this is a copy of “Agrimach’s Grimoir of
Necromancy” from back when he was a wandering battle mage) and players
can go and visit them to learn more spells from the same school. Named
spell collections also facilitate writing up spells for other
magic-users since they can be former students with a subset of these
spells.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Secret societies</strong>: Give them names and leaders. For each
settlement figure out if the secret society has a presence and if so,
who the representative is.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Gods &amp; demons and their temples</strong>: Give them names
and themes. For each settlement, figure out if there is a shrine or
temple and if so, who the head priest is.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that monsters show up in multiple guises, here.
</p>
<p>
There are the very dangerous foes living in the ruins mentioned above.
These continue to be based on our nightmares: dragons spreading terror
and devastation, undead sucking the life of the land, or giants making
travel unsafe. The neighbouring communities need the players’ help,
resulting in more wilderness travel. These are opponents that can be
fought by the players, directly.
</p>
<p>
The remaining monsters have societies living in the settlements
mentioned above, just like humans. A few of them live in dystopian
societies that players would like to end: Slavers, brutalisers,
dictatorships. It is important that there are many more neutral
settlements, however. If all the orcs are brutal tribal savages and all
the underground elves are matriarchal slavers, it’s too easy to draw up
conflict along racial lines. It’s better to have one society of brutal
savages looking for plunder and one society of slavers looking for
victims and have the rest be fearful onlookers and “neutral” parties.
Organising them, solving their problems and forging alliances is what
this tier is about.
</p>
<h3 id="community-objectives-and-you">
Community objectives and you
</h3>
<p>
New factions emerge: secret societies, cults, political parties (clans,
families). There are power struggles between them, observable from a
distance (like the political careers of the village non-player
characters). For their struggles, these factions need the help of
players. Invasions have to be fought back, spying missions need to be
carried out, treasure needs to be found (dungeon adventures don’t
necessarily disappear, but the dungeons are far away and dangerous,
necessitating travel through the wilderness.
</p>
<h3 id="wilderness-encounters">
Wilderness encounters
</h3>
<p>
Wilderness encounters do not happen in tiers like encounters in dungeon
levels where deeper means tougher. The wilderness has no centre and no
distance – unless there is a colonialist vision of a borderland and the
non-human world is there for the taking. Like slavery, colonialism can
be a topic to explore, but it’s better to be struggling against it than
to glorify it. If there are slaves, players can free them and fight the
slavers. If there are colonisers, players can stop the land grab and the
massacres.
</p>
<p>
The monsters and lairs no longer reflect the nightmares of our childhood
(monsters that eat us, monsters that take what’s ours, monsters that
live in the darkness). Monsters now reflect the nightmares of our adult
lives. Enemies have strongholds from where they sally out and attack our
communities, disrupting our trade, plundering our villages, capturing
our ships. Pirates and bandits, and monstrous equivalents. Conquering
armies, occupational armies.
</p>
<h3 id="moving-on-1">
Moving on
</h3>
<p>
As the game progresses, things come to a head and the players cannot
fight against hundreds of enemies on their own. Allies have to be found
and it all culminates in a big battle or a series of battles. Mass
combat rules are used. And when it’s over, when there’s a power vacuum,
players are ready to move on and fill it.
</p>
<h2 id="level-7-9-the-political-years">
Level 7-9: The Political Years
</h2>
<p>
You will lead a community to wealth or ruin or maybe a little of
both.<br> You will learn how to navigate the pitfalls of leadership.<br>
You will command armies and governments.<br> You will anchor yourself to
something.<br> You will fade away and make room for those that come
after you.
</p>
<h3 id="making-the-political-landscape">

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Expand on the list of powerful people</strong>: Add family
members. Families add another layer of overlapping and contradicting
loyalties. Now every important person can be connected to a magic
school, a secret society, a temple, and a family.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>A list of jobs</strong>: Every settlement, every important
building, every right to harvest is a resource that results in a job for
somebody, a step on the way up for people.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-your-community">
Making your community
</h3>
<p>
Based on the lower tiers of the game, players have hopefully made
alliances with powerful people and their families. Some ways to make
them part of the community:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Family</strong>: Where as before players are mostly interested
in their names and their abilities, now is the time to learn about their
families. Family is always a mixed bag. Some of them have disturbing
tendencies. How do you handle those without triggering a feud? Some of
them need a better place. Can you take them in and care for them, offer
them an education and a career? Meeting new people also means a chance
for romantic interests. Will you be able to create a family of your
own?<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Housing</strong>: The devastation of war and powerful monsters
leads to refugees that need housing. How do you provide for the raw
materials to build camps and to fortify these? How do you transform
these improvised settlements into regular settlements?<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Building settlements, wells, walls,
cisterns, granaries, towers, strongholds, roads, dams, aqueducts – this
is the new normal. Sometimes the problems here still allow for short
adventures. Road constructions are blocked because of an unnatural
crocodile infestation. No stones are available because the quarry has
been taken over by kobolds worshipping a medusa. Some of the problems
need political resolutions, however: Perhaps the mine stopped working
because revolutionaries incited the workers into revolt and indeed,
their grievances are justified. Time to step in.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tolls and taxes</strong>: Infrastructure takes an immense effort
in gold and manpower. Soldiers need to guard the roads and man the
strongholds. With travel secured, trade brings in revenue. As trade
expands overseas and across mountain passes, securing it becomes more
difficult. Ships have to be built. Soldiers need to be raised and
equipped.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Jobs</strong>: With many people now depending on you, it’s
important to pick the right advisors, the right second-in-commands.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Peace</strong>: At this point, people are exhausted from the
war. They want peace. Even if problems could conceivably be resolved by
going to war, they prefer not to. To solve problems by violent
confrontation is now retrograde and frowned upon.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="threats-to-the-community-you-love">
Threats to the community you love
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Corruption and betrayal</strong>: Whom do you trust? Loyalty is
not a given. People will work for you until you hand them a settlement
to run and they go rogue, allying themselves with stronger neighbours.
People will work for you until you give them a post and then they’ll be
corrupt, asking for bribes and posts for their family. How do you keep
them in check and still get things done? How do you root out traitors
without descending into paranoia and alienating your friends? How do you
handle secret societies and cults?<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>War</strong>: A war is no longer a question of mass combat rules
used at the end of the previous tier. Player characters are usually not
going on military expeditions. A single die roll determines whether
armies win or lose battles, whether they advance or retreat. What
players care about: How much reinforcements does the army need? How long
are the supply lines and consequentially, how much of the reinforcements
wither away before reaching the army? How many more battles will there
be? How many refugees return from the war?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Revolution</strong>: The machinations of economics produce
inequalities. You need rich people to stay in power and yet rich people
are the causes of revolution. Can you ensure an economy that can stand
against your neighbours without sucking your people dry?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Succession</strong>: You and your party rose to power but the
world is complicated and strange. There are those who can handle it, but
they need to learn how to do it – from you. And as they do, you’ll find
yourself more and more obsolete. Will you get the timing right? Will you
raise people to power in times of need? Will you hold the reins until
they are ready? And will you be able to let go when you’re no longer up
to the task?
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="threats-to-the-people-you-love">
Threats to the people you love
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Power</strong>: Can you manage a peaceful transition that
doesn’t end end with most of your family dead?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Education</strong>: Can you raise your children to be the kind
of people they want to be? Can you uplift your society to be the kind of
citizens they want to be?
</li>
</ul>

community faces as well as the people you love, consider the following
checklists to generate political adventures.

<strong>Act 1, the people involved</strong>: Secure the consent of the
parties involved. Does the bride or groom want to go? Does the diplomat
want the job? Why not? Can you sweeten the deal? Does anybody next to
them object – family, rivals? Can you placate them?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 2, controlling public space</strong>: Travelling no longer
means facing monsters but securing adequate lodgings for the entourage.
Is somebody preventing the hosts from fulfilling their obligations? Can
you send agents ahead of the troupe to get this resolved? If not, can
you get it resolved in person without threatening violence?
Alternatively, if you are hosting: Are there people in your community
working against you? How will agents, heralds and advanced parties
react? How do you prevent an escalation?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 3, social dynamics</strong>. Is there a hunt, a feast or a
joust to partake in? Do you recite poetry or sing? Do you have the right
people in your employ to entertain the hosts or guests? What gifts will
you exchange? If there are veiled insults, how will you handle them
without violence?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 4, diplomacy</strong>. Every demand, every offer, every deal
is met with a counter. What do you have in return? How good are you at
negotiating?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 5, the financial aftermath</strong>. When everything is said
and done, check your finances. Did you win or did you lose? Add up the
successes and failures and compare them to the table of financial
consequences. Do you need to borrow gold from merchants and bankers to
pay for all the entertainment, the soldiers, the pageantry? If you have
gold to spare, how will you spend it? Or will you be saving it?

<h4 id="a-protracted-war">

<p>
<strong>Why</strong>: To gain notoriety and glory, to increase your

<h3 id="ending">
Ending
</h3>
<p>
A successful, peaceful transfer of power to the next in line is the
crowning achievement. The monarchist way to win is to found a family,
have children and pass power to them. The republican way to win is to
found an organisation that can sustain itself. The religious way to win
is to steer the institution and its community through these troubled
times and then to live out those last years in peace. Players win when
peace and stability reigns, at least for a few years.
</p>
<p>
The rules for war ensure that losses can be recovered from by betting
more of what you have. Increase the stakes. At first, you send a
second-in-command and some soldiers to take back those villages. Then
you send reinforcements. You build roads to improve the supply lines.
Perhaps there’s a betrayal and you must send your child to take back
control – or you must go yourself. And if you lose then, your life’s
work collapses. Players lose when civil war and ruin follows a long
period of upheavals.

<p>I rewrote the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">oursocialweb.org</a> home page. It
needed to focus on linking. The term web is being thrown around too
casually, without regard to what the web is, the same kind of dilution
that’s happening with podcasting. But the <i>social web</i> idea is
fairly new, and it’s really important that we get this right.</p>

what Musk is doing now, do you think the internet will still be here in
a year? Will there be any tech companies that aren’t wholly owned by
Musk, Inc. Will owning things even mean anything? Or is this the
beginning of the rule of the tech bros, world wide. I can’t imagine what
they’re planning for us. In the meantime, me divesting my Tesla, which
seemed so urgent just 24 hours ago, now seems like a powerless gesture.
I heard it said that now feels like the moment in Covid when you
realized everything was about to freeze, and you’d better head to the
supermarket right now, and when you got there, you found you weren’t
among the first to see it this way. I was very reassured by the blog
post that Krugman did. It’s nice to hear a sane voice out there.</p>

<h2 id="using-rsync-with-sqlite-databases">2025-01-27 Using rsync with
Sqlite databases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-27-using-rsync-with-sqlite-databases">
2025-01-27 Using rsync with Sqlite databases
</h1>
<p>
I use Debian stable so my copy of Sqlite is not the latest and greatest.
At the same time, I don’t use Borg Backup for my server. I use rsync.
</p>
<p>
I copy the content of the important server files to my local laptop and
then I make a backup of my laptop to external disks using Borg Backup.
</p>
<p>
When making copies using rsync, the database must not be in use.
Otherwise, a busy database is probably going to be corrupt when
restoring it from backup.
</p>
<p>
The key is to stop all programs using database files before beginning
the backup and restarting them after the backup. It’s also important to
stop these programs using the monitoring software.
</p>
<p>
I use Monit to monitor the server. If I don’t stop the programs using
Monit, Monit will discover that they are not running and restart them
while rsync is still copying the database file. The GoToSocial database
is 10G so copying it takes a long time. Long enough for Monit to
discover that GoToSocial isn’t running to restart it.
</p>
<p>
The programs using database files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
GoToSocial
</li>
<li>
fail2ban
</li>
<li>
The Lounge
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Watch the log files for messages saying that files changed.
</p>
<p>
This is my script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# sibirocobombus.root is defined in ~/.ssh/config

echo Stopping GoToSocial
ssh sibirocobombus.root monit stop gotosocial
