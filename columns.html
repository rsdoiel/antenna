you read this blog, I hope you’ll take the time to listen to
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html">yesterday’s
podcast</a>. It’s all about WordPress, a product that you won’t read
much about on this blog, going back through the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+wordpress">archive</a>.
I wasn’t paying attention until 2023 when I began to see what an amazing
product it is, not just for 2004 when it came out, but in 2024. My
theory is that it’s the basis for an incredible social web platform,
much better than Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky and of course Twitter.
That’s what I’m talking about for 1/2 hour in this podcast. If you give
me that much time, I’ll change the way you see the world, or at least
the way you see me. I think I’m right about this, with another layer on
top of the WordPress foundation, it becomes newly relevant, and very
timely, in ways that as far as I know, no one has been pushing it. I
think for example that Ghost and Substack should be built on top of
WordPress. The fact that they aren’t gives a clue as to how portable
your work is there, and how much choice you get in editing tools.
Anyway, please make the time to listen. This is pivotal, and I don’t
think I’ll ever be able to spell it out in writing, it’s pure
storytelling. Thanks!</p>

<p>Interesting framing in We’re all (folk) programmers by Spencer Chang:
In contrast to fine art created for aesthetic value, folk art emerges
from cultural significance and needs. Folklore encompasses emergent
practices and traditions, passed down person-to-person within
communities, as opposed to “high culture” which is universal and
prescriptive, passed down through formal education… Folk programming

<p>Just found an exponential memory leak at the database level in
Bingeworthy. I have never seen one of these in all my years of
programming. A data structure that saves a copy of itself in itself. So
every time it saved it became exponentially bigger. Until it made the
SQL server crash because the JSON object it was storying was over the
limit of JSON objects. Crashed the freaking server. Fixed. Feels
good.</p>

thrown us under the bus, again, it’s worth remembering their rollout
strategy was to get us to overlook their past betrayals of users. They
said “We ❤️ Fediverse.” That did it. It was at a moment of fear of
Twitter, now owned by Musk, and a belief in the story of ActivityPub,
that it would create an open social web. Zuck said “we’re on board.” Now
it’s expedient to say to another group that he sees things their way,
and it just so happens to be the very people most people who were
looking to get away from in 2023 when he was loving the Fediverse. Now
we’re doing the same thing with Bluesky. And <i>it’s going to happen
again. </i>There will be a moment when you look back on your “hope for
the best” approach and realize that it didn’t work, and if I’m around I
will remind you again. We have to roll up our sleeves and make an
<i>open social web</i> that can’t be sold out. When you build value for
other people, they will use it for their advantage, leaving you with
nothing. That’s business. There are no companies that are different, not

Good morning. I have been awake since 4:20am, not for any fun reasons,
but because Viv woke me to feed Indie and then he sat there for the next
hour completing a form that had to be done by 9:30am today. I have to do
this form too, but thanks to the genius computer system involved, I was
not allowed to start until Viv had completed his copy. Anyway, at least
Le Pen senior is dead, that’s some good news.

<p>I wish the Ecmascript committee had put more effort into real
soul-saving enhancements like comments in JSON instead of coming up with
contorted ways to do the same old contortions we got used to dealing
with ten years ago. And they could have removed features from the
language instead of piling on more and more random reinventions. End of
editorial, now on with the new Bingeworthy.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-bingeworthy">The new Bingeworthy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Last night while watching a basketball game, checking my iPad, and all
of a sudden new items started appearing in the
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> for
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">the new Bingeworthy</a>.
</p>
<p>
I thought oh geez there’s some kind of bug, last thing I need now, but
quickly realized <i>someone was using it</i> and <i>it was working. </i>
</p>
<p>
There were some final mostly cosmetic things I wanted to deal with
first, and I wanted to fix up the
<a href="https://this.how/bingeworthy/">docs</a>, such as they are, but
I am spread too thin, and had been putting it off. But here was a
reminder, I put all that effort to rebuilding it after the
TwitterPocalypse. <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>
is the app I missed the most that hadn’t been ported off Twitter
identity. So I did the deed, flipped the switch and now you can use it
too.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what you’re getting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I started fresh, with no programs, no users and no ratings. Then I
imported the programs that I had rated, and my ratings for them.
</li>
<li>
The most important features are there, although they don’t necessarily
look that great. I want to do some more work there.
</li>
<li>
The predictive stuff, users most like you and recommendations, have not
been ported, because there are only two users, and we recommend both of
them to you. And all the programs I liked a lot are great, if you
haven’t watched them, you should, right now, stop everything.
</li>
<li>
If you have any questions or problems, I’ve started a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/315">thread</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It uses WordPress for identity. I like this because it’s the same
identity service I’m using for
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, of course, and this
makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or
don’t like for <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>. It
doesn’t mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use
OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews.
All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But
the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting
possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what
we were doing in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> on
the Mac in the 90s.
</p>
<p>
BTW, of course I had ChatGPT do a logo. There’s a slight typo, but
rather than fix it, I left it there as something for attentive fans to
find.

<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
It is time for another roundup of topics in storage that have caught my
eye recently. Below the fold I discuss the possible ending of the HAMR
saga and various developments in archival storage technology.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br />
<h3>
Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording
</h3>
Unless you have been tracking storage technology for many years, it is
hard to appreciate how long the timescales are. My go-to example for
communicating this is Seagate’s development of HAMR.<br /> <br />

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">demonstrated
HAMR in 2002</a>. In 2008 they published this graph, predicting HAMR
would supplant Perpendicular Magnetic Recording (PMR) starting in
2009.<br /> <br /> I first wrote skeptically about projections of HAMR’s
deployment
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2012/12/talk-at-fall-2012-cni.html">twelve
years ago</a>. Seagate had just demonstrated
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/03/20/seagate_terabit_areal_density/">HAMR
at a terabit per square inch</a> and predicted market entry in
2014.<br /> <br /> I wrote again in

I wrote about Chris Mellor’s
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/11/02/seagate_hamr_roadmap/"><i>Seagate
HAMRs out a roadmap for future hard drive recording tech</i></a>::<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate has set a course to deliver a 48TB disk drive in 2023 using its
HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) technology, doubling areal
density every 30 months, meaning 100TB could be possible by 2025/26. …
Seagate will introduce its
<a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/21/seagate_to_drop_multiactuator_hamr_in_2020/">first
HAMR drives in 2020</a>. … a 20TB+ drive will be rolled out in 2020.
</blockquote>
So in a decade the technology had gone from next year to the year after
next. The year after next Jim Slater wrote
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/hamr-dont-hurt-em-laser-assisted-hard-drives-are-coming-in-2020/"><i>HAMR
don’t hurt ’em—laser-assisted hard drives are coming in
2020</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate has been trialing 16TB HAMR drives with select customers for
more than a year and
<a href="https://blog.seagate.com/craftsman-ship/hamr-milestone-seagate-achieves-16tb-capacity-on-internal-hamr-test-units/">claims</a>
that the trials have proved that its HAMR drives are “plug and play
replacements” for traditional CMR drives, requiring no special care and
having no particular poor use cases compared to the drives we’re all
used to.
</blockquote>
But no, it would be another four years before we saw the first signs of
HAMR drives in the market. In December 2024 Matthew Connatser reported
that
<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagate-launches-32tb-exos-m-hard-drive-based-on-hamr-technology-mozaic-3-drives-are-the-worlds-first-generally-available-hamr-hdds"><i>Seagate

<blockquote>
Seagate’s biggest-ever hard drive is finally here, coming with 32TB of
capacity courtesy of the company’s new HAMR technology (via
<a href="https://www.expreview.com/97328.htm">Expreview</a>).<br />
<br /> It has almost been a year since Seagate said it had finally made

Note that the drives that are “(nearly) here” are still not available
from Amazon, although they are featured on
<a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/enterprise-drives/exos/exos-m-3-plus/">Seagate’s

<blockquote>
Drives based on Seagate’s Mozaic 3+ platform, in standard drive sizes,
will soon arrive with wider availability than its initial test batches.
The driver maker put in a
<a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001137789/5a69d4a1-883e-41f3-a6b8-f4cfdea91d09.pdf">financial
filing earlier this month</a> (PDF) that it had completed qualification
testing with several large-volume customers, including “a leading cloud
service provider,” akin to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or the
like. Volume shipments are
<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagates-hamr-hdds-qualified-by-customers-volume-shipments-imminent">likely
soon to follow</a>.<br /> <br /> There is no price yet, nor promise of
delivery, but you can do some wishful thinking on the product page for
the Exos M, where 30 and 32TB capacities are offered. That’s 3TB per
platter, and up to three times the efficiency per terabyte compared to
“typical drives,” according to Seagate.
</blockquote>
More indications that volume shipments could happen “next year” comes

<blockquote>
Intevac has said there is strong interest in its HAMR disk drive platter
and head production machinery from a second customer, which could
indicate that Western Digital is now involved in HAMR disk developments
following Seagate’s move into volume production.<br /> <br />
<a href="https://www.intevac.com/">Intevac</a> supplies its

manufacturers, such as Seagate, Showa Denko and Western Digital. It
claims more than 65 percent of the world’s HDD production relies on its
machinery. The Lean 200 is used to manufacture recording media, disk
drive platters, for current perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR)
disks.<br /> <br /> Intevac’s main customer for HAMR-capable 200 Lean
machines is Seagate, which first embarked on its HAMR development in the
early 2000s. It is only this year that a prominent
<a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2024/12/04/seagate-hamr-disk-drive-qualification/">cloud
service provider</a> has certified Seagate’s Mozaic 3 HAMR drives for
general use, more than 20 years after development first started. The
lengthy development period has been ascribed to solving difficulties in
producing drives with high reliability from high yield manufacturing
processes, and Intevac will have been closely involved in ensuring that
its 200 Lean machines played their part in this.

<h3>
Archival Media
</h3>
Maybe 2025 will be the year I can finally bring my 12-year-long series
about HAMR shipment schedules to a close, 23 years after Seagate started
work on the technology. Why have I been HAMR-ing on Seagate all these
years, and again now? Not to denigrate Seagate’s engineering. Getting a
HAMR drive into volume production that meets both the incredibly
demanding standards for storage media reliability and performance, and
the manufacturing yields needed for profit, is an extraordinarily
difficult feat. It is not a surprise that it took a couple of
decades.<br /> <br /> My criticisms have been aimed at the storage
industry’s marketing and PR, which hypes developments that are still in
the lab as if they are going to solve customers’ problems “next year”.
And at the technology press, which took far too long to start expressing
skepticism. Seagate’s marketing eventually lost all credibility, with
their predictions about HAMR becoming an industry joke.<br /> <br /> The
situation is far worse when it comes to archival media. The canonical
article about some development in the lab starts with the famous IDC
graph projecting the amount of data that will be generated in the
future. It goes on to describe the density some research team achieved
by writing say a gigabyte into their favorite medium in the lab. This
conveys four false impressions:<br />
<ul>
<li>
That there is some possibility they could scale their process up to a
meaningful fraction of IDC’s projected demand, or even to the
microscopic fraction of the projected demand that makes sense to
archive. There is no such possibility. Archival media is a much
<i>smaller</i> market than regular media.
</li>
<li>
That the researcher’s favorite medium could make it into the market in
the timescale of IDC’s projections. As we see with HAMR, where research
started
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">twenty-six
years ago</a>, it won’t. Research on the silica medium started
<a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">fifteen
years ago</a>. Research on the DNA medium started
<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/777811">thirty-six years ago</a>.
Neither is within five years of market entry.
</li>
<li>
That even if the researcher’s favorite medium did make it into the
market it would be a product that consumers could use. As
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Kestutis
Patiejunas figured out</a> more than a decade ago, the only way to make
the economics of archival storage work is to do it at data-center scale
and harvest the synergies that come from not needing data-center power,
cooling, staffing, etc.
</li>
<li>
That anyone either cares or even knows what medium their archived data
lives on. Only the hyper-scalers do. Consumers believe their data is
safe in the cloud. If anyone really cares about archiving they use a
service such as Glacier, when they definitely have no idea what medium
is being used.
</li>
</ul>
Consumers already have an affordable, durable archival medium. As
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/08/2024-optical-media-durability-update.html">I
have shown</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Surprisingly, with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost
media, and consumer drives, I’m getting good data from CD-Rs more than
20 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old.
</blockquote>
The market for DVD-R media and drives is gradually dying because they
have been supplanted in the non-archival space by streaming, an
illustration that
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast08/tech/marshall.pdf">consumers
really don’t care</a> about archiving their data!<br />
<h3>
DNA Storage
</h3>
In 2018’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html"><i>DNA’s
Niche in the Storage Market</i></a> I imagined myself as the product
marketing guy for an attempt to build a rack-scale DNA storage system,
and concluded:<br />
<blockquote>
Engineers, your challenge is to increase the speed of synthesis by a
factor of a quarter of a trillion, while reducing the cost by a factor
of fifty trillion, in less than 10 years while spending no more than
$24M/yr.
</blockquote>
The only viable market for DNA storage is the data-center, and the two
critical parameters are still the write bandwidth and the write cost. As
far as I’m aware despite the considerable progress in the last 6 years
both parameters are still many orders of magnitude short of what a
system would have needed back then to enter the market. Worse, the last
six years of data center technology development have increased the need
for write bandwidth and reduced the target cost. DNA storage is in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen's_race">Red Queen’s
Race</a> and it is a long way behind.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, DNA’s
long-term <i>potential</i> as an archival storage medium justifies
continued research. Among recent publications is
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08040-5"><i>Parallel
molecular data storage by printing epigenetic bits on DNA</i></a> by
Cheng Zhang <i>et al</i>, which avoids the need to synthesize strands of
DNA by attaching the bits to prexisting strands. In principle this can
be done in parallel. As is traditional, they start by asserting:<br />
<blockquote>
The markedly expanding global data-sphere has posed an imminent
challenge on large-scale data storage and an urgent need for better
storage materials. Inspired by the way genetic information is preserved
in nature, DNA has been recently considered a promising biomaterial for
digital data storage owing to its extraordinary storage density and
durability.
</blockquote>
The paper attracted comment from, among others,
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/25/epibit_dna_storage_research/"><i>The
Register</i></a>,
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-can-you-write-data-to-dna-without-changing-the-base-sequence/"><i>Ars
Technica</i></a> and
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-03312-6"><i>Nature</i></a>.
In each case the commentary included some skepticism. Here are Carina
Imburgia and Jeff Nivala from the University of Washington team in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-03312-6"><i>Nature</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
However, there are still challenges to overcome. For example, epigenetic
marks such as methyl groups are not copied by the standard PCR
techniques used to replicate DNA, necessitating a more complex strategy
to preserve epi-bit information when copying DNA data. The long-term
behaviour of the methyl marks (such as their stability) in various
conditions is also an open question that requires further study.<br />
<br /> Another challenge is that many applications require random access
memory (RAM), which enables subsets of data to be retrieved and read
from a database. However, in the epi-bit system, the entire database
would need to be sequenced to access any subset of the files, which
would be inefficient using nanopore sequencing. Moreover, the overall
cost of the new system exceeds that of conventional DNA data storage and
of digital storage systems, limiting immediate practical applications;
</blockquote>
You have to read a long way into the
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08040-5">paper to find
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
we stored 269,337 bits including the image of a tiger rubbing from the
Han dynasty in ancient China and the coloured picture of a panda … An
automatic liquid handling platform was used to typeset large-scale data
at a speed of approximately 40 bits s<sup>−1</sup>
</blockquote>
This is interesting research but the skepticism in the commentaries
doesn’t exactly convey the difficulty and the time needed to scale from
writing less than 40KB in a bit under 2 hours, to the petabyte/month
rates (about 2.8TB every 2 hours) Facebook was writing
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/02/facebooks-cold-storage.html">a
decade ago</a>. This would be a speed-up of nearly 11 orders of
magnitude to compete with decade-old technology.
<h3>
Diamonds
</h3>
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/29/chinese_boffins_find_way_to/"><i>Chinese
boffins find way to use diamonds as super-dense and durable storage
medium</i></a> by Laura Dobberstein reports that:<br />
<blockquote>
The research, published in
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01573-1i">Nature
Photonics</a>, highlights that the breakthrough extends beyond density.
It is said to offer significant improvements in write times – as little
as 200 femtoseconds – and lives up to the promise that “a diamond is
forever” by offering millions of years of allegedly maintenance-free
storage. Diamonds are highly stable by nature and the the authors have
claimed their medium could protect data for 100 years even if kept at
200°C.<br /> <br /> High-speed readout is demonstrated with a fidelity
of over 99 percent, according to the boffins.<br /> <br /> Scientists
have been eyeing diamonds as storage devices for a while. Researchers at
City College of New York in 2016
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1600911">claimed</a>
to be the first group to demonstrate the viability of using diamond as a
platform for superdense memory storage.
</blockquote>
These researchers, like so many others in the field, fail to understand
that the key to success in archival storage is reducing total system
cost. Long-lived but expensive media like diamonds are thus
counter-productive.<br />
<h3>
Project Silica
</h3>
I wrote about Microsoft’s Project Silica last March, in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/microsofts-archival-storage-research.html"><i>Microsoft’s
Archival Storage Research</i></a>. The more I think about this
technology, the more I think it probably has the best chance of
impacting the market among all the rival archival storage
technologies:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The media is very cheap, so the effect of Kryder’s Law economics driving
media replacement and thus its economic rather than technical lifetime
is minimal.
</li>
<li>
The media is quasi-immortal and survives benign neglect, so opex once
written is minimal.
</li>
<li>
The media is write-once, and the write and read heads are physically
separate, so the data cannot be encrypted or erased by malware. The long
read latency makes exfiltrating large amounts of data hard.
</li>
<li>
The robotics are simple and highly redundant. Any of the shuttles can
reach any of the platters. They should be much less troublesome than
tape library robotics because, unlike tape, a robot failure only renders
a small fraction of the library inaccessible and is easily repaired.
</li>
<li>
All the technologies needed are in the market now, the only
breakthroughs needed are economic, not technological.
</li>
<li>
The team has worked on improving the write bandwidth which is a critical
issue for archival storage at scale. They can currently write hundreds
of megabytes a second.
</li>
<li>
Like
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook’s
archival storage technologies</a>, Project Silica enjoys the synergies
of data center scale without needing full data center environmental and
power resources.
</li>
<li>
Like Facebook’s technologies, Project Silica has an in-house customer,
Azure’s archival storage, with a need for a product like this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The expensive part of the system is the write head, because it uses
costly femtosecond lasers. The eventual system’s economics will depend
upon the progress made in cost-reducing the lasers. <br /></p>

<p>My wife and I are moving upward through The Final Demographic.
Productively: working, traveling, doing stuff. But we are dealing with
some of the usual infirmities required by aging, which means we are
intimately involved (mostly in very slow motion) with what we generously
call U.S. health care system. And, of course, discussions about it.

great thing about using a system like MySQL (or any SQL for that matter)
is that it’s been around for so long that if you can think of something
that would be nice to have, you can be sure it’s there somewhere.
They’ve had enough time not only to hit all the walls, but to try out
different approaches and settle on one. Maybe at times there were
competing ways to do things, like the way Bluesky and ActivityPub, and
probably Threads, and certainly Facebook and Twitter insist on
reinventing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>.
But when I ask ChatGPT “can you do this in MySQL” it gives me one or two
ways to do it, but usually just one. These are things I never would have
found in the old Google-search way of finding answers. An example, I
wanted to find out if there was a MySQL way to query a value inside a
JSON object, and the answer is (of course) yes. And you can create an
index on such a value. I didn’t even ask for it, ChatGPT volunteered,
guessing it would be my next question (it was). Whatever happened in the
evolution of SQL it was a lot healthier than what’s going on now in the
social web, where the creators completely ignored what came before, and
each other, and as a result there’s a proliferation of different ways to
do things we’ve known how to do for
<a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html">over 20 years</a>. SQL
has been around for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#History">50</a>, so maybe
they went through this stage and emerged from it with a better answer.
This feels a bit like the
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/677bf6d0-b868-8012-af56-7e4449e9182f">Fermi
paradox</a> and I’m a time traveler who has managed to witness 50 years
of evolution long after the fact, any day of any week I want to thanks
to ChatGPT. Also this is why it is so important to keep the archives of
the 1990’s web preserved. We may need to loop back to this when the
people responsible for the social web decide that interop is important
as opposed to each of them going it alone.</p>

I’d write books with <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>.
Just thinking out loud here. Working with a group of people. It’s
possible it’s just the author and editor, or it could be a larger
documentation job, or a report covering a lot of ground. In 2025 we’d
use AI to find the threads in our writing, to maintain a book outline
that changes as our writing goes forward. Gone is the problem of writing
a chapter structure before doing any writing. I’ve always found that to
be a real obstacle to getting started. I’ve yet to use a ChatGPT-like
service to do this, but I expect it can be done. I’m thinking about how
I can set up an experiment for
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> for writing this kind
of book. The first test case could be the docs for WordLand. I would
write a post about a feature as I thought about it, but not worry about
how it fits into the rest of the book. Trust the AI organizer to help us
do something sensible.</p>

<h1 id="2025-01-06-asking-for-change-politely">
2025-01-06 Asking for change, politely
</h1>
<p>
It seems to me that when the powerful are terrible people and the weak
are trying to articulate their anger, to organize, to get a mass
movement going, asking them to politely make their case and letting
other people make up their mind is not OK. By telling people not to
fight for their rights but to just politely make their point and then
shut up one aligns with the powerful, one dismisses the methods of
resistance.
</p>
<p>
To get a feel for absurd this is, I remember a cartoon I once saw where
American natives gave the conquistadores a list of complaints; where
black Americans gave white Americans a list of civil rights they were
asking for; and so on. And in all cases, the oppressor answered, “oh,
that’s not fair!” or something to that effect and instituted the
necessary changes.
</p>
<p>
It never works that way.
</p>
<p>
For the oppressed to organize, they need the right to speak, to
organize, to meet, to protest.
</p>
<p>
For the oppressor to get spurred into action, it needs to hurt.
</p>
<p>
These days, that means that protests must lead to costs. Otherwise
they’re ignored. It’s as simple as that. Therefore, protest disrupts the
economy, disrupts the flow of goods, damages property. If it doesn’t
cost, it doesn’t hurt. If it doesn’t hurt, it isn’t felt.
</p>
<p>
Also consider all the political theatre that goes on. You can be part of
a grass-roots organisation and fight for change. As far as the situation
in Switzerland is concerned, the government might even invite you to
comment on new draft legislation. But you’re not going to get to write
the proposals. You’re not going to change the system by participating in
meetings. At that point, you’re part of the long arm of the government
reaching into civil society, there to confirm that they have made the
right choices, to do your part in the public performance to assure the
rest of us that everything is OK, everybody has been heard and all
points of view have been accounted for. At that point, it’s too late for
change.
</p>
<p>
The opportunity for change is to be a threat to the establishment, to
undermine the seats of politicians, to cast doubt on their reliability,
to make them unelectable. Then the government starts moving and writes
new proposals to be confirmed by the political theatre in front of a
changed audience.

in defense of Matt Mullenweg and the culture of the developer community
he built over the last 20 years, for better or worse, they don’t do what
Bluesky did. They look for prior art and implement it and they don’t
deprecate. They’re still running the APIs we invented for blogging
before WordPress even existed. The philosophy is “Let’s not argue about
decisions made a long time ago, because <i>we want interop.” </i>People
have all kinds of harsh things to say about their leadership, but unless
you’re a developer you don’t understand that the reason it works is that
they have a different code for their code, the only way we get interop
is by
<a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod">not
re-inventing</a>. There are two competing ways to do things in tech. The
blogging world has been taken over by the re-inventors, like the Bluesky
people. They make a nice product, but honestly they don’t reallllly want
us to work with them, or we wouldn’t be having this friction. Their API
is bullshit. Plain and simple. They even thought of using RSS constructs
and decided to reinvent the whole thing. There are places to innovate,
like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html">hamster
cages</a> where everyone
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com">gets</a>
to run around in a very tightly defined space, that’s fun. That’s what
Twitter was about, and that’s what Bluesky is doing too. At some point
we’re really going to break free of this mess, but this isn’t that time,
yet.</p>

crazy thing about Bluesky’s API is they took already standardized things
like links and enclosures, and after 20+ years came up with new
definitions. Makes our apps more expensive to maintain, and we waste
time and human wear and tear on stupid bullshit make-work. Developers
are people, and our work is already horribly overly complex, we’re
working at the edge of comprehension, and what the fukc let’s throw some
more unnecessary complication into the mix. Arrogance, narcissism,
whatever the source is, it’s not a good way to introduce yourself. And,
even better, after you go through the maze they break it, with an error
message about
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/1d0b3163a8441a98e6098a29393ac834">legacy
blob</a> bullshit. They’ve already done this, and they’re just getting
started. It’s why I say they should just adapt to RSS instead of trying
to force us to adapt to them. I’ll do it one more time, and then that’s
it. They can fix my code next time they break it.</p>

Wagtail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, updated: 2025-01-05, from: Cynthia Kiser’s blog</p>
<p>We host our websites in Docker containers using Fargate on AWS. This
means we don’t have a permanent file system so we need to use S3 to
store the media files our users upload. Fortunately there is a Django
package to add a variety of different file storage options, including
S3. Setting up S3 via django-storages is pretty straightforward -
install the package, configure storages.backends.s3.S3Storage as the
storage backend, and include AWS access information in your environment
variables.</p>
