<p>I’m starting to use the rewrite of my thread publisher on Bluesky.
Here’s an
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3limh2mzjdh2p">example</a>.
And here’s the
<a href="https://skywrt.com/scripting.com/006">version</a> of the thread
without being broken up into 300-character chunks (you can get it by
clicking in the
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/20/clickHereToReadFullThread.png">metadata
box</a> below the text of the post). I don’t like it. The software is as
good as it can be, given the extreme limits of the twitter-like
environment. I went all the way with this, but I’m not sure I’m going to
release it. But I’m going to keep using it, and maybe I’ll think of
something that makes it fun or worthwhile, or maybe I’ll just chalk it
up to another learning experience.</p>

<p>Once again Maddow is must-watch destination TV this year. Keep on
going. One thing to watch out for, Bluesky <i>will</i> disappoint you.
Don’t blame them when it happens, because they can’t be as good as
people think they are. They’re a startup in a tough market. Sooner or
later Musk is going to aim at them (maybe he already is) and they will
have to seek refuge somewhere, and all big tech companies are bastards.
There isn’t one of them you can trust with your democracy. So keep that
in mind, and when you see open billionaire-proof social networks rise
up, give them a little the Rachel we love.</p>

<p>One more thing. I like watching Maddow nowadays. She seems unstuck.
And she’s talking straight to the Repubs, and not with resignation, with
the idea that maybe finally enough is enough, and they might work with
us to save what we can of this great country. Also like that Bernie
Sanders is on the road campaigning in swing districts that are held by
Repubs, to see if he can squeeze out a few defectors from the ranks of
House Republicans. Very important, because the Repub margin there is
only 3. Just have to flip 2. America has to start moving now, or it’s
going to take a long long time to come back from this. The sooner we all
get that, and that <i>we</i> are part of it, the better things will turn
out, imho.</p>

don’t like
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3likjorqzmk23">social
networks</a> as they’re currently configured. The idea that it’s some
kind of conversation – no it really doesn’t resemble a conversation. I
would like to try a social network that didn’t have the concept of
replying to a post. Give each other a little more distance. It still
would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn’t be
able to insert something into someone else’s flow, which is where all
the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the
person it’s in reply to, so you don’t end up getting speeches under your
posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don’t bother reading
anything that’s related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can
enter the flow. We’ve been doing this, the way we do it, since the
inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network
is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics,
specifically graph theory – and the Twitter way of organizing people and
discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged.
Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the
structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way
might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can’t
intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we
should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the
other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or
whatever bullshit the influencers have made up). And with that I wish
you a good evening and note that tomorrow is another day. <span

<h1 id="2025-02-19-bots-again-cursed">
2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed
</h1>
<p>
I’m on a trip and once again the bot fuckers are at it. Long term load
average is 0.5; I have two cores so I can handle an average load of 2.0;
but when I looked at my sites this morning load was at 110. Some idiot
is training their AI again, is my guess.
</p>
<p>
I switched off Emacs Wiki and Community Wiki for the time being. They’ll
be back when the AI bros are tired of downloading every link.
</p>
<p>
Munin shows load goin up and up and then Munin breaks down…
</p>
<p>

<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Emacs">#Emacs</a>
</p>
<p>
Compare this shit I should be dealing with to the stuff I want to look
at:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-2.jpg" alt="Sunrise" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-3.jpg" alt="Mountains" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-4.jpg" alt="Snow" />
</p>
<p>
So here’s the new deal: I’m redirecting any request containing
“rcidonly” in the query string to
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/nobots">nobots</a>. This parameter is
used when showing recent changes for just a single page (“show all
changes”), or for showing a feed for just one page. These are valid
links but when the Internet ingesting machines start slurping, these
endpoints are too expensive. This redirect to the static page already
saves us a lot of resources.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, I wrote a fail2ban filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> containing this:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
# www.emacswiki.org:443 000.000.000.000 - - [19/Feb/2025:00:05:14 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1728421966&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_FacesPerBuffer&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 7168 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.127 Safari/537.36&quot;
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added a section using this filter to my jail
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>
<p>
And when I check it, it already contained some bots:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client status alex-bots
Status for the jail: alex-bots

<h2 id="device-code-phishing">Device Code Phishing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, updated: 2025-02-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This isn’t new, but it’s
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">increasingly
popular</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The technique is known as device code phishing. It exploits “device code
flow,” a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-07#section-3.4">OAuth
standard</a>. Authentication through device code flow is designed for
logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These
devices typically don’t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in
using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user
names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained
device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a
link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a
computer or other device that’s easier to sign in with and enters the
code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained
device that logs it into the account…

I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones,
for a fresh start, but then I started getting ideas, and decided to go
for it. I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and
these days I’m using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else,
though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but
usually there’s nothing for me in those places. Anyway I’ll be pointing
to this post
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g">from</a>
some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will
appear here.

to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
<em>How do you recompile Linux?</em>
</p>
<p>
In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild
<a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi’s Linux
kernel fork</a> instead of ‘mainline’ linux (the upstream
<a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).
</p>
<p>
Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building
and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly
goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more
convenient):

<h2 id="an-example-of-ai-use">An example of AI use</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to
ChatGPT. Here’s the prompt.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>I’m thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it
in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to
ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the
trip, I don’t mind going out of my way.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and
Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services
and notable bike trails.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place
that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.
</p>
<p>
It also offered information about weather considerations. It’s not
necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.
</p>
<p>
I’m not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example
because I’ve done this trip a number of times and was curious how things
had developed.
</p>
<p>
Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I
find a Starbucks not too far off the route I’m on. If you were plotting
the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a
continuum of services that have developed over the years that make
information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers
questions you have in the way you think of asking them.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 ">link
to the response</a>. I’ve heard that sometimes people have trouble
accessing these files.

<p>Today is Presidents Day, a somewhat vague holiday placed in 1968 on
the third Monday in February, near the date of George Washington’s
birthday on February 22, 1732, but also traditionally including Abraham
Lincoln, who was born on February 12, 1809.</p>

<p>Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in
Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a
profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order. Yet that response is
disturbing.</p>

I am seeing a lot of complaints from people around the world about the
current price of eggs. At my local supermarket, there no longer even are
eggs. The shelves where the eggs used to be are now filled with Easter
chocolate. The six eggs still left in our fridge are gonna have to be
rationed.

<p>
One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can’t moderate
comments under your own posts.
</p>
<p>
If someone says something abusive, it’s there for everyone to see,
forever.
</p>
<p>
I’ve come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full
discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes.
</p>
<p>
I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to
feel respected.
</p>
<p>
A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful.

<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A simple idea, a quid pro quo.
</p>
<p>
If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate
that we will support them.
</p>
<p>
We are the government of the US, Congress represents us.
</p>
<p>
We have been too passive.
</p>
<p>
But then, they have to include us in governing.
</p>
<p>
No more shutting off the connection after the election.
</p>
<p>
Seems like a fair deal.

<p>
If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I’d restart the
online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election
Day. 2. I’d get out the message over and over about how things are going
too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what’s happening.
Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the
US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes
will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun
to make my statement, but I’m afraid this is going too far. I think we
can all relate to that. We aren’t being represented here.
</p>
<p>
I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to
visualize what it feels like to be watching what’s happening in the US
from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have
expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure
out what you’re doing.

<p>BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on
Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It’s not a
very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if
the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition,
different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our

<p>Great quote from a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=severance+s2e5">favorite
