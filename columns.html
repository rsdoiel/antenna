<p>It has come to my attention that “It’s even worse than it appears”
might not be the right overlay for Kamala Harris, whose
<a href="http://scripting.com/images/2024/08/23/presidentKamala.png">picture</a>
is the current
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/30/scriptingNewsBanner.png">banner
art</a> for <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. Of
course she’s still even better than she appears. I really mean that, and
if you read this blog regularly you know. But what would a random person
think? Hmm. Maybe that it’s strange, this is a picture of the would-be
president, and it’s a good one. I wonder if there are many levels of
irony going on at this moment, the visitor might think. No matter how
much I love the Democratic team this year, this is not a campaign site.
I don’t take ads. This is just a blog. You might have to peer below the
surface to figure out what’s going on. Even the guy who writes this
freaking thing can’t see all the angles. For now neither the image or
motto are changing. There hasn’t always been a motto there you know.</p>

and putdowns in politics are great if you know how to do it and if the
time is right. Trump was the only comedian on stage at the debates. And
his act was fresh. The people who loved him loved that the other people
hated him. It really was simple. Like a sports team or a favorite comic.
Anyway, the Harris folk are <i>good</i> at putdowns and comedy, and the
time is right. Trump’s act is done, people are tired of the same old
bullshit (which is exactly what Kamala said last night in the big
interview). That’s the cushion they’re floating on. If they had called
Trump weird in 2016 it wouldn’t have worked, and probably not in 2020
for different reasons (he wasn’t a joke at that moment, a huge number of
Americans were sick and dying, and the economy was in ruin and there was
no end in sight, not a good time to be joking around). But now Trump
<i>is</i> a joke. So it feels right. Another perspective you should get
James Carville, who was on the
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/james-carville-trump-is-in-deep-trouble-and-he-knows-it/id1728152109?i=1000666762884">Daily
Blast podcast</a> on Tuesday. Real eye-openers re how campaigns really
work and why it’s working for Team Harris now. And btw, why she’s doing
great now and not so good in 2019, two things. 1. Obviously she’s grown.
The last four years she’s been VP of the United States. That’s got to be
some kind of education for someone as brilliant as she is. 2. In 2019
she was on stage with 20 other people, and only got tiny slivers of
time. Look at what you find appealing about her now (assuming you do).
It’s the pauses and looks as much as anything, the facial expression.
Anyway, she’s really good at what she’s doing now, at all levels, and
Donald Trump is washed up. That’s why it still feels good because of
course he still could win.</p>

2024-08-30 Karoshi and taxes
</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoshi">Karoshi</a> is when you
are being worked to death without the use of prison guards. Survive the
intense pressure of the workplace, of course! But then speak up about
it. Name the organizations that are part of this scheme to squeeze us
for all the hours we help them make a profit, name the techniques they
use, start resisting in big and small ways, help each other to resist.
99% of us are in this, together.
</p>
<p>
I’m watching family members working long hours for the Swiss federal
government, and on the weekend, too, and I don’t like it. I don’t like
it one bit.
</p>
<p>
This is what happens when people want a balanced budget and tax cuts for
the rich: there’s not enough money to go around, the work still needs to
get done, and so those who want to do a good job get to bear the burden.
The good start leaving. The experienced start leaving. The longer this
continues, the work is done by fewer people, desperate people,
inexperienced people, until it all fails, all at the same time.
</p>
<p>
We need to vote for people and parties that want to increase the tax
burden for the rich, that want to solve the problems of tax evasion and
of capital flight. We need that money and the rich don’t.

2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor
</h1>
<p>
I tried to send an email from Emacs and it didn’t work. The error was:
</p>
<pre><code>msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>
<p>
I was able to reproduce the problem with the following
<code>hello.txt</code> file:
</p>
<pre><code>From: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
To: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
Subject: Test

This is the test.
</code></pre>
<p>
And then feeding that to <code>msmtp</code> with debugging enabled
(<code>-d</code>) and reading recipients from the mail
(<code>-t</code>):
</p>
<pre><code>msmtp -d -t &lt; hello.smtp
</code></pre>
<p>
Now I had more info, however:
</p>
<pre><code>ignoring system configuration file /etc/msmtprc: No such file or directory
ignoring user configuration file /home/alex/.config/msmtp/config: Permission denied
falling back to default account
msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>
<p>
I checked permissions, and it was 0600 for the config file. Online, I
found a reference to AppArmor. Taking a peek at
<code>/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp</code> I didn’t see anything
surprising. But then I grew suspicious… I had in fact moved
<code>~/.config/msmtp</code> to <code>~/src/home/.config/msmtp</code>
(which is a Git repository) and replaced that with a symbolic link.
AppArmor didn’t like this and decided that <code>msmtp</code> was not
allowed to read that other file. Moving the directory back solved this
problem.
</p>
<p>
I guess I’ll be making occasional copies of this file into the Git
repository. 😒

<h1 id="2024-08-18-indie-search-for-oddmu">
2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu
</h1>
<p>
This is a follow-up for
<a href="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexes">2024-08-16 JSON feed for
indexing</a> where I linked to
<a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a>.
I want to see what’s required for this to work.
</p>
<p>
First, I need to install Pagefind. Lucky me, I already have a Rust build
environment installed.
</p>
<pre><code>cargo install pagefind
</code></pre>
<p>
Next, I need a static HTML copy of my site:
</p>
<pre><code>env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en  oddmu static -jobs 3 /tmp/alex
</code></pre>
<p>
Create the index:
</p>
<pre><code>pagefind --site /tmp/alex
</code></pre>
<p>
Upload:
</p>
<pre><code>mv /tmp/alex/pagefind .
make upload
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s now available at
<code>https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind</code>.
</p>
<p>
Adding the info to the page header:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;application/pagefind&quot; href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind&quot; title=&quot;Alex Schroeder’s Diary&quot;&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) =&gt; {
  new PagefindUI({ element: &quot;#pagefind&quot;, showSubResults: true });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And a div to the page body:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;pagefind&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And I had to add <code>‘unsafe-eval’</code> to the
<code>script-src</code> Content-Security-Policy header.
</p>
<p>
Too bad the search result links all end in <code>.html</code> … that
requires an extra rewrite rule, to get rid of. On the other hand, it
also allowed me to get rid of <code>baseUrl: "/view/"</code>.
</p>
<p>
Since there are still rough edges, this search is only available via
<a href="pagefind.html">Pagefind</a>. I’m also not promising any updates
to the index.

<strong>2024-08-19</strong>. While I was experimenting with this all, I
asked
<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="byjp">@byjp</span></a> some questions.
</p>
<p>
<em>Sites provide local indexes in the Pagefind format, as a static
file?</em>
</p>
<p>
Correct — except it’s many files, organised so as to allow minimal
transfer for a single search query — but all can be retrieved to have a
full local index
</p>
<p>
<em>Clients register one or more of these files and allow searching
them?</em>
</p>
<p>
Correct — they can be retrieved/cached to query locally, or queried
efficiently remotely.
</p>
<p>
<em>Users can install a large number of them, locally? Like I have 23
local dictionaries installed for my dictd and I can query them,
locally.</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Many can be kept locally or remotely. The sites you “register”/add
become your search index.
</p>
<p>
<em>Is it possible for a website to offer just a Pagefind installation
with a number of URLs to Pagefind indexes without hosting pages and
indexes? Clients visiting this Pagefind installation would download all
the indexes pointed to in the list and search them locally?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes (with minor hackery). Each Pagefind instance <em>is</em> the index,
a small bootstrapping JS/WASM blob, and ~5 lines of init JS. Those 5
lines can include locations of multiple indexes for the (exclusively
client-side) JS to query when searching; by default the only one
configured is the “local” index that created with the Pagefind JS/WASM
blob, but you could strip away an empty index and have what you describe
— in fact, that’s what my
<a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch</a> demo
does!
</p>
<p>
<em>If instead of visiting a site with a Pagefind installation one
installs a Pagefind browser extensions, is it possible to point it to a
URL that hosts a list of indexes?</em>
</p>
<p>
I haven’t built that (yet), but yeah — I’d want to build an mf2/IndieWeb
compatible “new user experience” that’d guide folks to finding a
good-for-them set of defaults. My demo automatically (provisionally)
adds any site you visit that supports IndieSearch, so you’d get better
coverage fast. I’d also consider default-importing from blogrolls and
the like. (Management &amp; performance gets tricky with 1000s of
indexes. Probs an “if we get there” problem. 😅)
</p>
<p>
<em>Is it possible to “merge” Pagefind indexes and pass those aggregates
on? I’m afraid that having local copies of the indexes means that
clients will have to at least query thousands of sites for updates to
their page indexes.</em>
</p>
<p>
Not yet, but I asked exactly this question of the Pagefind devs and they
offered that it’s currently too hard, but that there is a potential
route they’d consider, see
<a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/discussions/564#discussioncomment-8702059">#564</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Thank you so much for answering the questions!</em>
</p>
<p>
I’m still thinking about the situation where I’m part of a community and
we want to all share search, like using
<a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a> for a webring – except I’d
like a solution where I don’t have to do the crawling.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, the communities I’m part of are planets such as
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> or
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>, each with
hundreds of blogs. I suppose most of them don’t offer a Pagefind index,
being hosted on Blogspot and Wordpress, but what I’m considering is
ingesting their feed and indexing it. This could be a service I could
perform for people. Luckily, it’s often possible to get all the blog
pages via the feed. This is how I’ve made
<a href="2010-05-31_Blognapping">local backups of other people’s
blogs</a>. I guess that each site would be a separate index, however?
</p>
<p>
I’d like to find a way that doesn’t require me to always download all
the pages. I’d like to find a way to update the index as it’s being
used.
</p>
<p>
I’d need a way to figure out how to configure it such that the results
link back to the original pages, of course.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I’m considering is that my own site is rendered live, from
Markdown files… it’s not a static site. So ideally I’d be able to ingest
Markdown files directly. Or I can go the route of exporting it all into
a big feed and ingesting that, once I’ve solved the problem above, I
guess. But the problem above might also be easier to solve by extracting
HTML pages from the feed. It’s what I’ve done in the past. Create
something that works, first, then improve it later?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, ideas are swirling around.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-19</strong>. I notice more things that aren’t quite
working the way I like them to work.
</p>
<p>
The sort order of the results is less than ideal, for example. I like to
emphasize more recent blog posts. Pagefind, however, returns them in
some sort of scoring order so that I’ve seen quite a few results with
pages around 20 years old.
</p>
<p>
Image previews seem to rarely work. I suspect the problem is pages in
subfolders linking to images in that same subfolder. Such relative links
don’t need a path – but they do if Pagefind is not in the same
directory.
</p>
<p>
Here’s another thing to consider: The index takes up more space than the
full HTML of the entire site, compressed!
</p>
<pre><code>alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; du -sh alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz 
 43M    alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind
9.7M    alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz
</code></pre>
<p>
So the Pagefind index takes about 4× more space than the full HTML, for
this site. This matches my experience with better indexing for my own
site where I experimented with full text indexes and trigram indexes.
Back then:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the 15 MiB of markdown files seem to have generated an index of 70 MiB –
<a href="2023-09-11-oddmu">2023-09-11 Oddµ memory consumption</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, in terms of copyright incentives, handing off the entire site
like that is tricky. Doing it with a feed feels OK. Doing it for a
search engine seems like handing the keys to Google. This provides an
incentive to use a pre-computed index.
</p>
<p>
It also reminds me that the idea I had of building a search engine out
of feed slurping without consent is probably a bad idea – like all ideas
based on non-consensual acts.
</p>
<p>
Whether self-indexing is a good thing in terms of avoiding an
English-first focus I don’t know. I suspect that most people will be
using free software and therefore there’s no reason to suspect that a
search engine doesn’t have the means to process the languages. Then
again, that’s a lock-in where in order to support a new language, you
have to support the software your favourite search-engine supports. So
people indexing our own pages might have long term benefits.
</p>
<p>
I’m still wondering about the comparison of Pagefind and Lunr, to be
honest. How many such static search solutions are there? Is there a
benefit of one implementation over another?
</p>
<p>
I guess now I should look into Pagefind some more? Indexing non-HTML
pages, handling image previews for pages not in the root directory and
relative image source URLs, the sort order of results, the use of the
.html extension in results… there are still rough edges as far as I am
concerned – and per discussion above the onus is on me to fix my
indexing. 😭
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-29</strong>. Would caching help? I don’t think so. Let’s
check!
</p>
<p>
First, a script to find an IP number that is doing many requests:
<a href="/admin/leech-detector">leech-detector</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# tail -n 10000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
  | bin/admin/leech-detector \
  | head
Total hits: 10000
IP                             |       Hits | Bandw. | Rel. | Interv. | Status
------------------------------:|-----------:|-------:|-----:|--------:|-------
                185.103.225.81 |       1057 |     0K |  10% |    1.7s | 302 (50%), 401 (49%), 200 (0%)
…

root@sibirocobombus ~# whois 185.103.225.81
…
org-name:       Muth Citynetz Halle GmbH
…
</code></pre>
<p>
I have never heard of them. Sounds like a small hosting company,
responsible for 10% of all hits on my server, right now. Let’s print the
status code they received from my web server and the path they
requested.
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# grep 185.103.225.81 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
  | awk -e '{print $10, $8}' \
  | sort \
  | uniq -c
    524 /edit/logo.jpg
    529 /view/logo.jpg
      2 /view/RPG.rss
      2 /wiki/feed/full/RPG
</code></pre>
<p>
This is simply broken shit that cannot be fixed by caching.
</p>
<p>
OK, let’s pick another IP number. Let’s look for an IP number that is
getting a lot of 200 results but isn’t accessing my fedi instance:
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# grep -v '^social' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
  | grep ' 200 ' \
  | bin/admin/leech-detector \
  | head
…
                51.210.214.160 |        411 |     4K |   0% |  155.8s | 200 (100%)
…

root@sibirocobombus ~# whois 51.210.214.160
…
org-name:       OVH SAS
…
</code></pre>
<p>
This is totally a hosting provider. What are they hosting?
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# grep 51.210.214.160 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
  | awk -e '{print $10, $8}' \
  | sort \

<p>
For every single wiki page it learnt about its feed from meta data and
it indexing that. I don’t know what to do. Producing these feeds is
expensive. It can be a interesting service for humans that want to
monitor a page or two. It’s a waste of CO₂ for machines that want to
pre-emptively ingest these pages. And since there are thousands of these
pages, every search bot ends up storing all the URLs, calling the wiki
engine every time to ask for the latest change, making it load the page
and check the metadata and send the reply, and TLS handshakes and
cryptography on top of all that. It hurts my heart to think of all this
waste. I think this is terrible design that cannot be fixed by adding
caching. My wiki does client side caching (pages are said to remain
fresh for 10s); http caching (with ETag header); html caching
(attempting to reduce the time spent parsing the wiki sources and
generating the html). In a way, these bots are forcing me to abandon
dynamically generated content on the open net – or to waste more time
and energy for squid cashes or varnish, more RAM, more resources, more
of my time. And that’s what making me so angry. Dynamically generated
HTML is excellent for low traffic sites. These days, there seems to be
no more low traffic because robot traffic is so high. They keep the
caches warm, all the time, on a global scale.
</p>
<p>
I remain unhappy.

It’s a wonderful talk: funny, engaging, wise, prescient. Remember that

TCP/IP and the internet went operational. She was a remarkable person.

Listening to it, and thinking about the audience of NSA engineers, I
wonder how much of what she’s talking about as the future of

I can’t read most of the stories I want to read. I have the money and am
willing to spend it. But there is no system that allows me to pay.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand the distribution of video entertainment is somewhat
functional, I spend an ungodly amount of mostly wasted money to get
access to that.
</p>
<p>
I am not cheap. The news system realllly doesn’t work. It could be
fixed, but for the usual problem – they would have to work with each
other.
</p>
<p>
If you think the NYT is a huge success, compare its size to the size of
Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon or Apple, all of whom have made great
businesses out of distributing other people’s products.

This is the BCM2712 <em>D0</em> stepping. Older Pi 5’s shipped with a

Steppings are basically chip revisions where they don’t change
functionality, and usually just fix bugs, or tweak the layout. But even
tiny design changes could have unintended consequences. I wanted to see
exactly what happens when I push one of these new chips to the limits.

id="to-a-tiling-wm-user-apparently-other-guis-are-like-wearing-handcuffs">To
a tiling WM user, apparently other GUIs are like wearing handcuffs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: Liam on Linux</p>
 This is interesting to me. I am on the other side, and ISTM that the
tiling WM folks are the camp you describe.
<p>
Windows (2.01) was the 3rd GUI I learned. First was classic MacOS
(System 6 and early System 7.0), then Acorn RISC OS on my own home
computer, then Windows.
</p>
<p>
Both MacOS and RISC OS have beautiful, very mouse-centric GUIs where you
<i>must</i> use the mouse for most things. Windows was fascinating
because it has rich, well-thought-out, rational and consistent keyboard
controls, and they work everywhere. In all graphical apps, in the window
manager itself, <i>and on the command line</i>.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + a letter is a discrete action: <i>do this thing now</i>.
</p>
<p>
– Alt + a letter opens a menu
</p>
<p>
– Shift moves selects in a continuous range: shift+cursors selects text
or files in a file manager. Shift+mouse selects multiple icons in a
block in a file manager.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + mouse selects discontinuously: pick disconnected icons.
</p>
<p>
– These can be combined: shift-select a block, then press ctrl <i>as
well</i> to add some discontinuous entries.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + cursor keys moves a word at a time (discontinuous cursor
movement).
</p>
<p>
– Shift + ctrl selects a word at a time.
</p>
<p>
In the mid-’90s Linux made Unix affordable and I got to know it, and I
switched to it early ’00s.
</p>
<p>
But it lacks that overall cohesive keyboard UI. Some desktops implement
most of Windows’ keyboard UI (Xfce, LXDE, GNOME 2.x), some invent their
own (KDE), many don’t have one.
</p>
<p>
The shell and editors don’t have any consistency. Each editor has its
own set of keyboard controls, and some environments honour some of them
– but not many because the keyboard controls for an editor make little
sense in a window manager. What does "insert mode" mean in a file
manager?
</p>
<p>
They are keyboard-driven windowing environments built by people who live
in terminals and only know the extremely limited keyboard controls of
the most primitive extant shell environment, one that doesn’t honour GUI
keyboard UI because it predates it and so in which every app invents its
own.
</p>
<p>
Whereas Windows co-evolved with IBM CUA and deeply embeds it.
</p>
<p>
The result is that all the Linux tiling WMs I’ve tried annoy me, because
they don’t respect the existing Windows-based keystrokes for
manipulating windows. GNOME &gt;=3 mostly doesn’t either: keystrokes for
menu manipulation make little sense when you’ve tried to eliminate menus
from your UI.
</p>
<p>
Even the growing-in-trendiness MiracleWM because the developer doesn’t
use plain Ubuntu, he uses Kubuntu, and Kubuntu doesn’t respect basic
Ubuntu keystrokes like Ctrl+Alt+T for a terminal, so neither does
MiracleWM.
</p>
<p>
They are multiple non-overlapping, non-cohesive, non-uniform keyboard
UIs designed by and for people who never knew how to use a
keyboard-driven whole-OS UI because they didn’t know there was one. So
they all built their own ones without knowing that there’s 30+ years of
prior art for this.
</p>
<p>
All these little half-thought-out attempts to build something <i>that
already existed</i> but its creators didn’t know about it.
</p>
<p>
To extend the prisoners-escaping-jail theme:
</p>
<p>
Each only extends the one prisoner cell that inmate knew before they got
out, where the prison cell is an app – often a text editor but sometimes
it’s one game.
</p>
<p>
One environment lets you navigate by only going left or straight. To go
right, turn left three times! Simple!
</p>
<p>
One only lets you navigate in spirals, but you can adjust the size, and
toggle clockwise or anticlockwise.
</p>
<p>
One is like Asteroids: you pivot your cursor and apply thrust.
</p>
<p>
One uses Doom/Quake-style WASD + mouse, because everyone knows that,
right? It’s the standard!
</p>
<p>
One expects you to plug in a joypad controller and use that.

which they
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">acquired

simple colorful user-friendly interface for WordPress, something it’s
needed for a long time. WordPress does everything in its UI, Tumblr has
its UI better organized for writers and more casual users. If they can
move in this direction, it seems that WordPress could be large part of

<p>date: 2024-08-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-28-traveller-and-mongoose">
2024-08-28 Traveller and Mongoose
</h1>
<p>
Marc Miller’s email was reposted in a few places, like Usenet (oh yes,
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/news/article/rec.games.frp.misc/290">it
was posted on rec.games.frp.misc</a>!),
<a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2024/08/concerning-future-of-traveller.html">Rob
Conley’s blog</a>, and elsewhere. What are your thoughts on it?
</p>
<p>
I am of two minds. Mongoose has been good for Traveller, I think. I
liked Mongoose Traveller 1st ed., which I ran for a bit, and I have no
reason to doubt that the current Mongoose Traveller 2nd ed. is as good a
system the many other Traveller editions out there.
</p>
<p>
I also have my doubts regarding Mongoose’s quality in terms of editing –
but who am I kidding, these days people are cutting corners all over the
place and sometimes they’re cutting corners in editing. It happens. It’s
the Zeitgeist. I guess in the world of quality assurance Mongoose
wouldn’t actually be all that bad because I’m assuming they fix all the
typos in later printings. 😏
</p>
<p>
Also they based a lot of follow-up products on the Traveller system and
what’s not to like about more 2d6 systems! 😸
</p>
<p>
This at least ensures that they remain committed to the basic idea. And
maybe that means that the PDFs will remain around for much longer.
That’s certainly better than ending up being managed by kids or being
sold off to the highest bidder after Miller’s passing. It’s not the
greatest plan but it’s a plan. Wouldn’t a real TAS be great? An
association that had a board elected by its members, the community? An
association based on Swiss law, like FIFA or the ICRC? Anyway, that’s a
dream and it wouldn’t be clear whether it would work in the long run so
perhaps passing it on to Mongoose was the best idea after all.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if Mongoose has a better succession plan, though. Looking at
<a href="https://forum.mongoosepublishing.com/threads/state-of-the-mongoose-2023.124344/">State
of Mongoose 2023</a>, it seems that the whole company is owned by
Matthew Sprange. Is he so much younger than Marc Miller? What’s the long
term plan, here?
</p>
<p>
Anyway. Thinking about what happens to our games when we die is a good
idea.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Miller should have slapped a CC-BY-SA 4.0 or a CC0 onto the
products he owns and said: “On the day I die, these licenses go into
effect immediately.”
</p>
<p>
But that’s not how these things go. I suspect some money changed hands
and that’s probably for Miller’s best.

with James Carville. Two take-aways for Democrats. 1. Avoid NPR
politics. 2. Appeal to college-educated white men. Most of them vote
Republican, but with Walz on the ticket, they have a special ambassador,
he represents that straight-talking country folk are part of the
Democratic coalition. It’s still true that white voters are the
majority. Get a small number to vote Democratic could be enough to win
the election. It never is about policy. It’s about whether you are like
them. That’s what it means to avoid NPR politics. And btw, imho –
getting the press to like you might not be good. I wonder if the Dems
would ever have the courage to sever itself from the journos. Imagine
Harris saying “If the press says we’re bad you know that means we’re
good.” She could say that in her big interview. 😀</p>

<p>The drives I use from ASUS and LG report significant numbers of read
errors from the CDs but verify the MD5s correctly. I didn’t notice them
reporting any read errors from the DVDs. An off-brand drive fails to
read the CDs, but read one of the older DVDs with no read errors.<br />
<br /> Surprisingly, with no special storage precautions, generic
low-cost media, and consumer drives, I’m getting good data from CD-Rs
more than 20 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old. Your
mileage may vary. Tune in again next year for another episode.<br />

The NYT isn’t trying to make us love Trump, that’s impossible. But they
are trying to make us not fall in love with Harris. I doubt they foresaw
that possibility. But our feelings about Harris are very much love. The
NYT is our only master, they must think. There’s no room for us to love
someone else, because we might listen to them. In a sense they respond
like a first born child on the arrival of their little sister or
brother. I don’t know. As I said it doesn’t matter why. That’s their
problem. Our problem is to get them out of the way.</p>

<h2 id="the-status-of-twitters-api">The status of Twitter’s API</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The Twitter API still works, with some serious limits. Not easily
incorporated into products, but useful for individuals with developer
accounts. Not an insurmountable hurdle, it seems, though I was a
developer from before. A few bullet points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My linkblog now reliably works on
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew">Threads</a>, in addition to
<a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave">Mastodon</a>,
<a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>,
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">RSS</a> and
<a href="https://linkblog3.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>.
</li>
<li>
I was confused about the status of the Twitter API, but it turns out
it’s still there, and there is a
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2">package</a> that
connects to it for Node apps.
</li>
<li>
It took me a few hours to add
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js#L543">support
for Twitter</a> in my
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main">textcasting</a>
server app which is how my software connects to all the various
services.
</li>
<li>
I should probably add a plugin abilitiy for textcasting so that other
services could easily be added, without modifying the core app. Totally
doable. It’s already factored that way internally.
</li>
<li>
I should probably write
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md">some
docs</a> for it too. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</li>
<li>
Anyway, the
<a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api">deal
with Twitter</a> is that it’s free for up to 1500 posts per month, as I
read it, which seems manageable for one person (me), but no way is it
enough for a community of users.
</li>
<li>
Why connect to Twitter? People are there. Until they aren’t we’re going
to need a way to push stuff to Twitter.
</li>
</ul>

the investigation into
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/310">getting
UserTalk running</a> in 2024 has been a trip. The last time I did any
work on this code, or even in this area of computer science, was approx
1990. It comes right back, like riding a bike. I saw a tremendous amount
of potential fun here, but I had to move on to runtime, object database,
verbs, user interface – for Frontier. In the 34 years between then and
now – a lot of software has been written, and I’m only looking at a
fraction of it, limited to stuff that runs in Node, the browser and
Electron. And I have to say I’m totally enjoying reading about what
they’ve done. I’m learning about evolution of technology, a facet of
development I am extremely drawn to, in a whole new way, as if viewed
through a tunnel in time.

This is a big deal. A US Appeals Court

It’s not surprising, after all. This is a very prominent sentence in
their README:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
GoToSocial is still ALPHA SOFTWARE.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But what are the exact problems? Sometimes alpha software is good
enough, right?

<h2 id="major-annoyances">
Major annoyances
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No post editing</strong>. I hope you can handle your own typos.
All you have is “Delete and Redraft”. But that orphans all replies,
undoes all boosts, forgets all likes and removes posts from bookmarks.
“Delete and Redraft” is a sledge hammer. “Edit post” is a delicate
quill. And you don’t get to have it. YOLO! (You only live once.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>No filtering</strong>. You can mute and block and all that, but
when everybody is posting about Monsterdon, the European Song Contest,
the US elections, Caturday or Wordle, you can’t filter those hashtags.
You must endure the enthusiasm of the people you are following. (I think
the developers are implementing things, but it does not seem to have an
effect in the front-ends I use, so who knows.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Limited federation</strong>. This one is hard to spot. You want
to follow this account and that account and it all seems to work until
you go back and find that for one account, your follow request seems to
hang in limbo, waiting. You cancel, and follow again. It seems to work.
Come back later, back in limbo again, waiting. If you check the log,
you’ll find errors about signatures failing and what not. I have no
idea. There are currently
<a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+signature">8
open issues containing the word ‘signature’</a>. Something is not
working and you’ll have to have an alt (a separate account) on a
different server that doesn’t have this issue. That makes me sad. 😥
</p>
<h2 id="minor-annoyances">
Minor annoyances
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No automatic post expiry</strong>. You’ll have to use something
like
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/mastodon-archive.git/">Mastodon
Archive</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="no-problem">
No problem
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No front-end</strong>. There is no front-end. I use apps like
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@tootapp">Toot!</a> on my phone and
<a href="https://semaphore.social/">Semaphore</a> on the web. I don’t
need anything fancy. And for the non-fancy options, I have
<a href="https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el">mastodon.el</a> for
Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">toot</a> for the
command-line, <a href="https://tuba.geopjr.dev/">tuba</a> for Gnome,
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bitlbee-mastodon.git/">bitlbee-mastodon</a>
for IRC, and so on. There are plenty of options.
</p>
<h2 id="the-good-stuff">
The good stuff
</h2>
<p>
<strong>Markdown</strong> in your posts. I like my code blocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>SQLite</strong> on the server. It’s currently 8.4G. The media
stuff is 11G.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Memory footprint</strong>. I use Monit to monitor processes and
this process uses 185.6 MB.
</p>
<p>
<strong>No admin</strong>. I haven’t had to run any administration task.
Not once. ❤️

die as a result of the bans, and many more who will be severely injured,
and all will have their freedoms severely restricted. 2. He’s lying.
When Congress passes a national abortion ban he’ll sign it and boast

<p>The raucous roll call of states at the 2024 Democratic National
Convention on Tuesday, as everybody danced to DJ Cassidy’s state-themed
music, Lil Jon strode down the aisle to cheers for Georgia, and
different delegations boasted about their states and good-naturedly
teased other delegations, brought home the real-life meaning of E
Pluribus Unum, “out of many, one.” From then until Thursday, as a sea of
American flags waved and attendees joyfully chanted “USA, USA, USA,” the
convention welcomed a new vision for the Democratic Party, deeply rooted
in the best of traditional America.</p>
