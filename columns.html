there this week, once with Kay, and once with Lucy to walk among the
acres of brilliant colors and natural beauty.

<p>Why we all have to be working <i>together</i> on creating a modern
easily distributed communication system that’s truly decentralized. The
key is to only implement features that have super-simple
implementations, so it will be easy to product new versions quickly in
all environments. Which means starting with formats and protocols that
are already widely supported.</p>

<p>This morning ChatGPT told me it knows more about me, and will learn
better. Promises promises. I would like to begin with teaching it my
coding conventions. Will make it <i>much</i> easier for me to work with
it. Their idea of how JavaScript works is disorganized bordering on
chaos. I find that human developers always find a reason not to listen
to other people, and that has huge problems (like no interop), but
machines should do better. It seems to have infinite patience. What I
need is to share a bit of space with the bot, so I can keep it up to
date on my worknotes. I’m pretty good at it these days. Why not let that
be input into the system so I can say – give me all the notes I have on
my Bingeworthy project. Why should I have to copy/paste. This is a big
problem in the web, products that pretend to be islands, when they’re
really all floating on the same sea, the internet. We were supposed to
be able to network not only our attention, but also our work.</p>

think they know more than people already doing the jobs. They quickly
learn that in school they were doing “student projects” which are not

vulnerabilities</a> in source code:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Microsoft discovered eleven vulnerabilities in GRUB2, including integer
and buffer overflows in filesystem parsers, command flaws, and a
side-channel in cryptographic comparison.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, 9 buffer overflows in parsing SquashFS, EXT4, CramFS,
JFFS2, and symlinks were discovered in U-Boot and Barebox, which require
physical access to exploit.
</p>
<p>
The newly discovered flaws impact devices relying on UEFI Secure Boot,
and if the right conditions are met, attackers can bypass security
protections to execute arbitrary code on the device…

<p>date: 2025-04-11, updated: 2025-04-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Imagine that all of us—all of society—have landed on some alien planet
and need to form a government: clean slate. We do not have any legacy
systems from the United States or any other country. We do not have any
special or unique interests to perturb our thinking. How would we govern
ourselves? It is unlikely that we would use the systems we have today.
Modern representative democracy was the best form of government that
eighteenth-century technology could invent. The twenty-first century is
very different: scientifically, technically, and philosophically. For
example, eighteenth-century democracy was designed under the assumption
that travel and communications were both hard…

<h1 id="2025-04-07-galène-was-comparatively-easy-to-setup">
2025-04-07 Galène was comparatively easy to setup
</h1>
<p>
I remember how tricky the Jitsi setup was, at the time. When we used it,
system load for my small server jumped up to seven or eight. And in the
end, we all ended up on Discord. But with Discord showing annoying ads
even to paying customers, I’m taking another look at the alternatives.
</p>
<p>
From my point of view, <a href="https://galene.org/">Galène</a> has the
benefits of requiring just a single binary for installation. Sure,
deployment is trickier, but in typical Go fashion, you get a huge binary
that you copy over to the server and you’re essentially ready to test
it.
</p>
<p>
So what did I do?
</p>
<p>
I created a system user <code>galene</code> with home directory
<code>/home/galene</code>. There is no <code>galene</code> group.
</p>
<p>
This is where the binary lives.
</p>
<p>
I copied the example <code>galene.service</code>
<a href="https://galene.org/INSTALL.html#:~:text=systemd">from the
website</a> and adapted it (by changing <code>Group=galene</code> to
<code>Group=nogroup</code>).
</p>
<p>
My Galène installation does not live behind a reverse proxy, so there is
no logging of bots trying to access it. Perhaps a problem to solve for
later.
</p>
<p>
I had to add a bunch of lines to my <code>/etc/apache2/hook.sh</code>
that runs whenever <code>mod_md</code> gets new certificates. When that
happens, Galène also gets a copy, with permissions set appropriately.
And it gets restarted.
</p>
<p>
I created a JSON file to define a single group, making me the operator
(with a password), and allowing
<a href="https://galene.org/README.html#:~:text=wildcard">wildcard
users</a> (all sharing the same password). I handed out this password on
the IRC channel we use to chat and hang out.
</p>
<p>
Should we end up with two dozen people or more, then I’ll write a web
app to administrate users and groups via the web. An
<a href="https://galene.org/README.API.html">API</a> to do this already
exists. Or if I’m feeling evil, I’ll add the functionality to administer
them to an IRC bot. 😂

As you folks know, I look up to Final Cut Pro on iPad for UI
inspiration.
</p>
<p>
Today I was psyched to see Final Cut got keyboard shortcuts, but for
once, I am vastly ahead of them. They just dumped all shortcuts with no
organization whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
I think they did that because doing it today in SwiftUI requires
shortcut centralization. It was a pain to implement, but I think Xogot
is better for doing it.

Abstract
</h3>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://www.starwars.com/video/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope-opening-crawl">A
long time ago in a Web far, far away it is a period of civil war</a>
between two conceptions of how digital information could be preserved
for posterity. On one side is the mighty Empire, concerned with the
theoretical threat of format obsolescence. On the other are the Rebels,
devoted to the practical problem of collecting the bits and ensuring
that they survive. Among the rebels are the
<a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and the
<a href="https://lockss.org">LOCKSS Program</a>. This is the story of
how the rebels won, thanks in no small part to Cliff Lynch’s sustained
focus on the big picture.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Thirty Years Ago
</h3>
It all started just thirty years ago. In January 1995 the idea that the
long-term survival of digital information was a significant problem was
popularized by Jeff Rothenberg’s <i>Scientific American</i> article
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24980135.pdf?casa_token=WdKPZuD47ksAAAAA:uRBwPull8jM4JiKf4zYaSXQCkFK85fmfQ6hoYdM6b9KPx2l181JPRwfE_PPgmF_pGdfae_vFiMWiw1bes3fwPksCX0saQDTyP79zRux3ePR0TsiNErE"><i>Ensuring
the longevity of digital documents</i></a>. Rothenberg’s concept of a
“digital document” was of things like Microsoft Word files on a CD,
individual objects encoded in a format private to a particular
application. His concern was with <i>format obsolescence</i>; the idea
that the rapid evolution of these applications would, over time, make it
impossible to access the content of objects using an obsolete
format.<br /> <br /> Rothenberg was concerned with interpreting the
bits; he essentially assumed that the bits would survive. Given the
bits, he identified two possible techniques for accessing the
content:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<i>Format migration</i>: translating the content into a less obsolete
format to be accessed by a <i>different</i> application.
</li>
<li>
<i>Emulation</i>: using a software implementation of the original
computer’s hardware to access the content using the <i>same</i>
application.
</li>
</ul>
Emulation was a well-established technique, dating from the early days
of IBM computers.<br />
<h3>
The Web
</h3>
But five months later an event signalled that Rothenberg’s concerns had
been overtaken by events. Stanford pioneered the transition of academic
publishing from paper to the Web when Vicky was part of the
<a href="http://highwire.stanford.edu/">HighWire Press</a> team that put
the <a href="http://www.jbc.org/"><i>Journal of Biological
Chemistry</i></a> on the Web. By then it was clear that, going forward,
the important information would be encoded in Web formats such as HTML
and PDF. Because each format with which Rothenberg was concerned was
defined by a single application it could evolve quickly. But Web formats
were open standards, implemented in multiple applications. In effect
they were <i>network protocols</i>.<br /> <br /> The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_deployment">deployment of
IPv6</a>, introduced in December 1995, shows that network protocols are
extraordinarily difficult to evolve, because of the need for timely
updates to many independent implementations. Format obsolescence implies
backwards incompatibility; this is close to impossible in network
protocols because it would partition the network. As David discussed in
2012’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2012/10/formats-through-time.html"><i>Formats
Through Time</i></a>, the first two decades of the Web showed that Web
formats essentially don’t go obsolete.<br /> <br /> The rapid evolution
of Rothenberg’s “digital documents” had effectively stopped, because
they were no longer being created and distributed in that way. Going
forward, there would be a legacy of a static set of static documents in
these formats. Libraries and archives would need tools for managing
those they acquired, and eventually
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2015/11/follow-up-to-emulation-report.html">emulation</a>,
the technique Rothenberg favored, would provide them. But by then it
turned out that, unless information was on the Web, almost no-one cared
about it.<br />
<h3>
Integrity of Digital Information
</h3>
Thus the problem for digital preservation was the survival of the bits,
not of their format, aggravated by the vast scale of the content to be
preserved. In May the following year Brewster Kahle established the
<a href="https://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a> to address the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/the-evanescent-web.html">evanescence
of Web pages</a>. This comes in two forms, <i>link rot</i>, when links
no longer resolve, and <i>content drift</i>, when they resolve to
different content.<br /> <br /> This is where Cliff Lynch enters the
story. As he did in many fields, he focused on the big picture. He
understood the importance to the big digital preservation picture of
simply collecting the content and ensuring its integrity. Already in
1994’s
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199412)45:10%3C737::AID-ASI4%3E3.0.CO;2-8"><i>The
Integrity of Digital Information: Mechanics and Definitional
Issues</i></a> he had written:<br />
<blockquote>
A system of information distribution that preserves integrity should
also provide the user with a reasonable expectation of correct
attribution and source of works. Even if deliberate attempts at fraud,
misdirection, or covert revision may sometimes slip through the routine
processes of the system these problems can be adjudicated by a formal
challenge and examination system ,,, The expectation should be that
violations of integrity cannot be trivially accomplished.
</blockquote>
And he had noted that even in the print world this
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199412)45:10%3C737::AID-ASI4%3E3.0.CO;2-8">expectation
was fading</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We assume that print is difficult to alter, that print authorship and
source attribution are relatively trustworthy, and that printed works
are normally mass-produced in identical copies. In fact, current
technology trends undermine these assumptions. Printed publications are
becoming increasingly tailored to very narrow audiences, and it has
become easy to imitate the format of well-known and professionally
presented publications.
</blockquote>
Lynch discussed how the survival of the bits could be confirmed using
digital hashes, the potential for digital signatures to confirm
authenticity, and why such signatures were not used in practice.<br />
<h3>
LOCKSS
</h3>
In October 1998 we proposed to Michael Keller, Stanford’s Librarian, a
decentralized system whereby libraries could cooperate to collect the
academic journals to which they subscribed, and preserve them against
the three threats we saw, technological, economic and legal. He gave us
three instructions:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Don’t cost me any money.
</li>
<li>
Don’t get me into trouble.
</li>
<li>
Do what you want.
</li>
</ul>
Thus was the LOCKSS (Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe) Program born. The
prototype was funded first by two small grants from Michael Lesk at the
NSF, and then by
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/08/a-tribute-to-don-waters.html">Donald
Waters at the Mellon Foundation</a>, both of whom like Lynch understood
the importance of assuring the survival of, and access to, the bits.
Development of the first production system was mostly funded by a
signficant grant from the NSF and by Sun Microsystems. We didn’t cost
Keller any money, quite the reverse considering Stanford’s overhead on
grants!<br /> <br /> The LOCKSS system, like the Internet Archive, was a
system for ensuring the survival of, and access to, the bits in their
original format. This was a problem; somehow, despite Rotheberg’s
advocacy of emulation, the conventional wisdom in the digital
preservation community rapidly became that the <i>sine qua non</i> of
digital preservation was defending against format obsolescence by using
format migration based upon collecting preservation metadata.<br />
<br /> Actually, the <i>sine qua non</i> of digital preservation is
ensuring that the bits survive. Neither Kahle nor we saw any return on
investing in preservation metadata or format migration. We both saw
scaling up to capture more than a tiny fraction of the at-risk content
as the goal. Future events showed we were right, but at the time the
digital preservation community viewed LOCKSS with great skepticism, as
“not real digital preservation”.<br />
<h3>
Paper Library Analogy
</h3>
In his
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199412)45:10%3C737::AID-ASI4%3E3.0.CO;2-8">1994
paper</a> Lynch had described how the paper world’s equivalent of
ensuring the bits survive works; “Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe”:<br />
<blockquote>
When something is published in print, legitimate copies … are widely
distributed to various organizations, such as libraries, which maintain
them as public record. These copies bear a publication date, and the
publisher essentially authenticates the claims of authorship … By
examining this record, control of which is widely distributed … it is
possible, even years after publication, to determine who published a
given work and when it was published. It is very hard to revise the
published record, since this involves all of the copies and somehow
altering or destroying them.
</blockquote>
Compare this with how we summarized libraries’ role in our first major
paper on LOCKSS,
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix2000/freenix/full_papers/rosenthal/rosenthal.pdf"><i>Permanent
Web Publishing</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Acquire lots of copies. Scatter them around the world so that it is easy
to find some of them and hard to find all of them. Lend or copy your
copies when other librarians need them.
</blockquote>
From a system engineering viewpoint,
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix2000/freenix/full_papers/rosenthal/rosenthal.pdf">we
wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Libraries’ circulating collections form a model fault-tolerant
distributed system. It is highly replicated, and exploits this to
deliver a service that is far more reliable than any individual
component. There is no single point of failure, no central control to be
subverted. There is a low degree of policy coherence between the
replicas, and thus low systemic risk. The desired behavior of the system
as a whole emerges as the participants take actions in their own local
interests and cooperate in ad-hoc, informal ways with other
participants.<br /> <br /> If librarians are to have confidence in an
electronic system, it will help if the system works in a familiar way.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Threats
</h3>
Lynch’s focus on the big picture meant he also understood that economic
and legal threats were at least as significant as technological ones.
For example, in 1996’s
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Uj-LIewe3TUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Lynch+%22Integrity+Issues+in+Electronic+Publishing%22&amp;ots=MHICOKk4Zv&amp;sig=FWmKVuu6f0yJTuWEsNhzNDPWdZ0"><i>Integrity
Issues in Electronic Publishing</i></a> he wrote:<br />
<blockquote>
In the networked information environment, the act of publication is ill
defined, as is the responsibility for retaining and providing long-term
access to various “published” versions of a work. Because of the legal
framework under which electronic information is typically distributed,
matters are much worse than they are generally perceived to be. Even if
the act of publication is defined and the responsibility for the
retention of materials is clarified, the integrity of the record of
published works is critically compromised by the legal constraints that
typically accompany the dissemination of information in electronic
formats.
</blockquote>
He discussed some electronic journal pilots in a
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J123v28n01_12">1996 talk</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One key question Lynch identified was how acceptable transactional
pricing systems will be to end users or to producers, suppliers, and
rights holders. Will such models cause streams of income and
expenditures to become unworkably erratic?
</blockquote>
Now there are two lawsuits from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive#Book_publishers'_lawsuit">copyright</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive#Music_publishers'_lawsuit">cartels</a>
aimed at destroying the Internet Archive, it is easy to understand that
the most critical threats to preserved content are legal. A
quarter-century ago this was less obvious in general. But even then,
facing the oligopoly academic publishers, it was obvious to us that
LOCKSS had to be designed around the copyright law.<br /> <br /> Lynch
continued to remind the library community of the economic and legal
threats, and the broader issues impeding preservation of our digital
heritage. Early examples include:<br />
<ul>
<li>
1999’s
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DYleyyzxH7kC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA140&amp;ots=37fkUmUZbn&amp;sig=dEsc05rL0r-x5ydLLrxUsGn-nGE"><i>Experiential
Documents and the Technologies of Remembrance</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The retention, reuse, management, and control of this new cornucopia of
recorded experience and synthesized content in the digital environment
will, I expect, become a matter of great controversy. This will include,
but not be limited to, privacy, accountability and intellectual property
rights in their broadest senses. And these materials will hopefully
become an essential and growing part of our library and archival
collections in the 21<sup>st</sup> century - particularly as we sort
through these controversies.

the Threshold of Discontinuity: The New Genres of Scholarly
Communication and the Role of the Research Library</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is unclear how to finance archiving and preservation of these
materials. Their volume is no longer driven by acquisitions budgets or
by the scholarly publishing system, but by activities that may take
place largely beyond the control of the library. And, of course, costs
are open ended and unpredictable for digital preservation, unlike the
costs associated with preserving modern printed materials (on acid-free
paper).

documents deceive: Trust and provenance as new factors for information
retrieval in a tangled web</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Digital documents in a distributed environment may not behave
consistently; because they are presented both to people who want to view
them and software systems that want to index them by computer programs,
they can be changed, perhaps radically, for each presentation. Each
presentation can be tailored for a specific recipient.
</blockquote>

2003’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J111v38n03_04"><i>The Coming
Crisis in Preserving Our Digital Cultural Heritage</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Preservation of digital materials is a continuous, active process
(requiring steady funding), rather than a practice of benignly
neglecting artifacts stored in a hospitable environment, perhaps
punctuated by interventions every few decades for repairs.
</blockquote>
And:<br />
<blockquote>
It is probably not an exaggeration to say that the most fundamental
problem facing cultural heritage institutions is the ability to obtain
digital materials together with sufficient legal rights to be able to
preserve these materials and make them available to the public over the
long term. Without explicit and affirmative permissions from the
rights-holders, this is likely to be impossible.
</blockquote>
And:<br />
<blockquote>
What is threatening us today is not an abuse of centralized power, but
rather a low-key, haphazard deterioration of the intellectual and
cultural record that is driven primarily by economic motivations and the
largely unintended and unforeseen consequences of new intellectual
property laws that were enacted at the behest of powerful commercial
interests and in the context of new and rapidly evolving technologies.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
There were many others.<br />
<h3>
The “Standard Model”
</h3>
The LOCKSS team repeatedly made the case that preserving Web content was
a different problem from preserving Rothenberg’s digital documents, and
thus that applying the entire apparatus of “preservation metadata”,
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/">PREMIS</a>,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/fits/">FITS</a>,
<a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove">JHOVE</a>, and format
normalization to Web content was an
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/03/premis-lockss.html">ineffective
waste of scarce resources</a>. Despite this, the drumbeat of criticism
that LOCKSS wasn’t “real digital preservation” continued unabated.<br />
<br /> After six years, the LOCKSS team lost patience and devoted the
necessary effort to implement a capability they were sure would never be
used in practice. The team implemented, demonstrated and in 2005
published
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1045/january2005-rosenthal">transparent,
on-demand format migration of Web content</a> preserved in the LOCKSS
network. This was possible because the specification of the HTTP
protocol that underlies the Web <i>supports the format metadata needed
to render Web content</i>. If it lacked such metadata, Web browsers
wouldn’t be possible.<br /> <br /> Unsurprisingly, this demonstration
failed to silence the proponents of the “standard model of digital
preservation”. So five more years later David published
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/LibraryHighTech2010.pdf"><i>Format
Obsolescence: Assessing the Threat and the Defenses</i></a>, a detailed
exposition and critique of the standard model’s components, which
were:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Before obsolescence occurs, a digital format registry collects
information about the target format, including a description of how
content can be identified as being in the target format, and a
specification of the target format from which a renderer can be created.
</li>
<li>
Based on this information, format identification and verification tools
are enhanced to allow them to extract format metadata from content in
the target format, including the use of the format and the extent to
which the content adheres to the format specification. This metadata is
preserved with the content.
</li>
<li>
The format registry regularly scans the computing environment to
determine whether the formats it registers are obsolescent, and issues
notifications.
</li>
<li>
Upon receiving these notifications, preservation systems review their
format metadata to determine whether they hold content in an obsolescent
format.
</li>
<li>
If they do, they commission an implementor to retrieve the relevant
format specification from the format registry and use it to create a
converter from the now-obsolescent target format to some less doomed
format.
</li>
<li>
The preservation systems then use this converter and their format
metadata to convert the preserved content into the less doomed format.
</li>
</ul>
The critique included pointing out that creating a format specification
for a proprietary format and then implementing a renderer from it was
almost impossible, that the existence of open-source renderers made
doing so redundant, that most HTML on the Web
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_editor">failed validation</a>
(a consequence of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel’s
Law</a>), that there were no examples of widely used formats going
obsolete, and that
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2008/01/format-obsolescence-right-here-right.html">Microsoft’s
small step in that direction</a> in 2008 met with universal disdain and
was
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2008/01/05/ms_office_sp3_woes/">abandoned</a>.
It also
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/LibraryHighTech2010.pdf">noted
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the standard model is based on format migration, a technique of which
Rothenberg’s article
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24980135.pdf?casa_token=WdKPZuD47ksAAAAA:uRBwPull8jM4JiKf4zYaSXQCkFK85fmfQ6hoYdM6b9KPx2l181JPRwfE_PPgmF_pGdfae_vFiMWiw1bes3fwPksCX0saQDTyP79zRux3ePR0TsiNErE">disapproves</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Finally, [format migration] suffers from a fatal flaw. … Shifts of this
kind make it difficult or impossible to translate old documents into new
standard forms.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The critique was awarded the 2011 Outstanding Paper Award for Library
High Tech, but again failed to silence the standard model’s proponents.
Although we no longer follow the digital preservation literature
closely, it is our impression that over the intervening 15 years
advocacy of the standard model has died down, thanks in no small part to
Lynch’s sustained focus on the big picture.<br /> <br /></p>

I prepared myself for about a month worth of fixing small issues for
AppStore review and figured "during the back and forth, we can wrap up
documentation"
</p>
<p>
They did catch one problem, we fixed it.
</p>
<p>
But Xogot is approved for release!
</p>
<p>
Now we need to complete the documentation :-)

<p>If I were a sassy Democratic Party leader I’d cop to being woke. “Why
yes I am woke. Aren’t you?” The Repubs have never explained why it’s bad
to be awake. Dems have to learn how to engage to win. Another one –
“read, fire, aim” is how Trump leads, just look at the tariffs, and it’s
been a huge disaster for hard-working American wage-earners of all
generations. The “all generations” part opens an interesting
conversation, how it isn’t just old people or young people, it’s also
people who are working today whose earnings are being stolen, and those
of us who have been working for 50 years who were paying into a fund so
we could benefit when we retire. That money is coming out of your
paycheck with no intention of ever paying it back. That’s the
Republican-run America. Not so great.</p>

<h2 id="the-cootie-zone">The Cootie Zone</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
All Trump is doing is making the US the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooties">cootie</a> zone.
</p>
<p>
We won’t make anything here and we won’t buy anything.
</p>
<p>
We’ll have nice 2025 computers, phones, cars, medicine, lumber, energy,
but all the shit we import will break and be used up and we won’t be
able to replace it.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the world will wonder why they cared so much about the US,
as the world gets along just fine without us.
</p>
<p>
And that $1 trillion military budget, forget it – not only did they fire
everyone at the IRS, but no one is making any money so there aren’t
actually any taxes to pay, and there sure as hell aren’t any tariffs
because no one can afford to buy anything produced anywhere, in the US
or the rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
We become a very sad, poor, sick, uneducated country, but – Trump will
be on Mount Rushmore and his face will be on the $20 bill, which no one
sees because no one has $20.
</p>
<p>
And thus, dear friends, America has become Great Again!

<h2 id="the-big-vision-behind-wordland">The big vision behind
WordLand</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I believe that eventually WordPress will be the hub for writers the way
the web itself became the the hub for apps. Initially, the web wasn’t
the best place to host apps, the Mac had a much more developed set of
meaningful features for app devs, and we already knew the Mac APIs where
the web was strange and incomplete.
</p>
<p>
Yet most of the energy in AppLand quickly shifted to the web because of
three advantages it had:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Anyone could publish for it, there was no platform vendor.
</li>
<li>
The networking model was open and simple, where the Mac’s was hidden
behind incomplete and poorly written docs.
</li>
<li>
The Mac’s networking only worked on the Mac at a time when Windows was
becoming dominant, and the web offered simplicity that neither platform
could match.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The web made writing network apps a joy, where the Mac made it a slog.
No matter how much time you spent developing, it never resulted in
success.
</p>
<p>
There was no question for me when I saw the web, I had to be there.
</p>
<p>
Substack and Ghost are like Mac and Windows at the dawn of the web.
Their big mistake imho is they weren’t built on WordPress, which can and
should imho serve as the base platform for writing on the web. If an
ecosystem of writing tools is built on the Wordpress foundation how
could silo’d writing tools hope to compete?
</p>
<p>
If you question the choice of Wordpress, what would you go with in its
place? I argue that whatever it is, it would work much like Wordpress,
which has a 20+ year head start, is stable, scales, is widely supported,
and open source, so if you don’t like the company behind it, you can
choose not to use their distribution.
</p>
<p>
With WordLand we are testing the water hopefully proving that it is
possible to create a functional writing environment on the WordPress
foundation. Why is that such an advantage? Because, like the word
processing products of the 80s on various OSes, these apps should be
able to share data. One day you may feel like writing something with
WordLand and a few days later you might want to try editing the same
document using a different editing tool. As long as they both ingest and
emit Markdown, they should have no trouble editing each others’
documents. This is where the benefit of a common platform becomes
insurmountable, because the silos insist you use their editor and only
their editor and an open platform with open data formats lets you move
between apps that interop. There’s a reason so many word processors
thrived in the 80s, because the needs and tastes of writers vary so
much, and technically it was possible to move data around in an ad hoc
way.
</p>
<p>
Until WordLand, tools for writers on the Wordpress platform were
practically nonexistent. I think that can change now, because the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">middleware</a> that
connects WordLand to Wordpress is both easy to understand, for
developers, and open source under the most liberal license. Any app that
connects with Wordpress through this API will interop with WordLand so
totally that it could replace WordLand.
</p>
<p>
I would be happy if WordLand played the role of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite">MacWrite</a> in the Mac
ecosystem of the 80s. At the outset it was the only writing tool for the
Mac, and set the usability pattern for all that followed. As a result
the Mac platform, even though initially its appeal was mainly to
developers and designers, quickly boomed as a writer’s platform. I
strongly believe Wordpress has this potential.
</p>
<p>
I think writers need the same variety and open possibilities as
developers, and the existing writer’s systems are not offering that
choice. I believe this is the start of the writers web, that should, if
we do it right, and if my intuition is correct, grow like the web itself
at inception. My bet is that an expansive approach will yield far more
creativity in a very important area, writing, and should quickly become
the place writers want to be.

<h2 id="arguing-against-calea">Arguing Against CALEA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-08, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
At a Congressional
<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/salt-typhoon-securing-americas-telecommunications-from-state-sponsored-cyber-attacks/">hearing</a>
earlier this week, Matt Blaze
<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Blaze-Written-Testimony.pdf">made
the point</a> that CALEA, the 1994 law that forces telecoms to make
phone calls wiretappable, is outdated in today’s threat environment and
should be rethought:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In other words, while the legally-mandated CALEA capability requirements
have changed little over the last three decades, the infrastructure that
must implement and protect it has changed radically. This has greatly
expanded the “attack surface” that must be defended to prevent
unauthorized wiretaps, especially at scale. The job of the illegal
eavesdropper has gotten significantly easier, with many more options and
opportunities for them to exploit. Compromising our telecommunications
infrastructure is now little different from performing any other kind of
computer intrusion or data breach, a well-known and endemic
cybersecurity problem. To put it bluntly, something like Salt Typhoon
was inevitable, and will likely happen again unless significant changes
are made…

<p>Major indexes on the stock market began down more than 3% today when,

delaying his tariffs by three months sent stocks surging upward by
almost 8%.</p>

<p>Rachel Maddow’s show these days often begins with a hard-to-watch
over-the-top endorsement of Bluesky. She shouldn’t be doing that. It’s a
private company and someday she may criticize them as strongly as she
did Facebook. I’d love to hear her explain exactly what’s the difference
between Bluesky and Facebook. A lot less than you might think.</p>

<h2 id="paul-evan-peters-award-lecture">Paul Evan Peters Award
Lecture</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
At the Spring 2025 Membership Meeting of the
<a href="https://cni.org/">Coalition for Networked Information</a>,
Vicky and I received the
<a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/awards/pep-award">Paul Evan
Peters Award</a>.<br /> <br /> You can tell this is an extraordinary
honor from the list of previous awardees, and the fact that it is the
first time it has been awarded in successive years. Part of the award is
the opportunity to make an extended presentation to open the meeting.
Our talk was entitled <i>Lessons From LOCKSS</i>, and the abstract
was:<br />
<blockquote>
Vicky and David will look back over their two decades with the LOCKSS
Program. Vicky will focus on the Program’s initial goals and how they
evolved as the landscape of academic communication changed. David will
focus on the Program’s technology, how it evolved, and how this history
reveals a set of seductive, persistent but impractical ideas.

First, we are extremely grateful to the Paul Evan Peters award committee
and <a href="https://cni.org">CNI</a>, and to the
<a href="https://arl.org">Association of Research Libraries</a>,
<a href="https://www.educause.edu/">EDUCAUSE</a>, Microsoft and Xerox
who endowed the award.<br /> <br /> David and I are honored and
astonished by this award. Honored because it is the premiere award in
the field, and astonished because we left the field more than seven
years ago to take up our new full-time career as grandparents. The
performance metrics are tough, but it’s a fabulous gig.<br /> <br />
This talk will be mostly historical. David will discuss the technology’s
design and some lessons we learned deploying it. First I will talk about
our goals when, more than a quarter-century ago, we
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2013/10/it-was-fifteen-years-ago-today.html">walked
into Michael Keller’s office</a> and pitched the idea that became the
<a href="https://www.lockss.org">LOCKSS Program</a>. Mike gave us three
instructions:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Don’t cost me any money.
</li>
<li>
Don’t get me into trouble.
</li>
<li>
Do what you want
</li>

<br /> We succeeded in each of these. That the program is still going is
thanks to many people. Snowden Becker who is here today represents a
much larger team who work tirelessly to sustain the program. Many others
helped along the way. Michael Lesk then at NSF and Donald Waters then at
the Mellon Foundation provided essential funding. This slide attempts to
thank everyone, but we’re sure we’ve left people out — it was a long
time ago.<br /> <br />

Let’s get started. Over the centuries libraries developed a dual role.
By building collections they provided <i>current</i> readers with access
to information. Then they exercised stewardship over these collections
to safeguard <i>future</i> readers’ access.<br /> <br />

Libraries transitioned from the print to the digital world over a couple
of decades. In the mid 1980’s the Library of Congress experimented with
readers accessing journals on 12-inch optical media.<br /> <br />

In late 1989 Tim Berners-Lee’s first Web browser accessed a page from
his first Web server.<br /> <br /> Two years later the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center put the first US Web page online and people started
thinking about how this new publishing medium would impact the academy.
An early effort came in 1993 when Cliff Lynch wrote a 105-page report
for the federal Office of Technology Assessment.<br />

Now, consider a library acquiring information in an electronic format.
<b>Such information is almost never, today, sold to a library (under the
doctrine of first sale); rather, it is licensed to the library that
acquires it</b>, with the terms under which the acquiring library can
utilize the information defined by a contract typically far more
restrictive than copyright law. The licensing contract typically
includes statements that define the user community permitted to utilize
the electronic information as well as terms that define the specific
uses that this user community may make of the licensed electronic
information. These terms typically do not reflect any consideration of
public policy decisions such as fair use, and in fact the licensing
organization may well be liable for what its patrons do with the
licensed information.

Cliff’s report was wide-ranging and insightful. In particular, he noted
the change from the

Very few contracts with publishers today are perpetual licenses; rather,
they are licenses for a fixed period of time, with terms subject to
renegotiation when that time period expires. Libraries typically have no
controls on price increase when the license is renewed; thus, rather
than considering a traditional collection development decision about
whether to renew a given subscription in light of recent price
increases, they face the <b>decision as to whether to lose all existing
material that is part of the subscription as well as future material</b>
if they choose not to commit funds to cover the publisher’s price
increase at renewal time.

He pointed out that the change made future readers’ access completely
dependent upon continued payment and the publishers’ whims, thus
blocking libraries from fulfilling their critical stewardship
role.<br /> <br /> In 1995 I was part of the small team that developed
Stanford’s Highwire Press. Highwire was the first Web publishing
platform for academic journals. By then the problems Cliff identified
impacting libraries’ stewardship role had become obvious. At the time I
attended a lot of conferences. A frequent discussion topic was the
ramifications of libraries transitioning from content ownership to
content access. Many highly placed librarians thought the change was
great – no more building collections, no more stewardship
responsibility! I strongly disagreed. Hiking with David after one such
conference I described how stewardship worked in the paper world and how
it didn’t in the Web world. His response was “I can build a system that
works the way paper does”.<br /> <br /> David’s and my goal was to model
the way paper worked, to provide librarians with an easy, familiar,
affordable way to build and steward traditional collections that were
migrating from paper to online.<br /> <br /> Libraries fulfill their
stewardship role when future access is ensured. Stewardship occurs when
libraries take possession of and manage cultural and intellectual
assets. We thought it vital for libraries to retain their stewardship
role in the scholarly communication ecosystem. We didn’t want them to
become simply convenient places to work and drink
coffee<sup><a href="#Footnote1">[1]</a></sup>.<br /> <br />

Stewardship matters for at least three reasons:<br />
<ol>
<li>
To protect privacy.
</li>
<li>
To protect first sale.

<li>
To defend against censorship.

transfer when content is acquired.<br /> <br /> The

enables libraries to maintain and circulate knowledge. First Sale
ensures that the public, especially future generations, benefit from
today’s and yesterday’s works of literature, science, and culture.<br />
<br /> Stewardship resists censorship when there are multiple copies
under multiple stewards.<br /> <br /> Today, book banning is on the
rise. Librarians are being forced to remove items from circulation.
Content ownership ensures materials can’t be erased from view without
detection. Stewardship of banned materials allows librarians to choose
whether to safeguard these materials for future readers.<br /> <br />

Government Documents are and always have been in the crosshairs of
censors, I’ll mention four efforts providing countervailing
forces:<br />
<ol>
<li>
First, the U.S. LOCKSS Docs Network. The Government Publishing Office
(GPO), produces and distributes government documents. In the paper
world, the Federal Depository Library Program distributed documents to
over 1,000 libraries across the nation. To recall documents, the
government had to contact the librarians and ask them to withdraw the
materials. It was a transparent process.<br />

This is a sample of withdrawn Federal documents.<br /> <br /> Online,
there were no censorship guardrails. In 2008 a small group of librarians
formed the U. S. Docs LOCKSS network. This program is a digital
instantiation of the U.S. Federal Depository Library Program. In
partnership with the Government Publishing Office, participating
libraries have recreated the distributed, transparent, censor resistant
nature of the depository paper system.<br />

The community recently relearned a lesson history failed to teach.
Digital preservation’s biggest threat is insider attack. In recent
months an unknown number of critical government databases are gone, or
altered. The antidote to insider attack is multiple copies under
multiple stewards. In LOCKSS language, let’s make it easy to find some
of the copies, but hard to find all the copies.
</li>
</ol>
I want to say a few words about sustainability. We worked very hard to
make the LOCKSS Program sustainable. Don Waters at the Mellon Foundation
awarded LOCKSS a matching grant to transition from grant funding to the
Red Hat model of free software and paid support.<br />

Funding programs like LOCKSS is difficult. The LOCKSS Program reinstates
stewardship and enables libraries as memory organizations. This is a
hard sell. Librarians spend scarce resources to support current readers,
spending them to ensure materials are available to tomorrow’s readers …
not so much. While fundraising fluctuates, costs are steady. To ensure
stability, we accumulated reserves by having a very lean staff and being
stingy with salaries. <br />

And then along came CLOCKSS, where publishers took the lead to establish
a community run archive that implements library values. In 2006, a
handful of publishers, notably the late Karen Hunter, Elsevier,
suggested a partnership between libraries and publishers to form a
community run archive. In 2008, after a pilot funded by the founding
archive libraries, contributing publishers, and the Library of Congress’
NDIIPP, the CLOCKSS archive went into production.<br /> <br /> Identical
copies of archived content are held in eleven libraries worldwide
(Scotland, Australia, Japan, Germany, Canada, and six in the United
States). This international footprint ensures content is safe from
shifting ideologies, or nefarious players. As in all LOCKSS networks, if
a bad actor tries to remove or change content, the technology warns
humans to investigate.<br /> <br /> The CLOCKSS founding librarians and
publishers unanimously agreed that when archived content becomes
unavailable, it will be hosted from multiple sources, open access. An
example: Heterocycles was an important chemistry journal. Established in
1973, it abruptly ceased publication in 2023 after 50 years.
Inexplicably the journal also disappeared from the publisher’s web site;
current subscribers lost all access. The content was unavailable from
anywhere.<br /> <br />

Fortunately, the entire run of the Heterocycles journal was archived in
CLOCKSS. In June 2024, two CLOCKSS archive libraries, the University of
Edinburgh and Stanford University each made all 106 volumes open access
on the web.<br /> <br /> The CLOCKSS Archive is governed equally by
publishers and librarians, in true community spirit. However, publishers
provide the bulk of financial support, contributing 70% of incoming
funds. Libraries contribute only 30%.
<a href="mailtoa:wise@clockss.org">Alicia Wise</a>, CLOCKSS executive
director reports this gap is wideningover time. Ironically, the
publishers many librarians consider “rapacious” are paying for an
archive that upholds traditional library values and protects content
access for future readers. <br /> <br /> After more than a
quarter-century, the LOCKSS Program continues to collect, to preserve
and to provide access to many genres of content. The business model has
evolved, but the goals have persisted. I will now hand over to David to
talk about the technology, which has also evolved and persisted.<br />

The ARL Serials Initiative forms part of a special campaign mounted by
librarians in the 1980s against the high cost of serials subscriptions.
This is not the first time that libraries have suffered from high serial
prices. For example, in 1927 the Association of American Universities
reported that:<br />
<blockquote>
“Librarians are suffering because of the increasing volume of
publications and rapidly rising prices. Of special concern is the much
larger number of periodicals that are available and that members of the
faculty consider essential to the successful conduct of their work. Many
instances were found in which science departments were obligated to use
all of their allotment for library purposes to purchase their periodical
literature which was regarded as necessary for the work of the
department”

The power imbalance between publishers and their customers is of long
standing, and it especially affects the academic
literature.<sup><a href="#Footnote2">[2]</a></sup> Simplistic
application of Web technology drove a change from <i>purchasing</i> a
copy of the content to <i>renting</i> access to the publisher’s
copy.<sup><a href="#Footnote3">[3]</a></sup> This greatly amplifies the
preexisting power imbalance. Thus in designing the LOCKSS system, we
faced three challenges:<br />
<ul>
<li>
to model for the Web the way libraries worked on paper,
</li>
<li>
to somehow do so within the constraints of contract law and copyright,
</li>
<li>
to ensure the system cost was negligible compared to subscription costs.
</li>
</ul>
From a system engineering viewpoint, what struck me about Vicky’s
description of the paper library system was that libraries’ circulating
collections form a model fault-tolerant decentralized system. It is
highly replicated, and exploits this to deliver a service that is far
more reliable than any individual component. There is no single point of
failure, no central control to be subverted. The desired behavior of the
system as a whole emerges as the participants take actions in their own
local interests and cooperate in ad-hoc, informal ways with other
participants.<br /> <br />

LOCKSS Design Goals<br />
<div data-align="left">
Allow libraries to:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<b>Collect</b> journals to which they subscribed
</li>
<li>
Give current readers <b>access</b> to their collection
</li>
<li>
<b>Preserve</b> their collection for future readers
</li>
<li>
<b>Cooperate</b> with other libraries
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
The system I envisaged on the hike would consist of a LOCKSS box at each
library, the digital analog of the stacks, that would hold the content
the library had purchased. It would need these characteristics of the
paper system:<br />
<ul>
<li>
It would allow libraries to <i>collect</i> material to which they
subscribed from the Web.
</li>
<li>
It would allow libraries’ readers to <i>access</i> material they had
collected.
</li>
<li>
It would allow them to <i>preserve</i> their collections against the
multiple frailties of digital information.
</li>
<li>
It would allow libraries to <i>cooperate</i>, the analog of
inter-library loan and copy.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Collect
</h4>
The collect part was both conceptually simple and mostly off-the-shelf.
Since the journals were pay-walled, as with paper each library had to
collect its own subscription content. But collecting content is what Web
browsers do. When they fetch content from a URL they don’t just display
it, they store it in a cache on local storage. They can re-display it
without re-fetching it. The system needed a browser-like “Hotel
California” cache that never got flushed, and a Web crawler like those
of search engines so that <i>all</i> the library’s subscribed content
ended up in the cache.<br /> <br /> Because we lacked “first sale”
rights, the crawler had to operate with permission from the publisher,
which took the form of a statement on their Web site. No permission, no
collection.<br />
<h4>
Access
</h4>
The access part was also conceptually simple and mostly off-the-shelf.
Readers should see the content from the publisher unless it wasn’t
available. Their LOCKSS box should act as a transparent Web proxy,
forwarding requests to the publisher and, if the response were negative,
responding with the cached copy.<br />
<h4>
Preserve
</h4>
The preserve part was conceptually simple — just don’t remove old
content from the cache on disk. But it was more of a problem to
implement for three reasons:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Disks are not 100% reliable in the short term and are 0% reliable over
library timescales. Over time, content in the cache would get corrupted
or lost.
</li>
<li>
Because libraries were under budget pressure and short of IT resources,
the hardware of the LOCKSS box had to be cheap, thus not specially
reliable.
</li>
<li>
Content in the cache would be seen by humans only in exceptional
circumstances, so detecting corruption or loss could not depend upon
humans.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Cooperate
</h4>
Cooperation provided the solution to the problems of preservation. We
expected considerable overlap between libraries’ subscriptions. Thus
each journal would be collected by many libraries, just as in the paper
system. The LOCKSS boxes at each library subscribing to each journal
could compare their versions, voting on it in a version of the standard
Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm. A library that lost a vote could
repair their damaged copy from another library.<br /> <br /> The goal of
stewardship drove LOCKSS’ approach to preservation; given a limited
budget and a realistic range of threats, data survives better in many
cheap, unreliable, loosely-coupled replicas than in a single expensive,
durable one.<br />

Technology Lessons (David)

Our initial vision for the system was reasonably simple, but
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder">no
plan survives contact with the enemy</a>” and so it was as we developed
the system and deployed it in production. Now for some lessons from this
process that are broadly applicable.<br />

In January 1995 the idea that the long-term survival of digital
information was a significant problem was popularized by Jeff
Rothenberg’s <i>Scientific American</i> article
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24980135"><i>Ensuring the
Longevity of Digital Documents</i></a>. Rothenberg’s concept of a
“digital document” was of things like Microsoft Word files on a CD,
individual objects encoded in a format private to a particular
application. His concern was that the rapid evolution of these
applications would eventually make it impossible to access the content
of objects in that format. He was concerned with interpreting the bits;
he essentially assumed that the bits would survive.<br /> <br /> But
thirty years ago next month an event signaled that Rothenberg’s concerns
had been overtaken by events. Stanford pioneered the transition of
academic publishing from paper to the web when
<a href="http://highwire.stanford.edu/">Highwire Press</a> put the
<a href="http://www.jbc.org/"><i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i></a>
on the Web. Going forward the important information would be encoded in
Web formats such as HTML and PDF. Because each format with which
Rothenberg was concerned was defined by a single application it could
evolve quickly. But Web formats were open standards, implemented in
multiple applications. In effect they were <i>network protocols</i>, and
thus evolve at a glacial
pace.<sup><a href="#Footnote4">[4]</a></sup><br /> <br /> The rapid
evolution of Rothenberg’s “digital documents” had effectively stopped,
because they were no longer being created and distributed in that way.
Going forward, there would be a static legacy set of documents in these
formats. Libraries and archives would need tools for managing those they
acquired, and eventually
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2015/11/follow-up-to-emulation-report.html">emulation</a>,
the technique Rothenberg favored, would provide them. But by then it
turned out that, unless information was on the Web, almost no-one cared
about it.<br /> <br />

Thus the problem for digital preservation was the survival of the bits,
aggravated by the vast scale of the content to be preserved. In May the
following year 2004 Paul Evan Peters awardee Brewster Kahle established
the <a href="https://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a> to address
the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/the-evanescent-web.html">evanescence
of Web pages</a>.<sup><a href="#Footnote5">[5]</a></sup> This was the
first digital preservation effort to face the problems of scale - next
year the archive will have collected a trillion Web
pages.<sup><a href="#Footnote6">[6]</a></sup><br /> <br /> The LOCKSS
system, like the Wayback Machine, was a system for ensuring the survival
of, and access to, the bits of Web pages in their original format. This
was a problem; the conventional wisdom in the digital preservation
community was that the <i>sine qua non</i> of digital preservation was
defending against format obsolescence. Neither Kahle nor we saw any
return on investing in format metadata or format migration. We both saw
scaling up to capture more than a tiny fraction of the at-risk content
as the goal. Events showed we were right, but at the time the digital
preservation community viewed LOCKSS with great skepticism, as “not real
digital preservation”.<br /> <br /> The LOCKSS team repeatedly made the
case that preserving Web content was a different problem from preserving
Rothenberg’s digital documents, and thus that applying the entire
apparatus of “preservation metadata”,
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/">PREMIS</a>,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/fits/">FITS</a>,
<a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove">JHOVE</a>, and format
normalization to Web content was an
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/03/premis-lockss.html">ineffective
waste of scarce resources</a>. Despite this, the drumbeat that LOCKSS
wasn’t “real digital preservation” continued.<br /> <br />

After six years, the LOCKSS team lost patience and devoted the necessary
effort to implement a capability they were sure would never be used in
practice. The team implemented, demonstrated and in 2005 published
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1045/january2005-rosenthal">transparent,
on-demand format migration of Web content</a> preserved in the LOCKSS
network. This was possible because the specification of the HTTP
protocol that underlies the Web <i>supports the format metadata needed
to render Web content</i>. If it lacked such metadata, Web browsers
wouldn’t be possible. The criticism continued
unabated.<sup><a href="#Footnote7">[7]</a></sup><br /> <br /> There have
been a number of services based instead upon
<a href="https://mellon.org/Rosenthal-Emulation-2015">emulation</a>, the

Around 6<sup>th</sup> December 1991
<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml">Paul
Kunz at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> bought up the
<a href="http://swap.stanford.edu/19911206000000/http://slacvm.slac.stanford.edu/FIND/default.html">first
US Web site</a>.<sup><a href="#Footnote8">[8]</a></sup> In a
foreshadowing of future problems its content was dynamic. It was a
front-end for querying databases; although the page itself was static
clicking on the links potentially returned different content as the
underlying database was edited.<br /> <br />

Digital documents in a distributed environment may not behave
consistently; because they are presented both to people who want to view
them and software systems that want to index them by computer programs,
they can be changed, perhaps radically, for each presentation. Each
presentation can be tailored for a specific recipient.

</div>
Cliff Lynch identified the problem that dynamic content posed for
preservation. In 2001 he wrote “Each presentation can be tailored for a
specific recipient”. Which recipient’s presentation deserves to be
preserved? Can we show a future recipient what they would have seen had
they accessed the resource in the past?<br /> <br />

there’s a largely unaddressed crisis developing as the dominant archival
paradigms that have, up to now, dominated stewardship in the digital
world become increasingly inadequate. … the existing models and
conceptual frameworks of preserving some kind of “canonical” digital
artifacts … are increasingly inapplicable in a world of pervasive,
unique, personalized, non-repeatable performances.

</div>
Sixteen years later Lynch was still flagging the problem.<br /> <br />
The dynamic nature of Web content proved irresistible to academic
journal publishers, despite their content being intended as archival.
They added features like citation and download counts, personalizations,
and of course advertisements to HTML pages, and watermarked their PDFs.
These were all significant problems for LOCKSS, which depended upon
comparing the copies ingested by multiple LOCKSS boxes. The comparison
process had to filter out the dynamic content elements; maintaining the
accuracy of doing so was a continual
task.<sup><a href="#Footnote9">[9]</a></sup><br /> <br /> The
fundamental problem is that the Web does not support Universal Resource
Names (URNs) but only Universal Resource Locators (URLs). A URN would
specify <i>what</i> a resource would consist of, all that a URL
specifies is from <i>where</i> a resource can be obtained. As with the
first US Web page, what content you obtain from a URL is unspecified and
can be different or even unobtainable on every visit.<br /> <br /> The
reason the Web runs on URLs not URNs is that the underlying Internet’s
addresses, both IP and DNS, only specify location. There have been
attempts to implement a network infrastructure that would support “what”
not “where” addresses; think of it as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>, but
at the transport not the content
layer.<sup><a href="#Footnote10">[10]</a></sup><br /> <br /> The goal of
digital preservation is to create one or more persistent, accessible
replicas of the content to be preserved. In “what” networks, each copy
has the <i>same</i> URN. In IP-based networks, each copy has a
<i>different URL</i>; to access the replica requires knowing
<i>where</i> it is. Thus if the original of the preserved content goes
away, links to it no longer resolve.<br /> <br />

in 2010</a>, 2017 <a href="https://youtu.be/o4nUe-6Ln-8">Paul Evan
Peters awardee Herbert Van de Sompel</a> and others made a valiant
effort to solve this problem with
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7089.txt">Memento</a>. Accepting
the fact that persistent replicas of content at a URL at different times
in the past would have different URLs, they provided an HTTP-based
mechanism for discovering the URL of the replica close to a desired
time. In some cases, such as Wikis, the original Web site implements the
discovery mechanism and the underlying timeline. In other cases, such as
the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a>, the site
holding the replica implements the timeline. Since there are likely to
be multiple Web archives with replicas of a given URL, Memento in
practice depends upon
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/03/re-thinking-memento-aggregation.html">Aggregator
services</a> to provide a unified timeline of the replica space.<br />
<br /> In “what” networks there would still be a need to provide an
aggregated timeline, not discovering the URL of a replica from a desired
time, but discovering its URN. Just as in the Web, they would depend
upon a mechanism above the transport layer to connect the names into a
timeline. Thus, despite its theoretical appeal, “what” networking’s
practical advantages are less than they appear.<br />

When something is published in print, legitimate copies … are widely

In 1994 Lynch had described how “Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe” in the
paper world. Compare this with how we summarized libraries’ role in our

<blockquote>
Acquire lots of copies. Scatter them around the world so that it is easy
to find some of them and hard to find all of them. Lend or copy your
copies when other librarians need them.

Because we were modeling the paper library system, we hoped that the
LOCKSS system would obtain the benefits of a decentralized system over a
centralized one performing the same function, which in the paper system
and in theory are significant:<br />

<li>
It can scale better.

<li>
It has the economic advantage that it is hard to compare the total

After a couple of my prototypes proved to be insecure, I worked with a
group of amazing Stanford CS Ph.D students to design a decentralized
peer-to-peer network secured by Proof-of-Work. The
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/945445.945451">2003 paper describing
it</a> won “Best Paper” at the prestigious Symposium on Operating System
Principles. This was five years before Satoshi Nakamoto published his
decentralized peer-to-peer network secured by Proof-of-Work.<br />
<br /> Unfortunately in the digital world it is extraordinarily
difficult to reap the theoretical benefits of decentralization. I laid
out the reason why this is so a decade ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html"><i>Economies
of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks</i></a>. In brief, the mechanism
described by W. Brian Arthur in his 1994 book
<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/593250105"><i>Increasing
Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</i></a> operates. Technology
markets have very strong increasing returns to scale. The benefits from
participating in a decentralized digital system increase faster than the
costs, which drives
centralization.<sup><a href="#Footnote11">[11]</a></sup> Thirty years
later, Arthur’s work explains today’s Web perfectly.<br /> <br />

In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/04/decentralized-systems-arent.html"><i>Decentralized
Systems Aren’t</i></a> I explained that they suffer four major
problems:<br />
<ol>
<li>
Their advantages come with significant additional monetary and
operational costs, such as the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/ee380-talk.html">massive cost of
the Bitcoin blockchain</a>’s Proof-of-Work.
</li>
<li>
Their user experience is worse, being more complex, slower and less
predictable. An example is that Bitcoin’s transaction rate is limited by
its 10-second block time.
</li>
<li>
They are in practice only as decentralized as the least decentralized
layer in the stack.
</li>
<li>
Their excess costs cause emergent behaviors that drive centralization.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The fundamental problem is that most layers in the software stack are
highly concentrated, starting with the three operating systems. Network
effects and economies of scale apply at every layer.<br /></p>
</div>
The LOCKSS system was designed and implemented to be completely
decentralized. It was <i>permissionless</i>; nodes could join and leave
the network as they liked. We designed the network protocol to be
extremely simple, both to avoid security flaws, and also in the hope
that there would be multiple implementations, avoiding single points of
failure. There were a number of reasons why, over time, it turned out
much less decentralized than we hoped:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Although we always paid a lot of attention to the
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/bsdcon03/tech/full_papers/rosenthal/rosenthal_html/index.html">security
of LOCKSS boxes</a>, we understood that a software mono-culture was
vulnerable to
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/12/securing-software-supply-chain.html">software
supply chain attacks</a>. But it turned out that the things that a
LOCKSS box needed to do <i>other</i> than handling the protocol were
quite complex, so despite our best efforts we ended up with a software
monoculture.
</li>
<li>
We hoped that by using the BSD open-source license we would create a
diverse community of developers, but we over-estimated the expertise and
the resources of the library community, so Stanford provided the
overwhelming majority of the programming effort.
</li>
<li>
Don Waters was clear that grant funding could not provide the long-term
sustainability needed for digital preservation. So he provided a
matching grant to fund the transition to being funded by the system’s
users. This also transitioned the system to being permissioned, as a way
to ensure the users paid.
</li>
<li>
Although many small and open-access publishers were happy to allow
LOCKSS to preserve their content, the oligopoly publishers never were.
Eventually they funded a completely closed network of huge systems at
major libraries around the world called
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/07/trac-certification-of-clockss-archive.html">CLOCKSS</a>.
This is merely the biggest of a number of closed,
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2016/03/talk-on-private-lockss-networks-at-pasig.html">private
LOCKSS networks</a> that were established to serve specific genres of
content, such as government documents.
</li>
</ul>
Mono-culture risk is pervasive throughout the stacks of digital
preservation systems. For example, for very good reasons almost all are
based on X86 hardware and an open-source stack starting with the Linux
kernel. These very good reasons outweigh the benefits of diversity in
the stack. And, of course, the problem of mono-culture risk is generic
throughout IT due to the network effects and economies of scale
described by Brian Arthur. It is especially worrying in an era of
zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated

<br /> We have already warned you against three seductive but
impractical ideas; format migration, “what” networking and
decentralization. My parting gift to you is to stop you wasting time on
another seductive but impractical idea — that the solution to digital
preservation is quasi-immortal media. What follows is an extract from a
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html">talk at
Berkeley</a> last month.<br />
<h4>
Archival Data

<ul>
<li>
Over time, data falls down the storage hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
Data is archived when it can’t earn its keep on near-line media.
</li>
<li>
Lower cost is purchased with longer access latency.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
What is a useful definition of archival data? It is data that can no
longer earn its keep on readily accessible storage. Thus the fundamental
design goal for archival storage systems is to reduce costs by
tolerating increased access latency. Data is archived, that is moved to
an archival storage system, to save money. Archiving is an
<i>economic</i> rather than a technical
issue.<sup><a href="#Footnote13">[13]</a></sup><br /> <br />

Six years later, this is a picture of, as far as I know, the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41228-8">only write-to-read
DNA storage drive ever demonstrated</a>, from the Microsoft/University
of Washington team that has done much of the research in DNA storage. It
cost about $10K and took 21 hours to write then read 5 bytes. <br />
<br /> The technical press is equally guilty. The canonical article
about some development in the lab starts with the famous IDC graph
projecting the amount of data that will be generated in the future. It
goes on to describe the amazing density some research team achieved by
writing say a megabyte into their favorite medium in the lab, and how
this density could store all the world’s data in a teacup for ever. This
conveys five false impressions.<br />
<h3>
Market Size
</h3>
First, that there is some possibility the researchers could scale their
process up to a meaningful fraction of IDC’s projected demand, or even
to the microscopic fraction of the projected demand that makes sense to
archive. There is no such possibility. Archival media is a much
<i>smaller</i> market than regular media.

<h3>
Timescales
</h3>
Second, that the researcher’s favorite medium could make it into the
market in the timescale of IDC’s projections. Because the reliability
and performance requirements of storage media are so challenging, time
scales in the storage market are much longer than the industry’s
marketeers like to suggest.<br /> <br />

Take, for example, Seagate’s development of the next generation of hard
disk technology, HAMR, where research started
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">twenty-six
years ago</a>. Nine years later in 2008 they published this graph,
showing HAMR entering the market in 2009. Seventeen years later it is
only now starting to be shipped to the hyper-scalers. Research on data
in silica started
<a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">fifteen
years ago</a>. Research on the DNA medium started
<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/777811">thirty-six years ago</a>.
Neither is within five years of market entry.<br />
<h3>
Customers
</h3>
Third, that even if the researcher’s favorite medium did make it into
the market it would be a product that consumers could use. As
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Kestutis
Patiejunas figured out</a> at Facebook more than a decade ago, because
the systems that surround archival media rather than the media
themselves are the major cost, the only way to make the economics of
archival storage work is to do it at data-center scale but in warehouse
space and harvest the synergies that come from not needing data-center
power, cooling, staffing, etc.<br /> <br />

Storage has an analog of Moore’s Law called
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kryders-law/">Kryder’s
Law</a>, which states that over time the density of bits on a storage
medium increases exponentially. Given the need to reduce costs at
data-center scale, Kryder’s Law limits the service life of even
quasi-immortal media. As we see with tape robots, where data is
routinely migrated to newer, denser media long before its theoretical
lifespan, what matters is the economic, not the technical lifespan of a
medium.<br />

Fourth, that anyone either cares or even knows what medium their
archived data lives on. Only the hyper-scalers do. Consumers believe
their data is safe in the cloud. Why bother backing it up, let alone
archiving it, if it is safe anyway? If anyone really cares about
archiving they use a service such as Glacier, when they definitely have
no idea what medium is being used.<br />

Fifth, the idea that with quasi-immortal media you don’t need Lots Of
Copies to Keep Stuff
Safe.<sup><a href="#Footnote15">[15]</a></sup><br /> <br /> Media such
as silica, DNA, quartz DVDs, steel tape and so on address bit rot, which
is only one of the threats to which long-lived data is subject. Clearly
a single copy on such media is still subject to threats including fire,
flood, earthquake, ransomware, and insider attacks. Thus even an archive
needs to maintain multiple copies. This greatly increases the cost,
bringing us back to the economic threat.<br /> <br /> The reason why
this focus on media is a distraction is that the cost per terabyte of
the <i>medium</i> is irrelevant, what drives the economic threat is the
capital and operational cost of the <i>system</i>. It is only by
operating at data-center scale and thus amortizing the capital and
operational costs over very large amounts of data that the system costs
per terabyte can be made competitive.<br /> <br /> The fundamental idea
behind LOCKSS was that, given a limited budget and a realistic range of
threats, data would survive better in many cheap, unreliable,
loosely-coupled replicas than in a single expensive, durable one.<br />

Van Jacobson and a team at PARC started a long-term project called
<a href="http://www.ccnx.org/"><i>Content-Centric Network</i></a> and
gave a 2006
<a href="https://www.ccnx.org/395/1/van-jacobsen-at-google/">Google Tech
Talk</a> about it. In 2013’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/01/moving-vs-copying.html"><i>Moving
vs. Copying</i></a> I described the difference thus:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The goal of IP and the layers above is to <i>move</i> data. There is an
assumption that, in the normal case, the bits vanish from the sender
once they have been transported, and also from any intervening nodes.
</li>
<li>
The goal of CCN is to <i>copy</i> data. A successful CCN request creates
a locally accessible copy of some remote content. It says nothing about
whether in the process other (cached) copies are created, or whether the
content is deleted at the source. None of that is any concern of the CCN
node making the request, they are configuration details of the
underlying network. While it has its copy, the CCN node can satisfy
requests from other nodes for that content, it is a peer-to-peer
network.
</li>
</ul>
Basing networking on the copy-ability of bits rather than the
transmissibility of bits makes a huge simplification. In particular, it
means that, unlike in IP-based networks but like in BitTorrent, caches
(and thus digital preservation) just work. In CCN all replicas of the
same content have the <i>same</i> name as the original; which of them
satisfies a request is determined by the CCN network’s routing at
request time. If the content changes, so does its name. In CCN, the
analogs of routers in an IP network are caches, holding recently
accessed content and supplying it on request. Some of them are archives,
caches that are never flushed like our vision for LOCKSS boxes. Just
like routers, unless something goes wrong they are invisible.

The Nakamoto coefficient is the number of units in a subsystem you need
to control 51% of that subsystem. Because decentralization applies at
each layer of a system’s stack, it is necessary to measure each of the
subsystems individually. In 2017’s
<a href="https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e"><i>Quantifying
Decentralization</i></a> Srinivasan and Lee identified a set of
subsystems for public blockchains, and measured them using their
proposed
“<a href="https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e">Nakamoto
Coefficient</a>”. Their table of the contemporary Nakamoto coefficients
for Bitcoin and Ethereum makes the case that they were only minimally
decentralized.<br /> <br /> <br />

There is an even bigger problem for Ethereum since the blockchain
switched to Proof-of-Stake. The software that validators run is close to
a mono-culture. Two of the minor players have recently suffered bugs
that took them off-line, as Sam Kessler reports in
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/22/bug-on-ethereums-nethermind-software-sparks-discussion-of-client-diversity-risks/"><i>Bug
That Took Down 8% of Ethereum’s Validators Sparks Worries About Even
Bigger Outage</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A bug in Ethereum’s Nethermind client software – used by validators of
the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the
chain’s key operators on Sunday.<br /> …<br /> Nethermind
<a href="https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution">powers around 8%</a>
of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend’s bug was
critical enough to pull those validators offline. … the Nethermind
incident followed a similar outage earlier in January that impacted
Besu, the client software behind
<a href="https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution">around 5%</a> of
Ethereum’s validators.<br /> …<br /> Around
<a href="https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution">85% of Ethereum’s
validators</a> are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to
smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth’s dominant
market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues
with its programming.<br /> …<br /> Cygaar cited data from the website
<a href="http://execution-diversity.info/">execution-diversity.info</a>
noting that popular crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken
all <a href="http://execution-diversity.info/">rely on Geth</a> to run
their staking services. “Users who are staked in protocols that run Geth
would lose their ETH” in the event of a critical issue,” Cygaar wrote.
</blockquote>
Remember
“<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nobody-ever-gets-fired-buying-ibm-brian-welsh">no-one
ever gets fired for buying IBM</a>”? At the Ethereum layer, it is
“no-one ever gets fired for using Geth” because, if there was ever a big
problem with Geth, the blame would be so widely shared.
</li>
<li id="Footnote12">
Vitalik Buterin, inventor of Ethereum, pointed out in
<a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274"><i>The
Meaning of Decentralization</i></a>:
<blockquote>
In the case of blockchain protocols, the mathematical and economic
reasoning behind the safety of the consensus often relies crucially on
the uncoordinated choice model, or the assumption that the game consists
of many small actors that make decisions independently. … However, can
we really say that the uncoordinated choice model is realistic when 90%
of the Bitcoin network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show
up together at the same conference?
</blockquote>
What Buterin is saying is that <i>because</i> decentralized systems in
the real world are not composed of “many small actors that make
decisions independently”, there is nothing to stop the small number of
large actors colluding, and thus acting as a centralized system.

How long should the archived data last? The
<a href="https://longnow.org/">Long Now Foundation</a> is building the
<a href="https://longnow.org/clock/">Clock of the Long Now</a>, intended
to keep time for 10,000 years:<br />
<blockquote>
Ten thousand years is about the age of civilization, so a 10K-year Clock
would measure out a future of civilization equal to its past. That
assumes we are in the middle of whatever journey we are on – an implicit
statement of optimism.
</blockquote>
They would like to accompany it with a 10,000-year archive. That is at
least two orders of magnitude longer than I am talking about here. We
are only just over three-quarters of a century from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby">first
stored-program computer</a>, so designing a digital archive for a
century is a very ambitious goal. Note that the design of the Clock of
the Long Now is as much social as technical. It is designed to motivate
<a href="https://longnow.org/clock/">infrequent but continual
pilgrimages</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On days when visitors are there to wind it, the calculated melody is
transmitted to the chimes, and if you are there at noon, the bells start
ringing their unique one-time-only tune. The 10 chimes are optimized for
the acoustics of the shaft space, and they are big.<br /> <br />
Finally, way out of breath, you arrive at the primary chamber. Here is
the face of the Clock. A disk about 8 feet in diameter artfully displays
the natural cycles of astronomical time, the pace of the stars and the
planets, and the galactic time of the Earth’s procession. If you peer
deep into the Clock’s workings you can also see the time of day.<br />
<br /> But in order to get the correct time, you need to “ask” the
clock. When you first come upon the dials the time it displays is an
older time given to the last person to visit. If no one has visited in a
while, say, since 8 months and 3 days ago, it will show the time it was
then. To save energy, the Clock will not move its dials unless they are
turned, that is, powered, by a visitor. The Clock calculates the correct
time, but will only display the correct time if you wind up its display
wheel.

<li id="Footnote14">
It is noteworthy that in 2023 Optical Archival (OD-3), the most recent
archive-only medium, was canceled for lack of a large enough market. It
was a 1TB optical disk, an upgrade from Blu-Ray.
</li>
<li id="Footnote15">
No medium is perfect. They all have a specified Unrecoverable Bit Error
Rate (UBER) rate. For example, typical
<a href="https://www.seagate.com/content/dam/seagate/en/content-fragments/products/datasheets/exos-x24/exos-x24-DS2080-2307US-en_US.pdf">disk
UBERs are 10<sup>-15</sup></a>. A petabyte is 8*10<sup>15</sup> bits, so
if the drive is within its specified performance you can expect up to 8
errors when reading a petabyte. The specified UBER is an upper limit,
you will normally see
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/tr-2005-166.pdf">far
fewer</a>. The
<a href="https://cdn.allbound.com/iq-ab/2022/12/LTO-9-TB00068A.pdf">UBER
for LT09 tape is 10<sup>-20</sup></a>, so unrecoverable errors on a new
tape are very unlikely. But not impossible, and the rate goes up steeply
with tape wear.<br /> <br /> The property that classifies a medium as
quasi-immortal is not that its reliability is greater than regular media
to start with, although as with tape it may be. It is rather that its
reliability decays more slowly than that of regular media. Thus archival
systems need to use erasure coding to mitigate both UBER data loss and
media failures such as disk crashes and tape wear-out.

chatbot</a> before getting humans involved. Anyway, the answer is yes,
OPML is the native file format of
<a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. It’s the reason we chose
<a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> as the format for RSS reading lists,
so we could edit them in a distant
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154217">ancestor</a>
of Drummer’s whose native file format was also OPML. I tend not to
change file formats gratuitously – it’s how you can use different tools
to edit your own data. That’s a big part of the plan with
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, because the internal
file format for drafts is Markdown, you could put any editor alongside
that can edit and save text in Markdown, without a glitch. The idea is
to create a new platform, editors for WordPress, and have them all
interop with each other perfectly from the start. Because WordLand is
the first product in this niche, and Markdown is a very safe choice
these days (understood to discourage lock-in), I think it’s going to be
a perfect basis for interop. Learning from past experience and doing it
better each time.</p>

<p>I wonder when ChatGPT or Claude.ai will compete with Wikipedia. I
think Wikipedia is great but it has always had a weakness in that it can
be manipulated to tell a story from a very limited point of view. For
example the RSS page has a long section explaining the benefits of Atom.
What I like about the AI versions of the basic history of things is that
it isn’t so easily manipulated. I talked about this with Claude, and
asked it to write up a <a href="https://this.how/claudewiki/">proposal
for ClaudeWiki</a>, a Wikipedia workalike, not too expensive to run,
make it part of a user’s $20 per month subscription. I think it would be
useful, if only as a demo how Wikipedia itself might improve its
service.</p>

<p>If I were designing a social network, I would implement replies
differently. When you reply to a post, only the person who wrote the
post sees it. If they want they can RT it. The way it works now on all
twitter-like systems means most of the replies are basically spam,
people using your post as a way to reach people who follow you.</p>

<p>I used to tell friends you can’t go wrong buying the S&amp;P 500. The
president is rated by now the stock market does, and so over the long
haul you can expect steady growth from the S&amp;P 500, and it keeps
things really simple. Well, have to say – that’s no longer good advice.
Maybe real estate? Outside the United States? I don’t know. It depends
on what the people of this country do, and if our representatives are
listening.</p>

That said, in the manner of non-internet-connected electronics, its

deluded schoolyard bully. What is amazing, if you think about it, is
that we aren’t having an emergency impeachment and trial to get him out
of there. That could actually restore a bit of confidence of the outside
world, showing that the power in the US is more with the people than it
has been for a long time. Maybe our
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa">would-be
overlords</a> are scared too at what their idea has unleashed. Even if
Trump weren’t so inept, eventually whoever you choose as the monarch,
they’re going to behave like this. Inevitable. We could have a
revolution right now, fix this, and set the country on the right course.
We could do it. I believe we could.</p>
