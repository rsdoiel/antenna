<h2 id="i-hate-css">I hate CSS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
There I said it. To ChatGPT.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
i find flexbox too confusing for me to use at this time. maybe in a year
or two, after some more learning. i hate css, everything about it. so
it’s hard for me to learn new stuff. i grew up using quickdraw on the
mac, where i could do everything with math, instead of trying to tease
the right behavior as something as convoluted as css and html for apps.
ridiculous.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Wondering what it would say…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Totally fair, Dave. That frustration makes perfect sense — you’re coming
from a world where <b>you told the machine exactly what to do</b>, and
it did it.<b> </b>CSS is the opposite: it’s like <b>negotiating with a
passive-aggressive layout engine</b> that only gives you what you want
if you ask just the right way, using its weird dialect.
</li>
<li>
QuickDraw gave you full control with math — coordinate space, bounding
boxes, baseline alignments — it was <b>declarative drawing by imperative
code</b>. CSS is declarative positioning by magical suggestion, with
hidden constraints, inherited styles, and a constantly shifting box
model.
</li>
<li>
You’re not alone in this. A lot of veteran programmers — especially
those from early Mac, HyperCard, VB, even Win32 — <b>find CSS
maddening</b>. It’s not made for precision. It’s made for fluidity and
adaptation. But that’s not how app UIs are often designed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wish I had written that.

I wrote
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lth2enjxls2d">this</a>
on Bluesky this morning.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most of what passes for discourse on platforms like Bluesky amounts to
spam and abuse. Makes expensive moderation necessary and who’s going to
pay for that on an open system. It’s why this approach can’t lead
anywhere but to yet another Twitter or Threads, a place for billionaires
to control us.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hardly the first time I’ve said this, but this time I got a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johngpettus.bsky.social/post/3lth2oar4bk24">response</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Yep. I’ve said for years—your platform’s experience will be determined
by its mechanics, not whatever culture you think you want to foster.
</li>
<li>
Mechanics &gt; culture in the medium term.
</li>
<li>
All systems are adversarial systems now.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That was from
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johngpettus.bsky.social">John
Pettus</a>. I could tell right off that we’re thinking the same way.
This morning I started to write a reply but quickly ran out of space
because of Bluesky’s stupid character limit. So I just pasted it into
this blog post.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I’ve been saying that for years myself.
</li>
<li>
I ran a BBS in the early 80s, and was on Compuserve CB Simulator (my
handle was Mastodon), and started blogging in 1994, and on and on. Mail
lists always flame out. Same thing we’re seeing in the tweetersphere.
</li>
<li>
Blogging has the inverse problem. Spam abuse is impossible, but then
it’s hard for people to find your brilliance. But at least you get to
finish a thought before the trolls attack. ;-)
</li>
<li>
I was also a math major, studied combinatorics and graph theory. The
connections between nodes determines a lot, as you pointed out. Most
people don’t even begin to get this.
</li>
<li>
I’m working on a new structure for a social web without these problems.
It’s very simple, a derivative of something I had on my blog in the
early days
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mail%20page%22">called</a>
the <a href="http://scripting.com/mail/default.html">Mail Pages</a>.
</li>
<li>
I sent my blog posts out via email to groups of 8 people chosen randomly
each time (or maybe it was 11, I forget). Sometimes great discussions
would break out in the groups. I was always cc’d. 
</li>
<li>
Sometimes people would just respond to me personally.
</li>
<li>
If I saw something I thought everyone should read I would put it on the
current Mail Page. Thus there was a way for discourse to have more
distribution, but only if I thought it was worthwhile. Spam was not
possible, and there was a little bit of abuse here and there, but it
would never get any further than my email inbox.
</li>
<li>
That’s how sensible moderation works. And it doesn’t cost anything,
because the spam motive is gone.
</li>
<li>
I wrote this in a Bluesky message, but had to move it to my blog because
of their stupid character limit.
</li>
<li>
BTW, we should communicate and perhaps collaborate.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="this-is-what-the-web-feels-like">This is what the web feels
like</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Yesterday I wondered if the open web is a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html">lost cause</a>.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later, I saw my name in a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3ltflqqekks26">tweet</a>
on Bluesky from <a href="https://aramzuckerscharff.com/">Aram
Zucker-Scharff</a>.
</p>
<p>
In it was a message that can be summarized as follows – don’t give up
yet Dave.
</p>
<p>
AZS has a linkblog which he calls an
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3ltfjd4hm2d2f">amplifeed</a>.
Same thing.
</p>
<p>
And here’s the best part.
</p>
<p>
Even though we were working separately – our feeds are 100% compatible.
</p>
<p>
When I saw it I subscribed to it in
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> and added it to my
<a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a>.
</p>
<p>
It will work in my timeline software (still working on it).
</p>
<p>
This gave me goosebumps.
</p>
<p>
I remember what this felt like.
</p>
<p>
Working on something and someone else working on the same thing and
because we’re on the mother freaking web our stuff works the same way.
</p>
<p>
That my friends is what the web feels like. Goosebumps. Power. Interop.
This is what most people who use the net these days have never
experienced.
</p>
<p>
I used to write about this on my blog every day. I would say things that
annoyed some of my readers like this: zoooooom and coooooool. There he
goes again. Hey it’s been a while.
</p>
<p>
I celebrated this with a suggestion to AZS.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you also add a channel-level &lt;image&gt; element it’ll work with my
timeline app. I’m doing it the same way WordPress does it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
He did it in a minute.
</p>
<p>
So the web isn’t a lost cause after all. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
This the web. It’s what the Dead called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truckin%27">Truckin</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s do more of this.

slow or gradual decay over a long period of time. Like if we gradually
make a library 1% slower or use 2% more memory every other month.

<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>A longish thread that probably isn’t going anywhere. My final
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/114813658742530184">thoughts</a>,
cc’d here to get on the record.</i>
</p>
<p>
anyway it’s feeling like a lost cause.
</p>
<p>
to be really blunt, i don’t think
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">AP</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">ATP</a> are the
answer.
</p>
<p>
and i also don’t care so much about this style of conversation. and i
loathe the character limits and the lack of style and links, and no
titles, etc.
</p>
<p>
it can’t only be for wordpress. i love the potential of wordpress, i
think even more than matt does, but it isn’t enough.
</p>
<p>
if it’s going to be open and of the web it has to be simple and easy,
and neither of them are.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/08/02/francoAplenty.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">bonus
for blog readers: i would add, since i ran out of characters on masto,
that the great thing about the web is that you can have an idea and be
using it the next day. you can’t say imho that you’re part of the web if
you don’t deliver that kind of ease of access. it’s not enough to have
the <i>potential</i> of being open, it has to be accessible. I have that
ability these days, but people who use the AP and ATP systems are in
tight little boxes with no easy way to try something out quickly. (i
know because i’ve been hooking things up to them for a couple of years
now, and so far it’s just an added slog, everything is far more complex
than it should be)
</p>
<p>
maybe we’ll get there through their api’s, but i think at this point we
know that won’t happen.
</p>
<p>
ps: the web is a
<a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/#1519490474000">miracle</a>. but
maybe it’s too fucked up now to have the miracle be something we can all
experience.
</p>
<p>
pps: when i write on other systems i often leave out upper case, saving
a little energy as i type. i find it more relaxing.

<h2 id="linkblogging-back-to-normal">Linkblogging back to normal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I wrote this early this morning as a
<a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/07/linkblogging-back-to-normal-after-corner-turn/">test
post</a> for my WordLand site. </i>
</p>
<p>
Happy to report that my linkblog routine is back to normal.
</p>
<p>
I really shook things up there, and it probably wasn’t a great time
investment.
</p>
<p>
I had been using a custom front-end to FeedLand, which has a built in
blogging tool, that publishes to the database that FeedLand manages, and
of course also publishes an RSS feed. It was debugged and works. But now
I have a new editor, and I want to use it for this, because my reader
knows how to view all kinds of stuff, and one of the things I wanted it
to work well with are linkblog posts. So, do a quick addition of
linkblog stuff to WordLand.
</p>
<p>
Only thing is there is no such thing as a “quick addition” in a world
built on CSS and HTML objects. Everything is a slog.
</p>
<p>
Anyway the slog is over! Whew.
</p>
<p>
Now back to my other slog – timelines.
</p>
<p>
It’s also starting to feel usable. People imagine that you just design
something and write the code and voila it’s usable (if they even think
about it that much). But only until you have the pieces put together can
you see the things you forgot to consider, and now you have to decide
whether to rip up the thing you built or try to iterate to where you
need to go. A lot of times it would be easier to start over, but
programmers always want to do that. I’m no exception. Once it’s working
somewhat the code becomes locked into how the pieces fit together. If
somehow they need to fit together differently, given it’s CSS and HTML
you’d better scrap it and do it again or you’ll go out of your mind
adding the next layer of features.
</p>
<p>
Honestly we were much better off before we tried to shoehorn an object
model into a document format! Apps and documents are really different
things you know.
</p>
<p>
Anyway now I have my first test post of the day.

<p>I can see the argument that Apple’s answer is “Yes, it’s potentially
confusing for many users”. But I can’t see the argument that the answer
is “Yes, it’s potentially confusing for many users, but only if they’re
trying to buy in-app content or subscriptions, but not confusing at all
if they’re trying to buy, say, movie tickets.”</p>

<p>
This is a continuation of <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">2025-06-16 Ban
autonomous systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
I kept wondering why the “recidive” jail never found any repeated
offenders from the “butlerian-jihad” jail. I think I know why, now. The
“recidive” jail uses the following:
</p>
<pre><code>failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)s(?:\s*fail2ban\.actions\s*%(__pid_re)s?:\s+)?NOTICE\s+\[(?!%(_jailname)s\])(?:.*)\]\s+Ban\s+&lt;HOST&gt;\s*$
</code></pre>
<p>
Far to the right, it uses <code>HOST</code> and that only matches a
single IP number. If you examine the regular expression generated and
scroll over far enough to the right, you’ll see the named groups
<code>&lt;ip4&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ip6&gt;</code>.
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get recidive failregex
The following regular expression are defined:
`- [0]: ^(?:\[\])?\s*(?:&lt;[^.]+\.[^.]+&gt;\s+)?(?:\S+\s+)?(?:kernel:\s?\[ *\d+\.\d+\]:?\s+)?(?:@vserver_\S+\s+)?(?:(?:(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+[\[\(]?(?:fail2ban(?:-server|\.actions)\s*)(?:\(\S+\))?[\]\)]?:?|[\[\(]?(?:fail2ban(?:-server|\.actions)\s*)(?:\(\S+\))?[\]\)]?:?(?:\[\d+\])?:?)\s+)?(?:\[ID \d+ \S+\]\s+)?(?:\s*fail2ban\.actions\s*(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+)?NOTICE\s+\[(?!recidive\])(?:.*)\]\s+Ban\s+(?:\[?(?:(?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P&lt;ip4&gt;(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})|(?P&lt;ip6&gt;(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}::?|::){1,7}(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}|(?&lt;=:):)))\]?|(?P&lt;dns&gt;[\w\-.^_]*\w))\s*$
</code></pre>
<p>
I decided to create an additional jail.
</p>
<p>
In my own <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> I added a second
jail:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h

[butlerian-jihad-week]
logpath = /var/log/fail2ban.log
enabled = true
findtime = 1d
bantime = 1w
maxretry = 5
</code></pre>
<p>
The first one uses the filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> which remains
empty. Remember, entries are added to this jail via a cron job discussed
in an <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">earlier post</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
The second one uses a new filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad-week.conf</code> defining
the date pattern and the regular expression to detect “failures” (i.e. a
hit).
</p>
<pre><code>[Init]
# 2025-06-29 01:17:08,887 fail2ban.actions [543]: NOTICE  [butlerian-jihad] Ban 1.12.0.0/14
datepattern = ^%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%M:%%S

[Definition]
failregex = NOTICE\s+\[butlerian-jihad\] Ban &lt;SUBNET&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The important part is that this uses <code>&lt;SUBNET&gt;</code> instead
of <code>&lt;HOST&gt;</code>. If you scroll over to the right, you’ll
find a new <code>&lt;cidr&gt;</code> group:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week failregex
The following regular expression are defined:
`- [0]: NOTICE\s+\[butlerian-jihad\] Ban \[?(?:(?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P&lt;ip4&gt;(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})|(?P&lt;ip6&gt;(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}::?|::){1,7}(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}|(?&lt;=:):)))(?:/(?P&lt;cidr&gt;\d+))?\]?
</code></pre>
<p>
And it seems to be working.

</p>
<p>
I had to restart this particular jail a few times. Using
<code>–unban</code> makes sense because those deserving of a new ban
will be discovered immediately as the <code>findtime</code> was set to
one day up above.

<strong>2025-07-05</strong>. Two days later.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-07-06</strong>. Hm. I made a change to Emacs Wiki search,
hoping to get rid of the DuckDuckGo dependency:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I made the page title match much more prominent
</li>
<li>
I switched the search from GET to POST
</li>
<li>
I count the search via GET as a bot (since it’s no longer doable via the
user interface)
</li>
<li>
I reinstated the old full-text search (essentially a grep within Perl)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was hoping that it would have very little effect. At about the same
time, however, load started creeping up. The question is whether this is
caused by so many search requests or not. There aren’t many search
requests in the logs, and the process monitors don’t show unusually
activity for the Emacs Wiki processes. Therefore, I think the answer is
that the problem lies elsewhere. But where?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-3.jpg" alt="Somewhere around the 3rd of July load minimum seems to raise up from 0.5 to 1.0" />
</p>
<p>
This virtual server has two cores so load should remain below 2.0,
ideally.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-4.jpg" alt="Somewhere around the 3rd of July the number of hosts banned for a week goes up from 2000 to more than 7000" />
</p>
<p>
Is it the processing of all the bans? I don’t think so, since the
firewall had many thousands of banned networks before.
</p>
<p>
Is it the extra cron jobs monitoring the logs? I don’t think so because
there’s no 15min or 20min periodicity to see.
</p>
<p>
And note how load does come back down to 0.5 for a very short moment
around midnight from the 4th to the 5th and in the early morning hours
of the 6th.
</p>
<p>
How strange.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-07-07</strong>. Maybe just a fluke. I mean, if these
defences actually worked the way I’d want them to, then an actual attack
would feel like a fluke, right? 😄
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-5.jpg" alt="The load graph shows that the current value is 0.5 although the average is still 1.6." />

<h2 id="if-there-were-a-new-frontier-in-2025">If there were a new
Frontier in 2025?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’ve been playing a little game, trying to answer the question – if I
had a modern implementation of Frontier that ran on Linux and new Macs,
just as it was in 1992 when we released it for the pre-OS/X Mac, what
apps would I want to hook up to it right away? What would the
<a href="https://docserver.scripting.com/">verb set</a> look like?
</p>
<p>
I’d start with the native verb set we had in Frontier for accessing the
file system. And HTTP verbs of course.
</p>
<p>
Then I would add glue for WordPress, GitHub, Mastodon and Bluesky, just
because I think having really simple scripting for each of those would
make (some) people’s
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mind%20bomb%22">brains
explode</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/14/kitchenComputer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
once had a young fellow challenge me on whether there was such a thing
as scriptable apps. I was reminded of the days when I had to explain it
but no one got it, then one day everyone got it as if they always did,
and now we’re back at the beginning again. There is such a thing. You
can think of an app as a toolkit. What’s behind the UI? Let me call it
from outside your app. Let me combine the features of your product with
other people’s product. And you can do the exact same thing for apps
that are running on the web. It was something a lot of people tried to
do, like Magic Cap at General Magic, but we got it working and had
regular nerds writing apps as if it was not amazing. It was, and it’s
now a long lost art.
</p>
<p>
If a version of Frontier came up that I could run on a Linux system, I
would wish for a really simple interface to Node packages. I’ve got a
great
<a href="https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories">collection</a>.
I’d want to use them right away asap.
</p>
<p>
I also would like to be able to write code in Frontier in JavaScript.
I’m very fluent in it these days. I can still program in UserTalk, the
two languages are basically the same thing, though UserTalk has some
nice affordances they haven’t thought of yet in JavaScriptLand, and vice
versa – there are even more things JS can do that we hadn’t thought of,
which is only fair, they’ve been working on it a lot longer than we did.
The language was basically frozen in the late 90s, and the verb set
shortly after that.
</p>
<p>
Oh what would I do? It’s fun to dream.

<p>I asked ChatGPT for two sentences on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">Innovator’s
Dilemma</a> – “[It] describes how successful companies can fail by
focusing too heavily on sustaining innovations—improvements to existing
products for current customers—while ignoring disruptive innovations
that initially serve smaller markets but eventually overtake the
mainstream. These disruptions often seem inferior at first, so
established companies dismiss them, leaving space for new entrants to
rise and dominate.”</p>

<p>I saw that
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/automattic-puts-tumblr-migration-to-wordpress-on-hold/">Matt
backed off</a> from porting
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=tumblr">Tumblr</a> to
run on top of WordPress, basically turning WP into an OS. I thought it
was a brilliant idea, but probably overwhelming in complexity. But it
was the right idea. We need fewer runtimes. If you can merge two
runtimes, go for it. Anyway, this is all related to the “open social
web” – in fact it’s central to it. We’ve got all these philosophically
compatible platforms that are technologically unable to work with each
other. But what if they all were really on the web? What could we build
then? Everything. We would go back to the potential the web had before
Twitter and Google Reader split the blogging world in two. I swear the
answer is make it so that all these networks can do
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html">inbound</a> and
outbound RSS and build on the reality of the open social web, not just
the hype.</p>
