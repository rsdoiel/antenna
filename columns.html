<p>When Google tells you it’s easy to convert a site to HTTPS they’re
wrong. It’s an insurmountable job for scripting.com. 30 years of writing
is on that domain, lots of different runtimes on lots of different
domains which would also have to be converted. Images in all the pages.
All that breaks when you flip the switch. I can’t walk away from a big
part of my life’s work. Sorry, not for Google. Every time someone
assumes I’m to blame for this situation, that’s how Google has tricked
you. I followed the rules. They broke them.</p>

<h1 id="2024-08-11-serving-bare-git-on-the-web">
2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web
</h1>
<p>
In the old days, I used <code>cgit</code> to render my git repositories
on the web. It’s simple to set up since it’s a CGI script. This is ideal
for URLs that get very few hits. When nobody is requesting the URL, the
CGI script isn’t running and no resources are being used. When a URL is
requested, however, the CGI script loads, the interpreter loads, the
libraries load, the script executes… It’s an expensive end-point! And
you know how it is. The web is full of leeches and bad bots, crawlers
and idiots. Having an expensive end-point means it needs protection.
</p>
<p>
For I while I thought that <code>legit</code> was the answer. It was
nice and fast and all that. But recently, <code>git clone</code> no
longer worked. It calls <code>git upload-pack</code> as an intermediate
workaround for
<a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/1062">#1062</a>. This
was failing for some reason, however. I tinkered with it for a while but
didn’t get anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Then I started thinking about
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a>’s post on
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos">hosting git
repos</a>. I made some changes to my Apache config and now <code>git
clone</code> works again.
</p>
<p>
The key is that you need a <code>post-update</code> hook that calls
<code>git update-server-info</code>. Each git repository already comes
with a <code>post-update.sample</code> hook containing the necessary
code, so I needed to loop over all the bare repositories I had and
rename the example hook.
</p>
<p>
Using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>for d in *.git
    sudo -u git mv $d/hooks/post-update.sample $d/hooks/post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Sadly, this is not good enough.
</p>
<p>
In order to generate an <code>index.html</code> file for every
repository, I need a hook that regenerates it. If you know how to
determine whether regeneration can be skipped, I’d love to hear how to
that.
</p>
<p>
This hook also updates or adds the <code>AddDescription</code> lines I
need.
</p>
<p>
I prepared a hook that I wanted to install in every repository and saved
it as <code>~/post-update</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is what it looks like, using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

git update-server-info

# create index.html
set branch (git branch --show-current)
set template (cat /home/git/.readme.html | string collect)
set title (basename (pwd))
set body (git show $branch:README.md | cmark --to html | string collect)
printf &quot;$template&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &quot;$body&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &gt; index.html

# update description
set description (cat description)
sed --in-place=~ --expression &quot;/ $title/d&quot; /home/git/.htaccess
printf &quot;AddDescription \&quot;$description\&quot; $title\n&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/git/.htaccess
</code></pre>
<p>
(I need the title twice, once for the title and once for the reminder on
how to clone.)
</p>
<p>
I turn Markdown into HTML using <code>cmark</code>. Common Mark is the
closest we have to a standard, I guess.
</p>
<p>
The template <code>/home/git/.readme.html</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;format-detection&quot; content=&quot;telephone=no&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
html { max-width: 70ch; padding: 1ch; margin: auto; }
body { hyphens: auto; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://src.alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
%s&lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/%s&lt;/mark&gt;
      &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
So now I needed to distribute the <code>post-update</code> hook to every
repository and run it once. I wrote yet another Fish script,
<code>~/recreate-index</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for d in /home/git/*.git
    echo $d
    cd $d
    cp ~/post-update hooks/
    chown git:git hooks/post-update
    chmod 775 hooks/post-update
    sudo -u git git hook run post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m currently hosting 95 repositories according to <code>ls -d
/home/git/*.git | wc -l</code>. Some of these don’t have a
<code>README.md</code> file. Should I ever touch them again, I’ll have
to investigate.
</p>
<p>
Now, for the Apache web server – I changed my site to the following:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin alex@alexschroeder.ch
    ServerName src.alexschroeder.ch
    Include conf-enabled/blocklist.conf
    SSLEngine on
    DocumentRoot /home/git
   &lt;Directory /home/git&gt;
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>/home/git</code> directory has an <code>.htaccess</code> file
that starts out containing the following:
</p>
<pre><code>HeaderName .top.html
IndexOptions SuppressIcon SuppressSize FancyIndexing HTMLTable
IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>.top.html</code> file contains a fragment to add to the top of
the index:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body { max-width: 80ch }
td { padding: 0.5ex 1em 0 0; white-space: nowrap; overflow-x: auto }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hello!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm Alex Schroeder.
  These are my source code repositories. You can find out more about me on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. There, you'll also find a page
  listing ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As for the git repositories, you should be able to clone them as they are.
  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmu.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For more about this setup, see
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos&quot;&gt;How to host git repos&lt;/a&gt;
  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra&quot;&gt;@Sandra&lt;/a&gt; and my post,

<strong>2024-08-12</strong>. I wondered about links from the README to
local files. Right now, linking to images and files hosted in the same
repository doesn’t work since they don’t exist in the raw repository.
The question then becomes, as far as I am concerned, whether this README
is supposed to speak to developers or end-users? If it is for
developers, then pictures, screenshots, PDF files and all of that don’t
need to be linked from the repository. If you are interested in these
things, do a <code>git clone –depth 1</code> and investigate locally.
</p>
<p>
If the repository is for the end users, however, things are harder. The
<code>post-update</code> hook should extract all the local files linked
to from the README. Something like the following, perhaps:
</p>
<pre><code>for file in (printf &quot;%s\n&quot; $body | /home/oddmu/oddmu links - | egrep -v '^(https?:|mailto:|/)')
    set dir (dirname $file)
    if test ! -d $dir
        mkdir -p $dir
    end
    echo $file; sudo -u git git show $branch:$file &gt; $file
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses <a href="oddmu">oddmu</a> to extract the links from a Markdown
file, creates the necessary directories and checks out the files.
</p>
<p>
But if the files are no longer linked from the README, they are not
deleted. If a directory is linked from the README (I have done this!
🤦), the checkout won’t work.
</p>
<p>
I think the better way forward is to move this information elsewhere.
The README is not the documentation.
</p>
<p>
And with that, I think I did it! Serving git repositories from static
files. A single directory per project containing the bare git data and a
single <code>index.html</code> file. No more gazillion end points for
crawlers to lose themselves.

Interesting paper:

Taxonomy of Tactics and Insights from Real-World Data</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Generative, multimodal artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers
transformative potential across industries, but its misuse poses
significant risks. Prior research has shed light on the potential of
advanced AI systems to be exploited for malicious purposes. However, we
still lack a concrete understanding of how GenAI models are specifically
exploited or abused in practice, including the tactics employed to
inflict harm. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of GenAI misuse
tactics, informed by existing academic literature and a qualitative
analysis of approximately 200 observed incidents of misuse reported
between January 2023 and March 2024. Through this analysis, we
illuminate key and novel patterns in misuse during this time period,
including potential motivations, strategies, and how attackers leverage
and abuse system capabilities across modalities (e.g. image, text,
audio, video) in the wild…

Right before the pandemic hit, I moved into a new house that was just
outside of cable TV coverage. And while I'd dabbled in streaming apps
for years, this was the first time I was forced to become a full-time
cord-cutter.

My sister just got back from two months in Europe and returned bearing
gifts, including this adorable onesie for our baby in utero that I just
had to share 😅 I couldn’t help but quip, “Ah, a country I’ve never been
to!” (in good humour – it’s super cute, I was very appreciative!) but
seriously, I guess I do have some Irish heritage, and therefore, so does
our baby, so it still works. It’s a gorgeous onesie in any case 😂

<p>A lot of people are thinking that

the new “nice” version of The Original Twitter, but folks, that’s pure
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a> –
remember who owns Threads and ask yourself if you want that dude to be
in charge of our political organizing network. We need

<p>Idea for a neat product from Automattic or really anyone: Configure
WordPress for writing a book, hook it up to an AI service that can
always turn that site into prose, reorganized into chapters, however
you’d like, on demand, in an instant. You could use an outliner to
arrange the table of contents and it could automatically generate a back
of the book index. Technologically I think today’s AI is ready to do
this, just needs to be packaged. Charge a fair price for the service,
esp at the beginning it would totally be worth it. Who knows where it
would lead. I bet a lot of writers would use it, I certainly would.</p>

carry two phones, an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_13_Pro">iPhone 13 Pro</a>
and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6">Pixel 6 Pro</a>.
The latter is my main phone, and I prefer it to the Apple phone, not
sure why, it’s what I use for most things. I need the iPhone because I
use an Apple Watch. Lately there’s been some trouble with the screen on
the Pixel 6, on certain gestures, the right edge lights up in bright
green and then immediately returns to normal. I’m thinking the display
may be about to fail? It might be time for a new phone. So I went to the
Pixel site to see what they have that’s new and found that they’re
announcing a new phone, the
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ac8f1461-9923-43da-87b9-b951ff2f32b2">Pixel
9</a>, on Tuesday. So I immediately, of course, dropped the idea of
buying an upgrade today, why not wait till the new version is out. I
looked over the teaser, guessing that AI figures big in this release.
Not sure how I feel about that because the last thing I want to do is
switch over to Google’s AI from my beloved ChatGPT. Kind of the same
thing I see happening with Threads re Twitter.</p>

to hear what the NYT-centered media has to say because it’s all

I have to listen to nonstop bullshit, I’d rather hear from people who
