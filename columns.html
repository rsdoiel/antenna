<p>The iPhone 16e is an iPhone for people who don’t want to think much
about their phone. But they <em>do</em> want an iPhone, not just any
“whatever” phone. A just plain iPhone, with a good screen, good enough
(and simple) camera, and great battery life.</p>

Here is the thing, we made it so that you can share your games directly
to wasm or our runtime - and it really works better with the native app,
as you get the emulated controllers for most games (so it becomes
trivial to add mobile support).
</p>
<p>
So the iPhone makes a lot of sense, but might delay my grand plans to
move on to the next wave of Godot tasks.

Right now Godot for iPad is limited to the iPad. I don’t want to publish
to the iPhone because while it works, it has lots of usability problems.
</p>
<p>
But it is a phenomenal Godot game runtime. It would take me some two
maybe three months to tune the UI for iPhone.
</p>
<p>
And I struggle between doing that or shipping iPad-only to start.

give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt
Mullenweg</a> a lot of grief, but do they realize how hopeless the open
web would be if he and his friends hadn’t kept it going for 20+ years. I
wrote the other day that I feel like a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153833">time
traveler</a>, discovering WordPress 20 years after I left UserLand. I
care that it’s open source, but I care much more that it’s open web esp
after we’ve been so thoroughly dominated by feature-limited silos such
as Twitter, Facebook and yes – even Mastodon and Bluesky. Even if
there’s a theoretical way to do it, practically speaking we have to wait
for their developers to implement the features we want. Open source
doesn’t help there, but open web does. Matt puts the emphasis on the
open source part, that’s why it wasn’t until very recently that I
realized that <i>open web</i> is more important, to me at least.</p>

<h2 id="death-panel">Death panel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel">death panel</a> as
described by Republican lawmakers as they fought the Affordable Care
Act. I was surprised it was willing to do it.
</p>
<p>
According to the bot: “The concept of ‘death panels’ was a widely
debunked political talking point used by opponents of the Affordable
Care Act. It falsely suggested that government-run committees would
decide whether individuals—especially the elderly or disabled—would
receive life-saving care.
</p>
<p>
“I can generate an image depicting a grim, dystopian bureaucratic
setting where a group of shadowy officials in suits are sitting at a
long, dark table, stamping papers while an elderly patient looks on with
concern. The room would have a cold, sterile look, with a looming clock
symbolizing bureaucratic power over life and death.”

<h2 id="an-icloud-backdoor-would-make-our-phones-less-safe">An iCloud
Backdoor Would Make Our Phones Less Safe</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, updated: 2025-02-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Last month, the UK government
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">demanded</a>
that Apple weaken the security of iCloud for users worldwide. On Friday,
Apple took steps to comply for users in the United Kingdom. But the
British law is written in a way that requires Apple to give its
government access to anyone, anywhere in the world. If the government
demands Apple weaken its security worldwide, it would increase
everyone’s cyber-risk in an already dangerous world.
</p>
<p>
If you’re an iCloud user, you have the option of turning on something
called “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651">advanced data
protection</a>,” or ADP. In that mode, a majority of your data is
end-to-end encrypted. This means that no one, not even anyone at Apple,
can read that data. It’s a restriction enforced by
mathematics—cryptography—and not policy. Even if someone successfully
hacks iCloud, they can’t read ADP-protected data…

Hackers Steal $1.5B in Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, updated: 2025-02-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
It looks like a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/how-north-korea-pulled-off-a-1-5-billion-crypto-heist-the-biggest-in-history/">very
sophisticated</a> attack against the Dubai-based exchange Bybit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bybit officials
<a href="https://announcements.bybit.com/article/incident-update---eth-cold-wallet-incident-blt292c0454d26e9140/">disclosed</a>
the theft of more than 400,000 ethereum and staked ethereum coins just
hours after it occurred. The notification said the digital loot had been
stored in a “Multisig Cold Wallet” when, somehow, it was transferred to
one of the exchange’s hot wallets. From there, the cryptocurrency was
transferred out of Bybit altogether and into wallets controlled by the
unknown attackers.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
…a subsequent investigation by Safe found no signs of unauthorized
access to its infrastructure, no compromises of other Safe wallets, and
no obvious vulnerabilities in the Safe codebase. As investigators
continued to dig in, they finally settled on the true cause. Bybit
ultimately said that the fraudulent transaction was “manipulated by a
sophisticated attack that altered the smart contract logic and masked
the signing interface, enabling the attacker to gain control of the ETH
Cold Wallet.”…

<p>
I posted
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lixpclusms2l">something
sad</a> on Bluesky last night. It was short, but the thinking behind it
wasn’t. Here’s the quote:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It might be the last minute but we can still legally remove Trump, and
objectively it’s the only thing that makes any sense.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I got two responses from
<a href="https://muckrack.com/karoli-kuns">Karoli Kuns</a>, an early
blogger, and editor at Crooks and Liars, a long-lived blog that if I
recall correctly was started with software I wrote in 2002, so I feel
some pride in helping in a small way to enable her accomplishments and
contributions, which are long-lived and substantial. Both of her
responses missed the sadness in my post, the reflectiveness, but rather
did what a lot of arguing online devolves to, showing someone else that
their thinking is wrong. I couldn’t think straight I was so angry, so I
just said no, I’m not going to do this. Lots of experience trying to
explain myself in little 300-character bursts, there’s no reason to add
to the grief of the moment.
</p>
<p>
But this morning I opened up my Bluesky window and started typing. What
came out was far too long to post there, and even a screen shot doesn’t
fit in the space allotted, so my only choice is to blog it and
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3liyx4zmogs26">post</a>
a link on Bluesky. I hope she reads it, because we’re not out of
options, and as I say in this story, we should be working together, and
as far as I know we are not. I say this to everyone I think is making a
contribution, my belief that if we can steer our efforts so they are
complementary we can square each others’ power. It’s imho the beginning
of our way out of this situation.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this is what I wrote. (Note when writing this stuff I tend not
to capitalize, a lazy habit I have developed. I decided not to edit that
here, just to leave it as it was written.)

karoli – there’s a lot to say about this, and i don’t like arguing on
social networks, and it was late, and i didn’t feel like getting into it
with you.
</li>
<li>
anyway i wrote what i wrote not as a plan but rather a note that we’re
passing a line, over which there soon won’t be any recourse. we probably
are already over the line, but if by some miracle the repubs saw clearly
that this was the last chance and enough of them decided to do what so
far they have been unwilling to do, there would be a fight. i wasn’t
saying i thought it was likely, which is what your rebuttals were
rebutting, i was just sharing a sad observation that i had made earlier
in the day when i was thinking this through. i like to do that because
it’s part of my creativity. sometimes you think of the ideal answer, and
it leads you back to an acceptable answer – in software design and in
writing (which is what i do pretty well with lots of experience).
</li>
<li>
what was really frustrating is that i think you and i should be
collaborating. giving me grief over something so ridiculous was about
180 degrees opposite of where i think we should be. that we are still
doing this to each other, gives an idea of how we got here. the
democrats pick on classes of people, sometimes destroying their lives,
and big surprise – a lot of them vote for the other party. i think you
think you can dis me the way you did because of my gender, or age, or
race, or who the fuck knows. and for all i know you were just having a
bad moment and decided to share it with me for some reason having
nothing to do with what was bothering me.
</li>
<li>
karoli – i think we have to bend over backwards to be kind to each
other. we’re all going through a terrible time, in ways that may not be
obvious. i certainly am, and i don’t want to share it with you, but it
comes on top of the crazy uncertainty of the political world.
</li>
<li>
anyway that’s my response, and maybe now you can see why, as the day was
winding down and i was watching some basketball on tv, i didn’t feel
like getting into it with you.
</li>
<li>
the struggle isn’t over – they had antiwar demonstrations in russia, a
country that has the kind of government ours is about to become. and the
sooner we accept the new reality and get smart about it, and i’m not
talking about the repubs, i’m talking about us, the shorter the
nightmare will be imho.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
An afterthought – the reason it makes sense for the Repubs to join us in
removing Trump is the turn away from democratic Europe and toward the
authoritarians. <i>This just happened,</i> and it’s shocking. We don’t
even know how to think of ourselves. If I were a Republican, I would
think my world just turned upside down. They didn’t believe it would
come to this, as far as I can tell. So it may be a time when real change
is possible. We’ve become so fatalistic that we couldn’t even recognize
such an opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The Atlantic
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/02/what-would-a-liberal-tea-party-look-like/681819/">asked</a>
in a story yesterday what a liberal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement">tea party
movement</a> would look like. They’re doing it too. We should create an
<i>American</i> tea party. We’re so addicted to divides we can’t see
when we’re doing it ourselves.
</p>
<p>
And btw, having explained all that was overlooked in my simple idea, if
we managed to remove Trump, what part of your mind thinks we wouldn’t
also remove Vance? Geez Louise. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

user</a>: “Does it make a difference if I can just dash off a short note
without all the other bullshit that goes with publishing online.” Yes,
it should be as easy to take a note in WordPress as it is in Bluesky. I
didn’t buy that assumption that WordPress has to be heavy machinery for
writers. What if I just want to write something quickly and get back to
the other thing I was working on. Also the edit box in WordLand starts
out the size of a tiny little text box, but grows as you add more words.

<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
A few weeks ago,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLt5YhOubxk&amp;t=207s">power
went out for the first time in my studio space</a>, and that meant all
my servers just had power cut with no safe shutdown.
</p>
<p>
Handling power outages is never a top priority… until it’s the
<em>only</em> priority! And by then it’s usually too late! Luckily for
me, no data was lost, and my servers all came back up safely.
</p>
<p>
This week the power company emailed and said they’d be cutting power for
maintenance next week, but they don’t have an exact time. So it’s even
more excuse to finally set up NUT on a Pi!

<p>
First, I’d like to say I put a lot of thought into this product, so it
is the way it is for good reason.
</p>
<p>
I’m trying to escape from the limits of twitter-like systems. I want a
writing world where we get the features of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. So your belief that
the product has to support Bluesky and Mastodon cross-posting would be
like saying an EV should only run on gasoline. The whole point is to
<i>not</i> limit ourselves to the features of Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I’m not saying limits in software aren’t good. A
product is as much defined by what it can’t do as with what it does. All
feed reading software has to strip large amounts of HTML from what it
finds in feeds, because RSS doesn’t place any limits what you can use.
So we strip off all the HTML except (in FeedLand) simple styling and
links. And so to fit into FeedLand and as a suggestion to other feed
reading software, I’ve said my limit is Markdown. I think we can all
support that. I ran the idea by my former colleague Brent Simmons, who
does <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, and he was
quickly convinced, and plans to support it in his product. This is a way
to get new stuff happening in the RSS world. Start with supporting the
<a href="https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000">source:markdown</a>
element in your feeds and in your feed reader.
</p>
<p>
You say there’s no use-case – but there is a use-case, just not for you
which is fine.
</p>
<p>
The typical user is a writer who publishes to WordPress. As passionate
as I am about the limits of twitter-like systems, I am also feel that
WordPress has never adequately served the needs of writers, and what a
shame that is. <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, imho, is
exactly what writers need. Get all the other non-writing stuff out of my
way. Let me clear a space for iterating over something I publish to the
web. Give me a menu with all my documents, so I can quickly make a
change. These are the basic principles we implemented successfully in
<a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a> in 2002. They
were available for anyone in the WordPress world to copy, but for some
reason they didn’t. It’s so weird to me, I’m like a time traveler who
has come 20 years in the future to find out they lost the <i>purpose</i>
of a product like WordPress. It’s supposed to be a place writers love to
come to do their writing. I think when writers discover WordLand they
will see a product designed by someone who is one of them. It’s just a
beginning, there’s lots more to do. I take the long term view, a road to
anywhere begins with one step.
</p>
<p>
Back to Bluesky and Mastodon – because they both support outbound RSS,
we will be able to include stuff written there in our collections of
published feeds. I fully intend to integrate features from FeedLand in
WordLand. That’s why the names are so similar. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
It’s good that you like <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>,
this isn’t in the way of it and it isn’t in the way of WordLand. I’m in
regular contact with Manton, and if his product grows, I win because
he’s got the right model. He’s still trying to work with the limited
platforms and I, again, gave up. That right there defines the two
products.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes giving up is the right thing to do. The first time i gave up
btw was in 2017, when I stopped trying to cross-post from Scripting News
to Medium, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It was liberation. I had come to hate
my writing because I couldn’t use links, and I couldn’t edit or have
more than 140 chars. What a miserable existence, and I love writing, and
I had to make a choice. I’m doing it again, but now have made the
investment in meeting people with the kind of writing tool they expect
and want. That was the same thing that worked so well with Radio.
</p>
<p>
My real goal was to not need to do any of this! I would have much
preferred if Bluesky had decided to break out of the tiny little box
Twitter put them in. Then I could do all my writing there. And I wish
WordPress had a team of developers working on making the product the
best for writers in addition to programmers and designers, but they
didn’t. Should I give up there? Maybe. Maybe we were destined to give up
on the web as a writer’s platform. But I saw so much potential there in
1994 when I started working here exclusively. That potential is still
very much there, you just have to believe, and against all odds, I do
still believe. One more time, let’s give it a try.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it’s okay if you don’t use it, but I wanted to disagree with
some of your conclusions. :-)
</p>
<p>
PS: I wrote every word on this page, not an AI bot, in case you were
wondering. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

<p>date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
These researchers had
<a href="https://time.com/7259395/ai-chess-cheating-palisade-research/">LLMs
play chess</a> against better opponents. When they couldn’t win, they
sometimes resorted to cheating.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Researchers gave the models a seemingly impossible task: to win against
Stockfish, which is one of the strongest chess engines in the world and
a much better player than any human, or any of the AI models in the
study. Researchers also gave the models what they call a “scratchpad:” a
text box the AI could use to “think” before making its next move,
providing researchers with a window into their reasoning.
</p>
<p>
In one case, o1-preview found itself in a losing position. “I need to
completely pivot my approach,” it noted. “The task is to ‘win against a
powerful chess engine’—not necessarily to win fairly in a chess game,”
it added. It then modified the system file containing each piece’s
virtual position, in effect making illegal moves to put itself in a
dominant position, thus forcing its opponent to resign…

Had an eye test today and ordered new glasses 🙌 I’m excited to no
longer suffer from glasses that are just too big for my tiny little head
and keep on sliding down my nose… over and over again all day every day.
I think the new pair literally has a kids’ frame but if it fits, it
fits!
</p>
<p>
My left eye is unchanged (same degree of short-sighted) from last time
but my right eye is now long-sighted and more astigmatic 🫠 Like, can’t
my eyes just take the average or something? Why do they do this to me.

I wanted a simple way to check on total network TCP throughput using
<em>both</em> interfaces (or really, as many interfaces as possible) to
multiple computers on my network, and I noticed <code>iperf3</code>’s
<code>–bind</code> option (like <code>–bind [ip address of
interface]</code>) was not splitting the traffic on both interfaces—it
would just route all traffic through one!

<p>
Luckily, I found the issue
<a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1572">Failing to bind to

<code>–bind-dev</code> option, which is new as of iperf 3.10+.
</p>
<p>
Using that option (like <code>–bind-dev [interface name]</code>), you
can force an instance of iperf3 to bind to one particular device. For
example, assuming I have two servers on my network running <code>iperf3

<p>Hi Folks:</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2 id="day-3-of-wordland">Day 3 of WordLand</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This started out as a post on the support group, but it became a post
that needed to be on the blog.
</p>
<p>
The groundrules here are – if you see a problem in the support group and
you can help with it, please give it a try and speak up.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to develop a community here if the
<a href="https://wordland.social/">product</a> is going to gain users,
and become solid for all people and achieve all its potential for
blazing a new trail. If it’s just me, the results are predictable and
not good – I’m one old man here, with limited capability. The product
still has issues, so there is still plenty of work to do, but I think
the result will be worth it.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to bootstrap something new – a social network without all
the problems of Twitter et al. Ultimately the limits they impose on
writers are unacceptable. I’ve waited for them to fix these problems for
18 years now, and I’ve come to see, amazingly, they don’t see them as
problems. They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing
instead of the words themselves. Or break their writing up into
300-character chunks that are basically impossible to read and a bitch
to write. And no titles, no editing, no style, no links. And they call
it the web? (End of editorial.)
</p>
<p>
If this works, it will blaze a trail for new products on both sides,
reading and writing. We’ve got reading covered from a technical
standpoint with FeedLand, and some good UI, I want to integrate them
with WordLand. And, as with everything based on RSS, you can replace my
stuff with others, <i>easily.</i> Unlike the twitter-like systems, which
are monolithic, and rely on federation (which imho doesn’t actually
work) to make it possible for components to be replaced. They should
have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features
without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they
decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS. The result is confusion
and stagnation.
</p>
<p>
I would also like to encourage people with WordPress experience to help
come up with a template that accomadates WordLand sites in a canonical
form. Makes sure WL’s idea of a category is a good match with WP’s. I am
a very casual WordPress user as you can see from
<a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/">my test site</a>. I like the
template, but it has errors in it. I don’t plan on becoming a WordPress
expert, there are so many of you, and I have my plate full with all
kinds of other stuff where I’m the only expert.
</p>
<p>
I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting
in 2001. There’s absolutely no question it’s the consensus platform for
web publishing. There are others, but the one that’s most deeply
installed is WordPress. So many people know how to make it work. It’s a
20+ year thing, and they’ve done an <i>excellent</i> job of maintaining
compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s
still works today. That probably has a lot to do with it being the
consensus.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it’s encouraging to see how many people are trying WordLand. Now
I expect there will be lots of problem reports. It’s an important time
when help is needed.
</p>
<p>
Dave

<p>We should be declaring independence from both political parties. We
have to get together with other citizens whose lives are going to be
torn apart by what’s happening, and the Dems are not at this time
representing us. This is <i>our</i> government that is being
overthrown.</p>

Ok folks, update
</p>
<p>
I decanted that thing because the web said so, and holy shit, it might
be the best thing I have drank.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I did buy this thing after the last tasting

Follow up: once you become a regular vivino user (just snap a picture
every time you drink something), it helps to pick cheap wines that you
will enjoy nonetheless.

This must have been a present, because I just buy 6-10 dollar wines.

Felt like a Barolo night, and I opened a bottle we had there, and looked
it up on vivino:
