of my favorite features in the newest version of Bingeworthy is that it
can generate a ChatGPT
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fhappy-valley">review</a>
of a program.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/27/bingeScreenShot.png">Screen
shot</a>. I wouldn’t have opened this up before because of that would
let in the weirdness of the internets. This way we can find out what
people thought, as sanitized by ChatGPT. BTW do you think the root of
sanitized is sane? As the root of ignorant is ignore? Of course

<h2 id="a-bingeworthy-sunday">A Bingeworthy Sunday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wasn’t planning on this, but there was a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/bingeworthySupport/issues/5">report</a>
that there was a problem with
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>, looked into it
and was able to fix it.
</p>
<p>
Source of problem: When I added a feature that lets you ask ChatGPT to
review the program you’re looking at, I broke the ability to add a new
program to the database. It took about 15 minutes to track down and
verify and another few minutes to fix – and now that important function
works again.
</p>
<p>
As long as I was in there working around, I updated the
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml">Bingeworthy RSS feed</a> to
only report program additions. The other events it was reporting just
weren’t as interesting.
</p>
<p>
I also added that feed to my
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/27/blogrolledBingeworthy.png">blogroll</a>
on <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’d say it works a lot better now.

<p>A couple of days ago I saw a “guess the cubomania” challenge from
Theo. I’ve had an interest in Cubomania in the past and played around
with the idea a bit. After a chat with D. who gave me a few engravers I
googled a bit and guessed, wrongly, Goya. Next I thought to ask […]</p>

<h2 id="testing-a-reset-of-the-one-week-jail">2025-07-23 Testing a reset
of the one week jail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-07-23-testing-a-reset-of-the-one-week-jail">
2025-07-23 Testing a reset of the one week jail
</h1>
<p>
I’ve had a number of people complaining about being banned and I’ve been
wondering whether I should reduce the ban-time for the escalation jail.
Right now, if you’ve been banned for 1h five times in a 24h period,
you’re banned for one week. What I f I reduced this one week to three
days (“one long weekend”), for example?
</p>
<p>
As a test, I wanted to reset all the one week bans and see whether load
explodes or not. If most of the scraping has ceased, then perhaps there
would be no problem?
</p>
<p>
So around 10:30 local time, I made a backup of the weekly jail:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned &gt; butlerian-jihad-week.json
# sed s/\'/\&quot;/g &lt; butlerian-jihad-week.json | jq length
2862
# fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned
[]
</code></pre>
<p>
The backup has 2862 entries, the jail is now empty.
</p>
<p>
Let’s watch Munin!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-1.jpg" alt="The graph shows the one week jail pretty constant at nearly 3000 entries dropping to zero moments ago." />
</p>
<p>
40 minutes later. What are you dooooing‽
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-2.jpg" alt="10 minutes after the reset, the 1h jail already has over 700 entries and in another 10 minutes, it has 850 entries." />
</p>
<p>
And who’s doing it?
</p>
<pre><code># asn-find (grep &quot;^2025-07-23 1.* \[butlerian-jihad\] Ban &quot; /var/log/fail2ban.log|cut -c 89-)\
    | cut -f2-3 | sort | uniq
16567   NETRIX-16567, US
17035   NBCUNI-17035, US
19855   MASERGY, US
209366  SEMRUSH-AS, CY
35485   MAILUP-SPA, IT
39630   ASPTECH, GB
7922    COMCAST-7922, US
8069    MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US
8075    MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US
</code></pre>
<p>
The only obvious thing I can see is that Semrush and Microsoft are
trying to crawl the site using their bots, one for their marketing and
search engine optimisation and the other for their search engine itself.
But remember: <a href="2023-10-04-search">2023-10-04 Search engines, the
deal is off!</a>. I am no longer convinced that being listed by search
engines is in my best interest.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-3.jpg" alt="A few hours later, the scene appears unchanged. There are four waves of blocks, going up to between 1000 and 1500 banned entries and coming back down again." />
</p>
<p>
If that’s the image, then perhaps the long term punitive ban doesn’t
have to be that long.
</p>
<p>
And what’s the situation 24h later?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-4.jpg" alt="The fifth wave generates entries in the one-week ban. But the cycles for the one-hour ban continues and so more entries keep getting added to the one-week ban." />
</p>
<p>
And another day later:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-5.jpg" alt="The situation has stabilised around 1400 blocked entries." />
</p>
<p>
And another day later:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-6.jpg" alt="The bots were back and now we&rsquo;re at 2900 entries blocked for a week." />
</p>
<p>
Every day is worse. If you look at the graph below, you’ll notice that
Saturday morning just after 2:00 there was a huge wave of about 6000
entries that got blocked for an hour. The same wave repeats around 9:00,
13:00, 18:00. And then, nearly 24h later, just before 2:00, the fifth
such wave rolls in. At at that point, the bans are added to both the
one-hour and the one-week jail.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-7.jpg" alt="The one-week ban now has 9000 entries after a surge at 1:50 in the morning adding about 6000 new entries" />

<p>
<strong>2025-07-25</strong>. So now, two days after a reset, I’d like to
see who’s hovering just below those limits I’ve set. If they seem to be
innocents, that would be an argument to raise the limits. If they seem
to be bots, that would be an argument to lower the limits or, given that
the system load is OK at the moment, to leave the limit as it is.
</p>
<p>
Let’s go through the various test.
</p>
<p>
First, “active autonomous systems”. On a good day, the limit is 500
requests per autonomous system.
</p>
<pre><code># show-active-autonomous-systems --top 3
count   percent ASN AS
234 4.54    45102   ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN
172 3.33    208258  ACCESS2IT Access2.IT Network, NL
158 3.06    12880   DCI-AS, IR
total: 5158
</code></pre>
<p>
Clearly, Alibaba is a bot hoster in China. What about Access2.IT in the
Netherlands?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 208258 | log-request | rank-lines 
    176 /
</code></pre>
<p>
Clearly, that is also a bot. 2h is 120 minutes. This company is checking
more than once per minute whether my sites are up. That angers me. They
probably sell uptime data to other companies.
</p>
<p>
What about the autonomous system from Iraq?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 12880 | log-request | rank-lines 
    164 /
</code></pre>
<p>
The same bullshit! 😲
</p>
<p>
So my conclusion is that the limit could be lower! 😠
</p>
<p>
Next, let’s look at “expensive end-points”. These are the endpoints I’m
planning to <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/2025-07-13_AI_Scrapers">do
away with</a>, eventually.
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log \
    | egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | asncounter --top 3 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null
count   percent ASN AS
27  4.42    7922    COMCAST-7922, US
11  1.8 6939    HURRICANE, US
8   1.31    7713    TELKOMNET-AS-AP PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, ID
total: 611
</code></pre>
<p>
Comcast in the United States seems to request all sorts of things:
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 7922 | log-request | rank-lines
      7 /1pdc/2024/
      4 /view/index.rss
      4 /osr/feed.xml
      4 /osr/atom.xml

      1 /zen?action=rss&amp;all=0&amp;days=90&amp;rcfilteronly=%22WikioStyle%22&amp;showedit=1
</code></pre>
<p>
Note how only one of these requests is one of the “forbidden” URLs. But
apparently it’s also attempting to upload images! Looks like spiders, if
you ask me.
</p>
<p>
What about Hurricane in the United States?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 6939 | log-user-agent | rank-lines

      4 Feedbin feed-id:2584020 - 2 subscribers
      4 Feedbin feed-id:1821891 - 1 subscribers
</code></pre>
<p>
What the hell is wrong with these people? Do I really have these many
interesting feeds?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 6939 | log-request | rank-lines
      9 /view/index.rss
      8 /osr/feed.xml
      6 /view/RPG.rss
      5 /files/osr-discord.xml

      4 /podcast/hh.xml
      3 /wiki/feed/full/RPG
      3 /wiki/feed/full/Old_School
</code></pre>
<p>
Maybe. 😬
</p>
<p>
Four requests means one request every half hour, for every feed. I guess
it makes sense.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I seems that maybe these autonomous systems are hitting a
lot of expensive end-points but in general, they are all focused on feed
processing.
</p>
<p>
The autonomous system from Indonesia looks even more like a bot but in
addition to that it also goes through all the archives, for every single
page:
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 7713 | log-request | rank-lines

      1 /wiki?action=admin&amp;id=UserInterfaceValidator
</code></pre>
<p>
Hopefully most of that will be fixed once the forms all change from GET
to POST. 😬
</p>
<p>
In any case, I don’t feel like lifting this limit!
</p>
<p>
The last instance involves banning all the autonomous systems that are
hitting “no bots” warnings. The web server does this redirect for
various requests, including all user agents containing the words “bot”,
“spider”, “crawl” etc.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to change all my <code>robots.txt</code> files to the
following:
</p>
<pre><code>User-agent: *

<h2 id="a-social-media-ethos">A social media ethos</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’m trying to come up with an ethos of how I want to use social media.
What rules and constraints do I put around it. This is a living
document.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rules for posting/reposting content:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Repost/Share cool links from the internet
</li>
<li>
Repost/Share cool art (and credit whenever possible)
</li>
<li>
Repost/Share people looking for work
</li>
<li>
Doubly-so if the people above are in tech and from an underrepresented
group
</li>
<li>
Repost/Share job listing from reputable companies
</li>
<li>
Then… if you’ve done all that, promote your own thing
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>General principles for me and my brain:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have a bad habit of starting the day off with a goof, avoid this
</li>
<li>
I like riffing and puns but it can have reply-guy vibes, limit this
</li>
<li>
In any conversation you have 3 options: Be rude, Be nice, Say nothing –
the latter is usually the most correct answer
</li>
<li>
It’s okay to let people be wrong
</li>
<li>
Write down the issues you allow yourself to get outraged over
</li>
<li>
Read the room before posting
</li>
<li>
You can block/mute any person or channel for any reason, it’s fun
</li>
<li>
Research suggests it takes 23m15s to resume a task after a distraction!
</li>
<li>
Raycast Focus is your friend
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>On specific social-media apps:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
X is for Nazis and Russian bot nets, avoid.
</li>
<li>
FB/Instgram are for family and friends, use on occasion.
</li>
<li>
TikTok is a dopamine trap, avoid.
</li>
<li>
YouTube is a dopamine trap, but useful.
</li>
<li>
Bluesky is fine.
</li>
<li>
Mastodon is for quality conversations.
</li>
<li>
Discord is for like-minded communities, prioritize intimate ones.
</li>
<li>
Log into LinkedIn once a month and give some thumbs-ups. It supports
your friends and colleagues in the algorithmic trash fire and that
<em>handshakefullness</em> and relationship building might be helpful in
the future if you need a job.
</li>
</ul>

<p>To paraphrase Sigmund Freud, sometimes a memo is not just a
memo. That’s why we have to read between the lines of Satya Nadella’s
1,150-word memo. Microsoft’s chairman and CEO, in his message, tried to
rationalize the 9,000-employee layoff. I was interested in how he was
positioning the AI-based disruption in the software industry. This memo
is not just about Microsoft. In a way, it’s a weather forecast for the
rest of …</p>

<p>
So what about <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmuse.git/">that
old wiki software</a> that’s been serving me so well for more than
twenty years?
</p>
<p>
Back then, Recent Changes or a search for a page title was implemented
as a GET request. The idea was that it would be possible to bookmark or
share such links. But what has happened instead is that the web scrapers
are losing themselves in a gazillion dynamic pages, trying to ingest
them. And since searches and filters are expensive operations, this
drives up the load of the system hosting the wiki.
</p>
<p>
Examples such as these showed up in previous blog posts:
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 7713 | log-request | rank-lines
      1 /wiki/Older_Upgrading_Issues

      1 /wiki?action=admin&amp;id=UserInterfaceValidator
</code></pre>
<p>
In theory, POST is used when making changes to a web resource such as a
wiki page. What I’ve done now is I wrote an extension that
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/POST_instead_of_GET_extension">changes
all these links to forms</a> and I’ve installed it for the Oddmuse wikis
I still run.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the web server is blocking requests to these URLs.
</p>
<pre><code># Block for GET requests for search, recent changes and filtered feeds
RewriteCond &quot;%{QUERY_STRING}&quot; &quot;search=&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{QUERY_STRING}&quot; &quot;action=rc&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{QUERY_STRING}&quot; &quot;action=rss[&amp;;]&quot;
RewriteRule &quot;^&quot; https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s see if that starts cutting down on the number of these requests
I’m getting. I suspect that many of these URLs are in fact stored in
training sets so it will take a long time for these URLs to fade from
use.

<h2 id="modernizing-my-sound-system">Modernizing my sound system</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-25, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I got tired of my old sound system, too many wires, a big receiver whose
functions I never used, all designed long before the 4-year-old 65-inch
OLED screen on top of it all, so I downscaled to a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWLCLZPS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1">Sony
soundbar</a>, figured that was as simple as you could get, for $300,
thinking of it as an experiment.
</p>
<p>
I liked it but then I thought to ask ChatGPT a question I’ve had for a
while. I want a small amp designed for today’s music and video, and went
through a bunch of options and came up with the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGCLXH4H?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1">WiiM
Home amp</a>. No speakers, unlike the soundbar, but hooks up to the TV
via the ARC connector, and I have plenty of old speakers to try out in
this configuration.
</p>
<p>
I got it yesterday and the setup experience was pretty great and the
feature list is totally 2025. Will have more to say for sure.

Today’s freaky

<p>
We study subliminal learning, a surprising phenomenon where language
models learn traits from model-generated data that is semantically
unrelated to those traits. For example, a “student” model learns to
prefer owls when trained on sequences of numbers generated by a
“teacher” model that prefers owls. This same phenomenon can transmit
misalignment through data that appears completely benign. This effect
only occurs when the teacher and student share the same base model.

<h1 id="2025-07-19-the-current-setup-defending-my-sites">
2025-07-19 The current setup defending my sites
</h1>
<p>
I wrote this post (and posted it
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2025-07-19">on Emacs Wiki</a>)
because people have been wondering about it all on Reddit. I’m no longer
on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
If you see other people on the net wondering whether one of my sites is
down, feel free to repost this message or parts of it. Sadly, you won’t
be able to link to it, because the people wondering are probably banned
by the firewall.
</p>
<p>
Why am I having visitors banned by the firewall? The web has been under
attack by AI scrapers since around 2022. That’s when big companies
decided they needed to train AI and one of the sources of training
material was the web. (Another source was a huge collection of pirated
books, but that’s a different story.) And if your task is to scrape as
much of the web as possible, you can’t be picky. The result is
devastating. Let me quote Drew DeVault:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you think these crawlers respect robots.txt then you are several
assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl
everything they can find, robots.txt be damned, including expensive
endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit
in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that overlap with
end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses – mostly
residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than one HTTP
request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and
maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding
attempts to characterize their behavior or block their traffic. –
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">Please
stop externalizing your costs directly into my face</a>, by Drew
DeVault, for SourceHut
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So people have been scrambling to defend their sites against the AI
scraper stampede. There are no good tools.
</p>
<p>
One of the first measures was to block self-identified scrapers and
bots. Any user agent containing the words “bot”, “crawler”, “spider”,
“ggpht” or “gpt” are automatically redirected to a “No Bots” page with
an HTTP status of 410, which means the resource is gone and the user
agent should remove it from their database. And then I have another list
of user agents that keep hitting the site: bots to help search engine
optimisers (SEO), bots to “audit” the site, bots to check uptime, get
page previews, and on and on. Whenever I checked the top hitters on my
sites, I’d find another user agent or two to add to the list.
</p>
<p>
But as you saw in Drew DeVault’s blog post, AI scrapers have been
working around this by faking regular user agents, making them
indistinguishable from humans. The solution, therefore, is not to listen
to what they say but watch what they do.
</p>
<p>
One tool I stumbled upon pretty early was using <code>fail2ban</code>.
The traditional way of using it is to have it check a log file such as
the <code>sshd</code> log for failed login attempts. If an IP address
was causing too many failed login attempts, they would get banned for 10
minutes. A nice trick is that you could also have it check its own log
files and if an IP address was getting banned multiple times, then they
would get banned for 1 week.
</p>
<p>
I started applying this to the web server log files. I figured a human
clicking a bunch of links might show a burst of activity, so I defined a
rate limit of 30 hits in 60 seconds. That is: the average rate must not
exceed one hit every 2 seconds but activity bursts of up to 30 hits are
OK. I also exclude a lot of URLs matching images and other resources.
</p>
<p>
The main limitation is that this rule is limited to single IP addresses.
And as you saw in Drew DeVault’s blog post, AI scrapers have been
working around this by using services that distribute requests over
whole networks. The solution, therefore, is to defend against entire
organisations.
</p>
<p>
Multiple times per hour, I have jobs scheduled that go through the last
two hours of the web server access log, extracting all the IP addresses
and determining their autonomous system number (ASN). That number
identifies whole internet service providers (ISP) or similar companies.
</p>
<p>
I know, using autonomous systems makes this a very broad ban hammer. It
catches innocent people that use an ISP that hires out computing power
and bandwidth to AI scrapers. But I don’t know any other way to fight
back bots “using random User-Agents that overlap with end-users and come
from tens of thousands of IP addresses”. So this is what it is. On the
positive side, the bans are temporary. They expire after a while. If the
AI scrapers are done ingesting the world-wide web, the ban is over. If
they’re still at it, the ban is reinstated.
</p>
<p>
The first job bans “active” autonomous systems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If load exceeds 10, the number of hits in a 2 hour period may not exceed
300 per ASN.
</li>
<li>
If load exceeds 5, the number of hits in a 2 hour period may not exceed
400 per ASN.
</li>
<li>
Under regular load, the number of hits in a 2 hour period may not exceed
500 per ASN.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This includes everything showing up in the web server access log
including hits for embedded things such as CSS files and images.
</p>
<p>
The second job bans autonomous systems hitting expensive end-points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If load exceeds 10, the number of expensive hits in a 2 hour period may
not exceed 10 per ASN.
</li>
<li>
If load exceeds 5, the number of expensive hits in a 2 hour period may
not exceed 20 per ASN.
</li>
<li>
Under regular load, the number of expensive hits in a 2 hour period may
not exceed 30 per ASN.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Expensive end-points are filtered RSS feed, Recent Changes and full-text
searches.
</p>
<p>
The third job bans autonomous systems hosting bots:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If load exceeds 10, the number of bot hits in a 2 hour period may not
exceed 10 per ASN.
</li>
<li>
If load exceeds 5, the number of bot hits in a 2 hour period may not
exceed 20 per ASN.
</li>
<li>
Under regular load, the number of bot hits in a 2 hour period may not
exceed 30 per ASN.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A bot hit is counted when the web server returned a HTTP status 410 as
mentioned above. In other words, these are all the user agents
containing the words “bot”, “crawler”, “spider”, “ggpht” or “gpt”.
</p>
<p>
The bans from the three jobs mentioned just now last for 1 hour.
</p>
<p>
If such a ban was made more than 5 times in a day, the ban is extended
to 1 week.
</p>
<p>
Banning an ASN means that all the networks it manages are banned.
</p>
<p>
If the system works, the AI scraper stampede starts, load starts to
climb up to 10, everything slows down to a crawl, the number of threads
goes up from 350 to 450, the number of TCP connection goes up from 150
to 550, the number of wiki processes goes up from 1 or 2 to 20, and
after a few minutes my jobs kick in and start banning IP addresses left
and right <a href="2025-07-18-my-hope">until things have calmed
down</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m still learning. The programmers working on AI scrapers are still
learning. The arms race isn’t over until their funding dries up. Until
we all decided that the costs of AI aren’t worth it. So this post is
just a snapshot. I’ll continue tweaking the setup.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry if this ban hammer is hitting you. It’s still better than
taking my sites offline. I’ve had to do that in the past because I did
not know what else to do.
</p>
<p>
The easy solution is to switch networks. You might still be able to
access the site from a mobile phone using mobile data, for example.
(Using a phone in a wifi network won’t work.)
</p>
<p>
A harder solution is to use a VPN or to switch ISP.
</p>
<p>
An alternative for those of you with a static IP address within a
network that is often banned is to <a href="Contact">contact me</a> and
I can add your specific IP address to an allow-list. Use
<a href="https://ip.small-web.org/">Your IP address</a> if you don’t
know your IP number. In that case, however, I suspect that it is not
static.
</p>
<p>
I can’t wait for the next AI winter. 🥶

<p>When trying to “work” with ChatGPT, realize that it’s mistakes could
be much worse than you could possibly imagine. It could be leading you
down a blind alley. You must always consider how full of shit it is. It
may not just be making things up, but it could not understand something
very basic about what you’re doing. There’s no limit to the ways it can
be wrong. And you can waste whole programming sessions chasing a
solution where none could possibly every under any circumstances be
found. The level of bullshit is sometimes hard to fathom.</p>

I have a site with a well developed set of categories, I’ve added to it
carefully over a few months, it covers most of the topics I write about.
Another site has a small set of categories. I write all my WordPress
posts in the same editor, and could easily set it up so that all
categories were available to me in every site I post to. The question:
Is that a good practice in the world of WordPress? I noticed that
categories are given global ID’s so if I use a category like “movies” it
will have the same ID as yours has on your sites. I love this idea of a
global namespace for categories, and see it as something that could be
adopted by sites written in any other writing environment. Anyway, if
you have a moment to comment, I’d appreciate your ideas. Update: Jeremy

<p>date: 2025-07-24, updated: 2025-07-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The current state of digital identity is a mess. Your personal
information is scattered across hundreds of locations: social media
companies, IoT companies, government agencies, websites you have
accounts on, and data brokers you’ve never heard of. These entities
collect, store, and trade your data, often without your knowledge or
consent. It’s both redundant and inconsistent. You have hundreds, maybe
thousands, of fragmented digital profiles that often contain
contradictory or logically impossible information. Each serves its own
purpose, yet there is no central override and control to serve you—as
the identity owner…

If you have to choose between Google’s web browser or one from your

<a href="https://www.404media.co/googles-ai-is-destroying-search-the-internet-and-your-brain/">destroying</a>
the web, as is ChatGPT and Claude etc. Because the people who tried to
capture flow using SEO made you wade through mountains of garbage before
you got the info you were coming there for, if you ever got it. It’s the
same thing with clicking links in Twitter. If instead, they had focus on
providing a product that made people happy and built respect for theri
brand, they’d still have a seat at the table. It’s too late to complain,
you had a chance to view your efforts as a business. But there’s still
plenty of potential for the web, esp if developers get imaginative in
how to use the new browser platforms. I don’t imagine Google’s going to
rock and roll too much with Chrome, but maybe they will.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-23, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-07-22-i-cannot-ignore-politics">
2025-07-22 I cannot ignore politics
</h1>
<p>
When I read something like
<a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2025/07/kumbaya.html">Kumbaya</a>
where James says that “not every game choice is a political act” and how
he misses that he and his friends back when they were kids just talked
about games and how these days it feels more like “excommunication”, I
wonder. I was happy to read Gern Blanston’s comment where they suspect
that things weren’t political back then because we were kids and didn’t
know. It’s definitely true for me. And now that I’m am adult, I can’t
look away.
</p>
<p>
I can’t ignore politics because I feel that politics is about being part
of society. Politics is about how society is organized. How one wants
society organized is a moral choice. Needless to say, I only want to
spend time with people that don’t do or support morally reprehensible
things. Not everybody feels that revulsion, but I do. And maybe it’s not
always easy to be good people, to know what’s right and what’s wrong,
but I believe that we should strive for it – and that means looking at
the moral choices made all around us, at the politics here and now. And
that also means that political choice has consequences.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, we’re blessed with alternatives. We don’t have to play
Barker’s Tékumel since there are so many other good games and settings
out there. I can separate the work and the artist but I don’t have to. I
do not feel that art is a goal in itself. Instead, I feel that art is an
expression of a human, and usually that means that there is a political
layer somewhere. Sometimes the politics contained within might be big
and in your face and sometimes it might be small and easy to ignore. But
I still think that political choice has consequences.
</p>
<p>
And if the word “politics” gets your hackles up, think of something
else, like animal abuse. I don’t want to buy books by somebody who
mistreats their cat, who speaks out in favour cat mistreatments, who
financially supports cat mistreatments, I don’t want to play their games
and I don’t understand the people who support them.

lawsuit</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Google on Thursday announced filing a lawsuit against the operators of
the Badbox 2.0 botnet, which has ensnared more than 10 million devices
running Android open source software.
</p>
<p>
These devices lack Google’s security protections, and the perpetrators
pre-installed the Badbox 2.0 malware on them, to create a backdoor and
abuse them for large-scale fraud and other illicit schemes.

<p>I think I figured out why the AI companies want to do web browsers.
It’s so that they can create an application development platform for
people who want to write apps that run inside a new environment where
the OS is a LLM. Lots of interesting possibilities. Imagine how the OS
API might work. You could restructure a database by explaining in
English how you want it restructured. In the freaking code. Could we
bury Algol-like languages the same way we buried assembly and machine
languages? Do we have the courage to imagine such things?</p>

On my recent visit to London I was struck by how many of the
advertisements in the Tube were selling AI. They fell into two groups,
one aimed at CEOs and the other at marketing people. This is typical,
the pitch for AI is impedance-matched to these targets:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The irresistible pitch to CEOs is that they can “do more with less”, or
in other words they can lay off all these troublesome employees without
impacting their products and sales.
</li>
<li>
Marketing people value plausibility over correctness, which is precisely
what LLMs are built to deliver. So the idea that a simple prompt will
instantly generate reams of plausible collateral is similarly
irresistible.
</li>
</ul>
In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html"><i>The
Back Of The AI Envelope</i></a> I explained:<br />
<blockquote>
why Sam Altman et al are so desperate to run the “drug-dealer’s
algorithm” (<i>the first one’s free</i>) and get the world hooked on
this drug so they can supply a world of addicts.
</blockquote>
You can see how this works for the two targets. Once a CEO has addicted
his company to AI by laying off most of the staff, there is no way he is
going to go cold turkey by hiring them back even if the AI fails to meet
his expectations. And once he has laid off most of the marketing
department, the remaining marketeer must still generate the reams of
collateral even if it lacks a certain something.<br /> <br /> Below the
fold I look into this example of the process Cory Doctrow called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The first thing to note is that
the pitch is working. The discourse is full of CEOs talking their book.
For example we have Matt Novak’s
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/billionaires-convince-themselves-ai-is-close-to-making-new-scientific-discoveries-2000629060"><i>Billionaires
Convince Themselves AI Chatbots Are Close to Making New Scientific
Discoveries</i></a> recounting the wisdom of Travis Kalnick:<br />
<blockquote>
“I’ll go down this thread with [Chat]GPT or Grok and I’ll start to get
to the edge of what’s known in quantum physics and then I’m doing the
equivalent of vibe coding, except it’s vibe physics,” Kalanick
<a href="https://youtu.be/Z0k-4wyH5vk">explained</a>. “And we’re
approaching what’s known. And I’m trying to poke and see if there’s
breakthroughs to be had. And I’ve gotten pretty damn close to some
interesting breakthroughs just doing that.”
</blockquote>
Then there are the programmers extolling “vibe coding” and how it
increases their productivity. CEOs who buy this pitch are laying off
staff left and right. For example, Jordan Novote reports that
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html"><i>Microsoft
laying off about 9,000 employees in latest round of cuts</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Microsoft said Wednesday that it will lay off about 9,000 employees. The
move will affect less than 4% of its global workforce across different
teams, geographies and levels of experience, a person familiar with the
matter told CNBC.<br /> …<br /> Microsoft has held several rounds of
layoffs already this calendar year. In January, it cut less than 1% of
headcount based on performance. The 50-year-old software company slashed
more than 6,000 jobs in May and then at least 300 more in June.

How well is this likely to work out? Evidence is accumulating that AI’s
capabilities are over-hyped. Thomas Claiburn’s
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/03/ai_models_potemkin_understanding/"><i>AI
models just don’t understand what they’re talking about</i></a> is an
example:<br />
<blockquote>
Asked to explain the ABAB rhyming scheme, OpenAI’s GPT-4o did so
accurately, responding, “An ABAB scheme alternates rhymes: first and
third lines rhyme, second and fourth rhyme.”<br /> <br /> Yet when asked
to provide a blank word in a four-line poem using the ABAB rhyming
scheme, the model responded with a word that didn’t rhyme appropriately.
In other words, the model correctly predicted the tokens to explain the
ABAB rhyme scheme without the understanding it would have needed to
reproduce it.<br /> <br /> The problem with potemkins in AI models is
that they invalidate benchmarks, the researchers argue. The purpose of
benchmark tests for AI models is to suggest broader competence. But if
the test only measures test performance and not the capacity to apply
model training beyond the test scenario, it doesn’t have much value.

As far as I know the only proper random controlled trial of AI’s
productivity increase comes from Model Evaluation and Threat Research
entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089"><i>Measuring the
Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open-Source Developer
Productivity</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature
projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience.
Each task is randomly assigned to allow or disallow usage of early 2025
AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers primarily use Cursor
Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. Before starting
tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time
by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI
reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI
actually increases completion time by 19%–AI tooling slowed developers
down.

<blockquote>
Even the devs who liked the AI found it was bad at large and complex
code bases like these ones, and over half the AI suggestions were not
usable. Even the suggestions they accepted needed a lot of fixing up.

This might be why Ashley Stewart reported that

<blockquote>
Julia Liuson, president of the Microsoft division responsible for
developer tools such as AI coding service GitHub Copilot, recently sent
an email instructing managers to evaluate employee performance based on
their use of internal AI tools like this.<br /> <br /> “AI is now a
fundamental part of how we work,” Liuson wrote. “Just like
collaboration, data-driven thinking, and effective communication, using
AI is no longer optional — it’s core to every role and every
level.”<br /> <br /> Liuson told managers that AI “should be part of
your holistic reflections on an individual’s performance and impact.”

Microsoft didn’t ask their customer whether they would pay for AI,
because the answer would have been no.
<a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-force-feeding-of-ai-on-an-unwilling">Gioia
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This is how AI gets introduced to the marketplace—by force-feeding the
public. And they’re doing this for a very good reason.<br /> <br /> Most
people won’t pay for AI voluntarily—just 8% according to a recent
survey. So they need to bundle it with some other essential product.
</blockquote>
As I discussed in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html"><i>The
Back Of The AI Envelope</i></a>, the AI giants running the drug-dealer’s
algorithm are losing money on every prompt.
<a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-force-feeding-of-ai-on-an-unwilling">Gioia
has noticed this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s another reason why huge tech companies do this—but they don’t
like to talk about it. If they bundle AI into other products and
services, they can <i>hide the losses</i> on their income
statement.<br /> <br /> That wouldn’t be possible if they charged for AI
as a standalone product. That would make its profitability (or, more
likely, loss) very easy to measure.<br /> <br /> Shareholders would
complain. Stock prices would drop. Companies would be forced to address
customer concerns.<br /> <br /> But if AI is bundled into existing
businesses, Silicon Valley CEOs can pretend that AI is a moneymaker,
even if the public is lukewarm or hostile.

Salesforce is another company that has
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/06/18/salesforce-ai-agents-dont-work-but-were-charging-6-more-for-ai-anyway/">spotted
this opportunity</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Yesterday Salesforce announced that prices on a pile of their services
are going up around 6% — because AI is just that cool.<br /> <br />
Salesforce’s stated reason for the price rise is “the significant
ongoing innovation and customer value delivered through our products.”
But you know the actual reason is because f- you, that’s why. What are
you gonna do, move to SAP? Yeah, didn’t think so.
</blockquote>
One problem is that the technology Salesforce is charging its customers
for doesn’t work well in Salesforce’s application space. Salesforce’s
own researchers developed a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18878">new bechmark suite called
CRMAArena-Pro</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena with nineteen expert-validated tasks
across sales, service, and ‘configure, price, and quote’ processes, for
both Business-to-Business and Business-to-Customer scenarios. It
distinctively incorporates multi-turn interactions guided by diverse
personas and robust confidentiality awareness assessments. Experiments
reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58% single-turn success on
CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to approximately
35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more
tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated
business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit
near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting
can improve this, it often compromises task performance.

To
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/06/18/salesforce-ai-agents-dont-work-but-were-charging-6-more-for-ai-anyway/">summarize
the results</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The agent bots had 58% success on tasks that can be done in one single
step. That dropped to 35% success if they had to take multiple steps.
The chatbot agents are also bad at confidentiality:<br />
<blockquote>
Agents demonstrate low confidentiality awareness, which, while
improvable through targeted prompting, often negatively impacts task
performance. These findings suggest a significant gap between current
LLM capabilities and the multifaceted demands of real-world enterprise
scenarios.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
Despite the fact that most consumers won’t pay the current prices, it is
inevitable that once the customers are addicted, prices will go up
spectacularly. But the wads of VC cash may not last long enough, and
things can get awkward with the customers who are paying the current
prices, as
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/07/09/cursor-tries-setting-less-money-on-fire-ai-vibe-coders-outraged/">David
Gerard reports</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
You could buy 500 Cursor requests a month for $20 on the “Pro” plan.
People bought a year in advance.<br /> <br /> In mid-June, Cursor
offered a new $200/month “Ultra” plan. But it also changed Pro from 500
requests to $20 of “compute” at cost price — the actual cost of
whichever chatbot vendor you were using. That was a lot less than 500
requests.<br /> <br /> You could stay on the old Pro plan! But users
reported they kept hitting rate limits and Cursor was all but
unusable.<br /> <br /> The new plan Pro users are getting surprise
bills, because the system doesn’t just stop when you’ve used up your
$20. One guy ran up $71 in one day.<br /> <br /> Anysphere has looked at
the finances and stopped subsidising the app. Users suddenly have to pay
what their requests are actually costing.<br /> <br /> Anysphere says
they put the prices up because “new models can spend more tokens per
request on longer-horizon tasks” — that is, OpenAI and Anthropic are
charging more.
</blockquote>
The CEO who laid off the staff faces another set of “business risks”.
First, OpenAI is close to a monopoly; it has around 90% of the chatbot
market. This makes it a single point of failure, and it
<a href="https://status.openai.com/incidents/01JXCAW3K3JAE0EP56AEZ7CBG3/write-up">does
fail</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On June 9 at 11:36  PM PDT, a routine update to the host Operating
System on our cloud-hosted GPU servers caused a significant number of
GPU nodes to lose network connectivity. This led to a drop in available
capacity for our services. As a result, ChatGPT users experienced
elevated error rates reaching ~35% errors at peak, while API users
experienced error rates peaking at ~25%. The highest impact occurred
between June 10 2:00  AM PDT and June 10 8:00  AM PDT.
</blockquote>
Second, the chatbots present an attractive attack surface. David Gerard
reports on a
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/08/10/microsofts-copilot-studio-ai-leaks-your-business-info-internally-and-externally/">talk
at Black Hat USA 2024</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Zenity CEO Michael Bargury spoke at Black Hat USA 2024 on Thursday on
how to exploit Copilot Studio:
<ul>
<li>
Users are encouraged to link “public” inputs that an attacker may have
control over.
</li>
<li>
A insider — malicious or just foolish — can feed their own files to the
LLM.
</li>
<li>
If you train the bot on confidential communications, it may share them
with the whole company.
</li>
<li>
63% of Copilot bots are discoverable online, out on the hostile
internet. Bargury fuzzed these bots with malformed prompts and got them
to spill confidential information.
</li>
</ul>
Bargury demonstrated intercepting a bank transfer between a company and
their client “just by sending an email to the person.”
</blockquote>
<p>So the technology being sold to the CEOs isn’t likely to live up to
expectations and it will cost many times the current price. But the way
it is being sold means that none of this matters. By the time the CEO
discovers these issues, the company will be addicted.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/building-a-pyramid.jpg" alt="1890s engraving of slaves building a pyramid" width="600" height="450">
<p>
There’s one quote from
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Elites-America-After-Meritocracy/dp/0307720462">Twilight
of the Elites</a> (Chris Hayes, 2013) that has stuck with me since
reading the book earlier this year. In sharing his experience attending
the prestigious test-in Hunter College High School in Manhattan, Hayes
acknowledges that the idea (and social stratification and skin tone) of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_College_High_School#Concerns_about_admission_policies">merit
begins to homogenize over time</a>. In one sentence he laid bare the lie
of meritocracy and it cut deep for me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The pyramid of merit has come to mirror the pyramid of wealth and
cultural capital.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the tech and venture capital space there’s ample criticisms of
meritocracy out there dispelling the head-slap-inducing claims made by
ill-informed tech bros who have found themselves in positions of power.
I’d be lying if I said meritocracy didn’t appeal to me at least on some
level; rewarding highly skilled labor with higher pay accordingly
appeals to my sense of fairness… but then I hear about
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2023/">CEOs earning
290⨉ the average worker</a> and the whole system begins to crumble for
me. Sure, they assume some risk… but never seem to suffer the same
consequences. Despite its aroma of enlightened empirical fairness,
meritocracy is ultimately a tool for protecting the status quo.
</p>
<p>
You can see it with your own eyes. Merit goes to the already wealthy.
Merit magically awards itself to people from the same fraternal
organization. Merit goes to people of similar net worth, who look the
same, talk the same, believe the same, joke the same, and have the same
education. Merit goes to symmetrical acne-free faces, shampoo model
hair, designer scents, six pack abs, and strong jaw lines because those
people <em>must</em> have earned it through hard work and not surgery,
drugs, photoshop, or genetic lottery.
</p>
<p>
This year has poured a gallon of salt into this festering wound for me
as my own country’s government tries to set “meritocracy” against
“diversity, equity, and inclusion” –as if they’re opposed concepts,
rather than the latter being a framework to recognize and correct
pre-existing biases– then proceeding to nominate the most inept,
corrupt, and deceitful people to perhaps ever occupy a government role.
A cabinet full of regressive billionaires, cowboy cosplayers, and
conservative television hosts papering over their racism with a flimsy
banner of meritocracy. The entire administration is an insidious heist
to enrich a small cabal of already wealthy families and we’ll be paying
for this televised crime spree for generations.
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to fall into the trap of comparing DEI and meritocracy.
Instead, I think we can examine meritocracy based on its merits; its an
entirely gameable system that is for sale, prone to in-group biases, and
often nullifies its own intent. Merit then will always mean money when
its for sale. Plain and simple.
</p>
<p>
Diversity then… of people, wealth, cultures, and thought… is an
antidote. A Darwinian cure to prevent groupthink and corruption that
flourish in meritocratic systems. You and I remember the old truths, the
old dreams, the old habits of loving thy neighbor. We’d do good to
protect diversity, encourage it, and nourish it.

<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_sto.html">Dual_EC_PRNG
backdoor</a> from a US constitutional perspective:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: The National Security Agency (NSA) reportedly paid and
pressured technology companies to trick their customers into using
vulnerable encryption products. This Article examines whether any of
three theories removed the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that this be
reasonable. The first is that a challenge to the encryption backdoor
might fail for want of a search or seizure. The Article rejects this
both because the Amendment reaches some vulnerabilities apart from the
searches and seizures they enable and because the creation of this
vulnerability was itself a search or seizure. The second is that the
role of the technology companies might have brought this backdoor within
the private-search doctrine. The Article criticizes the doctrine­
particularly its origins in Burdeau v. McDowell­and argues that if it
ever should apply, it should not here. The last is that the customers
might have waived their Fourth Amendment rights under the third-party
doctrine. The Article rejects this both because the customers were not
on notice of the backdoor and because historical understandings of the
Amendment would not have tolerated it. The Article concludes that none
of these theories removed the Amendment’s reasonableness requirement…

<blockquote>
<p>
List all the numbers
</p>
<p>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, …
</p>
<p>
skip every second one:
</p>
<p>
1, 3, 5, 7, …
</p>
<p>
form the partial sums like this:
</p>
<p>
1, 1+3, 1+3+5, 1+3+5+7, …
</p>
<p>
Hey, you get the square numbers!
</p>
<p>
1, 4, 9, 16, …
</p>
<p>
Lots of people know that.

<p>
I did not and it blows my mind.

He continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But now list all the numbers

</p>

1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, …

<p>
then form the partial sums:

then skip every <em>second</em> one:

then form the partial sums again:

<p>
Hey, now you get the cubes! You shouldn’t trust me based on so little
evidence, so do some more, or prove it works.
</p>
<p>
But the cool part is that this pattern goes on forever. If you list all
the natural numbers starting from 1, skip every nth one, form the list
of partial sums, skip every (n-1)st one, form the list of partial sums,
skip every (n-2)nd one, … blah di blah di blah… skip every 2nd one, then
form the list of partial sums, you get the nth powers!

<p>
This is called Moessner’s theorem, and I learned about it from Michael
Fourman. It’s in Chapter 7.5 here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Jan Rutten, <a href="https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/28550/rutten.pdf">The Method
of Coalgebra: Exercises in Coinduction</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Moral: anytime you see a pattern in mathematics - one that goes on
infinitely, not a coincidence! - it’s probably just the tip of a bigger
iceberg.

<blockquote>
<p>
i was amazed when i learned that 1 / 7 is 0.142857 (repeating) which
struck me as odd as that contains 14, 0028, 000056, 00000112 and so on
and so 1/7 is basically the infinite sum of 7×(0.02)ⁿ which is so
because 1/49 is the infinite sum of 0.02ⁿ … 0.02 being 1/50

<p>
Sadly, I don’t have anything to add. I’m still stuck in my high-school
math and even that is getting worse over the years. But it’s small posts
like these that remind me of the cool stuff that’s out there.

Since I’ve been posting so much about the Butlerian Jihad, you might
wonder how many IP addresses or networks are actually being banned.

Here’s what Munin shows:

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-21-butlerian-jihad-numbers-1.jpg" alt="At the end of June, things start picking up and on July 3, numbers start going up for real. The butlerian-jihad jail (1 hour) dances up and down and sometimes goes up to 5k but reaches 10k around July 9. The butlerian-jihad-jail (1 week) climbs to around 8k in the same time period. After that numbers fall back down but since July 12  or the week-long ban hovers around 3k and the one-hour-long ban jumps up from zero 5k many times, reaching 11k on July 17." />
</p>
<p>
Currently, 2.70k IP ranges are affected by the week-long ban.

<p>
At the same time, people have been

<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>I have a dark cloud over my head about the news that
CBS canceled Stephen Colbert for “financial reasons,” an explanation no
one is buying.Well, unless those financial reasons were the regulatory
approval of the Skydance-Paramount deal.  The Wall Street Journal
does its best to make a case that TV is dying. No shit, Sherlock! And

<p>A month ago, I reported that Apple was in the final stages of
acquiring the rights for F1 streaming following the success of its movie
about the sport. Almost a month later, the Financial Times reported the

Back in the mists of time,
<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2015/10/zipfs-law/">I wrote about
a peculiar property of words</a> called Zipf’s Law. The idea is quite
simple: the frequency at which different words occur in any large body
of work, ordered from the most common to the least common, follows a
predictable pattern. This is true across languages, and even in some
texts, such as that in the Voynich Manuscript, that we haven’t yet
deciphered.<a class="bibcite" id="bibcite_10.1080/0161-110191889932" href="#bibshow_10.1080/0161-110191889932" title="
