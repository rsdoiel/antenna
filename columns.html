<h2 id="fukuoka-japan">Fukuoka, Japan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: mrusme blog</p>
<p>“Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital city of
Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The city is built along the shores of Hakata
Bay, and has been a center of international commerce since ancient
times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as
it is the nearest point among Japan’s main islands to the Asian
mainland. Although humans occupied the area since the Jomon period, some
of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka
area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period. Because of
the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great distance from the
social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo),
Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has
persisted to the present.”</p>

<h2 id="the-bots-are-at-it-again">2025-01-23 The bots are at it
again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-23-the-bots-are-at-it-again">
2025-01-23 The bots are at it again
</h1>
<p>
For a while I just appended new graphs and data to
<a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>. This
time around I feel it’s worse. There are so many bots that I can’t even
do the WHOIS lookup any more. Or perhaps I just managed to block so few
that I never realized how many more there were. In any case, now that
I’m speeding things up, there are more bots to block.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback,
no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script
full of firewall commands.</strong>
</p>
<p>
It needs ipset and iptables access:
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.
</p>
<p>
I blocked another 4669 networks.
</p>
<p>
What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access
log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that
it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word,
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a
summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5
requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks
with a single request only.
</p>
<p>
That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient
because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no
individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and
even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn’t help against the
next 85% of requests because they are all unique.
</p>
<p>
Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their
success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little
jousting I’m doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are
turning the web to shit.
</p>
<p>
Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded
all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.
</p>
<p>
Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these
leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger
machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their
scam.
</p>
<p>
I keep shouting “CO₂ for the CO₂ god!” and that’s part of it, yes…
Sadly!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is
unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught.
While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this shit.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this whole generation.
</p>
<p>
Time passes.
</p>
<p>
Let me count how many entries I added today.
</p>
<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>
<p>
I think it’s about time to add some fail2ban code. If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service
provider out there.
</p>
<p>
Right now load is below 4, so that’s not too bad for 2 cores. The sites
are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:
</p>
<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>
<p>
But today:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" />
</p>
<p>
I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server
and didn’t run the script! 😱
</p>
<p>
I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>,
<code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took
care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my
server without the firewall rules.
</p>
<p>
Grrr.
</p>
<p>
They said we’re running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I’m trying to
block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that
there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may
Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the
web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails,
their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses
until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage
they are wreaking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots
and so I looked at the last run. Let’s take the last run:
</p>
<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |
------------------------------:|-----------:|
                       unknown |          4 |
                38.188.60.0/24 |          3 |
                201.46.36.0/22 |          3 |
                45.225.53.0/24 |          2 |
              170.246.119.0/24 |          2 |
               45.178.110.0/23 |          2 |
</code></pre>
<p>
The top hitting network I blocked in the last run had made just
<em>three</em> suspicious requests!
</p>
<p>
There is more info below:
</p>
<pre><code>38.188.60.0/24
38.188.60.92 38.188.60.70 38.188.60.70
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.92 | 24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:11:58:47 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1730419325&amp;rcidonly=profh&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:12:01:02 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=2013-11-08&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.3478.83 Safari/537.36
ipset add banlist 38.188.60.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP
numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
38.188.60.92
</li>
<li>
38.188.60.70
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the
last 3 days for the page “Comments on VimMode”.
</p>
<p>
Let’s check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request
belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?
</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over
24h.
</p>
<p>
The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to
train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it’s a denial of service attack.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages
about making it all persistent:
</p>
<p>
<code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.
</p>
<p>
<code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.
</p>
<p>
<code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>. This file is about 1MB and pretty
much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.
</p>
<p>
And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.
</p>
<p>
You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after
running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on
a reboot.

<p>
For now, I keep returning a 410 “Gone” response to self-identified bots
and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the
firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from
fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And
I’m not expiring the bans, unfortunately.

<p>…not the e-paper. Well, I have been extended use of old good hardware
tools. While I use my phone and computer to manage my calendar I don’t
like to use digital things to make quick notes and to manage my

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How
to build Ollama to run LLMs on RISC-V Linux</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;RISC-V is the new entrant into the SBC/low-end desktop space, and as I&#39;m in possession of a HiFive Premier P550 motherboard, I am running it through my usual gauntlet of benchmarks—partly to see how fast it is, and partly to gauge how far along RISC-V support is in general across a wide swath of Linux software.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
From my first tests on the
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/risc-v-business-testing-starfives-visionfive-2-sbc">VisionFive
2 back in 2023</a> to today, RISC-V has seen quite a bit of growth,
fueled by economics, geopolitical wrangling, and developer interest.
</p>
<p>
The P550 uses the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC, and while it doesn’t have a
<em>fast</em> CPU, by modern standards, it is fast enough—and the system
has enough RAM and IO—to run most modern Linux-y things. Including
llama.cpp and Ollama!
</p>
<h2>
Compiling Ollama for RISC-V Linux
</h2>
<p>
I’m running Ubuntu 24.04.1 on my P550 board, and when I try running
Ollama’s simple install script, I get:

week’s Ezra Klein podcast</a>. It made me wonder if any of the readers
of my blog voted for Trump. I can’t imagine too many did, unless they’ve
been willing to overlook my strenuous support for any option that
opposes him. However if any of you are still here, I’d like you to know
that what’s happening now is exactly what we thought <i>would</i>
happen. If you agree that this is unacceptable, maybe we can use that as
common ground to work together to get our country back from the chaotic
authoritarian mess that Elon Musk is turning it into. He makes Trump
look like an absolute moderate. Certainly no one who voted for Trump
with any kind of appreciation for the American system, where your vote
and mine matter, can stand by and not object to what he’s doing to our
system of government. If not now, keep this in mind as Musk’s chaos
becomes more and more real.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
Understand what the system can do and where it is applied.
</li>
<li>
You don’t have to compute gradients to break an AI system.
</li>
<li>
AI red teaming is not safety benchmarking.
</li>
<li>
Automation can help cover more of the risk landscape.
</li>
<li>
The human element of AI red teaming is crucial.

Responsible AI harms are pervasive but difficult to measure.

possibly was a bit hasty in
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/04.html#a204729">declaring the
coup over</a> yesterday. I’m sure there will be new restraining orders
from the courts telling Musk to stop, and so far Trump has been obeying
those, so there’s some hope when that happens he’ll order Musk to stop,
and then we’ll find out who the boss is and how our new post-coup
reality works. The shock of Trump’s
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo">plan for
Gaza</a>, announced yesterday may get even the most “loyal” Repubs in
Congress to think again about what hell they hath wrought on they
country they all grew up in. I have some faith that American values are
installed in their personal operating systems, somewhere in there is the
remnant of the ideals of the Constitution. So I might have missed the
mark, I hope I did. Meanwhile I wonder if Musk’s wonderboys have managed
to penetrate the military, and if they’re planning on giving them orders
about how to restrain the anti-Musk protests that are starting to break
out around the country. Oh mama we live in

<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: Tracy Durnell Blog</p>
<p>Oliver Burkeman‘s latest email seems written for me, in that it
sounds terrifying: The 70% rule: If you’re roughly 70% happy with a
piece of writing you’ve produced, you should publish it. Moving forward
at 70% takes more guts, more strength of character, than holding out for
100%, because it entails moving forward amid uncertainty, […]</p>

<h2 id="borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">2025-01-31 BorgBackup
for the laptop and the server</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-31-borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">
2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago I mentioned the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-01-27-rsync-sqlite">rsync-based
backup script</a> I use to copy data from the server to the laptop.
</p>
<p>
The backup script that makes backups of my laptop (including the backup
from the server) to external disks is different, however.
</p>
<p>
My actual backup uses external disks. I have two of them. One of them is
always at the office. Every now and then (not often enough!) I make a
backup to the external disk I have at hand and then I carry it to the
office and bring the other one back. That is, the laptop and the two
external disks are never in the same location.
</p>
<p>
The two external disks I use are “known backup disks”. When I plug them
in, BorgBackup immediately starts making a backup. I discussed this
setup <a href="2017-12-24_Borg_Backup">back in 2017</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m just going to repost the stuff and I don’t think there have been any
significant changes.
</p>
<p>
Run commands and create files as root.
</p>
<p>
Either use <code>sudo</code> for every command you run, or use
<code>sudo su</code> once and do everything as root. No matter how you
do it, the danger zone awaits!
</p>
<h2 id="mnt-backup">
<code>/mnt/backup</code>
</h2>
<p>
Create the mount point on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-fstab">
<code>/etc/fstab</code>
</h2>
<p>
Any disk labeled “Backup” will be mounted as <code>/mnt/backup</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show 0 0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-40-backup-rules">
<code>/etc/backups/40-backup.rules</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/40-backup.rules \
      /etc/udev/rules.d/40-backup.rules
</code></pre>
<p>
The file content:
</p>
<pre><code>ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;bdi&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;/devices/virtual/bdi/*&quot;, TAG+=&quot;systemd&quot;, ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}=&quot;automatic-backup.service&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This makes sure that the service <code>automatic-backup</code> starts
whenever an external disk gets plugged into the laptop.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-automatic-backup-service">
<code>/etc/backups/automatic-backup.service</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/automatic-backup.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/automatic-backup.service
</code></pre>
<p>
The service does nothing except start the <code>run.sh</code> shell
script.
</p>
<pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/backups/run.sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-backup-disks">
<code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
</h2>
<p>
The <code>run.sh</code> below runs for every external disk plugged in.
It’s important to only make backups to known backup disks, however.
</p>
<p>
The known backup disks are identified by their <code>uuid</code> in the
<code>backup.disks</code> file.
</p>
<p>
To list the disk labels and their <code>uuid</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>lsblk -o+uuid,label
</code></pre>
<p>
Add the <code>uuid</code> to the <code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
file.
</p>
<p>
This is the content of the file identifying my backup disks, for
example:
</p>
<pre><code># generate using: lsblk -o+uuid,label
7c478832-5d7f-43d3-9b79-20cfc67fb0e6
bb1c034e-dd21-48e7-a496-1b95685a094d
156cf4df-aa58-421e-b3d0-583fe6fdff4a
</code></pre>
<p>
If you create your copy of the file, your uuids will be different!
</p>
<p>
When you run <code>lsblk -o+uuid,label</code> you’ll also see the device
itself. In my case, that’s <code>/dev/sdb</code>. Create a BorgBackup
repository on the new disk, mount it, create the directory and
initialize the repository.
</p>
<p>
When initializing the repository, you’re asked for a passphrase. You
will need it for the <code>run.sh</code> script.
</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/sdb /mnt/backup
mkdir /mnt/backup/borg-backups
borg init --encryption=repokey --progress /mnt/backup/borg-backups/backup.borg
umount /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<p>
Make sure the disk has the correct label! You can do this from the
command-line but I used
<a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/">Disks</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-run-sh">
<code>/etc/backups/run.sh</code>
</h2>
<p>
Now we’re ready for the actual script. It checks whether a known backup
disk is mounted under <code>/mnt/backup</code> and if so, it creates a
new archive in the repository.
</p>
<p>
Don’t forget to search for <code>BORG_PASSPHRASE</code> and change it to
whatever you used when you ran <code>borg init</code> above!
</p>
<p>
Hide the passphrase from everybody else and to make it executable:
</p>
<pre><code>chmod 0700 run.sh
</code></pre>
<p>
This the content of the shell script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -ue

# The udev rule is not terribly accurate and may trigger our service before
# the kernel has finished probing partitions. Sleep for a bit to ensure
# the kernel is done.
#

</h2>
<p>
Check the log while the backup is being written:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --follow --unit automatic-backup
</code></pre>
<p>
Make sure the backup disk is identified correctly and look at the sizes
of the archives. If they’re too small, check whether the archives
contain the right files!

<strong>2025-02-04</strong>. A reader sent me an email saying: “you may
want to call <code>borg compact</code> after <code>borg prune</code> in
order to actually free up the disk space corresponding to the pruned
archives. Otherwise your backup repo will keep growing in size.”
</p>
<p>
Good point. I think in my case it doesn’t matter because I don’t use the
disk space for anything else (and surely Borg will reuse it). But who
knows. Your situation might be different.

<p>I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment
on Bluesky and found that they have a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22">Suggested
User List</a> that recommended the usual people who get in the way of
telling the story that’s really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my
stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created
influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter,
people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We’re living with
their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely
manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have
to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them
has run its course, don’t you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw
an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika
stickers on Teslas. That’s nice. The reason you can get away with that
is that you’re attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course
<i>publicly owned</i> now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed,
so quickly.</p>

happening in the US is like when a person who is a lifetime smoker gets
cancer and stops smoking. You hope the cancer doesn’t kill you, and
swear to never smoke again if you’re lucky enough to survive it.
</p>
<p>
We didn’t appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of
government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time,
when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start
trying to get their attention, which hasn’t happened yet, it’s going to
be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the
forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt
we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not.
</p>
<p>
The prognosis isn’t good. But we should get our shit together asap
because it’s our only hope.
</p>
<p>
PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own
responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.

2025-02-04 Degrowth
</h1>
<p>
I posted a picture from our living room on fedi and noticed that the
book
<a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/who-is-afraid-of-degrowth">Who is
Afraid of Degrowth</a> by Céline Keller was visible on the coffee table.
And a bit later,
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.nz/@aimee" title="@aimee@mastodon.nz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aimee">@aimee</span></a> shared a link to
the <a href="https://degrowth.net/">International Degrowth Network</a>,
specifically to their values and principles:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of
degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a
sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to
justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide
variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at
once for something to qualify as “degrowth”. –
<a href="https://explore.degrowth.net/degrowth/values-principles/">Values
&amp; Principles: Explore degrowth</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I really like the two lists. Might be useful as a checklist before doing
things. There’s more on the site, of course.

Election</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting
<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem">analysis</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED
AI Elections Project
(<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html">source</a>
for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political
content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case,
we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating
similar content without AI.
</p>
<p>
We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content
produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em>
AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the
supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify
interventions…

managing accordingly. A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of
the problem and if they’re good, do something brilliant, but misses out
on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely
discipline myself to get anything done, because that’s how I’m built.

<p>Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just
do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he’s making
it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would
be if what he was doing wasn’t so blatantly outrageous. We never voted
for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference,
thinks their own vote should count. That’s going to be a massive hurdle

<p>
This is yet another story of commercial spyware being
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware">used
against</a> journalists and civil society members.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a
possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it
had “high confidence” that the 90 users in question had been targeted
and “possibly compromised.”
</p>
<p>
It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers,
Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp
said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the
alleged attacks…

<p>I’m 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his
software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the
government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your
passport. And if you try to arrest him, he’ll stop paying interest on
the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve
currency of the world. He won’t just control the US government, he will
control the world economy.</p>

<h2 id="on-government-efficiency">On government efficiency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
<tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt>
</p>
<p>
I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency.
If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air),
you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less
taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in
people’s pockets, and you’d need less welfare (again, hands), less red
tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.
</p>
<p>
I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the
government should be to absorb inefficiencies.
</p>
<p>
As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at
lowering the costs of goods and services
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and
creating
jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> …
there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly
scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather
than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should
understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas
than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government
helps:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I
sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the
bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know
what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement
plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society,
<a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people
are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn’t nudge
companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even
though
<a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification
is 3× more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its
sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave
too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for “once
in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every year now. The “more
efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect
the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes,
rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We
pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for
insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate
it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption.
And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up
with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably
need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the
time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful
of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law)
that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected
users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance
marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would
be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to
create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank
and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our
country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire
trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for
more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need
and it manifests at a nation-state level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan
and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also
think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the
time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart
go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown
filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking
lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There’s no
way a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains
equals less traffic. We know adding new
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten
million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate
creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is
folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know
what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially.
What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private
schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor
force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school
closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system
exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn
and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups,
and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more
efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and
classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality
goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too.
You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those
numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only
billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes
foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like
curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider…
these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries
power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money
in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead
of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient
question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under
Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically,
our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for
cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and
then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well,
you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a
government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen
overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were
fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war
about it.
</p>

<p>
I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can
do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die
hard, I guess, because I’m still thinking about efficiency… but from the
opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb
inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and
kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure.
Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems
you need data and transparency.
</p>
<p>
The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game.
It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner
levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those
systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward
them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow
co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips.
Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people
who already have money. Sheesh.

<p>Throughout now-president Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, it was clear
that his support was coming from three very different factions whose
only shared ideology was a determination to destroy the federal
government.</p>

<p>Saw a commercial on CNN this evening from
<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/your-economic-partner">Ontario</a>
in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans
about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can’t the Dems do this,
say how important the independence of the FBI is, to start. We’d love to
pay for that. Get in the game Dems.</p>
