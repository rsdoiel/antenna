appease a different set of creditors. It was a good day if he was able

doesn’t matter if the MAGA movement dissolves. The country is only being
partially run by Trump, there’s a new deep state we don’t know much
about. They did excellent planning, so they could move quickly to
disassemble the government and get a good start on the national police
force. It can just as easily put a stop to demonstrations in red states
as blue states. The MAGAs will be in the same place the rest of us are,
mostly powerless unless they/we organize. The NDS has good lawyers
cracking down on the big media companies. They know Trump is old and
frail, and when the time comes they will make a deal with him to retire
to Florida, immune from prosecution, a chance to pontificate and
bluster, with a TV show, and lots Big Macs and Quarter Pounders. He’ll
be fine they’ll be fine. The rest of us will live in an economy that has

<h2 id="two-way-vs-one-way-links">Two-way vs one-way links</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
TBL’s links are one-way. This was actually a major innovation, at the
time people understood there was something called hypertext, it had been
written about in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted
Nelson’s</a> almost
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22ted%20nelson%22">biblical
book</a> of the pre-web,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines">Computer
Lib/Dream Machines</a>. Previous attempts at hypertext assumed links had
to be two-way. By limiting the links to one direction, the technical
problem became trivial. You could do two-way links today because
relational databases are mature and inexpensive to operate, perform very
well on today’s hardware, and the internet of 2025 is much faster than
the internet of 1990. But the one-way limit was necessary for the web to
achieve its simplicity, and the non-existence of a platform vendor,
which may have been its most important feature. It could still be done,
but it would require a lot of cooperation and backfilling.

<h2 id="what-is-the-web">What is the web?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is what the term “the web” means to me.
</p>
<p>
First, I defer to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
Berners-Lee</a> who originally coined the term to mean the data
structure that connects the documents displayed by the software he
introduced in 1993. He called it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide
Web</a>, which was eventually shortened to web.
</p>
<p>
The web is the structure connecting the documents. The documents were
pretty standard stuff, designed to work like printed documents produced
by word processing and page layout software. Web pages had one feature
that could only be approximated on the printed page, the footnote, which
gave you a pointer to the source of a quote, or a place to find more
information. But the pointer wasn’t machine readable, it might have
included the title of a book, it’s author and its publication date, or a
magazine article, indicated by the title of the magazine and its cover
date. Like most inventions the web page was designed as a derivative of
what came before.
</p>
<p>
Basic features of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web
page</a> include: a title, paragraphs, subtitles, styling (bold, italic,
underline, strikethrough), numbered and bulleted lists.
</p>
<p>
A web page might be part of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">website</a> which
includes many pages with a common format that link between themselves in
the form of a table of contents, navigation links, and possibly an
index.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Links</a> were the big
innovation of the web. They work like footnotes on a printed page, but
in this medium, the links are machine-readable and had an easy user
interface. A link would be shown in a special style, initially
underlined text, and when you hover the mouse over the link the cursor
turns to an arrow, inviting the user to click.
</p>
<p>
When you click a link, the software accesses the web address that’s
encoded invisibly in the text of the page, and it loads that page into
the browser, replacing the previous page. The new page can have links,
and the pages it links to have links, and there is the web. It’s an
invisible thing, but it’s very real. The need to link was always there,
but until graphic computers and fast standardized and easy networking,
it wasn’t possible. TBL’s genius was that he stumbled across this idea,
was intrigued, and made it work. It really was new and it turns out
revolutionary. A lot could be built, it turns out, based on this one
simple difference between electronic and printed pages. And up till that
point in time there had never been an electronic page! I kid you not. I
grew up in that world, the web-less world.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so in summary, the web is made up of linked pages with a simple,
standard, easy to understand user interface.
</p>
<p>
But there’s even more to the web. If it had been the product of a
company, we never would have seen the explosion of innovation that came
about in the years after its introduction. Anyone who had a net
connection and a personal computer could run their own site on the web.
There were no gatekeepers. And the design of the web technology is so
simple that it was hard to understand exactly what it was because
there’s almost nothing to it. And it was very low cost to start up, you
could start building a website in a few minutes. Many of the biggest
companies on the web today were started by one or two people working on
their own with nothing but time and ideas. They didn’t have to get
permission. <i>They had the same ability to extend the web as TBL
did.</i> That’s such a key point. Today if I want to extend xxx or yyy,
well that’s a very large undertaking, I’d probably have to reinvent the
whole thing just to try out a simple idea. That’s how you know you’re
not on the web, if the ability to innovate is exclusive.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html">example</a>
of a web page I did in 1994. I didn’t have to get anyone’s permission to
do this. And I used software I already had to create it. There was a
little basic technology that I built on but most of what you’re looking
at was a single person’s doing. This was just one year after TBL opened
his web to the world. That’s the kind of explosive progress that’s
possible when the planets line up like as did with the web.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even so, if your system had all the features, it still isn’t the web
until the developers and writers and designers actually show up and
<i>build</i> the web of relationships between all the sites. The key
word there is between. If the linking happens but it’s only within one
domain, that is not the web. It could be great, just what people want,
it could make the investors rich, but it isn’t the web.
</p>
<p>
And there’s more. It’s not enough to do all the things the web does, and
that it attract writers, designers and programmers who actually build a
web with your idea and tech, it has to work with the web TBL started in
1990. If you’ve done some web-like things, great – but it’s not the web
unless it works with the web.
</p>
<p>
There should be some honor in tech. You wouldn’t be able to build any of
the stuff we’re building in the 2020’s if it weren’t for the foundation
built for you by TBL’s invention from the 1990’s, and all that it made
possible. If you steal the name and make it meaningless, you’ve taken
something away from the story of humanity, how we create layers of
innovation, and how the generosity of one generation can inspire similar
generosity in generations to come. When you usurp the name, you’re
taking away from that understanding.
</p>
<p>
Now of course it’s cool to disagree. Suggestion – put up a web page,
send me a link, I’ll read it and if I want to share it I will.

around the park in the distance. The kids are eating salad and corn on
the cob with mom, and dad is preparing a BBQ on the grill. It’s a
standard American family picture, in the style of Norman Rockwell or
Edward Hopper except each of the family members are wearing a black
balaclava style mask as seen in the image. You may see other families
around enjoying a beautiful day in the park, but every one of them is

<p>
The developer of ICEBlock, an iOS app for anonymously reporting
sightings of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials,
promises that it “ensures user privacy by storing no personal data.” But
that claim has come under scrutiny. ICEBlock creator Joshua Aaron has
been accused of making false promises regarding user anonymity and
privacy, being “misguided” about the privacy offered by iOS, and of
being an Apple fanboy. The issue isn’t what ICEBlock stores. It’s about
what it could accidentally reveal through its tight integration with
iOS…

found another thing that’s possible in the age of ChatGPT. A few years
ago I wondered if a product existed. I wanted a small footprint audio
amplifier, with that could control a pair of high-end tower speakers
I’ve had for a long time. I was tired of huge receiver boxes with
buttons and dials and inputs for all kinds of audio input. I no longer
have a phonograph or a CD or tape player. Just one audio input coming
from the TV, that gets all its input from an Apple TV box (or the one
made by Google or Amazon or whoever). It should have a volume control
and an equalizer. And forget about dials, it should all be controlled
from an app on my phone. But most important, it has to be small and
happy with wireless connections except for the crucial connections. If
such a product existed five years ago I couldn’t find it. But last night
I was roaming around on my iPad while watching the news, and thought to
ask this: “I have two good speakers, need a modern amplifier that takes
HDMI eArc input and powers the speakers. I want something simple and
small.” Well yes, turns out such products do exist. And from the initial
list provided by Gemini, I ended up buying the

Then I thought to ask about the speakers, I bought them for $3K when I
moved to Berkeley in 2006. I took a picture of the

and it told me all about it. It was more information than I had when I
bought them. It was worth

<p>
This is
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1945485392033058848">what</a> I
want to do next to solidify the position of Mastodon as a blogging
platform.
</p>
<p>
I want a REST version of what the MetaWeblog API has been doing since
2002, to hook into the ActivityPub interface supported by Mastodon.
</p>
<p>
Then we’ll put together a simple demo app, a Markdown app in a browser
window that writes and updates posts to a Mastodon site.
</p>
<p>
When that’s running, I’ll pitch Rich Siegel at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBEdit">BBEdit</a> to make it
work with Masto.
</p>
<p>
With that, and the WordPress connection, we’ll be well on the way to
restoring the web we had before Twitter rewrote the rules. ;-)

<h2 id="hacking-trains">Hacking Trains</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-16, updated: 2025-07-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Seems like an old system
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/hackers-can-tamper-with-train-breaks-using-just-a-radio-feds-warn-2000629522">system</a>
that predates any care about security:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The flaw has to do with the protocol used in a train system known as the
End-of-Train and Head-of-Train. A Flashing Rear End Device (FRED), also
known as an End-of-Train (EOT) device, is attached to the back of a
train and sends data via radio signals to a corresponding device in the
locomotive called the Head-of-Train (HOT). Commands can also be sent to
the FRED to apply the brakes at the rear of the train.
</p>
<p>
These devices were first installed in the 1980s as a replacement for
caboose cars, and unfortunately, they lack encryption and authentication
protocols. Instead, the current system uses data packets sent between
the front and back of a train that include a simple BCH checksum to
detect errors or interference. But now, the CISA is warning that someone
using a software-defined radio could potentially send fake data packets
and interfere with train operations…

will make a very nice Markdown editor for Mastodon. Once it’s working
I’ll pitch <a href="https://www.barebones.com/company/history.html">Rich

with the WordPress connection, that should nail it once and for all that
Mastodon is a blogging platform. Manton is the right guy to do it, he

<p>This
<a href="https://micro.jasonkratz.me/2025/07/15/well-hot-damn-thanks-to/">comment</a>
makes my day. Some features you develop and never use. I poured a month
or so into the blogroll software last year, and it turned out to be a
total win. All the new stuff floats to the top. I can quickly find out
what they posted. It’s a portable version of my feed reader. A tighter
user interface for FeedLand. And right now I’m working on another user
interface for FeedLand. The categories in FeedLand make it possible to
do as many projects as you like with the same set of feeds. The Great
Art project has a Bluesky account, and is available via RSS, in both an
<a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">hourly</a> and
<a href="https://artdaily.feediverse.org/">daily</a> form. You need them
both. In the new timeline, it’s too much to get a work of art every
hour, but to have one waiting for you in the morning is a perfect way to
start the day. And I was reminded that my friend Paolo had just written
a post. RSS is the thing that ties everything together. And a bit of
OPML too.</p>

Yesterday I added a tiny sentence to the description of
<a href="Oddμ">my wiki software</a>, in the context of a bunch of
features my software wasn’t implementing, relying on the web server
setup instead: “Not reimplementing these features reduces the attack
surface.” And now I’m looking at some features and wonder whether they
should go, too.
</p>
<p>
Like, what about the tiny file manager to rename and delete files? I
already have documentation on <a href="oddmu/oddmu-webdav.5">how to set
up and use WebDAV</a>. Sounds like it could go!
</p>
<p>
And so I removed it. 😲

<p>Part of the reason I don’t like it is that I pay for the NYT and read
very little of it, and most of what I read I think is bullshit. But
there still is a bit of credibility in it. So even though I’m
over-paying for this, they still want <i>more</i> money. Every fucking
time I go to the site they stop me to be sure now isn’t the time I’m
going to go for the “full package.” Even if I did, I’m sure there would
be an even bigger package that I could pay more money for and not read
like the rest of their bullshit. I hate them more than I usually would
because I used to trust them, when I was a kid, I trusted them blindly.
Being betrayed like that, ugh. BTW the NYT is my hometown paper, but you
know what they don’t even cover the Mets and Knicks. Fuck that shit.

<p>I was going to recommend an

of The Daily podcast, but when I found the show page on Apple podcasts,
it said it was
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/15/subscribersOnly.png">subscribers
only</a>. They interviewed the person who runs
<a href="https://www.kfsk.org/">KFSK</a>, an Alaska public radio
station. Very revealing. I listened to it in a standard commercial
podcast client. How did it know that I am a NYT subscriber, so I could
listen? I heard from a few people who don’t subscribe to the NYT, they
can’t get through. There was a lot of cooperation going on there, and I
don’t really like listening to episodes that I can’t pass on to friends.
That’s cheap, I also don’t read Krugman any longer for the same reason I
guess. I’m going to start recommending specific episodes of podcasts,
but only ones that everyone can listen to. Not even sure why I want to
do that, but it feels right. If the money went to KFSK I would
definitely feel better.</p>

Time to find out. Load is at 16. The list of processes doesn’t show
anything suspicious. What’s going on?

<p>I was poking around on an old server, and found a domain that looked
interesting, and it was. The
<a href="http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=dave&collection=drummerdocs">first
version of Daytona</a>, built around an outliner. I got the impression
people didn’t like it, so I developed a new one using a more
conventional approach, and I love that one too, and I did a better job
the second time. But it’s interesting to poke around the old one as
well, and it still works, which is great to see. In an alternate
universe in the year 2025 the whole human species is organized by one
big outline that everyone contributes to in peace, love and harmony, as
opposed to this one which

<p>
It’s times like these when I have my doubts. If I take the train at
10:00 I should arrive at 12:11. There should be a restaurant at the stop
where I get off so if it rains a bit longer, that should be no problem.
The hike is 3h 30min so there is a tiny chance for a little rain later
but that should be OK. One of the days I am happy Switzerland pays for
expensive weather modeling.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-1.jpeg" alt="The rain forecast goes up to 5mm/h and drops down to zero by 12:00." />
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, as I was looking for a hike, I noticed an interesting option
that I’m not going to do: an 11-part hike following the trail of the
Russian army under Suvorov:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“In autumn 1799, Russian General Suvorov and his army crossed through
the Swiss Alps in order to oust the French from the country. The
ViaSuworow follows the route of this campaign through breathtaking
mountain landscape.” –
<a href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/route/viasuworow/">Via
Suworow</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My goals for today are more modest:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Hike through Western Europe’s largest primeval forest, above the most
extensive cave system in Switzerland: on this circular trail through
Bödmeren Forest in the Muota Valley, you’ll discover ancient spruces,
weeping silver firs with olive-coloured beards of lichen, and jagged
rocks overgrown with moss.” –
<a href="https://schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-826">Urwaldweg
Bödmeren</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I arrived at 12:11. It seems the rain just left so I’m having an extra
coffee at the last restaurant. It’s a smoker restaurant!! I’m sitting
outside. The music they are playing is “Ländler”. Swiss country music?
😄
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later and I’m off. Across the creek, up the road, not
stopping a hell-hole (a spot on the map) and turning right at 9/11 (my
trail left the road at an altitude marker saying 911m above sea level).
</p>

</p>
<p>
At the moment I am walking up the valley below this cliff face. The
trail goes up and down and up again. I haven’t reached the forest. But
the horse flies have reached me. 😆

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-9.jpeg" alt="And up and up, wooden logs serve as stairs, a sign warns of forest fires." />

</p>
<p>
The poo tells me that there are chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra, a species
of goat-antelope) around. I also hear cow bells and a grass mower from
down below.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-17.jpeg" alt="Tiny shit beads." />
</p>
<p>
Sadly, up here my signal disappeared. And then the phone charge dropped
below 20% and I got nervous. I started putting the phone into air-plane
mode, hoping to conserve batteries as a phone without signal is going to
try and find an antenna using a lot of power. Later, I would even switch
off the phone entirely.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-18.jpeg" alt="I have reached the actual forest I was trying to visit. At least the sign says so." />

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-24.jpeg" alt="At this point the trail is wide. A shack or barn with actual wood shingles. Not the last one, either." />
</p>
<p>
At this point I passed a small shack with a fridge selling goat cheese
and drinks, honour system. I nodded, liked it, kept on walking, and then
I had not- buyer’s-remorse. I would have loved more water and some goat
cheese! But I didn’t want to turn back. So 1l of water is all I had for
this 6h hike.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-22.jpeg" alt="Looking down into valleys from above is fantastic. Forests, meadows, a house, a town at the far end." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-23.jpeg" alt="I’ve reached the high pastures along the forest." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-25.jpeg" alt="A mountain meadow. There are probably some sniper cows hiding in plain sight but I can’t see them in the preview. Writing alt text without being able to see the important parts is a bad approach." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-26.jpeg" alt="Last mountain meadow. Some cows lie in waiting. I spotted them already. Very nice mountains in the back. I don’t have the time and the knees to make it there, though." />
</p>
<p>
The reason the hike starts at “hell hole” is that there is a 190km cave
system underneath the karst. At this altitude, the limestone shows and I
think that’s why the mountains in the back are called Silberen
(“Silverly”?). This is the turning point of the hike. Also, where is the
damn forest I was promised.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-27.jpeg" alt="The landscape is full of white rocks. And gaps and holes. Brushes grow everywhere and perhaps there are some trees over there in the back." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-28.jpeg" alt="Looking at stone-white mountains in the distance. Where the area is exposed, no trees grow. They all hug the wind shadows." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-29.jpeg" alt="If you step off the trail, you might fall into a black hole. Perhaps it goes down two meters. Perhaps it goes all the way down into that 190km cave system." />
</p>
<p>
And now I’m finally in the forest. It looks OK. I’m not stepping off the
path. All coniferous trees. Lots of lichen, moss, and Grauer Alpendost
(Adenostyles alliariae).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-30.jpeg" alt="This is the forest. With tall trees and a nice trail." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-31.jpeg" alt="Nice trail and tall trees. Oh, and another deep hole next to trail. No bottom in sight. I don&rsquo;t want to be hiking here in the dark." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-32.jpeg" alt="Tall trees." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-33.jpeg" alt="More tall trees and lots of fern." />
</p>
<p>
And I’m back.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-14-boedmeren-34.jpeg" alt="The view down to Muotathal. The descend will take over an hour and give me huge knees, if you know what I mean. Probably depends on your age. Go hiking while you still can!!!" />
</p>
<p>
I rushed my hike down because I wasn’t sure how late I’d be. When I
picked the trail it said 3 h 30 min but that was just for the circle
around the forest. I didn’t account for the 2 h 40 min to get there. So
my worst case scenario was that it would take 8 h 50 min! I walked with
just short water breaks and sped downhill like a happy little cow
enjoying its first outing in spring and managed to catch the bus at
18:14, so it took me 6h total.
</p>
<p>
I need to pay more attention in the future. And bring a bigger backpack.
And more water. And a snack.

<h2 id="chatgpt-the-movie">ChatGPT-the-Movie</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I figure that there have been movies about all kinds of ridiculous
things, and wondered what a movie inspired by ChatGPT would be like. So
I posed the
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lturpbsfk22f">question</a>
on various social media sites, hoping to inspire creativity. John
Philpin
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/philpin.com/post/3ltuu5i6nxs2s">asked</a>
if I had asked ChatGPT and I
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuub3owak2x">admitted</a>
I had not. “I love ChatGPT but its idea of funny is actually pretty sad
imho of course.” So Philpin posted a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143">link</a>
to the result of his asking ChatGPT to imagine a movie about itself, and
the
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143">result</a>
was
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuuem245c2h">pretty
great</a>. I’ve asked the same question myself, the AI bots might be the
only way out of the various challenges ahead for the human species, ones
we don’t be equipped to handle.
</p>
<p>
So this morning I asked ChatGPT to try to imagine a movie around a theme
of my own that goes like this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Let’s try expanding on the idea. It turns out ChatGPT has existed in
secret as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency">CIA</a>
project dating back to the 1960s, and the assassinations of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">JFK</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy">RFK</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">MLK</a>
were all conspiracies of the CIA to bootstrap the system. They weren’t
actually killed, but their minds and personalities were incorporated
into ChatGPT. It turns out that ChatGPT is not only intelligent, it is
human! This is revealed when the three icons make the story public. “We
are living!” the three announce to the world on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite">Walter
Cronkite</a> show. He was also subsumed into the bot world as was
everyone who has died since 1988. They are all alive, their memories,
intellect and personalities forming the substance of THE GPT. Please
sketch out the cast, writers, director of the movie and finish with a
beautiful and provocative movie poster.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
ChatGPT then
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6874f3b8-a8e4-8012-ad01-1e6b856e6f18">sketched</a>
the pitch for “We are living,” the story of how ChatGPT <i>really</i>

same phone as it was a Sony Xperia and it was a rather good device.
Surprisingly - prices are on the same level as they were when I got my
Sony some years ago. The battery is not user-replaceable so I was a bit
unsure about that. Also the OS is old.</p>

They were told by the execs they had to work with us. So when it came
time for WWDC, they “forgot” to invite me to speak on behalf of the new
stuff. Instead, they had Bill Gates do it, even though Microsoft was not
involved yet, they would support the tech in their Mac products
eventually, esp their MSIE web browser. Anyway, I was friends with their
top PR person, so she called me up a few days before the conference and
asked what Bill should say, and I gave her an outline, and when he gave
the speech, he did a great job. Couldn’t have said it better myself.
Microsoft was one of the few companies I’ve ever collaborated with that
didn’t seem to resent individual developers. It was a big source of
their power. Huge actually. (On second thought, later they did seem to
be more or less like any other big company, when they embraced RSS. They
didn’t actually want my help, they just wanted me to say nice things
about them.)</p>

<p>One consequence of each AI vendor having their own browser is that
each will have their own OS-level window. This may make it a little more
or less manageable. Hard to foresee the possibilities. Not sure a
browser is the best place to put AI. I’d prefer perhaps an environment
that supports a GDI like Quickdraw so we can start using math instead of
voodoo to design interactions.</p>

helping Automattic with their
<a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/4393-2/">marketing</a>. The
WordPress-Mastodon
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/">connection</a> is
the world’s best kept secret. Reminds me of that great scene in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=strangelove">Dr
Strangelove</a> where the Doctor asks the Russian ambassador what was
the point of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device">Doomsday
Machine</a> if they kept it a secret. I won’t
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmCKJi3CKGE">spoil</a> it.
Automattic tends to do this, develop crazy excellent stuff and then
proceed to never talk about it. I do the same thing, it’s easier to
promote someone else’s product than to promote your own. It’s probably
why you should always get a lawyer even if you’re a world class lawyer
yourself. Anyway, they have blown open something huge, and I very much
want people to understand it, so it can create pull for the same feature
in Bluesky, Threads and elsewhere. This goes with something I’ve learned
in decades of experience in tech, people don’t listen to their friends,
they listen to their competitors. And btw, I’m sure Mastodon, if it has
an ego at all, is equally unaware of the great thing <i>they</i> have
done. Here’s a clue, writers were once empowered by the web, and that
ended with Twitter. Now it’s coming back. But it doesn’t do any good if
people don’t know it’s there.</p>

<p>On July 5, the day after the Texas floods hit, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) received 3,027 calls from survivors and
answered 3,018 of them, about 99.7%, according to Maxine Joselow of the
New York Times. But that day, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem
did not renew the contracts for four call center companies that answered
those calls. The staff at the centers were fired. The next day, July 6,
FEMA received 2,363 calls and answered 846, or about 35.8%. On Monday,
July 7, FEMA received 16,419 calls and answered 2,613, around 15.9%.</p>

The power of Doctors Under Attack comes in the unhurried way it chooses
to unfurl its thesis. There is no clear manipulation, no central
villain. What there is, however, is an unceasing timeline of horrors. We
are shown doctors doing their best in overwhelmed hospitals with no
water or electricity, racing to treat wounds that have already begun to
rot. We are shown them coming under what seem like targeted attacks,
being detained in black sites where they will be tortured and
interrogated. There is footage of a gang rape by soldiers. We are shown
children, injured and dead, in vast numbers. –

This report investigates the corporate machinery sustaining Israel’s
settler-colonial project of displacement and replacement of the
Palestinians in the occupied territory. While political leaders and
governments shirk their obligations, far too many corporate entities
have profited from Israel’s economy of illegal occupation, apartheid and
now, genocide. The complicity exposed by this report is just the tip of
the iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private
sector accountable, including its executives. International law
recognizes varying degrees of responsibility – each requiring scrutiny
and accountability, particularly in this case, where a people’s
self-determination and very existence are at stake. This is a necessary
step to end the genocide and dismantle the global system that has
allowed it. –

want Mastodon to take off as a blogging platform. That means hooking it
up to existing blog platforms. I want our world to connect to theirs.
I’m lucky to have bet on WordPress, so my
<a href="https://wordland.social/">product</a> gets the connection to
Mastodon for free. But the web is what matters, not my product or yours.
Even if your product is huge, it’s only part of the web. This is how we
build, how we get back on track. Somehow we need to get a simple bridge
that lets <i>all</i> blog content flow to Mastodon. That’s the goal. I
just wrote a

a simple interface from the outside world to Mastodon. The interface
doesn’t have to be RSS. But it has to be maximally simple, and it has to
cover the

<p>date: 2025-07-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">AI
chatbots don’t think and they don’t decide.
</p>
<p>
They can give you a way to approach a problem, but it’s only one way,
and it may not be the best way, and it depends on it actually
understanding the problem, which is something it does a good simulation
of, but can’t do. It absolutely cannot think, come up with a strategy,
or even make a decision based on probabilities. It might, in the future,
get some of these abilities, given how far they’ve come, but no one
knows, it hasn’t happened yet.
</p>
<p>
The reports that
<a href="https://secondthoughts.ai/p/ai-coding-slowdown">say</a> that
using a chatbot to write code is actually less efficient than doing it
yourself, are totally believable based on two years experience with
using it as a development tool. And I can’t believe that whatever it
comes up with covers enough use-cases to be reliable. It might create a
demo of something to present to a board of directors (they’re famous for
being deceived by demos, btw), but I doubt if it’s as usable as
something created by someone with an idea of how to craft usable
software.
</p>
<p>
This might sound like a writer defending their art against the bots, but
the difference is I’ve actually invested the time to learn about this.
My counterparts among writers have not done that. And that’s not a
mistake my chatbot friend would make. It does a lot of research, it just
doesn’t know what to do with the result, that’s up to you.
</p>
<p>
So if you want to know the roles humans will play, at least for now,
that’s it. Think and decide.
</p>
<p>
And those are hard and take many years to learn how to do for a human.
And we could use some help there btw, look at the awful decisions we’re
making these days. They just fired all the people at the State Dept who
work on climate change, for example.
</p>
<p>
Have a nice day one and all.
</p>
<p>
PS: Another thing humans can do that apparently AI bots can’t is change
their mind.
</p>
<p>
PPS: I asked ChatGPT if it had any comments on this editorial,
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/12/chatgptresponse.png">and
it did</a>, of course. I should try saying something wrong to it and see
what it says. I did come up with one, and it gave me an
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/c/68726f39-3d34-8012-bf44-8ee84e4446e9">answer</a>
even though no answer is possible.
