recommends (which is on the right track). They could be playing the same
role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I’d love to see a requirement that
every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple
of weeks a year, to keep them aware of the standard that should also
apply to news, not just justice. (Update:

their attacks. In the security community, the immediate questions
weren’t about how hackers were using the tools (that was utterly
predictable), but about how Microsoft figured it out. The natural
conclusion was that Microsoft was spying on its AI users, looking for
harmful hackers at work.

<p>
Some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39442429">pushed
back</a> at characterizing Microsoft’s actions as “spying.” Of
<em>course</em> cloud service providers monitor what users are doing.
And because we expect Microsoft to be doing something like this, it’s
not fair to call it spying…

<p>The Gettysburg Address it wasn’t. Seventy-seven years ago, on June 5,
1947, Secretary of State George C. Marshall, who had been a five-star
general in World War II, gave a commencement speech at Harvard
University. Rather than stirring, the speech was bland. Its long
sentences were hard to follow. It was vague. And yet, in just under
eleven minutes on a sunny afternoon, Marshall laid out a plan that would
shape the modern world.</p>

2024-06-01 Fonts are important

<p>
I was thinking about writing a simple editor again. The
<a href="https://smallandnearlysilent.com/">Small and Nearly Silent</a>
web app by
<a class="account" href="https://tenforward.social/@eli_oat" title="@eli_oat@tenforward.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="eli_oat">@eli_oat</span></a> is beautiful
because it mixes text and line drawings. I often feel that I’d like a
simple path-based SVG-like drawing ability, like
<a href="https://akkartik.name/lines.html">lines</a>, by
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="akkartik">@akkartik</span></a>. Some lines,
some control points, some curves, filling stuff with patterns… I don’t
know whether I’d actually use it, but it’s alluring.
</p>
<p>
The whole <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">uxn</a>
ecosystem with many different small tools is also quite alluring.
Unfortunately, it’s also a bit hard to get into an existing ecosystem
like that. I still feel that if spent a while writing something myself,
it’d feel more like it was “mine”. I’d just understand it better. I just
don’t know if I’m ready to spend that much time on it, or if I’d even be
able to pull it off. So that’s why I wavering at the same time that I’m
fascinated.
</p>
<p>
Given all that, I was thinking about Gforth and found
<a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Gforth-SDL2-Bindings/">SDL2
Bindings for Gforth</a>, and I found the example
<a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Yellow-Snow">Yellow
Snow</a> game using this library, I tried to compile it and Gforth
complained about the missing headers. No problem, I thought to myself. I
know what to do: <code>sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev
libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev</code> – but the mixer results in
<a href="https://doc.sccode.org/">SuperCollider</a> getting deinstalled.
Oh no!
</p>
<p>
So now I’m once again thinking about the thing I actually want to do. Do
I want to build an Emacs light? A simple line-based text editor like
<code>ed</code> but with more features? An editor that only runs inside
a terminal, like <code>kilo</code> or <code>mini</code>? See
<a href="2018-03-12_Writing_an_Editor">2018-03-12 Writing an Editor</a>
for more. Or would it be an editor with a GUI? Would it work only with
X11? Or would it be based on SDL?
</p>
<p>
I feel like an editor with a minimal GUI would be nice. I don’t think I
need a menu, but I think I’d like a way to scale font size up and down,
UTF-8 support to write German and Portuguese, basically render Markdown
and some simple variant of SVG, inline. I feel like that’s why I need to
start with graphics and font support. Otherwise I’ll end up with
something like <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~m15o/grid/">grid</a>: a cool
<a href="https://plan9.io/wiki/plan9/using_acme/index.html">ACME</a>-inspired
text editor, but it would only really works for English.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Editor">#Editor</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-06-04</strong>. Thinking about Go and the
<a href="https://github.com/hibiken/mini">mini</a> editor. It runs in a
terminal. So what would it take to turn it into a graphical editor with
fonts, ligatures, bidirectional text, font-sizes, and all of that?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/go-text/typesetting">go-text/typesetting</a>
is a library that’s used by <a href="https://fyne.io">Fyne</a>,
<a href="https://gioui.org">Gio</a>, and
<a href="https://ebitengine.org">Ebitengine</a>. So perhaps one of these
frameworks?
</p>
<p>
Fyne has a
<a href="https://apps.fyne.io/apps/com.fynelabs.notes.html">Notes</a>
example application. It looks like a nice, simple app. When I built it,
however, it didn’t work. Is it because I’m on Wayland? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Gio is used by <a href="https://anvil-editor.net/">Anvil</a>, an
ACME-like editor with many features. In fact, it already looks like it
has too many features for me to start building something. I wonder.
Perhaps those are the right features? I just can’t warm up to using the
mouse all that much.
</p>
<p>
Ebitengine has a
<a href="https://ebitengine.org/en/examples/font.html">Font</a> example.
It just shows how one loads a font for a number of code-points and
that’s that. An interesting way to load a font, for sure.

<p>In other words the designers of CSS and JavaScript and probably every
other technology everyone uses had no idea what actual developers were
doing with their committee-designed creation. They made mistakes and
piled them on each other, fixing old mistakes with new mistakes. After
30 years of evolving in this convoluted way, if you want to create
useful software, you have to either master all of it (and no one has) or
pay $20 a month to OpenAI so you can use it to navigate the awful
hairball that the web platform has become. Where we only have a sliver
of knowledge as humans, <i>the machine knows all of it.</i> And that’s
just programming. I’m just guessing that everything is that way. You
know the

knows</a> how the technology works. That’s where we are now. Spend your
whole life using the stuff and you still only know a tiny fraction of
what you need to make good software. We needed what ChatGPT does, but we
didn’t know we needed it. That’s where we are now, and the journos are
sitting on the sidelines hurling

<p>What got me spinning was listening to Rachel Maddow advertise her
podcast at the beginning of her show last night. You can get the podcast
for free, she says, or if you want no ads, you can pay some money and
get it from Apple. What Apple is selling there, and Maddow is going
along with, is not a freaking podcast and by calling it one they
undermine a great medium. I understand why Maddow might not care, she
makes millions from a medium that doesn’t give users much choice (ie
MSNBC) so why should she care about podcasting, which does.</p>

podcasting had a marketing team behind it, we’d run a campaign that says
“It’s not podcasting if you don’t have choice.” If you have to use
Apple, Audible, Spotify or Google to listen to something, that’s nice,
hope it’s good for you, but folks that is not a podcast. Podcasts give
you the listener all the power. If you give it up it’ll all be
Disneyfied before too long. It pisses me off that Amazon Music sends me
messages about all the new “podcasts” they have. I mutter under my
breath when I hear this, some expletive I’d rather not repeat. Amazon,
the users know that podcasting == user choice, and they hate you just a
little every time you lie about it. Find another term you like and use
that. You have the money to do the marketing. Come on, just once play
fair. You’ll be surprised how good it feels, and I wouldn’t be surprised
if the users reward you for it.</p>

I delete the comments and change the permissions to only allow friends
to comment. <i>The journalists are wrong about ChatGPT.</i> I solve
problems with it. It guides me through difficult programming situations,
esp around convoluted designs like CSS and JavaScript. It knows all of
it. The only times it hallucinates (and I know it’s doing it btw, I’m
not stupid) is when there is not enough info on the web to give an
answer. It would be nice if it just said “I don’t know” but it’s early,
and they haven’t figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no
sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs.
I can’t wait for the first aha! from a journalist – who will say this:
“Aha! Now I see what this is for and it’s freaking lovely.” But they’ve
decided it sucks and that’s that. Too bad, we’re going on without them.
And thanks to the good moderation tools we can keep the turd-droppers
from totally screwing it up.</p>

Interesting
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roboform-password-3-million-dollar-crypto-wallet/">story</a>
of breaking the security of the RoboForm password manager in order to
recover a cryptocurrency wallet password.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Grand and Bruno spent months reverse engineering the version of the
RoboForm program that they thought Michael had used in 2013 and found
that the pseudo-random number generator used to generate passwords in
that version—­and subsequent versions until 2015­—did indeed have a
significant flaw that made the random number generator not so random.
The RoboForm program unwisely tied the random passwords it generated to
the date and time on the user’s computer­—it determined the computer’s
date and time, and then generated passwords that were predictable. If
you knew the date and time and other parameters, you could compute any
password that would have been generated on a certain date and time in
the past…

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">
2024-05-23 Death and dying
</h1>
<p>
This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am
old enough to be an adult about it.
</p>
<p>
One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in
Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at
the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see
my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn’t go
myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn’t
there for my sister’s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours,
back then. I don’t know how things are now. There was school and stuff
and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn’t feel very
close. It just felt weird. I didn’t know what it was supposed to mean.
</p>
<p>
Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are
failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his
heart is failing; they can’t give him his heart medication because the
kidneys are at their limits, can’t have him move around because he’s
weak, and so he’s breaking down. I mean, he’s calm, he knows what’s
happening, and he’s very, very tired. He’s ready to go.
</p>
<p>
I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to
go one day. I don’t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines.
I’ll be very, very tired. I’ll just want to go home. I also won’t want
anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I’ll feel that I lived a good
life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were
decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will
be able to let go and be at peace. It’s what I hear about my stepfather.
</p>
<p>
But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and
Germany and my mother, and one after another people start crying,
choking up, it’s hard. It’s that invisible choker, grabbing us, one
after another.
</p>
<p>
I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the
laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our
family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back
to haunt us, now.
</p>
<p>
To go and support each other.
</p>
<p>
Go and hug your loved ones.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at
all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping,
mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us,
saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The
doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes,
stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.
</p>
<p>
There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister,
my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the
only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”
</p>
<p>
Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of
them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not
feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my
partner that has died.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his
birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all
there for each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on
the radio.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the
family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the
language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad,
and how hard it was for a family where people live in different
countries, alone – but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had
led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings,
and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased
stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy
and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented
and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to
remember the good times we had and the lessons we all drew from his
presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.
</p>
<p>
I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived
across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous.
I wished to live like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went
back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild
and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there
were rumours that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise
when it was him, the wild and free guitar playing dude from across the
river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother,
moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical
and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes
they brought about, it was a miracle.
</p>
<p>
So, my man, wherever you are, here’s to you and your last trip, to your
guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of
independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you
again.

<p>The fallout from the New York jury’s conviction of Donald Trump on 34
felony counts last Thursday, May 30, continues. Trump’s team continues
to insist that the guilty verdict will help him, but that’s nonsensical
on its face: if guilty verdicts are so helpful, why has he moved heaven
and earth to keep the many other cases against him from going to trial?
And why are he and House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) calling for the
Supreme Court to overturn the convictions?</p>

The Hailo-8L’s claim to fame is 3-4 TOPS/W efficiency, which, along with
the Pi’s 3-4W idle power consumption, puts it alongside Nvidia’s edge
devices like the Jetson Orin in terms of TOPS/$ and TOPS/W for price and
efficiency.

<p>If you make a podcast client, I’d like to have an
<a href="https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">OPML list</a> of
all the feeds I’m subscribed to in my client so I can follow it in my
feed reader. I’d really like it to go the other way, actually, so I
could maintain the list on my desktop computer, and have it
automatically reflected in the mobile podcast client. It’s very
important that it use OPML, that’s the standard for this stuff. I
couldn’t possibly get excited by another format. Podcasting thrives on
these standards. The client I use is
<a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a> which is part of
Automattic. BTW, you can
<a href="https://editsubscriptionlists.opml.org/">use Drummer to
edit</a> a subscription list. Its native format is OPML.</p>

<a href="http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html">podcast
about podcasting</a>. Today I was asked how I feel about podcasting now.
Here’s what I said. It’s still working – people expect to have choice in
where they listen to their podcasts, and as long as that’s true they
will imho continue to have choice. But even if Google took it over
tomorrow, I’d be happy with the outcome. It’s been over 20 years since
we rolled it out, and it’s still delivering huge value to lots of
people, and isn’t controlled by anyone, as far as I can tell there are
no gatekeepers. If only we had been able to keep blogging free of that
kind of control, but I have hope there too.</p>

<p>One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult
to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot
of the
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/03/teslascreen.png">status
messages</a> are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and
in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating
for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And
when I’m flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms
Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for
this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the
wheel.</p>

keep coming back to this – ChatGPT is a vast library that comes with its
own librarian. And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and
can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what
the critics say) in an instant. I’ve been using libraries my whole life,
going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and
non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on
that timeline and you’ll see its significance. You didn’t write it, I
didn’t. Each of us may have contributed a little, and <i>isn’t that what
we want?</i> To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our
lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on
themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to
have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn’t get more meaningful than
this.</p>

know without wading through a lot of stuff you don’t care about. I got

<p>We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the
language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much
of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at
compile-time or runtime. It should strive to read like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>. We
started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the
computer, and for a few decades we were factoring and making it simpler
with every iteration, but then we turned around in the other direction.
I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at
all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all
the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I
plan to write more about this.</p>

Technology was once simply a tool—and a small one at that—used to
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1940761.1940772">amplify
human intent and capacity</a>. That was the story of the industrial
revolution: we could control nature and build large, complex human
societies, and the more we employed and mastered technology, the better
things got. We don’t live in that world anymore. Not only has technology
become entangled with the structure of society, but we also can no
longer see the world around us without it. The separation is gone, and
the control we thought we once had has revealed itself as a mirage.
We’re in a transitional period of history right now…

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Summary. </strong>Gen AI tools are rapidly making these emails
more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous. Recent
research showed that 60% of participants fell victim to artificial
intelligence (AI)-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success
rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts. Companies
need to: 1) understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced
phishing, 2) determine the company or division’s phishing threat
severity level, and 3) confirm their current phishing awareness
routines…

people who say you get wrong answers from ChatGPT, if I wanted my car to
kill me I could drive into oncoming traffic. If I wanted my calculator
to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other
words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have
to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if
you pay attention and don’t drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that
you can do things you never could do before.</p>

a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, the post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansible.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-the-awx-project/&quot;&gt;Upcoming Changes to the AWX Project&lt;/a&gt; came across my feed. An innocuous title, but sometimes community-impacting changes are buried in posts like this. So, as an interested Ansible user, I read through the post.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
In 1,610 words, almost nothing of substance was written.
</p>
<p>
A lot about how it’s not 2014 anymore, so 2014-era architecture doesn’t
suit AWX. Then a big bold disclaimer at the bottom:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Before we conclude, we should be clear about what will not happen.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We are not changing the Ansible project
</li>
<li>
We are not adjusting our OSS license structure
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ultimately, we need to make some changes to the way our systems work and
our projects are structured. Not a rewrite but a refactoring and
restructuring of how some of the core components connect and communicate
with each other.

rendering its RSS feed. Why bother statically rendering the home page,
month page, day page or pages for each individual post. Dynamic servers

a lot of stuff in Friday’s piece. Ken Smith pointed out the story in the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/31/123255.html#a125308">very last
postscript</a>. Before that, I hadn’t put it together that podcasting
worked because for a while Adam did my job, and for a while I did his.
That guaranteed two things – that the technology would be maximally
simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and
production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the
result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn’t matter, in
fact it helped that there were so many glitches in my early podcasts,
that said that hey if this guy can do it, so can I.</p>

<p>Today, as MAGA Republicans attack the rule of law and promise to
prosecute their political enemies if they get back into power, it’s easy
to forget that once upon a time, certain Republican politicians
championed reason and compromise and took a stand against MAGAs’
predecessors. On June 1, 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a
Republican from Maine, stood up against Republican Senator Joe McCarthy
of Wisconsin and his supporters, who were undermining American democracy
in a crusade against “communism.”</p>
