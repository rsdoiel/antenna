Configuring Oddµ via environment variables</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-09-29-configuring-oddµ-via-environment-variables">
2024-09-29 Configuring Oddµ via environment variables
</h1>
<p>
<a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> replaced <a href="Oddmuse">Oddmuse</a> as
my preferred wiki software.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Oddµ is a <strong>wiki</strong> – a website that can be edited on the
web, using a regular web browser on my phone, for example. Only I get to
edit the wiki these days and there is no way to leave a comment. Send me
an email, instead. I love getting email! 😍
</li>
<li>
Oddµ is a <strong>static site generator</strong> (SSG) so that I can in
theory write a bunch of Markdown files locally, run Oddµ and upload the
result to the web. The reason I don’t use it like that is that this
disables online search. If you don’t need online search or you’re using
some other software to handle it, static files are a great option.
Static files are also a great option if you need to archive or export
the whole site for offline viewing. Anybody will be able to browse the
HTML files offline.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Oddµ reacts to changes made as it runs, so I can edit the Markdown files
remotely, using ssh and my favourite editor or I can edit the Markdown
files locally and sync them with the server and the pages Oddµ serves
reflect those changes immediately, no restart required. Earlier versions
required a restart so that Oddµ would update its in-memory indexes of
page names and titles.
</p>
<p>
Oddµ is also a program that doesn’t take a config file. Oddmuse, its
predecessor, was designed to be hackable. There were a gazillion options
to set. You could hook into the parser and add new rules, add new
actions, add new meta data, and on and on. The drawback was an
incredible lock-in. After twenty years, I started to feel it: it was
hard to remove features for any specific wiki because its pages used a
markup that was incompatible with everything else. The sources files
ended up being tied to the config files and the modules used.
</p>
<p>
Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the old
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Usemod_Markup_Extension">UseMod
markup</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the newer
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Creole_Markup_Extension">Wiki Creole
markup</a> that some wiki engine authors wanted to push
<a href="2006-09-04_Wiki_Creole">back in 2006</a>. Some of my Oddmuse
wikis used their own
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Markup_Extension">eclectic markup
mix</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Markdown_Rule_Extension">Markdown</a>.
For a while I even added <a href="Gemtext">Gemtext</a> to the mix! I
didn’t like this incompatibility between sites and sometimes even
between old and new pages on the same site. This is why Oddµ only does
Markdown with three minimal extensions: hashtags, wiki links and fedi
account links. See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Oddµ generates HTML using templates so there is no need for options to
control the HTML output. If you want it changed, edit the templates. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Oddµ doesn’t know anything about users, passwords and permissions. If
you want authentication and authorization (which you do, if your wiki is
public), then you need to configure your webserver to ask for passwords
and restrict access accordingly. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-apache.5">oddmu-apache(5)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-nginx.5">oddmu-nginx(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Over time, however, I did add a few configuration options to Oddµ. This
happens via environment variables.
</p>
<p>
When stdin is a socket, Oddµ reads requests from it instead of listening
on port. This allows for systemd-style socket activation. This is what I
use at the moment. Otherwise, it listens on the address from
<strong>ODDMU_ADDRESS</strong> and the port from
<strong>ODDMU_PORT</strong>. ODDMU_ADDRESS may be either an IPV4 address
or an IPv6 address. If ODDMU_ADDRESS is unspecified, then the listener
listens on all available unicast addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6. If
ODDMU_PORT is unspecified, it listens on port 8080. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu.service.5">oddmu.service(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
By default, Oddmu tries to identify the language used on every page in
order to allow a style sheet to enable hyphenation for the correct
language. This is important for multi-lingual sites. The library used
detects over 70 languages. This takes memory and time.
<strong>ODDMU_LANGUAGES</strong> allows admins to reduce the number of
languages taken into account. This site, for example, only considers
English and German. See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
A pretty hairy feature is activated using <strong>ODDMU_FILTER</strong>.
Sometimes, subdirectories are separate sites. If you do not want to
include those sites in searches or archives of the whole site, you need
to identify them. The way to do this is via the environment variable
ODDMU_FILTER. It’s value is a regular expression matching separate
sites. On this site, my dad’s old site resides in such a subdirectory. I
use this environment variable to exclude “his” pages from searches made
on “my” pages. See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-filter.7">oddmu-filter(7)</a>
for more.
</p>
<p>
And finally, since linking to fediverse accounts involves an outgoing
Webfinger lookup, this feature is disabled by default. You can switch it
on by setting <strong>ODDMU_WEBFINGER</strong> to “1”. It’s what I do.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-29</strong>. I really love the fact that I picked
Markdown. If I miss something, I can just write HTML directly. And with
the decision to use Markdown, all the Markdown writing from years on
GitHub use stays relevant. There’s no need to tinker with the code. That
still surprises me.

<h1 id="2024-09-29-how-do-i-feel-about-the-mnt-pocket-reform">
2024-09-29 How do I feel about the MNT Pocket Reform?
</h1>
<p>
SpaceLizard asked:
<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/what-brought-you-to-the-mnt-community/2132">What
brought you to the MNT community</a>? Well, actually there were three
questions:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
How did you first find out about MNT Reform and/or what brought you
here?
</li>
<li>
What do you do / want to do with your Reform Laptop most?
</li>
<li>
Are cats or dogs better, (or robots)?
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s what I said:
</p>
<p>
I learned about MNT Reform on fedi. I had bought a Purism laptop
<a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">in 2017</a> and
<a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">I wasn’t happy</a>.
On a blog post <a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">in
2021</a> I mentioned the MNT Reform laptop for the first time. I
mentioned the MNT Pocket Reform in 2022,
<a href="2020-11-20_Small_computer">on a blog post from 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
I still use the Purism laptop as my main laptop, but one of its hinges
broke in 2021 and I needed something else to take on trips. That’s why I
started looking for an extra small laptop. I wanted something that was
energy efficient, that would allow me to use all my Debian stable tools
for system administration, to write Perl code, to use Emacs, to browse
the web using Firefox, to ssh into my server and do maintenance work
from hotel rooms and the like. The MNT Pocket Reform landed on the list.
</p>
<p>
As it stands right now, I’m still using Debian testing but I’d love to
make that switch to Debian stable one day. My secret idea is that I just
have to wait and one day I’d be able to do it using
/etc/apt/sources.list sorcery. I managed to switch from PureOS to Debian
stable doing that, so I don’t doubt that there is a way to do it from
Debian testing to Debian stable. Painfully, maybe, but doable.
</p>
<p>
I’d love for battery and wifi to be no problem. Right now, battery life
is good enough for my evening sessions if I have to move to the couch,
and wifi seems to be working fine now that summer is over. I have an
ethernet connection for the Pocket Reform, however, and that’s very
nice. The cable is 3m long or something. But in a hotel, wifi still
works, as I said.
</p>
<p>
I recently had some emergency sysadmin stuff to do in the evenings while
on holidays and the Pocket Reform did exactly what I needed it to do.
</p>
<p>
Finally, cats are bird murderers and dogs are our best friends. No
question, dogs are better! But also, I don’t have time in my life for a
dog, so I think I’ll vote for little Internet people in my computers, on
forums, IRC, Discord, Fedi, newsgroups and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Luckily,
<a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@josch" title="@josch@floss.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="josch">@josch</span></a> had some answers
for me!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Instead of doing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> sorcery in the
future, you could replace “testing” by “trixie” today. That way, at the
point in time where “testing” becomes “stable” you do not need to edit
your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. The updates and security
mirrors also exist already for trixie but are of course empty but this
means that you can also add those today already and have things set up
for the future:
</p>
<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie-updates main
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security trixie-security main
</code></pre>
<p>
The one point of pain may be that after the trixie release, the MNT
repositories will continue to build packages for unstable which will
work for a while but will break after new uploads of glibc and friends.
So in the future, you might want to switch out the MNT repo for the
Debian stable repositories on <code>reform.debian.net</code> which are
currently only serving packages for bookworm and not trixie.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This sounds like great advice.

<p>Summer over in a flash, autumn wind and rain outside – perhaps cosy
evenings will speed up both my reading and review-posting. I just
finished AI Snake Oil by Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor, having long
been a fan of …

I haven’t mentioned this before, but I’m working on the reading
interface for my blog. What you see when you go to scripting.com. I’m
putting the same kind of attention into it that I did for the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html">blogroll</a> feed
reader earlier this year. There are a few unreleased products that use
the same approach. The way we read the web hasn’t received enough
attention, we’ve been so focused on the twitter-like interfaces,
forgetting that reading on a full page is important too. We’ve settled
for a pretty awful way of reading. I want to fix writing too, and have
plans for this, but I thought I should do some work on reading as well.
I wish I could show you all the new ideas, but I’m saving that for a big
reveal at some point.</p>

“unchecked <span class="citation"

“rawdogging concurrency”

One of the rushed fixes was to slap a “DispatchQueue.main.async” to
invoke a <span class="h-card"
translate="no"><a href="https://mastodon.social/@MainActor" class="u-url mention">@<span>MainActor</span></a></span>
method from the URLSession.didFinishDownloadingTo - but this method
deletes the file upon return, so my file was gone by the time the method
was called. But took a week to catch the regression.

Some observations on swift concurrency:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>it has caught a bunch of mistakes I made<br />- I made a couple of
mistakes trying to speed run fixes<br />- some of the solutions to the
problems are harder to grasp than I hoped. I still google a lot.<br />-
wish there was a “sure you are correct, but I can guarantee this ain’t
ever going to happen, let me do it”
</p>
<p>
That said, I forgot how many times I used “foo!.bar” because I knew
“this is never going to happen” and found it a few months later on the
crash logs.

<p>Growing up, we had a tape with Home Cookin’s earlier self titled
album and it was a favorite for the drive to Tahoe, along with a Ray
Charles mix tape. ‘Little Joe from Chicago‘ was a favorite track on that
one — on this album there’s a sick organ solo on ‘Five O’clock
Blues.’</p>

<p>If you have a long career in media and writing in public like I have,
you’re likely to make some mistakes. And you’re going to have some
regrets. One of those was a story I wrote about Path, a company started
