<p>Here’s a
<a href="http://scripting.com/code/testing/baselineplayground/index.html">prototype</a>
of what a story page might look like on our baseline site for WordLand.
I did this off on the side as input for the WordPress theme. I find it
easier to work on style in a standalone page without much tech that can
get in the way of fast iteration.</p>

<h2 id="how-blogs-show-their-site-title">How blogs show their site
title</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
We’re working on the “baseline” theme for WordLand, the default – the
one that shows the user’s writing in a WordPress context. I did a survey
of news sites and blogs to see how they show their titles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-says-ny-budget-will-create-50m-rental-aid-program-championed-by-tenant-groups">Gothamist</a>
puts the name in the upper left corner, leaving room for some buttons
and a menu in the right corner.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/redditor-accidentally-reinvents-discarded-90s-tool-to-escape-todays-age-gates/">Ars
Technica</a> does something similar, name of site in upper left corner,
with an array of buttons flush right.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/04/30/three-coequal-timelines-of-government/">Empty
Wheel</a> does the same thing. (I sense a pattern here.)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2025/04/30/missouri-lawmakers-should-reject-fake-chaplains-in-schools-bill/">Missouri
Independent</a> centers the title in much bigger type than the previous
examples, the buttons are arrayed above it (more buttons).
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://evgrieve.com/2025/04/east-village-mainstay-cafe-mogador.html">EV
Grieve</a> puts the name in the upper left corner without much fanfare.
Proves that it doesn’t have to be eye-catching, it’s the attitude and
the content I love. One of my longtime favorites. It’s an East Village
neighborhood blog, running in Blogger for ages.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://seths.blog/2025/04/uncomfortable-ideas/">Seth’s
Blog</a> is a WordPress site, managed by Automattic. The left sidebar
includes the title of the blog, and has a list of things he wants you to
read, and how to get on his mail list, etc. So effectively the title is
in the upper left corner, and the equiv of the buttons are arrayed
vertically in a column. The functionality of his blog is probably
closest to what I have in mind for WordLand, but into spartan
beginnings. It’s easy to add stuff, impossible to take away.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/#atom-everything">Simon
Willison’s Weblog</a>, another great example of the kind of writing I
want people to do with WordLand. He puts the title in the upper left
corner, with a single button flush right. He deals with the recent
articles thing by putting a list of three posts, linkblog style, at the
bottom. I like this placement, btw. Positioned as an afterthought. If
you’re lingering here, you might like this? I pretty much always ignore
this kind of stuff.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/04/29/model-train-at-the-casey.html">Manton
Reece</a> does the same thing everyone else is doing. Title at the top
left, an array of buttons flush-right at the same level. What’s uncommon
about his style is that the name of his blog is tiny, 13px. But it also
is very visible.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://kottke.org/25/04/0046739-trump-is-a-hallucinating-">Kottke</a>
does not include the title of his blog on a story page. This is
remarkable. But he does have the author name very prominently placed,
it’s the very topmost text on the page, impossible to miss. So amazingly
the title is visible, even though it isn’t there.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/">Pluralistic</a>
puts the title in big type flush left, with a subtitle, and the buttons
are below the title, before the headline of the post (lots of white
space separating).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Meta is suing NSO Group,
<a href="https://cyberscoop.com/whatsapp-nso-group-trial-judge-limits-evidence-2025/">basically
claiming</a> that the latter hacks WhatsApp and not just WhatsApp users.
We have a procedural ruling:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Under
<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16395340/686/whatsapp-inc-v-nso-group-technologies-limited/">the
order</a>, NSO Group is prohibited from presenting evidence about its
customers’ identities, implying the targeted WhatsApp users are
suspected or actual criminals, or alleging that WhatsApp had
insufficient security protections.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
In making her ruling, Northern District of California Judge Phyllis
Hamilton said NSO Group undercut its arguments to use evidence about its
customers with contradictory statements…

<p>I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern

On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background.
Text colors are quite nice but I have disliked the gray background. I
have wished to have or black one or transparent one (it a terminal
emulator supports transparency).</p>

does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.</p>

<p>Things are continuously developing or at least changing. For example,
my gVim on my GPD Pocket (Ubuntu MATE 18.04) has issues with text
encoding. If I create a new file then I everything is OK. But when I
save it and re-open it then it en-codes local language characters
incorrectly. It is strange because I have been using the same
.vimrc/.gvimrc for ages on several Linux machines and I never
encountered such behaviour.</p>

<p>I have decided to update the Touchpad a bit. I think that it can be a
nice portable / secondary machine for some situations. Especially
because I have a good (original) keyboard for it.</p>

<p>As the quarantine is now not so strict here and as a results of some

amount of incoming mails and phone calls (and amount of work related to
them) have increased too much. And I have became tired.</p>

was down this morning</a>. Usually I don’t criticize a service when it’s
down, because I can relate. We like to help each other when there are
outages. But Bluesky is special, because they claim to be decentralized.
If it were, it wouldn’t go down unless the internet itself had. And
since the internet, amazingly, <i>is</i> decentralized, that’s not
likely to happen. It was designed that way when it was developed at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">Arpanet</a>, a project
of the US Department of Defense. It was designed to survive a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET#Inspiration">nuclear
strike</a>. Bluesky is nice, but it’s fragile, and their hype says
otherwise. That’s why they’re special. They should straighten this out
so we can properly get decentralization into <i>our</i> networks.
Bluesky could easily add a layer of
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> on top of what
they have, so that news flow could survive a disaster. In 2025 this is a
realistic concern, as it was in the 1960s. Also it would be nice if
other network experts would support this, esp if they’re on Bluesky.
This is not personal, if they wanted to get the RSS layer built, I would
help them do it. We should all pitch in because then it would really be
our network, and not owned by anyone. Live up to the promise, now.</p>

This seems like an
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/researchers-claim-breakthrough-in-fight-against-ais-frustrating-security-hole/">important
advance</a> in LLM security against prompt injection:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Google DeepMind has <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813">unveiled
CaMeL</a> (CApabilities for MachinE Learning), a new approach to
stopping prompt-injection attacks that abandons the failed strategy of
having AI models police themselves. Instead, CaMeL treats language
models as fundamentally untrusted components within a secure software
framework, creating clear boundaries between user commands and
potentially malicious content.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
To understand CaMeL, you need to understand that prompt injections
happen when AI systems can’t distinguish between legitimate user
commands and malicious instructions hidden in content they’re
processing…

Text colors are quite nice but I have disliked the gray background. I
have wished to have or black one or transparent one (it a terminal
emulator supports transparency).</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-29, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>Today my wife requested new keyboard. I thought that the Apple
white-transparent keyboard is too inferior to her IBM laptop keyboard.
Well, it is. So I have replaced it by spare HP one. A HP keyboard which
was a part of the PA-RISC Visualize workstation (the workstation itself
does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-29, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>Things are continuously developing or at least changing. For example,
my gVim on my GPD Pocket (Ubuntu MATE 18.04) has issues with text
encoding. If I create a new file then I everything is OK. But when I
save it and re-open it then it en-codes local language characters
incorrectly. It is strange because I have been using the same
.vimrc/.gvimrc for ages on several Linux machines and I never
encountered such behaviour.</p>

<p>It’s hard to come up with a buyer who could afford to pay a high
price for Chrome and who would pass regulatory muster as its new owner.
And if Chrome is not worth a high price, or simply isn’t sellable at

as well try to force Google to sell the two o’s from its name.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Windscribe, a globally used privacy-first VPN service, announced today
that its founder, Yegor Sak, has been fully acquitted by a court in
Athens, Greece, following a two-year legal battle in which Sak was
personally charged in connection with an alleged internet offence by an
unknown user of the service.
</p>
<p>
The case centred around a Windscribe-owned server in Finland that was
allegedly used to breach a system in Greece. Greek authorities, in
cooperation with INTERPOL, traced the IP address to Windscribe’s
infrastructure and, unlike standard international procedures, proceeded
to initiate criminal proceedings against Sak himself, rather than
pursuing information through standard corporate channels…

<h2 id="dont-let-your-voice-be-flattened-by-the-über-theme">Don’t let
your voice be flattened by the über theme</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I want you to have a blog. Despite this being nearly my entire online
ethos, one situation I struggle with are design systems and UX blogs on
Medium. A lot of them exist. Yet. I have difficulty understanding UX and
design professionals in this space who yield their UX and design
decisions over to the “everyone looks the same” content silo.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, I get why you or an organization would want to use a service
like Medium:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
People are busy and maintaining a blog is work.
</li>
<li>
It’s hard for the design team to get dev resources for a custom site.
</li>
<li>
There’s “free” community engagement there.
</li>
<li>
There’s even monetization paths.
</li>
<li>
Self-publishing obsessed dorks aren’t the target market.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong– I’d rather have more blogs than no blogs so if
that’s your situation don’t mind me and my niche beef. But consider for
a moment that I can’t tell you the last Medium post I’ve read because
they’re all the same to me. I follow a lot of UX and design systems
blogs… but I can’t tell you a single person who writes on Medium. Those
posts and authors have all blended together into a monolithic
groupthinkpiece where individual voices and personality are flattened by
the über theme.
</p>
<p>
If everyone is wearing the same uniform, you all look the same. You are
interchangeable. Your voice exists in a crowded space of vanilla
platitudes. A recent WIRED article suggested over
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-generated-medium-posts-content-moderation/">40%
of the content on Medium is AI generated</a> slop. I think the question
for you –and for me– is how do you stand out in this <em>fancy
copy-pasted</em> new world? My personal belief is that the answer starts
with your own personal website that looks like you, talks like you,
smells like you, and has quirks like you. I want that for you.

<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m sick of saying this
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lnunfkdru22h">over
and over</a>, the Dems need a regular snark-filled irreverent presence
on social media to condemn every freaking fascist thing the Trumps do.
They had it with the Kamala accounts, but they shut them down on
Election Day.
</p>
<p>
It’s so freaking simple. Not having a raging presence on social media in
the future will be seen as like a successful company not being listed on
the NYSE, or a country not having a rep at the United Nations. Aside
from the cost of keeping a staff online 24x7, it’s free, and serves as
its own money-raising channel.
</p>
<p>
The Repubs figured this out in 2016.
</p>
<p>
Maybe what the Dems need is some entrepreneurs and comedians at the top
to actually get through to voters that say “Hey we’re the Dems, we’re
here and we love America and we love you, Americans!” And actually make
a stink when they try to kill Social Security.
</p>
<p>
Another purpose – tell people when the next pandemic is here. You know
the Trumps aren’t going to do that.

<p>I mentioned this in
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/04/27/chatgptDeservesOurRespectAtLeast.html">yesterday’s
podcast</a> – new problems popped up with websockets in WordLand. I
worked through the whole tree of possibilities with ChatGPT and it came
to the conclusion that the source was an out of date package, and it was
confident if I replaced it with the one “everyone else” is using, the
problems will go away. Now this is the moment when human judgement
prevails. I’m going to experiment in a very small app first, to make
sure I have the approach right, then I will cautiously make the change
on my test WordLand server, and if it works there, then I will figure
out how to install it on the main site. It couldn’t break all that much
because for some reason the WS code stopped working, completely, with no
code changes anywhere.</p>

<p>
Sometimes my mind goes back to text editing and text editors. I have a
love/hate relationship with ed(1). I kind of like the deliberate mindset
I need to bring. But I also don’t like to think in terms of lines. Maybe
if each sentence is a line, that’s better. But I often think about
better semantic addressing.
</p>
<p>
Example: <code>p</code> prints a range of line(s) is the standard. What
I would also like is “print a range of paragraph”, “print a range of
sentences”, “print a range of words”. There’s a hierarchy, here. So once
there’s a “current” paragraph, you can list its sentences or its words.
My hope is that this is more useful than working on lines.
</p>
<p>
I’m still struggling to invent a command language, however. “Print
paragraph. Next. Next. Number sentences. Third sentence. Replace this
with that. Print paragraph.” I think this how I would work? “Last
paragraph. Insert paragraph. Start typing.” Would that be <code>p p n 3s
/this/that/ p</code> and <code>par $ i …</code> Effectively,
<code>p</code> switches to paragraphs and prints them, and moves to the
next one if used without a range. <code>n</code> numbers the items one
level down. In this case, with a paragraph selected, <code>n</code>
numbers the sentences. <code>s</code> switches to sentences and prints
them. I’m not sure about the search &amp; replace command. Is that also
<code>s</code>?
</p>
<p>
Should the data be kept in a tree? Should reading the text involve a
real parser that delivers a sort of abstract syntax tree and names the
nodes which automatically turn into commands?
</p>
<p>
And then: should this be written in Perl? 😍
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@mxp" title="@mxp@mastodon.acm.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mxp">@mxp</span></a> said he had written
«an Emacs interface to a syntactic parser», but I’m not sure this is
what I’m looking for. A natural language parser (NLP) is maybe not what
I’m looking for. I suspect it would help avoid grammar mistakes, which
makes sense to me. But is it what need as I write?
</p>
<p>
He then pointed me at Engelbart’s
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1476589.1476645">A research center for
augmenting human intellect</a>. There, we find
<a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/PurpleNumbers">purple
numbers</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The principal manifestation of this hierarchical structure is the
breaking up of text into arbitrary segments called “statements,” each of
which bears a number showing its serial location in the text and its
“level” in an “outline” of the text.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m not sure about the use of an outline. Many people seem to like
outlines, but for me an outline as a writing tool is weird. I never
start with an outline, except for cases where I know I need to follow a
structure and even then the structure is usually trivial: Introduction,
Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References, or something
along these lines. A bunch of headings is all I need. Do I need an
outline view? I agree that showing all the headings is important to
navigate any non-trivial text document when you’re reading and working
with it. But if I focus on writing, the outline doesn’t seem too
important. It’s too far “up” in the structure, for me.
</p>

<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@CerstinMahlow" title="@CerstinMahlow@mastodon.acm.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="CerstinMahlow">@CerstinMahlow</span></a>
wrote a position paper:
<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.17894">Writing Tools:
Looking Back to Look Ahead</a> where she argues that «new writing tools
should be inspired by “failed” projects from the 1970s and 1980s» and
discusses the current state of affairs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One type of functionality that Mahlow and Piotrowski suggest are
information functions that use NLP techniques to highlight certain
aspects of the evolving text, commonly referred to as “syntax
highlighting.” Since 2013, iA Writer has offered such a feature in a
commercial product to specifically highlight nouns, verbs, adjectives,
etc., advertising it as “using parts of speech to improve your writing”
and explicitly stating that writers deserve the same professional
support as programmers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This goes in a different direction, “down” to the grammar roles of
words. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs. The problem is that when I
write, I hardly ever worry about a particular verb. I never want to
navigate to the accusative object of this sentence or focus on the
subject. This is a very detailed view that I don’t care about.
</p>
<p>
The question is: What do I care about? Moving sentences around. Starting
sentences between some other sentences and then realizing that I started
at the wrong place and moving that fragments around. I think what I need
is a prototype editor that I can start using and where I can easily add
and remove functionality. And I’m not sure that Emacs is the correct
environment because there is so damn much to distract me.

<p>Lots of news reports about Trump’s polls. But it isn’t surprising
that in the transition from a democracy to autocracy the people would
become increasingly unhappy with the change, until we basically give up,
and the polls from some pollsters are always this way, but the polls
from others tell a different story. Fox News still runs polls the old
way, as does the NYT and others. But that will change, as the lawyers
have, and the Washington Post and NY Times have, in their editorial
functions. And they just arrested a judge in Wisconsin. Makes you think
maybe it doesn’t matter if the polls say what they say, if there isn’t
something behind them.</p>

<p>
If all goes as planned, if you’re subscribed to the
<a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly email</a>, you should get
two copies of the posts for April 27, one sent by the old software, and
one sent by the new. The new version might look better in your mail
reader app. That was the point of this transition.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBkVybd_vaWT4oen5uNAEKxK8ztFUvAStcCq0Y8m-0VSsTNQ/viewform?usp=header">Google
form</a> where you can let me know how it went. Did it work? How many
emails did you get? Does the v2 email look better than the old version?
In general do you want to comment?
</p>
<p>
<b>The story</b>
</p>
<p>
I had to do a rewrite because when I originally wrote it, I
misunderstood how CSS styling works in some/most email clients and it
required a very deep rewrite of the software, it was actually harder to
do the conversion than it was to write the software in the first place.
And the app was running on an old version of PagePark and depended on
Dropbox, and had broken in many ways over the years. But I never had the
time to zero in on this.
</p>
<p>
Now was the time to do it, because I want to do an <i>excellent</i>
email sender for <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And in
order for that to have even a small chance of working, I needed to do
this transition, to get fully up to date on the best practices for HTML
email in 2025.
</p>
<p>
And yet another plug for ChatGPT. It’s like having a library of medical
journals for a general practitioner. I’m sure they have this, if a GP
has a question about which specialist to send a patient to. And then
they probably have good reference materials for the specialist too, to
be sure they’re using the latest proven techniques for treating disease.
Believe it or not we have nothing like this in software development.
Which means we don’t interop, and don’t use prior art and are constantly
reinventing each others’ work because there’s no way to find out about
it. No conferences, no journals, nothing but hearsay and O’Reilly books
and I hear they aren’t very good these days. Enter ChatGPT, and all of a
sudden if you have a question it has the freaking answer. It’s as if
medicine went from the pre-internet days to now, in just a couple of
years. Only more so because medicine was considered a discipline, where
developing software never has been. Now at least us practitioners have
the tools if not the respect.

heard that
<a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sxsw/2025-04-26/huge-changes-in-sxsw-leadership/">Hugh
Forrest</a> was fired at SXSW. Many people loved him based on the
outpouring of grief, but I didn’t. They had keynotes and panels about
stuff I was working on at the time, in the 90s and 00s, blogging, RSS,
podcasting, bringing blogs to politics. He wouldn’t take my calls. I
wanted to be on stage to talk about what I was working on, and to set
the record straight on what we had created. Instead my competitors got
top billing and I was not allowed in. It felt corrupt to me, as if
someone was trading favors behind the scenes. My hope is now SXSW, or
whatever replaces it, will be more open-minded about who they include in
the show. I’m still working and still have a story to tell.</p>

<h2 id="lynx-nocolor-3">lynx –nocolor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern
systems. On my SGI it was OK - it simply respected IRIS terminal colors.
On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background.
Text colors are quite nice but I have disliked the gray background. I
have wished to have or black one or transparent one (it a terminal
emulator supports transparency).</p>

<h2 id="imac-g5-keyboard-3">iMac G5 keyboard</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>Today my wife requested new keyboard. I thought that the Apple
white-transparent keyboard is too inferior to her IBM laptop keyboard.
Well, it is. So I have replaced it by spare HP one. A HP keyboard which
was a part of the PA-RISC Visualize workstation (the workstation itself
does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.</p>

<h2 id="workflow-changes-and-additions-3">Workflow: Changes and
additions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>Things are continuously developing or at least changing. For example,
my gVim on my GPD Pocket (Ubuntu MATE 18.04) has issues with text
encoding. If I create a new file then I everything is OK. But when I
save it and re-open it then it en-codes local language characters
incorrectly. It is strange because I have been using the same
.vimrc/.gvimrc for ages on several Linux machines and I never
encountered such behaviour.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>I sometimes use the Pluma {sup}1{/sup} text editor (a Gedit clone
which is a part of the MATE {sup}2{/sup} desktop). It is a nice and
simple editor which has several useful functions like syntax
highlighting and spell checking.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>I might noted here in some of previous posts that during an
unsuccessful update I lost the OpenStore {sup}1{/sup} application on my
Ubuntu Touch {sup}2{/sup}. It was a problem because there is no CLI tool
to install (or remove) packages on the Ubuntu Touch (that’s an another
reason for me to dislike this table computing at all).</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>I am writing this on my BQ Aquaris M10 tablet (one of the few devices
shipped with the Ubuntu Touch pre-installed). The community-driven
Ubuntu Touch effort {sup}1{/sup} is still a thing and the recent update
(the OTA-12) is quite interesting.</p>
