Scripting News</strong> (date: 2024-09-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting
News)</p>
<p>I keep seeing mention of “Podcast 2.0” in various places. That is
unusually greedy, even for the tech industry. What next? Deprecating the
way podcasting has worked for the last 20 years? How do we know the
people doing this aren’t shilling for Spotify, Google or Amazon? Please
don’t mess with something that works as well as podcasting. You want to
do something better, great – make your own name and get people to
respect it. Stealing respect from podcasting tells me you have no honor
or self-respect, and it should say the same to everyone else. Something
else that tells you it’s bad, they never bothered to send me an email.
Welcome to the tech industry.</p>

<h2 id="good-forms">Good forms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
<a href="https://brian.io/">Brian LeRoux</a> posted
<a href="https://indieweb.social/@brianleroux/112932335725534529">a few
thoughts about forms</a> and the idea of a
“<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">good
form</a>” resonated with me so I dogpiled some of my own thoughts and
experiences on it. Here’s a compilation of those ideas. I’m sure this is
incomplete and would love to see your list.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Good forms work without client JavaScript (Brian LeRoux)
</li>
<li>
Good forms always submit (Brian LeRoux)
</li>
<li>
Good forms remember values and display problems inline (Brian LeRoux)
</li>

Good login forms work with password managers
(<a href="https://elk.zone/oldbytes.space/@mingo/112932355524060403">Mingo
Hogan</a>)
</li>
<li>
Good forms use a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag

<code>&lt;search&gt;</code> element
</li>
<li>
Good forms can be reset with a <code>&lt;button type=reset&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>
Good forms participate in <code>formData</code>
</li>
<li>
Good forms don’t use placeholder as a label
</li>
<li>
Good forms work on phones
</li>
<li>
Good forms don’t popup and ask for personal information
</li>
<li>
Good forms only ask for what is necessary and aren’t too long
</li>
<li>
Good forms use HTTPS
</li>
<li>
Good forms use the proper HTTP verbs
</li>
<li>
Good forms validate on the client AND on the server
</li>
<li>
Good forms have been driven with a screen reader <em>before</em> going
to production
</li>
<li>
Good forms clearly denote required attributes
</li>
<li>
Good forms warn about costly or destructive actions
</li>
<li>
Good forms make the baby Jesus smile
</li>
<li>
Good authenticated forms should have a server-generated nonce value
</li>
<li>
Good forms should do a pre-flight check for
<code>navigator.onLine</code> before attempting a submit
</li>
<li>
Good forms start with <code>accent-color</code> for styling and only get
more complex if necessary
</li>
<li>
Good forms see custom controls as a radioactive asset that must be
removed at the earliest opportunity
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anyways. People should talk about forms more. Here’s some more resources
on good form design.

<h2 id="dropbox-almost-reinvented-the-web">Dropbox almost reinvented the
web</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I was trying to
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/113125134990424609">explain</a>
to Miguel de Icaza, a longtime developer friend, how Dropbox was within
inches of making the web a million times more useful, ten years ago, and
then backed away from it. I don’t think I’ve ever told the story here on
my blog, so here goes. </i>
</p>
<p>
In 2013, Dropbox had a developer program, you could write an app, and
register it with them, and then the user could run your app from a
website, and log on to Dropbox in the app, and they would have access to
files in a directory in the user’s Dropbox hierarchy in the app, as if
it were accessing it from the local file system, which in a way they
were.
</p>
<p>
I made an <a href="http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html">outliner</a>
for that system, and loved it – it was great, I didn’t have to get into
the business of reselling storage, or user identity. And for the users,
it “just worked” as they say, because they were already using Dropbox,
and now it could be used for something completely new and incredibly
useful, and it didn’t require huge venture capital to get it going, so
it would enable very small niche products to find a market. It was
brilliant and visionary, and I was very open about my feelings on my
blog.
</p>
<p>
They also had a Public Folder, where any user files could be accessed
over the web.
</p>
<p>
They were within an inch of the perfect system. The problem was my app
couldn’t access user files in any other directory. So it didn’t allow
for specialization in products, every editor had to do everything.
</p>
<p>
They had an option where you could give an app access to
<i>everything</i> but that was ridiculous, I couldn’t recommend users do
that. Users store all kinds of private data on Dropbox.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the <a href="http://fargo.io/docs/fargo/dropbox.html">howto</a>
for the product and how it connects to Dropbox.
</p>
<p>
They lost interest in this, btw – and when they broke the API, I took
that opportunity to shut down the product.
</p>
<p>
I wish they had gone in that direction, or someone would go in that
direction.

<p>date: 2024-09-12, updated: 2024-09-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Microsoft is updating
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/SymCrypt">SymCrypt</a>, its core
cryptographic library, with new quantum-secure algorithms. Microsoft’s
details are
<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-s-quantum-resistant-cryptography-is-here/ba-p/4238780">here</a>.
From a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/microsoft-adds-quantum-resistant-algorithms-to-its-core-crypto-library/">news
article</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The first new algorithm Microsoft added to SymCrypt is called ML-KEM.
Previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, ML-KEM is one of three post-quantum
standards
<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards">formalized
last month</a> by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST). The KEM in the new name is short for key encapsulation. KEMs can
be used by two parties to negotiate a shared secret over a public
channel. Shared secrets generated by a KEM can then be used with
symmetric-key cryptographic operations, which aren’t vulnerable to
Shor’s algorithm when the keys are of a sufficient size…

questions and answers about why I like books</h2>

I saw
<a href="https://twitter.com/AlexHormozi/status/1543229182796132352">a
tweet</a> awhile back that sent my brain to a far off galaxy…
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Most people are proud of their reading habit. <br> <br> But for many,
it’s just an act of productive procrastination. <br> <br> I’m looking at

<p>
Of all the injustices happening in the world… you know who needs to be
taken down a peg? The Book-a-Week People. Fuck those guys. With their
books in their Zoom backgrounds. That bothers me. Fuck them.
</p>
<p>
I know the original post is part of some weird hustle culture subgenre,
but it’s probably no surprise to folks who reading that I like books and
fit this targeted demographic. After pondering whether I’m “finding
answers to questions or questions to answer” my answer is a resounding,
“…I guess?”
</p>
<p>
A lot of why I read is about juxtaposition. I read business books to
juxtapose my experience against the Platonic ideal of “good business”. I
read about social justice to juxtapose my lived experience against
others lived experience. I read science fiction to juxtapose the present
against futures I haven’t imagined. I read non-fiction airport books
because I like facts and social science garbage. I read books on topics
I’m already an expert in to see if there’s information that further
informs my perspective. I read to
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/06/telepresence/">teleport</a> to
different places, minds, times, and rooms where it happened.
</p>
<p>
I read to escape. I read to find myself. I read because I like facts. I
read because I like fiction. I read for entertainment. I read to fall
asleep. I listen to books to help me finish mundane tasks like doing the
dishes every night. And I listen to books because there’s a slight
communistic thrill of getting them from the library.
</p>
<p>
There’s a widely accepted idea out there that “the best way to become a
better writer is to become a better reader.” I think Stephen King said
it, but I can’t find the quote. Either way, I want to become a better
writer. Whether fact or fiction, I want the ability to not struggle when
putting thoughts on the page. Oh to partake in this magical osmosis! The
transitive impartation of skills! Let me flex the language encoding and
decoding synapses in my 40-watt brain.
</p>
<p>
And sometimes reading is out of due diligence. Like… if you’re going to
start a job as a manager… read a book on management? Or ten? You’re
dealing with people’s lives and careers, seems like the least you could
do. If you’re going to talk or blog on a topic and there’s a relevant
book… read that before
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-southern-phrase-showing-your-ass-mean">showing
your ass</a>? A thought backed by some literature seems better than
regurgitating TikToks.
</p>
<p>
Books are strange objects. Chapters and chapters of coherent research
and lived experiences assembled by people who wanted to put it all down
in one place. Edited by actual editors who like editing. Designed— down
to the weight of the paper, the typography, and the illustration on the
cover— to make the experience of reading it enjoyable. Books are uncanny
and impractical objects. A terribly inefficient way to encode
information from one brain to another, but an excellent way to tell a
story.
</p>
<p>
You can also just like books for no reason.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, books. Check ’em out.

appropriate role in our democracy. When Jeff started posting to his
blog, it gave his friends something to point to. This writing had much
more impact than a random tweet. Journalism crossed a line they should
not have crossed. Now we fully expect them to try to do it again. We
have to find a way for our ideas not to be scattered in the wind, so
thorougly ignorable. And in doing so, I’m convinced we’d find a better
way to organize the electorate online so it’s more immune from unwise
and unfair manipulation from the journalists. At the same time

an election will be like Game of Thrones or Succession. A campaign would

following episodes the plotting, intrigue, and undermining of democracy,
and at the end of the season the inauguration of a new president. Each
year you have more michegas, until four years later you go through the
election all over again. People would really study the candidates, and
would have reasons they like one character over another. And maybe the

It would have been cool if Harris had said “He’s going to have you for
dinner” instead of “He’s going to eat you for lunch,” which is what she
said Putin would do to Trump.

Makes you wonder if that was a slip of the tongue or if it was a little

Harris is doing is marketing. It takes a lot of impressions to get
people to believe she can be president. If she wants to win, she has to
do a lot of interviews and rallies and say quotable things, and be
tweeting all the time, not just in the campaign snark accounts (which
are great) but also seriously in her own name.
</p>
<p>
People aren’t going to care about the policies though they will say
that’s what they want more of. What they want to feel is that she is
present. Biden was invisible that’s why they didn’t like or trust him,
even though he is a good president. Trump is very present, and they like
that, trust that, but most of them also know he’s a creep. She just has
to keep beating the drum.
</p>
<p>
And the secret is to keep beating the drum, constantly, after she wins.
Don’t disappear like Obama did. She must not only be president of the
United States, but she has to be
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/09/10/twitterPresidentKamala.html">president
of Twitter</a> too (and by Twitter I mean all the twitter-like systems).
</p>
<p>
So don’t expect undecided voters to all convert to Harris in one event.
But they will if she stays in the news, even dominates the news (please)
and help them see Trump as a thing of the past.
</p>
<p>
That’s the way to win, and to win in governing too.

<p>I wouldn’t have traded places with Harris for anything in the world,
she did fantastic. The pressure on her was enormous. I don’t think Trump
said one thing that was true. And Harris made the point that the
division is coming from that guy over there, and if we don’t want it all
we have to do is turn the freaking page. For once the power is with the
people. The Repubs in the Senate wouldn’t vote to convict, the Supreme
Court just gave him immunity, but the American people, in a few weeks,
can tell them all to fuck off.</p>

most encouraging thing about last night’s debate was that the moderators
were journalists. When Trump repeated his most egregious lie about
murdering babies being legal in certain states, moderator Muir
confidently, almost derisively, said that there is no such thing. And
when Trump said he didn’t admit he lost the election, and then when
challenged said in a snotty way he was being sarcastic, Muir plainly
that wasn’t true either. It was like the Monty Python

the Effectiveness of Reward Modeling of Generative AI Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, updated: 2024-09-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
New research evaluating the effectiveness of reward modeling during
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10270">SEAL: Systematic Error
Analysis for Value ALignment</a>.” The paper introduces quantitative
metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of modeling and aligning human
values:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aims
to align language models (LMs) with human values by training reward
models (RMs) on binary preferences and using these RMs to fine-tune the
base LMs. Despite its importance, the internal mechanisms of RLHF remain
poorly understood. This paper introduces new metrics to evaluate the
effectiveness of modeling and aligning human values, namely feature
imprint, alignment resistance and alignment robustness. We categorize
alignment datasets into target features (desired values) and spoiler
features (undesired concepts). By regressing RM scores against these
features, we quantify the extent to which RMs reward them ­ a metric we
term feature imprint. We define alignment resistance as the proportion
of the preference dataset where RMs fail to match human preferences, and
we assess alignment robustness by analyzing RM responses to perturbed
inputs. Our experiments, utilizing open-source components like the
Anthropic preference dataset and OpenAssistant RMs, reveal significant
imprints of target features and a notable sensitivity to spoiler
features. We observed a 26% incidence of alignment resistance in
portions of the dataset where LM-labelers disagreed with human
preferences. Furthermore, we find that misalignment often arises from
ambiguous entries within the alignment dataset. These findings
underscore the importance of scrutinizing both RMs and alignment
datasets for a deeper understanding of value alignment…

Harris must become president of Twitter before becoming president of the
United States.
</p>
<p>
After the debate, Harris should be interviewed anywhere they’ll have
her. Go ahead and be overexposed. Answer every question with one of your
major positioning statements. Call in to radio talk shows, podcasts,
whatever you can think of. Biden hardly ever promoted himself. Not being
heard <i>all the time</i> was his biggest sin. Harris should get
accustomed to being accessible when she’s in office. Keep the
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/">kamalahq</a> snark channel
going. This will have been Trump’s contribution to American politics, no
fear of being heard.

<h1 id="2024-09-08-webdav-no-more">
2024-09-08 WebDAV no more
</h1>
<p>
I must have implemented <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a> two
or three times in the last decade or two. Just now I used
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_dav.html">mod_dav
for Apache</a> to enable WebDAV for some directories.
</p>
<p>
In theory, it’s great. You can treat the web server as a file server,
connecting to it and using your regular file manager and text editor,
using your favourite shell to do things. And if your website already
uses permissions to restrict access to some locations, you can use the
same config files to handle the making of changes.
</p>
<p>
In practice, however, the operating systems all have such brittle
implementations that none of the solutions I had in production ever
worked well. It doesn’t matter whether it’s Windows’ File Explorer,
macOS’ Finder, the Gnome virtual file system via Nautilus or something
else. The only thing that works is the command-line client
<a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>. It’s the best.
It works. Sooner or later, however, I realize that cadaver is probably
not the tool I can expect non-technical people to use. It has the same
user-interface as the old ftp command-line client.
</p>
<p>
I wonder what the issue is. WebDAV is 25 years old. It seems to me that
something about the process or the spec must have set it up for failure.
Perhaps it was a complex protocol?
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2518">RFC 2518</a> for
WebDAV is from February 1999,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> for
HTTP/1.1 is from June 1999. Perhaps the move from HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1
too away all the thunder. There was the DotCom craze and Web 2.0 and
what not. Nobody had time for WebDAV? Nobody had a business model for
WebDAV? People used FTP and SSH and all that for remote file access,
there was no point doing it using web technology? Or perhaps there
wasn’t just one library to rule them all and in the darkness bind them?
</p>
<p>
In any case, I think I need to write this down so I don’t fall for it
again in two years. I’ve been falling for it since 2005. Every wiki of
mine gets WebDAV support … Looking at my blog it seems that
<a href="2021-10-18_WebDAV_is_tricky">the last time</a> I spent five
days to get this right. This time around I’m just tired.
</p>
<p>
Time to disable <code>mod_dav</code> again.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23WebDAV">#WebDAV</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-10</strong>. Another option would be an explicit list of
endorsed clients like
<a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>,
<a href="http://rei.to/carotdav_en.html">CarotDAV</a>,
<a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>,
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/DAV">hDAV</a>,
<a href="https://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a>, … But I have only used
<code>cadaver</code> myself.

back then to get from Flushing to the Bronx to go to school, and in the

where the always-hated Yankees were HQ’d. Ed Kranepool

<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Are the Apple announcements like great reunions for people who have been
going to these things regularly for 20+ years? If so, I can see the
value in it.
</p>
<p>
I went to a reunion at Berkman,
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/08/222335.html">after 20
years</a>, and it was great, made me wonder why we didn’t do it every
year for the last 20. When you get a group of people together who do
great things in a special moment, you should see them from time to time.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">But
I have a feeling there’s a lot of turnover at the Apple events. In any
case, I stopped going to them somewhere in the mid-90s, or more
accurately they stopped inviting me. Yeah I was disruptive, but only in
comparison to how well-behaved the other journos were (at that time I
was writing for Wired).
</p>
<p>
The press was in awe of Apple and other Valley companies. I enjoyed that
for a very brief period when my company went public after I had a hit
Mac product. Then I became something of a pariah, because I
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">started blogging</a> and believe
me the icons of the Valley for the most part <i>did not like it.</i>
They were accustomed to fawning attention and rewritten press releases.
But because I was an insider, I had an idea where the bodies might be
buried, and I wrote about it.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Woz</a> liked it.
I was popular at the parties, I guess.
</p>
<p>
BTW, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Roizen">Heidi
Roizen</a> once observed that I took a date to an Apple announcement
(the one where Steve came back). There weren’t many people there, maybe
20 or 25.
</p>
<p>
Jeff Jarvis wrote in the foreword to his
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-We-Weave-Internet-Misanthropes/dp/1541604121">upcoming
book</a> that I’m like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig">Zelig</a> of tech. This is
what he meant, imho. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
We’re coming up on the 30th anniversary of my blog, one month from
tomorrow. You won’t hear anyone from tech applauding, and you probably
won’t hear anything from the old bloggers. But I have something special
in mind myself. Hopefully it’ll come together in the next month, or
sooner. :-)

In 2018, Australia passed the Assistance and Access Act, which—among
other things—gave the government the

to force companies to break their own encryption.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Assistance and Access Act includes key components that outline
investigatory powers between government and industry. These components
include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Technical Assistance Requests (TARs): TARs are voluntary requests for
assistance accessing encrypted data from law enforcement to teleco and
technology companies. Companies are not legally obligated to comply with
a TAR but law enforcement sends requests to solicit cooperation. …

of the Burren in the far distance. The cairn was built by person or
persons unknown. But it was asking to be photographed! Quote of the Day

<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A very practical issue.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l3njg5jhft2k">BlueSky</a>
has a 300 character limit, which is less than the other services I
cross-post to, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mastodon: 500 (using mastodon.social as benchmark)
</li>
<li>
Threads: 500
</li>
<li>
Twitter: 10000 (assume paying the montly fee)
</li>
<li>
RSS: no specific limit
</li>
<li>
WordPress: no specific limit
</li>
<li>
BlueSky: 300
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This will be a problem when we eventually get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering">peering</a> working
cross-network among twitter-like systems.
</p>
<p>
It looks to me, just eyeballing this list, that 500 is a good place to
start, although I don’t think ultimately there should be any specific
limits.
</p>
<p>
We saw that clearly when RSS 0.91 was the most recent version, there
were limits in the Netscape doc, but they were ignored by content
sources, which is why I took them out in the 0.92 and 2.0 versions.
</p>
<p>
Peering is simpler than federation. It would enable people to send
messages across these boundaries, but wouldn’t handle the engagement
features, likes, replies, forwarding. It’s what many people are starting
to do now, by hand. There’s no way to put it off, imho – the Bluesky
limit is already hard to deal with.

<p>By rights, tonight’s post should be a picture, but Trump’s behavior
today merits a marker because it feels like a dramatic escalation of the
themes we’ve seen for years.</p>
