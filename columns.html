<h2 id="largest-ddos-attack-to-date">Largest DDoS Attack to Date</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
It was a recently unimaginable
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/record-ddos-pummels-site-with-once-unimaginable-7-3tbps-of-junk-traffic/">7.3
Tbps</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The vast majority of the attack was delivered in the form of User
Datagram Protocol packets. Legitimate UDP-based transmissions are used
in especially time-sensitive communications, such as those for video
playback, gaming applications, and DNS lookups. It speeds up
communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is
transferred. Unlike the more common Transmission Control Protocol, UDP
doesn’t wait for a connection between two computers to be established
through a handshake and doesn’t check whether data is properly received
by the other party. Instead, it immediately sends data from one machine
to another…

a glimpse of their differences, similarities and some insights into what
it takes to support them all. SSLeay It all started with SSLeay. This

<p>One more thing about the linkblog, it no longer cross-posts to social
media sites. I want to see if I miss having the links there. It also
won’t have the limits. Maybe it’ll be better if my accounts are a bit
more quiet. Also the RSS feed is in a new location, I want to wait a bit
to make sure it works before publicizing the URL.</p>

<h2 id="wordcamp-canada-in-october">WordCamp Canada in October</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m keynoting the <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/">WordCamp
Canada</a> conference in October in Ottawa. It’s the first conference
I’ve attended since before the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
The timing is ideal, and the location is significant. As an American, I
don’t want to try to attract people from around the world to a meeting
in my country. Right now, I wouldn’t come here if I didn’t live here.
</p>
<p>
I’m also not happy with the tech industry of the US. I’d like a fresh
start, a return to our roots, with the assumption that the people
control their destiny and the role of developers is to give them to the
tools to try out new ideas.
</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> I’ve created a
product <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">for writers</a>, filling a
need that’s been there since the beginning of the web, using the
practices in writing tools we learned in the 80s. It doesn’t have the
artificial <a href="https://textcasting.org/">limits</a> imposed by
Twitter et al. I think they’re senseless. So we’re going to blow that
door wide open. No character limits. Simple styling. Links. Editable.
</p>
<p>
And it’s also a product for developers. There’s no lock-in anywhere in
this stack. So you can make a different style of editor. Or play with
new ways to view timelines.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to take discourse in a different direction too. A good design
for the social web shouldn’t require intense moderation. The reward for
spammers is practically nil. Also, it’ll be good for small groups in a
way that Twitter et al never have been.
</p>
<p>
So far I haven’t invented any new formats. We’re building on what works
now. WordPress is a remarkably deep product, so deep it could be used as
operating system. and that’s exactly how I’ve chosen to view it and it
works incredibly well. Some of what we’re building on is based on work I
did with Joseph Scott of Automattic in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22joseph%20scott%22">2009</a>,
believe it or not.
</p>
<p>
And as a bonus we get a great bridge into ActivityPub, from the great
work Automattic is doing in bridging WordPress to ActivityPub. Think
about it and you’ll see how connections in and out of WordPress can
facilitate a lot of interop, not just via RSS, but any format that comes
along that people want to use.
</p>
<p>
We’ll have a lot to talk about in October!
</p>

<h2 id="rss-on-a-timeline">RSS on a timeline</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
More on the vision for WordLand and RSS.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is the
editor of a
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22twitter-like%22">twitter-like</a>
system built around
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. It saves your
writing to WordPress, where it is published on a website and via RSS.
You don’t have to use WordLand or WordPress, because RSS is an open
format. <i>Any editor that generates RSS is part of the network.
</i>Designed to be simple.
</p>
<p>
All that’s missing is a timeline viewer, and that’s what I’m working on
now. It’s coming together pretty nicely, imho. Not an easy project,
though on the surface it looks like it should be. Also there’s nothing
proprietary about my timeline viewer. There could be a thousand of them.
Anyone who has written an RSS feed reader will have all the low-level
bits they need.
</p>
<p>
Hoping to have all the connections working by the end of the summer.
</p>
<p>
Once done, it will be the completion of the vision for RSS as the
foundation of the open social web, the place that all the open formats
agree on, so we can get on with interop and say goodbye to lock-in. It
can be done, I’m almost 100 percent sure of that now. Still have a
little ways to go. As they say – <i>still diggin!</i>
