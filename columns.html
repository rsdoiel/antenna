The level or ‘band’ of

you can install any out-of-the-box Linux distributions, as long as they
provide an arm64-compatible installer.

Ubuntu has some of the most complete support for arm64, so I went to
download a Live CD ISO I could flash to a USB stick, to install on my
test Thelio Astra. For server installs (with no GUI), either 4k or 64k

Certificates Coming to Let’s Encrypt</h2>

<p>
Starting
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/11/eoy-letter-2024/">next
year</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our longstanding offering won’t fundamentally change next year, but we
are going to introduce a new offering that’s a big shift from anything
we’ve done before—short-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates
with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of
the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key
compromise event.
</p>
<p>
Because we’ve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade,
most of our subscribers aren’t going to have to do much in order to
switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going
to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as
many certificates as we do now. It’s not inconceivable that at some
point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000
certificates per day…

<p>What if you had a twitter-like system that was embedded in a
ChatGPT-like app. What would you do with that?</p>

journalism I pay attention is labeling itself as <i>truth-based</i> –
but it most definitely is not. When it comes to topics I am expert in,
they tell a mushed up version of extreme points of view, that
(surprise!) favor the continued existence of their jobs. The choice of
the <i>truth-based</i> label is kind of a clue. <span

<p>This post spawned quite a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ldc6fz4sfz2v">thread</a>
on Bluesky: “The AI industry could give us easy tools to build our own
models, from our own archived writing, for private use. This may be a
blind spot. It’s as if when personal computers started, instead of
spreadsheet editors, we were offered great sets of tabulated recalc’ing
data. Fun to watch, maybe useful for researchers, but nothing compared
to the utility of playing ‘what if’ on our own models.”</p>
