<p>Highly recommend this
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81614129">Netflix series</a> –
esp the last three episodes. I found it enlightening, even though I
lived through most of this history, I never saw it all put together in a
series of events over decades. I came out of it with a much clearer
perspective of where we are in the Cold War. It never was over. “The end
of history” was too good to be true. Also glad I read so much about
slavery a few years ago. If you put both these together, you get the
USA, and the deep and lasting wounds we keep re-opening.</p>

One big problem of the economies of the US and the UK is the cult of the
CEO, and the resulting flood of CEO hagiographies that appear after a
surge in their company’s stock price. These aren’t harmless fluff
pieces, they contribute to a CEO mindset that is profoundly destructive
— see
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-5.html">Elon
Musk</a> for one example.
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/14/the-rich-were-led-to-believe-they-were-different-those-days-are-numbered">Will
Hutton writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But decades of being congratulated and indulged for the relentless
pursuit of their own self-interest has turned the heads of too many of
our successful rich. They really believe that they are different: that
they owe little to the society from which they have sprung and in which
they trade, that taxes are for little people. We are lucky to have them,
and, if anything, owe them a favour.

<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/engineering-for-long-term.html">posts</a>
by trying to clarify an aspect of the current Jensen Huang
hagiography.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Ed Zitron’s
must-read <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/"><i>The Shareholder
Supremacy</i></a> traces the idea of the super-hero CEO revealed by a
soaring stock price to:<br />
<blockquote>
the famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co.">Dodge
vs. Ford Motor Co.</a> case that would define — and ultimately doom —
modern capitalism, and in many ways birth the
<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/">growth-at-all-costs
Rot Economy</a>.<br /> <br />
<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dodge-v-ford-motor-co">The Michigan
Supreme Court</a> found that “a business corporation is organized and
carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders [and that] the
powers of the directors are to be employed for that end,” and intimated
that cash surpluses should not be saved to invest in upcoming projects,
but distributed to shareholders, because Ford had shown that it was good
at making money. Ford was directly forbidden from lowering prices and
raising employee salaries, and forced to issue a dividend.<br /> <br />
To be clear, the statement around corporations’ duty toward shareholders
was made “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum">obiter
dicta</a>.” This means it was not actually legally binding, despite over
a hundred years of people acting as if it was.
</blockquote>
Zitron goes on to detail how “Neutron” Jack Welch destroyed General
Electric while being lionized as a super-star CEO. I can testify to his
malign influence because, during my time at Sun Microsystems, Scott
McNealy was seduced by it.<br /> <br /> Now on to the latest CEO whose
soaring stock price has caught the attention of the CEO hagiographers,
Jensen Huang. Don’t get me wrong. I was there when he was a really good
startup CEO, and unlike many others he has grown with the company in a
very impressive way.<br /> <br /> In
<a href="https://spyglass.org/the-envy-of-nvidia/"><i>The Envy of
Everyone</i></a>, M. G. Siegler remarks on:<br />
<blockquote>
this
<a href="https://x.com/mgsiegler/status/1803337041024823348">incredibly
prescient profile</a> of co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang back in 2017 by
Andrew Nusca (in naming him Fortune’s 2017 ‘Businessperson of the
Year’).
</blockquote>
At the time Siegler
<a href="https://x.com/mgsiegler/status/933775680093016064">tweeted</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets
funding huge R&amp;D to solve massive computational problems.”<br />
<br /> Genius foresight. Sounds obvious now. Was not then.
</blockquote>
Siegler was commenting on Andrew Nusca’s 2017 profile entitled
<a href="https://fortune.com/2017/11/16/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang/"><i>This
Man Is Leading an AI Revolution in Silicon Valley—And He’s Just Getting
Started</i></a>. As Huang hagiography goes, it was pretty good. The
quote in the tweet is from Jensen Huang talking about the early
days:<br />
<blockquote>
“We believed this model of computing could solve problems that
general-purpose computing fundamentally couldn’t,” Huang says. “We also
observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most
computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high
sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games
was our killer app—a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge
R&amp;D to solve massive computational problems.”
</blockquote>
I don’t disagree with what Huang said. Despite the need to focus on
gaming, we did have a vague idea that in the future there would be other
application areas in which custom accelerators could make an impact. And
it is true that Nvidia’s VCs, Sutter Hill and Sequoia, gave us the time
to develop a multi-generation architecture rather than rushing out a
“minimum viable product”. I do quibble with the idea that this was
“genius foresight”.<br /> <br />

Even back when I was working with Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky on
Sun’s GX graphics chips the problem we were solving was that the CPU
could not write pixels into the framebuffer fast enough for any kind of
3D application. So a chip, then called a graphics chip but now called a
GPU, was needed between the CPU and the framebuffer capable of
converting a small number of writes from the CPU into a large number of
writes to the framebuffer. Designs faced three major performance
constraints:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The limited bandwidth of the bus carrying instructions from the CPU to
the graphics chip. I wrote about how we addressed this constraint in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/engineering-for-long-term.html"><i>Engineering
For The Long Term</i></a>.
</li>
<li>
The limited write bandwidth of the framebuffer.
</li>
<li>
The limited transistor budget imposed by the chip’s cost target.
</li>
</ul>

Six months after we started Nvidia, we knew of over 30 other companies
all trying to build 3D graphics chips for the PC. They fell into two
groups. Nvidia and a few others were making <i>fixed-function</i>
accelerators, but most were trying to get faster time-to-market by
making <i>programmable</i> accelerators in which the functions were
implemented in software running on a CPU in the graphics chip.<br />
<br /> One problem for the programmable companies was that the
transistors needed to implement the graphic chip’s CPU’s fetch, decode,
execute system were not available to implement the actual graphics
functions, such as matrix multiply. A second problem was that the CPU in
the graphics chip needed to fetch its instructions forming the program
that defined the functions from some memory:<br />
<ul>
<li>
It could fetch them from the system memory that the CPU got its data and
instructions from. That wasn’t a good idea since (a) it required
implementing a DMA engine in the graphics chip, and (b) the DMA engine’s
program fetches would compete for the limited bandwidth of the bus.
</li>
<li>
It could fetch them from a separate program memory private to the
graphic chip. This wasn’t a good idea since it added significant cost,
both for the separate memory itself and also for the extra pins and
complexity of the graphics chip’s extra memory port.
</li>
<li>
It could fetch them from the framebuffer memory. This wasn’t a good idea
since the program fetches would compete with the limited bandwidth of
the framebuffer RAM’s random access port.
</li>
</ul>
The result was that for many product generations from NV1 the winning
graphics chips were all fixed-function. At the time Nvidia was started,
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_having_ordinary_skill_in_the_art">person
having ordinary skill in the art</a> should have understood that
fixed-function accelerator hardware was the way to go. We were not
geniuses.<br /> <br /> Over the years, Moore’s Law gradually relaxed the
constraints, forcing the design choices to be re-evaluated. As we had
expected, the one that relaxed fastest was the transistor budget. The
obvious way for the accelerator to exploit the extra transistors was to
perform functions in parallel. For parallel applications such as
graphics this increased the accelerator advantage over the CPU. But
equally important in the competitive market for graphics chips, it sped
up the design by making the chip an assembly of many identical
units.<br /> <br /> The constraints continued to relax. In 2001 Nvidia
had enough transistors and bandwidth to release the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_3_series">GeForce 3
series</a> with programmable pixel and vertex shaders. Eventually,
various non-graphics communities figured out how to use the increasing
programmability of Nvidia’s GPUs to accelerate their parallel
applications, and Nvidia seized the opportunity to create a software
platform with the 2007 release of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a>. By greatly
simplifying the development of massively parallel applications for
Nvidia GPUs, CUDA drove their adoption in many fields, AI being just the
latest.<br /> <br />

The Huang hagiography’s focus on Nvidia’s current stock price is
misplaced and ahistorical. It is notoriously volatile. Look at the log
plot of the stock price since the IPO. I count eight drops of 45% or
more in 25 years, that’s average of about one every three years. One of
the questions I asked when interviewing Chris Malachowsky for the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/04/the-50th-asilomar-microcomputer-workshop.html">50<sup>th</sup>
Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop</a> was approximately “how do you manage
a company with this much volatility?” His answer was, in effect, “you
learn to ignore it”.<br /> <br />

In September 2023, I published

$200B Question</a>. The goal of the piece was to ask the question:
“Where is all the revenue?” <br /> <br /> At that time, I noticed a big
gap between the revenue expectations implied by the AI infrastructure
build-out, and actual revenue growth in the AI ecosystem, which is also
a proxy for end-user value. I described this as a <i>“$125B hole that
needs to be filled for each year of CapEx at today’s levels.” </i><br />
…<br /> The $125B hole is now a $500B hole: In the last analysis, I
generously assumed that each of Google, Microsoft, Apple and Meta will
be able to generate $10B annually from new AI-related revenue. I also
assumed $5B in new AI revenue for each of Oracle, ByteDance, Alibaba,
Tencent, X, and Tesla. Even if this remains true and we add a few more
companies to the list, the $125B hole is now going to become a $500B
hole.

Tech giants and beyond are set to spend over $1tn on AI capex in coming

pay off? MIT’s Daron Acemoglu and GS’ Jim Covello are skeptical, with
Acemoglu seeing only limited US economic upside from AI over the next
decade and Covello arguing that the technology isn’t designed to solve
the complex problems that would justify the costs, which may not decline
as many expect.

<p><br /> Mr. Market will do what Mr. Market does, the stock price isn’t
under Huang’s control. The things that are under Huang’s control are the
operating profit margin (53%), revenues ($26B/quarter), and the
company’s incredible efficiency. Nvidia’s peers in the $2-3T market cap
range have between 5 and 7 times as many employees. As Huang says,
Nvidia is the smallest big company.<br /> <br /></p>

<h1 id="2024-07-16-what-s-the-minimal-nncp-setup-to-get-started">
2024-07-16 What’s the minimal NNCP setup to get started?
</h1>
<p>
This page is for you if you are curious about NNCP and you don’t know
how to get started. It contains instructions on how to set up your
laptop such that it can exchange files with my laptop (melanobombus) via
my server (sibirocobombus).
</p>
<p>
Before testing it, you need to send me an email with some info but we’ll
get to that.
</p>
<p>
First, switch to the root user. Everything will be easier that way.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo su
</code></pre>
<p>
The instructions are going to assume a Debian system.
</p>
<p>
First, install the <code>nncp</code> package.
</p>
<pre><code>apt install nncp
</code></pre>
<p>
Generate a new <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file and secure it:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>
<p>
You need to add my server to your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file, in
the <code>neigh</code> section.
</p>
<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       CCAIPFSAZWYICBQ5BIURX4UMEJIXVSZFIING7HRUFTDOFV5XISVQ
      exchpub:  NGEIDPDVZ2I6CTRKCBT734VV4W2YFVTV6YFBU5UGB6IHBA3QDJUQ
      signpub:  VXBMWXS74IGAYQCLJY4UPAXXQXPT3K53QI5XCFHOAKL4I2FQNLKQ
      noisepub: MGGBAOHRHEWEC6CGT47GA2DOQXQFZUAKJ66PD734Y5WNWP364UXQ
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;@daily&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
What does it mean?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you know how to contact my server via the <code>.addrs.internet</code>
key – you need this, but you can specify <code>campaignwiki.org</code>
instead, if your prefer
</li>
<li>
you connect to my server every now and then via the
<code>calls[0].cron</code> entry – this is not necessary if you don’t
mind using <code>nncp-call</code> every now and then
</li>
</ol>
<p>
My laptop can only be reached via my server. You need to add it as well.
</p>
<p>
As far as the <code>melanobombus.incoming</code> key goes, pick a
suitable directory that your regular account has access to.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       R23WEIHB52TMA4EKGJPKUDBFSYP2HG4HHW2HGJ3RJATCCRLYDUZQ
      exchpub:  EGP2MMLQJQUKWTHI22JTIRMR2UV3BA2ATE3AYLVOFODMTNRGAMEA
      signpub:  YO6SZXVEIU77OQQRKMAUFUT4V3NJER4U7LQE5JI7JORJXKXY5FBA
      noisepub: 6ECO4WXJNDED6WHJ6SM2HGRQMUO75X65ALT2YRKZ3YGGBDXRNV4A
      via:      [&quot;sibirocobombus&quot;]
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/melanobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        rsmtp:  [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;, &quot;-bS&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
What does it mean?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you know how to contact my laptop via my server using the
<code>.via[0]</code> key – you need this and the name needs to match the
name you used for my server
</li>
<li>
you allow my laptop to save incoming files in a directory via the
<code>.incoming</code> key – you only need this if you want to receive
files (the directory must exist and the <code>nncp</code> group must be
allowed to write to it)
</li>
<li>
you allow my laptop to send mail to local users via the
<code>.exec.rsmtp</code> key – this is not necessary if you don’t want
to receive mail
</li>
</ol>
<p>
You would create the directory as follows. I’m assuming that
<code>$SUDO_USER</code> is your actual username so I’ll use that instead
of “alex”.
</p>
<pre><code>dir=&quot;/home/$SUDO_USER/incoming/melanobombus&quot;
mkdir --parents &quot;$dir&quot;
chown $SUDO_USER:nncp &quot;$dir&quot;
chmod g+w &quot;$dir&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
You need to send me your system’s public keys from the
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file so that I can set up similar entries
on my laptop and my server.
</p>
<p>
Once I’ve added your public keys to my server, we can test it.
</p>
<p>
My server will not call you, since it doesn’t know your Internet
address. It waits for you to call it both when you want to send or when
you want to receive something. You would do this as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
Otherwise, the <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="daily">@daily</span></code> entry in the
<code>sibirocobombus.cron[0]</code> entry of your
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file will call my server once a day, at
midnight.
</p>
<p>
To send me a README file, you’d run:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-file README melanobombus:
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z Tx README 486 B/486 B 100% (73 KiB/sec)
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z File README (282 B) is sent to melanobombus:README
</code></pre>
<p>
At this point, the file is in the queue.
</p>
<p>
You need to to call my server using <code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call
sibirocobombus</code> to actually send the files or you’ll have to wait
for the cron job. My server will receive the packets encrypted and
addressed to my laptop and enqueue them again. The next time my laptop
calls my server, it’ll get them.
</p>
<p>
You probably want to let me know about the channel via another channel,
be it IRC, regular mail!

<h2 id="the-dark-net">2024-07-16 The Dark Net</h2>

<h1 id="2024-07-16-the-dark-net">
2024-07-16 The Dark Net
</h1>
<p>
I haven’t read The Dark Forest but I read a few blog posts about it.
What really got me interested, however, was
<a href="https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/">The
Dark Forest Theory of the Internet</a> by Yancey Strickler in 2019:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other
predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the
internet, and away from the mainstream. – Yancey Strickler
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I often think of where the world is headed, politically. I’m a doomer at
heart.
</p>
<p>
As part of that, I think about the Internet in a few decades. In the
worst case, the public Internet is gone. An alternative that is slightly
less bad is that governments will have discovered that blocking at the
level of the national Domain Name System (DNS) won’t work because it’s
easy to circumvent using alternative name servers. And so, slowly at
first but then ever faster, from the top down, people will think that
perhaps the Great Firewall is cool: for the children, against porn,
against spam, against vandalism, to fight tax evasion, to fight
terrorism, you know the deal. And yes, even to fight fascism. So many
people are telling me that we should ban Telegram, for example.
</p>
<p>
I’m honestly not sure what to recommend. Is the free press our problem?
I don’t think so. It’s the incentives and the power imbalances that are
a problem. Rich people pay other people to create companies, to buy
companies, to sponsor some programs and to cancel others, and slowly the
landscape changes. Big corporations buy small ones. Rich people buy
failing ones. The prime example here in Switzerland is how the Weltwoche
was bought by billionaires and handed to somebody who supports a flat
tax, who supports the ban on minarets, who supports supports tax evasion
abroad, who supports anti-refugee policies… all of it legal, of course,
but these laws are nauseating. The same pattern can be seen in how the
state tries to support media diversity and still the big publishers
manage to profit the most. The same pattern can be seen in how the right
wing parties fight against state radio and state TV.
</p>
<p>
So what I recommend is to not go dark. Have friends. Have social media.
But be aware that our time might be short. We might have to build the
infrastructure while we can. Those of us who can should build for the
rest of us who have other things on their mind. We should build this to
be as easy to use as possible. We should build this so that we can
detach from the public Internet and it will still work.
</p>
<p>
The sneaker-net will be back. They will call it the dark net but to me,
it will forever be friends meeting in a place, with mass storage in our
backpacks (at the time) or in our pockets, exchanging stuff. And even if
this future is not great at all, we need that alternative. How else will
our future selves and our children organize? And even if it turns out to
be unnecessary because we keep riding that wild horse of freedom,
forever teetering at the brink of fascism, alternative needs to be there
to keep the next level of services in line. I still believe that the
availability and ubiquity of bit-torrent is what keeps the prices of
streaming services down. It’s the threat of piracy that keeps the
official channels honest. Because we can always go back. The
infrastructure is still around. The software is still around.
</p>
<p>
This is why I’m interested in
<a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@jgoerzen" title="@jgoerzen@floss.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jgoerzen">@jgoerzen</span></a>’s
<a href="https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10231-recovering-our-lost-free-will-online-tools-and-techniques-that-are-available-now">Recovering
Our Lost Free Will Online: Tools and Techniques That Are Available
Now</a>. In my case, the thing I’m most interested in is NNCP.
</p>
<p>
NNCP allows us to connect all services that can be made to work with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_and_forward">store and
forward</a> architecture. The simplest and oldest protocols in this
respect are mail and file copying, and services built on top of that,
such as net news. These services grew big with UUCP, the precursor to
NNCP. Store-and-forward precludes the kind of interactive applications
many of us are used to. Instead, it’s a bit like a library or a book
store: you order a book and at some point you get the book. There is a
delay. The postal system works the same way: write a letter and send it
off, wait for some days, maybe get a reply back. Basically, anything
that can be imagined as requesting something and getting back a reply
after some time can be implemented using store-and-forward architecture.
</p>
<p>
If you think of the web as serving static documents, it can be made to
work. Imagine reading Wikipedia via email: you send the URL via email to
a service, and some time later you get back an email with the response.
Soon we would be thinking of extensions to this. What if the response
returned an archive of the page requested, all the images it includes,
and the same for all the Wikipedia content pages it links to? Fewer
visits to the library, so to say! It would be much harder to do the same
thing using traditional social media because the web sites are more like
web apps. There are a gazillion ways to view things: in a time line (or
multiple time lines!), on a profile (so many profiles!), in threads, in
search results, and so on. If every click on a button requires a trip
that can take many days, it’s doesn’t work. Instead, such social media
sites must be restructured to work a bit like net news: new posts
satisfying some filters are sent in regular updates and your local
client rearranges the, filters them, searches them.
</p>
<p>
All of this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking">delay-tolerant
networking</a> is possible with Unix to Unix Copy
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">UUCP</a>). What Node to
Node Copy (<a href="http://www.nncpgo.org/">NNCP</a>) adds is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">end-to-end
encryption</a> (in a multi-hop setup the packets remain encrypted so the
carrier cannot read them) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing">onion routing</a>
(in a multi-hop setup the carrier doesn’t know where the packet is
originally from or where the packet is going to end up). And with that,
the sneaker-net is back. You can imagine a low-tech future where most of
the last miles are burned, the copper stolen and repurposed, the optical
fibre no longer functional, and a service springs up where the post or
some other courier is used to send USB sticks and SD cards from
community to community in order to exchange letters, reports, movies,
pictures, music, and so on. Or if the government is monitoring the
airwaves and declaring mesh networks illegal or taking over the mesh
networks (like Cuba’s Street Network,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Cuba#SNET">SNET</a>),
we’ll have to rely on USB sticks and SD cards, too.
</p>
<p>
This is where we’re getting back to the Dark Forest. I don’t have an
answer to that. It’s a bit like members-only bit-torrent sites. Do you
trust them? Do they trust you? How are you going to learn about the
trustworthy ones?
</p>
<p>
In order to learn more, to be prepared, to think things through, I want
to experiment with the technology. I want to see what can be done, run
into the issues, pick the low hanging fruits. Play with the technology
before we really need it.
</p>
<p>
I remember audio cassettes being sent back and forth as a kid when we
were living in South-West Africa (back before they finally got their
freedom and renamed the country to Namibia) and my grandparents were
living in Austria. Phone calls were very expensive. So the family sat
around a tape recorder, each of us speaking in turn, saying something,
and weeks later, all of us gathering again, listening to the replies.
</p>
<p>
Using images like these virtual, delay-tolerant family gatherings worked
long before I knew anything at all about computers.

problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance">JD
Vance</a> is that he’s empty inside, he’ll be whatever he needs to be to
get more power, and he’s young. He’s as empty as Trump, and much
younger, so we can’t hope to outwait him. Now we have a real problem,
because Trump has a successor. I imagine Trump’s sons probably aren’t
happy about this. Had he picked
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio">Little Marco</a>, no
one would mistake him as an heir, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum">Doug Burgum</a> who
is a bit too old to be an heir (same age as I am). We <i>do</i> have a
problem with Biden, he hasn’t prepared for this moment. Old or not, they
had 3.5 years to get ready, and they didn’t. As I wrote
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a124845">yesterday</a>,
the biggest most important thing is that we <b>organize ourselves.</b>
That’s the best defense all around. Every attempt to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_(enclosure)">corral</a> the
insurrection has been either non-existent or overwhelmingly inadequate.
Trump should be out of the picture, and for a while it seemed as if he
was getting there, but now he’s back, and probably a bigger threat than
ever. I don’t think replacing Biden is anywhere near enough. We need
leadership. Not wait to be led. We’ve waited too long. People who appear
ready to step up – AOC, Bernie Sanders. Who else? I wouldn’t put Obama
on that list, he tried to welcome Trump, even let him have his Supreme
Court pick, just to be a nice guy. We are not going to prevail by being
nice, unfortunately. We’re also not going to prevail by each of us
taking care of Number One. We have to work together. Organize and work
together. Those ought to be our mantras until we achieve them.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I submitted an entry for the One Page Dungeon Contest. Since I would
like the dungeons to be close to the prep I do for my own games so that
I feel like I belong to a community of referees that spends a similar
amount of time for their adventures I took some of my (German) prep
notes, cleaned them up and added some text boxes using Inskape and
decided against spending time on polishing it up.
</p>
<p>
At the time, my players had a hard time getting past the gate.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-08-22_Hammond_verfolgt_den_Orkzug">2023-08-22
Hammond verfolgt den Orkzug</a> is when a player tracked a group of orcs
as they reinforced the existing orc lair
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-09-20_Das_Endes_des_Balrogs">2023-09-20
Das Endes des Balrogs</a> was the first attempt at taking the lair in
which they faced the fire demon and hell hounds
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-09-26_Der_Kampf_auf_den_Galerien_von_Grosshammer">2023-09-26
Der Kampf auf den Galerien von Grosshammer</a>, this is where they found
a back entrance
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Result:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/pdfs/Orc_Halls_by_Alex_Schroeder_2.pdf">Orc Halls by Alex
Schroeder</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At the time I had a second 10-headed hydra, too…
</p>
<p>
The boss orcs had 3, 5 and 7 hit dice.
</p>
<p>
And later, when the players had killed all the orcs, a bunch of goblins
led by one Eye Poker resettled the halls.
</p>
<p>
These are the stats I would use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>orcs</strong> HD 1 AC 6 1d6 F1 MV 12 ML 8 XP 100</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Grishg</strong> HD 3 AC 6 1d6 F3 MV 12 ML 8 XP 300; with
<em>gauntlets of max strength</em> granting +3; under the influence of
the demon
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shagdog</strong> HD 5 AC 6 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 8 XP 500; lightning
bolt 1×/day for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; very loyal to Maufimbul
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ashuak</strong> HD 5 AC 3 1d6 F5 MV 6 ML 9 XP 500; willing to
buy freedom and leave
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maufimbul</strong> HD 7 AC 3 1d6 F7 MV 6 ML 9 XP 700; wielding
<em>Fur Hunter</em> +1/+3 vs. mammals; traditionalist spear dancer
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>boars</strong> HD 3+1 AC 6 1d8 F1 MV 15 ML 9 XP 300
</li>
<li>
<strong>hell hounds</strong> HD 5 AC 4 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; fire
2/6 for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; see invisible (that pack of hell
hounds is also the random encounter)
</li>
<li>
<strong>small pyrohydra</strong> HD 5 (40hp, 8hp per head) AC 5 1d10 per
head F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; regrowing heads (unless cauterized with fire
or ice, up to 7 more heads may grow, one per round, each with 8 hp);
fire breath 3×/day: deal as much damage as it has hit-points left, save
vs. breath for half; poisonous blood: when cutting off a head in melee,
save vs. poison or die; immune to fire and poison
</li>
<li>
<strong>fire demon</strong> HD 9+1 AC 4 1d6/2d6 F20 MV 12 ML 11; flying;
aura of fire 1d6 (everybody within 10 ft); when the first attack with
the flaming whip hits, the second attack with the flaming sword is at
+4; only harmed by magic and magical weapons; immune to fire (the
flaming whip and the flaming sword are two magic items that can be taken
from the demon)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Clearly, the pyrohydra is the worst if you fight it without multiple
lightning bolts or the like.
</p>
<p>
As for intelligent monsters, I figured that it would be possible to
somehow sneak in and overhear orcs talk about the four bosses. If
somebody wanted to, the power dynamic could be exploited. As it turned
out, though, my players tried to force the front gate with sleep spells,
alerted the guards, which brought on the fire demon and all the hell
hounds. The enemies were destroyed but the party had to retreat. Next
time, the party found the outlook, sent up a ranger with dark vision and
a magic item that could charm humanoids. He killed the four orc guards,
climbed down the netting into the cavern, found the way to the shooting
gallery, started killing all the orcs and that was the signal the others
needed to begin the race down the the long stairs. At the bottom, the
orcs had cajoled a ten-headed pyrohydra into the Merchant Hall but it
died in the first round after being hit by lightning bolts and other
spells.
</p>
<p>
The treasure map to the Cistern of Sulphur does not contain any new
monsters or traps; it’s not a new lair or dungeon. It’s part of the
treasure gained here so all it takes is a one day trip up the mountains
to that sulphur cavern. The only risk involved is random encounters.

political polarization to suggest that Trump is a danger to our
democracy, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump
in the last days of his presidency, dismissed the classified documents
case against the former president. She wrote that “Special Counsel

<p>Friends, J.D. Vance — Trump’s choice for vice president — said in a
social media post on Saturday that the attempted assassination of Trump
was “not some isolated incident” and suggested Biden’s campaign was to
blame. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President
Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all
costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted
assassination.”</p>

same as

Focus our attention on each product (ie climate change, social security,
Ukraine, etc), so the ideas don’t get missed, and we can network in
support of the initiative. This is all part of the idea of having a
<i>democratic.party</i> website that we call call home for our political
organizing. None of this pissing in the wind we do on twitter-like
systems. Form buddy groups of people we organize with, based on locality
or common interests. Organize the people as well as the billionaires are
organized. This is what political parties should be in 2024 for crying
out loud. We’re missing the point of the mess in our politics. It’s all
a mess because it needs to be organized and it’s not. Maybe I should
take everything else off my blog now so I can use what little attention
I have been able to gather here to focus on this idea.</p>

organization should do instead of not do. Flip the sense of the rule in
other words.

Then we feed those rules to an AI.

<p>
Then we flow in the news stories of the day from various sites through
the same AI for translation. Yes I know they’d complain

<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>,
arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody
else, including spam and binaries. I agree with all the points made. The
idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying
all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall
of Usenet.
</p>
<p>
Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other
servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just
want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a
different net.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UUCP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to
have a username and password.
</li>
<li>
NNTP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on
IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.
</li>
<li>
Servers don’t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in
what they accept and in what they pass on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spam problem arises when two systems “trust” each other and peer
messages but one of the systems doesn’t act on abuse and moderation
reports. Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system
administrators so they stopped following up on those reports. Perhaps
some servers had become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances seem
too big to defederate from.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up on
an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post
shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users
that I don’t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me. I
can block them all individually or block the large instance including my
small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet. It was the lack of moderation that
killed Usenet. It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able
to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant. In the end, to all these
people federation was not as important as moderation.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with
people that needed moderation. This is a problem on all platforms with
groups, e.g. Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their
niches. At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again. IRC,
Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and
self-moderation was viable.
</p>
<p>
This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of
federation are the most important quality of a platform.
</p>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.

<strong>2024-07-04</strong>. I got a long reply by
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span

its entirety below.

<p>
Ah, that’s not a super new post, it’s from September 2023. I dug it out
again since we were talking about Illuminant, which seems awesome. It
uses hashtags only as post keywords and instead, if I understand things
correctly, relies on FEP-1b12 to provide group support.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not quite the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s a bad thing that I’ve being hesitant to defederate from m.soc
even though I get more spam from it over Fedi than I’ve been getting
from email fro the past several years.
</p>
<p>
But I’m still only getting individual posts from m.soc or any other
server. (Which is also why hashtags don’t work the way people think.)
</p>
<p>
On Usenet, the typical behavior would be to carry the whole thing.
Currently, I get dozens of spam messages from m.soc. If I were to mirror
the whole thing (which is possible with AP relays, and is what would be
necessary for hashtags to work like channels, me mirroring the entirety
of all the non-banned servers), I’d have to deal with thousands of
messages. My server would croak.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But again something that was way worse with usenet because on
there, not only would I mirror or moderate abusive replies to me. I had
to mirror abusive replies to <em>everybody</em>.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I’m, for the most part, glad that the servers-that-can-comment
aren’t allowlisted, that it works like email, that I can get comments
from anyone. The downside of that is having to ban ban ban like crazy,
but if it didn’t work like that I’m not sure it even would be federated.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

my small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But on Usenet, <em>every</em> instance was too big to ban
since every instance was expected to carry everything.
</p>
<p>
Individual blocks is one way around it. That’s why I, a small instance
op, while I’ve banned many small mainly-abuse instances, my need to ban
the big sloppily moderated silos like m.soc or threads is a li’l lower
since I don’t have hundreds of users to protect, which a midsize
instance would have. I can absolutely see why midsize “safe space”
instances would ban m.soc for example.
</p>
<p>
Also I “silence” every instance since I don’t have a “whole known
network” tab.
</p>
<p>
Killfiles was a user-level way to mute users on newsgroups. So there was
<em>some</em> mitigation, but Fedi additionally has several other
moderation tools like instance bans or silencing.
</p>
<p>
More fundamentally: ActivityPub is about sending individual posts.
Usenet was about mirroring entire servers. Those two are not the same.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The context that I wrote that Usenet post last September was to rant
about hashtags. (A topic that I’m gonna return to every now and then
until the group/tag situation gets a li’l better, which might require
new UX affordances or perhaps only education.)
</p>
<p>
That problem, summarized:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Servers can only show you the posts that it has already stumbled over,
through following or commenting
</li>
<li>
So when you browse a hashtag, you only see a very small subset of those
posts
</li>
<li>
Which is fine for organizing a handful of persons posts, like “I wanna
see all of Marie’s <code>#tidying</code> posts” or “I wanna go back and
take a look at all of my already-followed-friends
<code>#mosstodon</code> posts” or even for filtering out stuff. I.e.
it’s OK as a tool for <em>subsets</em> and <em>intersection</em>
</li>
<li>
It’s a disaster for <em>union</em>, for discovery, for “emulating
channels” which people are used to from Tumblr and Twitter, which worked
there since those are centralized
</li>
<li>
For hashtags to work the way people expect them to, servers would have
to mirror all posts. Like on Usenet.
</li>
<li>
There was an effort in that direction early on, with the “relay” system.
</li>
<li>
But small servers would croak. <strong>That’s</strong> the problem. It’d
be an environmental waste heap.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And that’s absolutely a protocol level problem!
</p>
<p>
A protocol level problem that Usenet had even without hashtags. (Well,
there was one hashtag: Kibo.)
</p>
<p>
I’ve said a couple of times that servers mirror each other and for the
sticklers in the audience I’ve got to add that not literally
<em>every</em> server carried <em>every</em> group. For example, some
didn’t carry Anarchists Lunatics Terrorists a.k.a. the <code>alt</code>
hierarchy. But that’s the fundamental intended flow. Group mirroring.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg" alt="Usenet
architecture" />
</p>
<p>
So in that way, Usenet is unlike mailing lists, where individual
messages are sent to individual users. FEP-1b12 group servers on Fedi
(like PieFed and MBin) are awesome because they get the best of both
worlds of the “only send the relevant posts” nature of mailing lists,
and the “we’re hosting this post anyway so we only need to store it once
in the SQL” nature of Usenet. As long as one user on a Lemmy server is
subscribed to <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="garderning">@garderning</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="foo.bar">@foo.bar</span></code>, like an email user might be
subscribed to a mailing list, it might-as-well display a copy of that
group since it’s getting those messages anyway. It’s not perfect and
we’re still paying a hefty “decentralization tax”, but it’s more robust
than mail and news.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet. It was the ease of
setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made Usenet
irrelevant.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Naw, Usenet kept puttering along after that, for a while, until the cost
(and legal danger) of mirroring huge binaries archives which was the
nail of nails. And that was a protocol level issue.
</p>
<p>
Fedi absolutely has a moderation problem. That is being addressed
although it seems to me that there are still unsolved problems.<br>
Usenet had a much bigger moderation problem and much of the reason for
that was on the protocol level. We have instances and instance bans to
help moderate clusters of users where each instance op helps moderate
the users on their instance. Moderation is happening on a user level
which makes much more sense than on a group level. (Someone can be a
saint on <code>alt.suicide.holiday</code> but a jerk on
<code>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</code> for example.)
</p>
<p>
But Usenet also has a scalability problem. Resource use. Better
moderation wouldn’t be nearly enough to fix that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Email can’t moderate their users since email isn’t supposed to be
world-readable. (With exceptions like mailing lists; we can ban someone
who sends abusive messages to those.) But even so, instance banning is
very common on email.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Last time I talked about this I got the world’s most stubborn reply guy
on my neck who (since he was on a huge instance) could use hashtags to
find at least some amount of interesting posts and was resistant to
change. Since I mentioned scalability issues and how my server would
croak if it were to try to mirror even <em>one</em> of the big
instances, he started going on and on about “scalability is only for
capitalists”.
</p>
<p>
Yet another case of Smolnet Wishful Thinking Syndrome. The kind of
thinking that hates Eternal September more than anything but keeps
designing protocols that lead to more Eternal Septembers since they’re
about everyone-seeing-everyone and then they resort to technical
gatekeeping or even bullying to keep people out. Not into it.
</p>
<p>
My criticism of Usenet’s protocol here has nothing to do with capitalist
scaling, which is about “throwing computers at it”. Sure, that’d be one
solution to the protocol problems inherent to Usenet and
relay-laden-ActivityPub.
</p>
<p>
Real Smolnet scaling is about designing protocols that are about
connecting people to people (and to topic groups or other communities),
and in a non-wasteful, mottainai way create small overlapping villages
instead of one big shout-loud-and-go-viral channel.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of protocols. Those where everyone must see
everything (like Antenna and CAPCOM, and Twitter), and those where
that’s not the case (like ActivityPub and email).
</p>
<p>
Here are three network layouts:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/baran_networks.png" alt="Baran networks" />
</p>
<p>
First we have a centralized network. One hub server and then every
client is a spoke connected to that center core. The most efficient way
to organize an “everyone-must-see-everything” protocol, but vulnerable
to disasters like meteor strikes, nuclear explosions, billionaire
takeovers, or earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
Then we have a decentralized network. Several hubs connected to each
other, mirroring each other. Usenet worked like that. The hubs need to
be just as beefy as the ones in a centralized network. This has some
advantages like redundancy and robustnesss, and it’s more politically
appealing to the anarchists that built the internet. (Not sure why since
there’s still two tiers and a mod group that rules everything for
everyone.) It can be wasteful. It can handle
everyone-must-see-everything protocols. It can also really shine when
everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see everything, like IRC which is
super efficient. IRC is a brilliant protocol design that, like a mailing
list, only sends the messages to a server that that server needs.
</p>
<p>
Finally we have a distributed network. No hubs. It looks more like a
mesh where every machine is connected to only a handful of “nearby”
machines. This type of network is an absolute disaster for the
everyone-must-see-everything scenario! Redundant to the point of
wastefulness. That’s a future we must fight tooth and nail! And that’s
exactly where the relay-centered version of ActivityPub was headed, and
that’s what would be “needed” for hashtags-as-groups-and-discovery to
“work”.
</p>
<p>
Here’s where we the grassroots federalized ancom degrowth community need
to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves because even though
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/energy-is-undercosted" title="Energy is undercosted">energy
and e-waste is underpriced</a>, a capitalist for-profit silo company
would never in a million years set up a system like this because it’s
too wasteful ever for them, while we’re liable to do so since each
instance op only sees their <em>own</em> costs, not the cost for the
network as a whole. The megacorps are OK with centralization because for
them, the power consolidation in the first two network types is a
positive, while for us it’s a huge negative so we’re drawn to the third
type, so we need to be really careful and really responsible here.
</p>
<p>
But as bad as this layout is for everyone-must-see-everything, it’s
really awesome for protocols where everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see
everything. It’s economical, robust, cozy. ActivityPub (without the
relentless mirroring) is a good fit here. I can follow a handful of
users and be connected to their instances and only their posts are sent
to my instance, I don’t mirror the entire server. It’s actually pretty
awesome! It’s good for moderation too because I only need to moderate my
“neighborhood”. Yeah, a “neighborhood” is the perfect analogy for this;
neighborhoods that can and overlap but are still small and managed. A
system set up like that can remain smol and cozy even as it invites
everyone on Earth. It’s great. ActivityPub is awesome.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-08</strong>. I got a reply from
<a href="https://koldfront.dk/">Adam Sjøgren</a> regarding Sandra’s
comment on hashtag use in
<a href="https://illuminant.asjo.org/">Illuminant</a>.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
⁂
</div>
<p>
ActivityPub hashtags are translated to Keywords: and vice versa in
Illuminant. So far I haven’t had the need to use hashtags/keywords for
more than showing/writing them in Keywords: - I did have a plan to have
groups like fediverse.keyword.music, fediverse.keyword.askfedi etc. etc.
but I haven’t implemented it.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry to say that I do not know what FEP-1b12 is, so I don’t think
Illuminant implements any of the group support defined in that.
</p>
<p>
Since Illuminant is very much driven by what I personally want and feel
like implementing/have the energy to implement, it has a kind of skewed
subset of what I guess is expected from a fediverse server/user
interface by most…
</p>
<p>
While it is fun for me to hear somebody call Illuminant awesome, I must
say that I’m pretty sure there is only one person in the universe who
actually runs it. Being proven wrong would be awesome, though.

<p>Friends, I want to ask you, candidly: How are you doing? The last two
weeks — beginning with the Biden-Trump debate when Biden looked and
sounded even older than his years and Trump lied even more than usual,
followed by the Democrats’ public agonizing over whether Biden should
drop out, and then Saturday’s attempted assassination of Trump at a

<p>Shortly after 6:00 yesterday evening at a Trump rally in Butler,
Pennsylvania, a shooter on the roof of a building about 400 feet from
the stage appears to have shot eight bullets at the former president and
into the crowd. Trump appeared to flinch and reach for his right ear as
Secret Service agents crouched over the former president. When the
agents got word the shooter was “down,” they lifted Trump to move him
out. He asked to get his shoes and then to put them on.</p>

2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux
</h1>
<p>
On the last day, we decided to go for a walk nearby instead of getting
on the train immediately. We took the train to Yvonand and turned
towards the hills, spending most of our time in the forest. This is
<a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-129">route
129</a>.
</p>
<p>
When leaving the fields around Yvonand and entering the woods, the
autobahn arches high above. If only it were a fantastic train and not a
triumph for car culture.
</p>
<p>

This bridge marks the beginning of the way up, if I remember.

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Once you leave the forest, you’re on the plateau above. We ate lunch at
the Hotel de Ville in Chavannes-le-Chêne.

BTW, I’m intermittently locked out of my
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a>
account.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They
say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don’t explain. I don’t
have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried
changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network,
it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no
energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don’t see me over
there, this is why.

<p>
How I found out about Trump’s assassination. By accident, I was watching
CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few
minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to
season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of
Duty</a>, which isn’t very great. I couldn’t focus on the show. I got my
iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting
that <i>he</i> hadn’t been killed, and somehow I knew that “he” was
Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump
asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his
fist, looking right into the camera. He’s 100 percent television actor.
Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn’t
cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed
killing him. He’s thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my
first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies
about being a victim, really is a victim, and we’ll never hear the end
of it. And it didn’t take long before a random Republican asshole was
saying this was Biden’s fault for saying Trump would end democracy,
which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do
it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the
temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides.
It didn’t take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate.
This was Biden’s fault they all agree. Occam’s Razor says this is over.
We aren’t going to vote in November. The deal is done because the
journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I’ve
yet to hear another explanation from them.
</p>
<p>
If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph,
they’d nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That’s how our
journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the
dictator. This is what it’s like after that happened. People inside big
companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize.
Now their malaise becomes ours.
</p>
<p>
BTW, if Biden steps aside don’t expect the Repubs won’t sue saying it’s
illegal, so guess what – not only don’t you get Biden, you don’t even
get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with
just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for
appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the
arguments already written.

<p>This is on my bucket list to see performed live, but the closeup
shots in this are fun to see how different sounds are produced. I love
watching the musicians get into it — the bass player was really going to
town. The coordination of dozens of people to play complex music
together is one […]</p>

<p>As Maine writer E. B. White famously wrote to a man who said he had
lost faith in humanity: “Hang on to your hat. Hang on to your hope. And
wind the clock, for tomorrow is another day.” I’ll see you all then. —

<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>Friends, My first thought on hearing about the attempted shooting of
Donald Trump at a rally today in Pennsylvania was “I hope to god he’s
okay.” I thought this for the usual reasons we human beings hope that
other humans are safe from harm. But I had another reason in the case of
Donald Trump.</p>
