theorized why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack
Dorsey</a> is disappointed with Bluesky
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">on
Bluesky</a>. I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly
personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he’s a
human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and
I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or
bad. If my
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">theory</a>
is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it’s a valid point, Bluesky
was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The
more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with
being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did.
Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform
as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about,
basically making a global object storage system with real financial
backing, we’d be much further along with the web as an operating system.
We’re paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I
don’t understand. We should start having a public discussion about this.
It can’t hurt to talk about what-if’s instead of barrelling down the
same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00’s. I’ve been writing
about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let’s
start talking about how we break out, because it’s not going to “just
happen” organically.</p>

<p>I look forward to the day when I can link to a topic I’ve written
about on my blog without having to depend on Google. I don’t think they
know I have a blog or have any respect for it. Actually I know they
don’t have any respect for it. That’s why depending on them for access

Developers Targeted with Malware During Fake Job Interviews</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting social engineering attack: luring potential job applicants
with fake recruiting pitches, trying to
<a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/fake-recruiter-coding-tests-target-devs-with-malicious-python-packages">convince
them</a> to download malware. From a

article</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
These particular attacks from North Korean state-funded hacking team
Lazarus Group are new, but the overall malware campaign against the
Python development community has been running since at least August of
2023, when a number of popular open source Python tools were maliciously
duplicated with added malware. Now, though, there are also attacks
involving “coding tests” that only exist to get the end user to install
hidden malware on their system (cleverly hidden with Base64 encoding)
that allows remote execution once present. The capacity for exploitation
at that point is pretty much unlimited, due to the flexibility of Python
and how it interacts with the underlying OS…

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)">The
Bear</a> and am now totally thinking of my job as a chef. I started out
that way 40+ years ago, and somewhere along the line I stopped thinking
that way. If you can, watch
<a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-bear/video-extras/video/64beaaa830c49e0001e758d8">S02
E07</a> to see what I mean. It’s about service, the connection between
the staff and the people who come to eat, and the medium is the food.
It’s the same idea. There’s so much cynicism around tech, and I hate
that. We’ve rarely seen it as a human thing both by the people who make
the meals and the people who love great food. The world thinks of it as
billionaires and influencers and lying fascist politicians. But it
should be much more than that.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads,
Twitter, WordPress and RSS.
</p>
<p>
Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">The RSS feed</a>
is doing a lot of the work.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Links from the RSS feed show up on my
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links page</a> and in the
<a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emails</a>.
</li>
<li>
The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through
micro.blog. I am able to
<a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">give</a> it the
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">URL</a> of the
linkblogging feed, and then click on
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png">Add
Threads</a> – and that’s it. When I post something to the feed it shows
up on Threads.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most
people don’t know it’s there. It’s sort of a Grand Central station for
moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you’re a
micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds
page</a> is where you set it up.

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>While utterly despicable, yesterday’s apparent assassination attempt
on Trump can be seen as a symptom of the hate-filled politics he and
Vance are peddling.</p>

<p>I still have the SHARP Zaurus SL-C3200. A cute tiny clamshell PDA -
actually a tiny Linux laptop. I have got it when it was already obsolete
and used it little. It’s the most expensive model with the biggest RAM
(128 MB, I think), the bigges storage space (the 6GB HDD) and - of
course - the biggest power consumption.</p>

<p>I was recruited to speak at a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti">Ria Novosti</a>
conference in Moscow in June 2011, but decided not to go. This was back
when we thought naively that Russia was a democracy, and working with
Russian journalists, when American journalists wouldn’t, seemed like a
fair deal. Something about it didn’t smell right though, so I stayed
home.</p>

<p>I used to think of
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">Twitter
as a coral reef</a>, but its role as a world wide notification system is
fading, and we haven’t replaced it with anything. I wrote
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">this</a>
in 2007 when the utility of Twitter was just becoming apparent.</p>

has changed in the twitterverse, it’s grown new centers. For me,
Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot
less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for
ActivityPub but that’s more complicated than it may seem. As often is
the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a
strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn’t work,
when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users,
completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable
speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their
users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I
think it’s better if we, as users, remain diversified.</p>

<h2 id="ignore-polls">Ignore polls</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
You’ll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been
in every presidential election because then they’d have to fire half
their political reporters.
</p>
<p>
If you want a better idea of how it’s going, look at where the ad
dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning.
</p>
<p>
And make sure all your friends know that you’re voting and who you’re
voting for. I think that makes a difference.
</p>
<p>
I’m voting straight Democratic party line.

<p>I find that a lot of my posts on my blog are just like the tweets I
post on Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter. I used to have an icon
in my outliner that tweeted the text of the bar cursor headline.</p>

<p>If ChatGPT had a simple, non-AI scrapbook, like the old Mac OS had,
where you could just throw something over your shoulder so you can find
it later with a text search, that would make it a lot more useful for
retaining practices that work. It’s a shame to work something out, come
up with the answer that worked, and then to have to do it all over again
23 months later when you encounter the same problem.</p>
