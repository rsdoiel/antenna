Squid Blogging: Opioid Alternatives from Squid Research</h2>

Is there nothing that
<a href="https://www.capeandislands.org/2024-12-05/massachusetts-scientists-study-squid-to-develop-disease-treatments-and-opioid-alternatives">squid
research</a> can’t solve?

<blockquote>
<p>
“If you’re working with an organism like squid that can edit genetic
information way better than any other organism, then it makes sense that
that might be useful for a therapeutic application like deadening pain,”
he said.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
Researchers hope to mimic how squid and octopus use RNA editing in nerve
channels that interpret pain and use that knowledge to manipulate human
cells.

come to the conclusion that you can’t really use
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> as
a programming partner. It doesn’t understand the big picture, and if you
try to explain it, it probably isn’t getting it, and if it does, it will
forget it quickly. It’s basically fairly stupid, but a way better search
engine than Google. Also, it never says it doesn’t have enough info to
answer the question and then an hour later you figure out the answer it
gave you just doesn’t work. I still think it’s an incredibly useful too,
just not as great as I used to think. In a couple of years it has never
asked for more information before it answers. That’s a clue.</p>

<p>
Hello, and welcome to 2025. Is it that time already?
</p>
<hr>
<p>
The possessive apostrophe (or rather, the abuse of the possessive
apostrophe) is a
<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2024/06/miscellany-101/">recurrent</a>
<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2013/03/miscellany-27/">guest
star</a> here at <cite>Shady Characters</cite>, but usually in the
English language. Recently, though,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/07/germany-influence-of-english-idiots-apostrophe">the
<cite>Guardian</cite> reported</a> that unneeded apostrophes are
infecting German, too. The so-called <i>Deppenapostroph</i>, or “idiot’s
apostrophe”, appears when a German-language expression uses it to
indicate a possessive — despite the fact that it is more correct to add
an “s” on its own rather than “’s”.

<p>
I am always interested in new phishing tricks, and watching them spread
across the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
A few days ago I started getting phishing SMS messages with a new twist.
They were standard messages about delayed packages or somesuch, with the
goal of getting me to click on a link and entering some personal
information into a website. But because they came from unknown phone
numbers, the links did not work. So—this is the new bit—the messages
said something like: “Please reply Y, then exit the text message, reopen
the text message activation link, or copy the link to Safari browser to
open it.”…

<p>For eight minutes last night, Joe Biden sounded nothing like the

boldly stepped out of character when delivering his farewell.</p>

While doing the research for a future talk, I came across an obscure but
impressively prophetic report entitled
<a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED368360"><i>Accessibility and
Integrity of Networked Information Collections</i></a> that Cliff Lynch
wrote for the federal Office of Technology Assessment in 1993, 32 years
ago. I say “obscure” because it doesn’t appear in Lynch’s
<a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/staff/clifford-a-lynch/publications/lynch-pubs-pre97">pre-1997
bibliography</a>.<br /> <br /> To give you some idea of the context in
which it was written, unless you are over 70, it was more than half your
life ago when in November 1989 Tim Berners-Lee’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">browser first
accessed a page from his Web server</a>. It was only about the same time
that the first commercial, as opposed to research, Internet Service
Providers started with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet">ARPANET
being decommissioned</a> the next year. Two years later, in December of
1991, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center put up the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/11/first-us-web-page.html">first US
Web page</a>. In 1992 Tim Berners-Lee
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html">codified and
extended the HTTP protocol</a> he had earlier implemented. It would be
another two years before Netscape became the
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dR2G0oPufe0C&lpg=PA69&ots=UnIlNi_km1&dq=netscape%20SSL%201.0&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q=netscape%20SSL%201.0&f=false">first
browser to support HTTPS</a>. It would be two years after that before
the ITEF approved HTTP/1.0 in
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945">RFC 1945</a>. As
you can see, Lynch was writing among the birth-pangs of the Web.<br />
<br /> Although Lynch was insufficiently pessimistic, he got a lot of
things exactly right. Below the fold I provide four out of many

When discussing the “strong bias in the Internet user community to
prefer free information sources” he was, alas, prescient although it
took more than “a few years”:<br />
<blockquote>
The ultimate result a few years hence — <i>and it may not be a bad or
inappropriate response, given the reality of the situation</i> — may be
a perception of the Internet and much of the information accessible
through it as the “net of a million lies”, following science fiction
author Vernor Vinge’s vision of an interstellar information network
characterized by the continual release of information (which may or may
not be true, and where the reader often has no means of telling whether
the information is accurate) by a variety of organizations for obscure
and sometimes evil reasons.
</blockquote>
The Vernor Vinge reference is to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep"><i>A Fire
Upon the Deep</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the novel, the Net is depicted as working much like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> network in the
early 1990s, with transcripts of messages containing header and footer
information as one would find in such forums.
</blockquote>
The downsides of a social medium to which anyone can post without
moderation were familiar to anyone who was online in the days of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Usenet is culturally and historically significant in the networked
world, having given rise to, or popularized, many widely recognized
concepts and terms such as “FAQ”, “flame”, sockpuppet, and “spam”.<br />
…<br /> Likewise, many conflicts which later spread to the rest of the
Internet, such as the ongoing difficulties over spamming, began on
Usenet.:<br />
<blockquote>
“Usenet is like a herd of performing elephants with diarrhea. Massive,
difficult to redirect, awe-inspiring, entertaining, and a source of
mind-boggling amounts of excrement when you least expect it.”<br />
<br /> — Gene Spafford, 1992
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
Earlier in the report Lynch had written (Page 23):<br />
<blockquote>
Access to electronic information is of questionable value if the
integrity of that information is seriously compromised; indeed, access
to inaccurate information, or even deliberate misinformation, may be
worse than no access at all, particularly for the naive user who is not
inclined to question the information that the new electronic
infrastructure is offering.
</blockquote>
This resonates as the wildfires rage in Los Angeles.<br />
<h3>
<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/918590403">Information
Doesn’t Want To Be Free</a>
</h3>
Although Tim Berners-Lee’s initial HTTP specification included the
status code
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html"><b>402 Payment
Required</b></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The parameter to this message gives a specification of charging schemes
acceptable. The client may retry the request with a suitable ChargeTo
header.
</blockquote>
the Web in 1993 lacked paywalls. But Lynch could see them coming (Page
22):<br />
<blockquote>
There is a tendency to incorrectly equate access to the network with
access to information; part of this is a legacy from the early focus on
communications infrastructure rather than network content. Another part
is the fact that traditionally the vast bulk of information on the
Internet has been publicly accessible if one could simply obtain access
to the Internet itself, figure out how to use it, and figure out where
to locate the information you wanted. As proprietary information becomes
accessible on the Internet on a large scale, this will change
drastically. In my view, access to the network will become commonplace
over the next decade or so, much as access to the public switched
telephone network is relatively ubiquitous today. But in the new
“information age” information will not necessarily be readily accessible
or affordable;
</blockquote>
The current <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110">RFC
9110</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>
The 402 (Payment Required) status code is reserved for future use.
</blockquote>
Instead today’s Web is infested with paywalls, each with their own
idiosyncratic user interface, infrastructure, and risks.<br />
<h3>
The Death Of “First Sale”
</h3>
Lynch understood the highly consequential nature of the change in the
business model of paid information access from <i>purchasing</i> a copy
to <i>renting</i> access to the publisher’s copy; from a legal framework
of copyright and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine">“first sale”
doctrine</a>, to one of copyright and contract law (Page 30):<br />
<blockquote>
Now, consider a library acquiring information in an electronic format.
Such information is almost never, today, sold to a library (under the
doctrine of first sale); rather, it is licensed to the library that
acquires it, with the terms under which the acquiring library can
utilize the information defined by a contract typically far more
restrictive than copyright law. The licensing contract typically
includes statements that define the user community permitted to utilize
the electronic information as well as terms that define the specific
uses that this user community may make of the licensed electronic
information. These terms typically do not reflect any consideration of
public policy decisions such as fair use, and in fact the licensing
organization may well be liable for what its patrons do with the
licensed information.
</blockquote>
The power imbalance between publishers and their customers is of long
standing, and it especially affects the academic literature. In 1989 the
Association of Research Libraries published
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xuXgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39-IA19&amp;lpg=PA39-IA19&amp;dq=chuck+hammicker+serials+pricing+crisis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9ZMEXp73DG&amp;sig=n4WexMPTa5kqWbilLv-WJoX959g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw07nvot3aAhXqh1QKHdInDu8Q6AEIXTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20sun%22&amp;f=false"><i>Report
of the ARL Serials Prices Project</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The ARL Serials Initiative forms part of a special campaign mounted by
librarians in the 1980s against the high cost of serials subscriptions.
This is not the first time that libraries have suffered from high serial
prices. For example, in 1927 the Association of American Universities
reported that:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
“Librarians are suffering because of the increasing volume of
publications and rapidly rising prices. Of special concern is the much
larger number of periodicals that are available and that members of the
faculty consider essential to the successful conduct of their work. Many
instances were found in which science departments were obligated to use
all of their allotment for library purposes to purchase their periodical
literature which was regarded as necessary for the work of the
department”
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
The oligopoly rents extracted by academic publishers have been a problem
for close on a century, if not longer! Lynch’s analysis of the effects
of the Web’s amplification of this power imbalance is wide-ranging,
including (Page 31):<br />
<blockquote>
Very few contracts with publishers today are perpetual licenses; rather,
they are licenses for a fixed period of time, with terms subject to
renegotiation when that time period expires. Libraries typically have no
controls on price increase when the license is renewed; thus, rather
than considering a traditional collection development decision about
whether to renew a given subscription in light of recent price
increases, they face the decision as to whether to lose all existing
material that is part of the subscription as well as future material if
they choose not to commit funds to cover the publisher’s price increase
at renewal time.
</blockquote>
Thus destroying libraries’ traditional role as stewards of information
for future readers. And (Page 30):<br />
<blockquote>
Of equal importance, the contracts typically do not recognize activities
such as interlibrary loan, and prohibit the library licensing the
information from making it available outside of that library’s immediate
user community. This destroys the current cost-sharing structure that
has been put in place among libraries through the existing interlibrary
loan system, and makes each library (or, perhaps, the patrons of that
library) responsible for the acquisitions cost of any material that is
to be supplied to those patrons in electronic form. The implications of
this shift from copyright law and the doctrine of first sale to contract
law (and very restrictive contract terms) is potentially devastating to
the library community and to the ability of library patrons to obtain
access to electronic information — in particular, it dissolves the
historical linkage by which public libraries can provide access to
information that is primarily held by research libraries to individuals
desiring access to this information. There is also a great irony in the
move to licensing in the context of computer communications networks —
while these networks promise to largely eliminate the accidents of
geography as an organizing principle for inter-institutional cooperation
and to usher in a new era of cooperation among geographically dispersed
organizations, the shift to licensing essentially means that each
library contracting with a publisher or other information provider
becomes as isolated, insular organization that cannot share its
resources with any other organization on the network.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Surveillance Capitalism
</h3>
Lynch also foresaw the start of “surveillance capitalism” (Page
60):<br />
<blockquote>
we are now seeing considerable use of multi-source data fusion: the
matching and aggregation of credit, consumer, employment, medical and
other data about individuals. I expect that we will recapitulate the
development of these secondary markets in customer behavior histories
for information seeking in the 1990s; we will also see
information-seeking consumer histories integrated with a wide range of
other sources of data on individual behavior.<br /> <br /> The ability
to accurately, cheaply and easily count the amount of use that an
electronic information resource receives (file accesses, database
queries, viewings of a document, etc.) coupled with the ability to
frequently alter prices in a computer-based marketplace (particularly in
acquire on demand systems that operate on small units of information
such as journal articles or database records, but even, to a lesser
extent, by renegotiating license agreements annually) may give rise to a
number of radical changes. These potentials are threatening for all
involved.
</blockquote>
He described search-based advertising (Page 61)<br />
<blockquote>
The ability to collect not only information on what is being sought out
or used but also who is doing the seeking or using is potentially very
valuable information that could readily be resold, since it can be used
both for market analysis (who is buying what) and also for directed
marketing (people who fit a certain interest profile, as defined by
their information access decisions, would likely also be interested in
new product X or special offer Y). While such usage (without the
informed consent of the recipient of the advertising) may well offend
strong advocates of privacy, in many cases the consumers are actually
quite grateful to hear of new products that closely match their
interests. And libraries and similar institutions, strapped for revenue,
may have to recognize that usage data can be a valuable potential
revenue source, no matter how unattractive they find collecting,
repackaging and reselling this information.
</blockquote>
Of course, it wasn’t the libraries but Google, spawned from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Digital_Library_Project">Stanford
Digital Library Project</a>, which ended up collecting the information
and monetizing it. And the power imbalance between publishers and
readers meant that the reality of tracking was hidden (Page 63):<br />
<blockquote>
when one is accessing (anonymously or otherwise) a public-access
information service, it is unclear what to expect, and in fact at
present there is no way to even learn what the policy of the information
service provider is.

that out by now. Just by mentioning the weird thing he’s talking about
as if it were some kind of puzzle, a brilliant chess move, etc blah blah

<p>
<code>top</code> (pictured <em>below</em>… above is
<a href="#btop">btop</a>) is the first utility everyone recommends to
monitor Linux (or any form of UNIX, including macOS) resource usage.
It’s efficient, available almost everywhere… but it’s also a bit basic.
It shows essential metrics, but looks like it’s from the 80s. There are
ways to brighten it up, like highlighting active processes or changing
color schemes, but it’s not the only game in town!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, there are a <em>lot</em> of modern monitoring tools—and some
not so modern, but immensely useful—to choose from. This blog post will
run through some of the ones I rely on most often. Let me know in the
comments if you use any others I didn’t cover!

<h2 id="making-this-less-annoying">Making “this” less annoying</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Now that I have a job where I’m writing web components full time, I see
the <code>this</code> keyword more than I ever have in my whole life.
It’s not a problem, per se, but you can see how it’s a little
repetitive. I started wondering what my options were to fix this minor
annoyance and the ShopTalk Discord helped me find a simple way and an
over-the-top way to fix my issue.
</p>
<h2>
Simple way: Overriding VS Code theme color tokens
</h2>
<p>
By default my Github Light theme makes <code>this</code> a bold dark
blue color. I didn’t want to roll my own theme though to scratch this
niche itch, so I dug in and found out you can override single tokens in
VS Code. Handy. The documentation is a bit opaque but here’s what you
need to do:
</p>
<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="jsx"><span class="c1">// settings.json</span>
<span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.tokenColorCustomizations</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">textMateRules</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">scope</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">variable.language.this</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">settings</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">foreground</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">#b0b0b0</span><span class="dl">"</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now my <code>this</code> looks like this…
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/dimmed.jpg" alt="the keyword this in code set in a light gray, almost illegible font color" />
</p>
<p>
It’s a calming sensation for me to have repetitive noise dimmed. I liked
it so much I dimmed comments to match as well. I may even dim TypeScript
because sometimes I wish I could hide the syntax, but keep the
squiggles.
</p>
<h2>
Over the top way: Replace <code>this</code> with a custom glyph
</h2>
<p>
Changing colors is cool… but what if you could go one step further and
replace <code>this</code> with an icon? What would an icon for
<code>this</code> even look like?
</p>
<p>
I asked the ShopTalk Discord and got some interesting ideas like the
“☝️” emoji, which I think is funny in an “I’m with stupid” t-shirt sort
of way. <a href="https://andrewwalpole.com/">Andrew Walpole</a> took it
to the next level and
<a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/This-Logo-Yellow-by-walpolea/162159874.EJUG5">designed
a custom glyph</a>:
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/this.png" alt="the letter of the word this arranged in a diamond pattern" width="150" height="152">
<p>
<a href="https://www.alanwsmith.com/">Alan Smith</a> then figured out
<a href="https://youtu.be/x1heJdtQapI">how to use Glyphs Mini to add a
custom ligature to an open source coding font</a>. Andrew riffed on
Alan’s work and exported a custom version of Fira Code with his custom
glyph as a ligature. The last step was to install the font update my VS
Code settings:
</p>
<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="jsx">  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.fontFamily</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">'Fira Code Ligged', monospace</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.fontLigatures</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now my code looks incredibly futuristic…
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/glyph.jpg" alt="the this glyph replacing instances of the glyph keyword in code" />
</p>
<p>
Abusing typefaces to remove the repetitiveness of programming languages
is fun. After seeing the icon <em>in situ</em>, the idea might be a
smidge too wild for me due to reduced legibility. While I don’t use the
custom glyph on the daily, this experiment does spark a deep desire in
me to create a bunch of custom glyphs for common keywords so I can make
JavaScript an entirely rune-based programming language.
</p>
<h2>
Custom ligatures with CSS?
</h2>
<p>
A wild idea, but it would be neat if you could create your own custom
ligatures in CSS to avoid the need to re-bake custom fonts each time you
have a niche typographic need. Here’s a pseudo-syntax of how that might
work:
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="s1">"Dave Hijinks"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">match</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"this."</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">replace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"☝️."</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="s1">"Cloud2Butts"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">match</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"cloud"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"AI"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">replace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"butt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sx">url(fart.svg)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">font-face</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"Dave Hijinks"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"Cloud2Butt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">sans-serif</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Anyways, it’s a thought. Not a serious proposal. This was a fun rabbit
hole to travel down with some friends.

<h2 id="can-ai-reinvent-biology">Can AI reinvent biology?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>A new season of CrazyStupidTech has begun, with my co-writer Fred
Vogelstein turning his attention to a new company from one of the
fathers of modern artificial intelligence.  Generative AI has dominated
recent discourse, but the impact of artificial intelligence
extends far beyond consumer applications. Take Inceptive, for
example. The startup, co-founded by Jakob Uszkoreit (co-author of the
seminal Transformer paper) and Stanford biochemist Rhiju Das, marries AI
and biology to create “biological software.” It is …</p>

<h2 id="an-internet-of-ideas">An internet of ideas</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I used to use Twitter for middle of the night ideas. These days I use
one of Twitter’s successors.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw3z6k2d">Here’s
one</a>. “We should be able to tweet from within any application that
has the ability to create and edit text, and not just in tiny little
text boxes.”
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw4jrs2d">And
another</a>. “The limits imposed by twitter initially in 2006 resulted
in there being room for only very simple ideas.
</p>
<p>
Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an
internet of ideas. Why should we depend on one small vulnerable company
to handle all our internet publishing? It’s an old outdated idea. Look
where our investment in Twitter left us, nomads searching for a new
home, and what did we do, we went for basically the same deal as before.
Oy.
</p>
<p>
Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)">Silo</a>? I
don’t want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly
what we’re talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the
twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do
little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo.
But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such
thing. If you’re federated that means you peer with your competitors.
Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg’s company these days,
just
<a href="https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/">cut
off</a> an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation
is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might
also want to hook into flow from
<a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>. I never believed in their
support of the fediverse. Now let’s get some reality into these
discussions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxxs7gy22x">On
Unix</a>. “Learning Unix was when I learned that computer networks could
be simple yet infinitely powerful. Before that for me it was just an
inkling, a hunch. Reading the source code I wanted to make software that
works like that. I hope I have, to some extent.”
</p>
<p>
On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt
Mullenweg</a>, who surprisingly has become a polarizing figure in the
tech world. Who could’ve seen that coming? Not me.
“<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxsh7nd22x">Radical
idea</a>. Matt Mullenweg doesn’t like how things are going. He has every
right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I.” I don’t
like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used
to say stuff like that about me. It’s a substitute for trying to
understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned
about creating open technology is you attract people who don’t
contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take
orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it’s crazy.
If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or
make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just
trust the universe. But giving people orders, there’s no place for that.
Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he
has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent
that we can.
</p>
<p>
I have my own vision for WordPress, as I’ve started to talk about here
and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks. If
you want a clue, listen to my
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html">podcast</a>
from January 8, and then if you have questions,
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316">ask
them here</a>. I think it’s a better bet that WordPress will be the
backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn’t
mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I
can’t endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo’d. I also
don’t believe in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy">Tooth Fairy</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Glinda</a> the
good witch of the south.

more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice
released
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/">half
of the report</a> on their case against president-elect Trump, a much
anticipated bit of news. I didn’t know it had been released, but when I
woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads,
Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where
I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they
don’t like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as
some of the celebs do, understand this – most people aren’t affected by
the noise. I don’t see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is
because I’ve been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I
don’t have <a href="https://x.com/davewiner">enough followers</a> to be
an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They
post where the flow is, and my account isn’t as attractive as (for
example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get
people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a
gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you
don’t see their logo when you fill up. It’s very hard to get away from
companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately.

<a href="https://theconversation.com/how-britain-got-its-first-internet-connection-by-the-late-pioneer-who-created-the-first-password-on-the-internet-45404">created</a>
in 1973 by Peter Kirstein:

<blockquote>
<p>
So from the beginning I put password protection on my gateway. This had
been done in such a way that even if UK users telephoned directly into
the communications computer provided by Darpa in UCL, they would require
a password.
</p>
<p>
In fact this was the first password on Arpanet. It proved invaluable in
satisfying authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for the 15 years I
ran the service ­ during which no security breach occurred over my link.
I also put in place a system of governance that any UK users had to be
approved by a committee which I chaired but which also had UK government
and British Post Office representation…

<h2 id="on-neil-gaiman-and-sexual-abuse">On Neil Gaiman and sexual
abuse</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
I will not be seeking out or reading that article that came out today,
because I’m sure I’d find it too triggering. Besides, some revelations
already came out months ago, and I read those, and I’m gonna assume the
latest ones are more of the same (maybe worse).
</p>
<p>
Look, I was also abused by a self-proclaimed “male feminist” when I was
younger, and the audacity of these men makes me really angry. It’s like
they get off on the contradiction, on lying through their teeth and
having the wider world lap it all up while the victim just quietly
seethes. And maybe also because the lie makes it easier to attract more
naïve victims, I don’t know. I really try not to let my bitterness
overcome me, and not <em>always</em> assume the worst of men who remind
me of him, but then periodically there are these reveals and I’m like,
“Oh, guess I should have listened to my instincts all along.” I mean, I
know we’re talking about some random celebrity I’m never gonna meet
whose work I never really liked, but still. Gaiman can go to hell, and
so can every other perpetrator of abuse, but <em>especially</em> the
slimy ones with these charismatic, “anti-sexist” personas. There is a
<em>special</em> level of hell for you.

and
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/113822309652127443">Mastodon</a>

</p>
<p>
I see people betting on the idea of federation in Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, we should bet on simplifying Mastodon at scale.
</p>
<p>
Approach the problem from both directions.

We may need and not have federation in Bluesky at some point.

language I haven’t professionally used in over seven years.

<h2 id="what-i-want-and-am-not-getting-from-ai-technology">What I want
and am not getting from AI technology</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
There’s a funny contradiction in the AI world.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
News orgs, published authors, great artists, universities, want to
retain ownership of their intellectual property and don’t trust the
utility of AI chatbots. They think the only application of AI technology
is to steal from them, to cheat at school and in work. They see AI
technology as destructive, immoral and dishonest.
</li>
<li>
As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to
analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest
piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far
into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day
writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want
it to organize new writing projects in ways I can’t. I want it to help
me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative
work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than
demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all
absorbed into its models so I can study and learn.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Two very different approaches to the same technology.

Not sure this will matter in the end, but it’s a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/microsoft-sues-service-for-creating-illicit-content-with-its-ai-platform/">positive
move</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a
“hacking-as-a-service” scheme that was designed to allow the creation of
harmful and illicit content using the company’s platform for
AI-generated content.

<p>
The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to
bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation
of harmful content through its generative AI services,

It’s that time of the year again. How to get back disk space?
</p>
<p>
Open the Files application and empty the trash. (How to do this from the
command line?)
</p>
<p>
Delete the cache for Debian packages:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>
<p>
Check out local caches:
</p>
<pre><code>ncdu .cache/
</code></pre>
<p>
Python stuff:
</p>
<pre><code>pip cache purge
</code></pre>
<p>
Also, feel free to delete other stuff in there. I just deleted a
“whisper” directory containing a language model I didn’t need and a
“tracker3” directory containing data for the Gnome miner, I think. Also
“chromium” because it’s not my main browser. I don’t care about its
cache.
</p>
<p>
Perlbrew stuff. Find out what Perls you have installed.
</p>
<pre><code>perlbrew list
</code></pre>
<p>
You aren’t going to need them:
</p>
<pre><code>perlbrew uninstall perl-5.30.0
perlbrew uninstall perl-5.32.0
</code></pre>
<p>
Go build cache:
</p>

The basic definition of terrorism is “violence designed to create terror
in a civilian population to achieve a political aim”. Clearly, not only
are states <em>capable</em> of carrying out terrorism, they are by far
the primary perpetrators of terrorism in the world. But the UN, being
made up of nation-states, has always resisted having a definition of
terrorism that acknowledged that, instead including clauses like “…by
non-nation-state actors”. In this way, for example, Israel is “not a
terrorist state”, while the Palestinians defending themselves
<em>are</em> terrorists…

<p>
And then we reach the modern era, where acts not designed to instill
terror in a civilian population at all, like the United Healthcare
shooting, get branded as “terrorism”. Like, according to the ruling
class, it’s now just terrorism if the ruling class is afraid. No naked
self-interest in that at all 🙄

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@deivudesu" title="@deivudesu@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="deivudesu">@deivudesu</span></a> recently
wondered aloud about blogging software.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you were to design a brand new blogging platform from scratch today,
what would it look like?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Since I recently wrote Oddmu, I have opinions, of course. It would look
like this site! 😅
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Would it stick to the standard “N columns” template format?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Over the years of using Oddmuse (the predecessor software I started
maintaining in 2003), I tried sidebars for my site and never liked it
for long. When I visit other sites, I almost never use the sidebars.
</p>
<p>
Blogroll? No. Just discuss blog posts and link to other people – that’s
the better option.
</p>
<p>
Archives? No. The calendar widgets are small and cramped and soon enough
I end up on a separate page where I can navigate in big chunks. I almost
never want to know what somebody posted on a particular day. I want to
know whether they post a lot; whether they posted more on a topic in the
past. It all involves better overview and search. This need is not met
by an archive in the sidebar.
</p>
<p>
Many links to entry points? No. Just put them on the first page.
</p>
<p>
Many admin links? No. Just put them on a separate page, if you must.
Also try to redesign the application so that it needs fewer admin links.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Would it have a dedicated Admin UI, or would it reuse existing tools?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oddmu has no dedicated administration user-interface. It uses Markdown
text files and media files for storage. If you really need direct
access, open a file browser, a shell, an editor.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Would it define its own DB schema, or piggyback off existing standards?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Since Oddmu is designed to work with files directly, the DB schema would
be trivial: page name and page content. It steered me away from keeping
a lot of metadata.
</p>
<p>
If I wanted to keep drafts somewhere, I guess I would set up a second
Oddmu accessible only to me. Or I’d just use a text editor to write the
posts. (This post started in a text editor.)
</p>
<p>
Post scheduling would have to interface with command line tools like
<code>at</code> to move a file from one folder to another at some point
in the future. I don’t need this and so I never thought about it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Would it make sense to design it as an ActivityPub client with a Web UI?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I don’t think so. Many people commenting on fedi might be surprised to
see their comments show up on the web and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, having a little script off of a cron job that reads the
blog’s feed and posts on fedi worked well for me. Of course that would
not work for a platform like Blogger or Wordpress, but on an individual
level, it works.

<p><strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Jessica">@Jessica</span>
Smith’s blog</strong> (date: 2025-01-11, from: Jessica Smith’s blog)</p>
<p>
In the last few days, Indie’s been exclaiming a lot of, “Oh!” and “Ooh!”
So I was talking to her, going, “We can add this ‘oh’ and ‘ooh’ to the
’eeeeeeeeh’ you liked saying when you were a younger baby, and you’re
well on the way to mastering all the vowel sounds!” (She’s not, because
English has like 13 vowel sounds before you even consider diphthongs,
but I want her to feel encouraged.) I went on, “Next you’re going to
have to learn a whole new kind of sound, called consonants! Listen to
this: mamamamama… bababababa… papapapapa…” (Starting with the bilabials,
because I believe babies learn those first?)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Indie had been happily “oh!“ing and “ooh!“ing away, but when I
started with my “mamamamama” she fell silent and looked at me SO
closely. I could see her moving her lips and trying to copy what I did
🥹 Didn’t quite get there, but was clearly trying so hard to figure it
out. And now she’s back to chanting, “Ooh! Ooh! Oh!” on repeat, haha.
