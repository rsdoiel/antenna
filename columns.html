<p>And btw I also am wasting my ideas, one in a hundred has any
influence, and even then it’s minscule, the ideas drift away
unimplemented. I keep writing, hoping I see a way to get into the global
conversation, again. I remember what it’s like. But I’m not done. We
still have a big problem to solve in our political and communication
system. Online software is where it’s at.</p>

<p>trurl is slowing growing up and maturing. This is a minor patch
release following up the previous one done just a few weeks ago, fixing
a few annoying bugs only. Download it from curl.se/trurl Fixes in 0.15.1
Future I have this feeling that we still have use cases and combinations
that we don’t have tested …

ideas into the wind –
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22dan+conover%22">Dan
Conover</a>, who when he comes out with a piece, I stop everything and
sit down and carefully read it and savor it, because not only is there
sure to be new info and new ideas, but the writing is sooo good. He’s a
former local reporter in South Carolina. I met him on a road tour I did
a bunch of years ago. Where does he post this stuff? Facebook. I want it
to be part of the concentrated web writers union. Maybe think of it as
my karass, my version of The Atlantic, perhaps. Or my version of the
op-ed page of the NY Times. I think there is definitely enough good
stuff out there, unorganized, to easily rival them for originality,
depth of thought, experience and great writing. Dan is on my list of
such superheroes.</p>

couple of months ago, I was practically begging him to do this. He was
pouring so much unfocused energy into making journalism play an
appropriate role in our democracy. When Jeff started posting to his
blog, it gave his friends something to point to, and we did. This
writing had much more impact than a random tweet. Journalism crossed a
line they should not have crossed. Now we fully expect them to try to do
it again. We have to find a way for our ideas not to be scattered in the
wind, so thorougly ignorable. And in doing so, I’m convinced we’d find a
better way to organize the electorate online so it’s more immune from
unwise and unfair manipulation from the journalists. I also noted that

an election will be like Game of Thrones or Succession. A campaign would
be a season. There would be character development, arcs, twists,
revelations, unforseen events. Near the end of the season you have the
election, with the following episodes the plotting, intrigue, and
undermining of democracy, and at the end of the season the inauguration
of a new president. Each year you have more of this, until four years
later you go through the election all over again. People would really
study the candidates, and would have reasons they like one character
over another. And maybe the patriarch doesn’t die, and decides to run
again. This is where we’re heading, we might already be there.</p>

It would have been cool if Harris had said “He’s going to have you for
dinner” instead of “He’s going to eat you for lunch,” which is what she
said Putin would do to Trump.

<p>
Makes you wonder if that was a slip of the tongue or if it was a little
Easter Egg she dropped for our later amusement.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/24/drummer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">What
Harris is doing is marketing. It takes a lot of impressions to get
people to believe she can be president. If she wants to win, she has to
do a lot of interviews and rallies and say quotable things, and be
tweeting all the time, not just in the campaign snark accounts (which
are great) but also seriously in her own name.
</p>
<p>
People aren’t going to care about the policies though they will say
that’s what they want more of. What they want to feel is that she is
present. Biden was invisible that’s why they didn’t like or trust him,
even though he is a good president. Trump is very present, and they like
that, trust that, but most of them also know he’s a creep. She just has
to keep beating the drum.
</p>
<p>
And the secret is to keep beating the drum, constantly, after she wins.
Don’t disappear like Obama did. She must not only be president of the
United States, but she has to be
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/09/10/twitterPresidentKamala.html">president
of Twitter</a> too (and by Twitter I mean all the twitter-like systems).
</p>
<p>
So don’t expect undecided voters to all convert to Harris in one event.
But they will if she stays in the news, even dominates the news (please)
and help them see Trump as a thing of the past.
</p>
<p>
That’s the way to win, and to win in governing too.

<p>I wouldn’t have traded places with Harris for anything in the world,
she did fantastic. The pressure on her was enormous. I don’t think Trump
said one thing that was true. And Harris made the point that the
division is coming from that guy over there, and if we don’t want it all
we have to do is turn the freaking page. For once the power is with the
people. The Repubs in the Senate wouldn’t vote to convict, the Supreme
Court just gave him immunity, but the American people, in a few weeks,
can tell them all to fuck off.</p>

most encouraging thing about last night’s debate was that the moderators
were journalists. When Trump repeated his most egregious lie about
murdering babies being legal in certain states, moderator Muir
confidently, almost derisively, said that there is no such thing. And
when Trump said he didn’t admit he lost the election, and then when
challenged said in a snotty way he was being sarcastic, Muir plainly
that wasn’t true either. It was like the Monty Python

the Effectiveness of Reward Modeling of Generative AI Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, updated: 2024-09-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
New research evaluating the effectiveness of reward modeling during
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10270">SEAL: Systematic Error
Analysis for Value ALignment</a>.” The paper introduces quantitative
metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of modeling and aligning human
values:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aims
to align language models (LMs) with human values by training reward
models (RMs) on binary preferences and using these RMs to fine-tune the
base LMs. Despite its importance, the internal mechanisms of RLHF remain
poorly understood. This paper introduces new metrics to evaluate the
effectiveness of modeling and aligning human values, namely feature
imprint, alignment resistance and alignment robustness. We categorize
alignment datasets into target features (desired values) and spoiler
features (undesired concepts). By regressing RM scores against these
features, we quantify the extent to which RMs reward them ­ a metric we
term feature imprint. We define alignment resistance as the proportion
of the preference dataset where RMs fail to match human preferences, and
we assess alignment robustness by analyzing RM responses to perturbed
inputs. Our experiments, utilizing open-source components like the
Anthropic preference dataset and OpenAssistant RMs, reveal significant
imprints of target features and a notable sensitivity to spoiler
features. We observed a 26% incidence of alignment resistance in
portions of the dataset where LM-labelers disagreed with human
preferences. Furthermore, we find that misalignment often arises from
ambiguous entries within the alignment dataset. These findings
underscore the importance of scrutinizing both RMs and alignment
datasets for a deeper understanding of value alignment…

Harris must become president of Twitter before becoming president of the
United States.

<p>
After the debate, Harris should be interviewed anywhere they’ll have
her. Go ahead and be overexposed. Answer every question with one of your
major positioning statements. Call in to radio talk shows, podcasts,
whatever you can think of. Biden hardly ever promoted himself. Not being
heard <i>all the time</i> was his biggest sin. Harris should get
accustomed to being accessible when she’s in office. Keep the
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/">kamalahq</a> snark channel
going. This will have been Trump’s contribution to American politics, no
fear of being heard.

<h1 id="2024-09-08-webdav-no-more">
2024-09-08 WebDAV no more
</h1>
<p>
I must have implemented <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a> two
or three times in the last decade or two. Just now I used
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_dav.html">mod_dav
for Apache</a> to enable WebDAV for some directories.
</p>
<p>
In theory, it’s great. You can treat the web server as a file server,
connecting to it and using your regular file manager and text editor,
using your favourite shell to do things. And if your website already
uses permissions to restrict access to some locations, you can use the
same config files to handle the making of changes.
</p>
<p>
In practice, however, the operating systems all have such brittle
implementations that none of the solutions I had in production ever
worked well. It doesn’t matter whether it’s Windows’ File Explorer,
macOS’ Finder, the Gnome virtual file system via Nautilus or something
else. The only thing that works is the command-line client
<a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>. It’s the best.
It works. Sooner or later, however, I realize that cadaver is probably
not the tool I can expect non-technical people to use. It has the same
user-interface as the old ftp command-line client.
</p>
<p>
I wonder what the issue is. WebDAV is 25 years old. It seems to me that
something about the process or the spec must have set it up for failure.
Perhaps it was a complex protocol?
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2518">RFC 2518</a> for
WebDAV is from February 1999,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> for
HTTP/1.1 is from June 1999. Perhaps the move from HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1
too away all the thunder. There was the DotCom craze and Web 2.0 and
what not. Nobody had time for WebDAV? Nobody had a business model for
WebDAV? People used FTP and SSH and all that for remote file access,
there was no point doing it using web technology? Or perhaps there
wasn’t just one library to rule them all and in the darkness bind them?
</p>
<p>
In any case, I think I need to write this down so I don’t fall for it
again in two years. I’ve been falling for it since 2005. Every wiki of
mine gets WebDAV support … Looking at my blog it seems that
<a href="2021-10-18_WebDAV_is_tricky">the last time</a> I spent five
days to get this right. This time around I’m just tired.
</p>
<p>
Time to disable <code>mod_dav</code> again.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23WebDAV">#WebDAV</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-10</strong>. Another option would be an explicit list of
endorsed clients like

<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Are the Apple announcements like great reunions for people who have been
going to these things regularly for 20+ years? If so, I can see the
value in it.
</p>
<p>
I went to a reunion at Berkman,
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/08/222335.html">after 20
years</a>, and it was great, made me wonder why we didn’t do it every
year for the last 20. When you get a group of people together who do
great things in a special moment, you should see them from time to time.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">But
I have a feeling there’s a lot of turnover at the Apple events. In any
case, I stopped going to them somewhere in the mid-90s, or more
accurately they stopped inviting me. Yeah I was disruptive, but only in
comparison to how well-behaved the other journos were (at that time I
was writing for Wired).
</p>
<p>
The press was in awe of Apple and other Valley companies. I enjoyed that
for a very brief period when my company went public after I had a hit
Mac product. Then I became something of a pariah, because I
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">started blogging</a> and believe
me the icons of the Valley for the most part <i>did not like it.</i>
They were accustomed to fawning attention and rewritten press releases.
But because I was an insider, I had an idea where the bodies might be
buried, and I wrote about it.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Woz</a> liked it.
I was popular at the parties, I guess.
</p>
<p>
BTW, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Roizen">Heidi
Roizen</a> once observed that I took a date to an Apple announcement
(the one where Steve came back). There weren’t many people there, maybe
20 or 25.
</p>
<p>
Jeff Jarvis wrote in the foreword to his
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-We-Weave-Internet-Misanthropes/dp/1541604121">upcoming
book</a> that I’m like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig">Zelig</a> of tech. This is
what he meant, imho. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
We’re coming up on the 30th anniversary of my blog, one month from
tomorrow. You won’t hear anyone from tech applauding, and you probably
won’t hear anything from the old bloggers. But I have something special
in mind myself. Hopefully it’ll come together in the next month, or
sooner. :-)

In 2018, Australia passed the Assistance and Access Act, which—among
other things—gave the government the
<a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/australias-assistance-and-access-act">power</a>
to force companies to break their own encryption.

<p>
The Assistance and Access Act includes key components that outline
investigatory powers between government and industry. These components
include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Technical Assistance Requests (TARs): TARs are voluntary requests for
assistance accessing encrypted data from law enforcement to teleco and
technology companies. Companies are not legally obligated to comply with
a TAR but law enforcement sends requests to solicit cooperation. …

<h2 id="peering-in-the-social-web">Peering in the social web</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A very practical issue.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l3njg5jhft2k">BlueSky</a>
has a 300 character limit, which is less than the other services I
cross-post to, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mastodon: 500 (using mastodon.social as benchmark)
</li>
<li>
Threads: 500
</li>
<li>
Twitter: 10000 (assume paying the montly fee)
</li>
<li>
RSS: no specific limit
</li>
<li>
WordPress: no specific limit
</li>
<li>
BlueSky: 300
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This will be a problem when we eventually get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering">peering</a> working
cross-network among twitter-like systems.
</p>
<p>
It looks to me, just eyeballing this list, that 500 is a good place to
start, although I don’t think ultimately there should be any specific
limits.
</p>
<p>
We saw that clearly when RSS 0.91 was the most recent version, there
were limits in the Netscape doc, but they were ignored by content
sources, which is why I took them out in the 0.92 and 2.0 versions.
</p>
<p>
Peering is simpler than federation. It would enable people to send
messages across these boundaries, but wouldn’t handle the engagement
features, likes, replies, forwarding. It’s what many people are starting
to do now, by hand. There’s no way to put it off, imho – the Bluesky
limit is already hard to deal with.
