<p>I was trying to find Tony Kahn on the web for a friend doing a
documentary on the origins of podcasting, and came up empty. I just
stumbled across him on Facebook and that led to
<a href="https://www.tonykahn.org/home">this autobiographical site</a>
where he tells his story of podcasting. Tony was the person who brought
NPR into podcasting in 2004. A major contributor who isn’t often
credited. He was at WGBH at the time.</p>

<h2 id="leaked-github-python-token">Leaked GitHub Python Token</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, updated: 2024-08-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Here’s a disaster that
<a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/github-token-leak-could-have-put-the-entire-python-language-at-risk">didn’t
happen</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Cybersecurity researchers from JFrog recently discovered a GitHub
Personal Access Token in a public Docker container hosted on Docker Hub,
which granted elevated access to the GitHub repositories of the Python
language, Python Package Index (PyPI), and the Python Software
Foundation (PSF).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
JFrog discussed what
<a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/leaked-pypi-secret-token-revealed-in-binary-preventing-suppy-chain-attack/">could
have happened</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The implications of someone finding this leaked token could be extremely
severe. The holder of such a token would have had administrator access
to all of Python’s, PyPI’s and Python Software Foundation’s
repositories, supposedly making it possible to carry out an extremely
large scale supply chain attack…

look online for RPG conversation?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-01-where-to-look-online-for-rpg-conversation">
2024-08-01 Where to look online for RPG conversation?
</h1>
<p>
This is a reaction to a post by the same title on the
<a href="https://grumpywizard.home.blog/2024/08/01/where-to-look-online-for-rpg-conversation/">Grumpy
Wizard</a> blog. I know where I get my conversation in any case. But all
the points the Grumpy Wizard makes need to be considered. I don’t care
about D&amp;D and Pathfinder. I don’t even care for the old editions. If
at all, I care about the problems you ran into and your solutions at the
table: techniques, procedures, house rules.
</p>
<p>
I also don’t care for product announcements or read-through reviews. I
also don’t care about the details of session reports. I care about the
in-between: what have you used or made for use at the table, what can
you say about it, did it work, what would do differently.
</p>
<p>
Given these peculiarities, I find my conversation on Discord – on small
servers with a dozen active people, no more, and we mostly care about
the games we play with each other; or on the fediverse with an account
that follows a lot of people from tabletop.social and dice.camp (or
rollenspiel.social and pnpde.social, if you speak German). These sites
are all a bit like early Twitter except you can follow people on
compatible servers, too.
</p>
<p>
There are similar sites that are bit a like Reddit, but you can also
follow people on other servers – but I was never very active on Reddit
and so they don’t appeal much to me.
</p>
<p>
I guess if I were to look for forums, I’d go back to old haunts: EN
World, ODD74, or whatever flavour you preferred back then.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when I post stuff that got started because of something I heard
or somebody I spoke to, I try to link to their social media profiles or
blogs so that you can check them out and maybe follow them, too.
</p>
<p>
I sometimes wish there was more conversation to be found on IRC and
Usenet. But that basically requires people love both role-playing games
and old tech. It’s rare.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s what the Grumpy Wizard also said: So many thi gs have
been discussed for so long, I just don’t care about the conversation
anymore. Ascending or descending armour class? 6 mile hex? I no longer
care.
</p>
<p>
I guess I’m still into blogs. 😄

sues Consensys over MetaMask Swaps and Staking</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The SEC is charging Consensys for unauthorized sales of securities
through MetaMask Staking and for failure to register as a broker and a
dealer while offering crypto trades and staking services through
MetaMask Staking and Swaps. The SEC says that Consensys took $250

Consensys’ main money maker — a popular browser-based wallet that also
lets you stake ETH and buy and sell crypto via decentralized exchanges

</blockquote>
Consensys’ defense strategy poses potentially serious problems for the
concept of open source, because they are gaslighting about the software
that is the basis for the SEC’s complaint being open source. Were the
court to (a) fall for their gaslighting but (b) agree with the SEC’s
complaint it could provide a basis for imposing liability on open source
developers.<br /> <br /> I am afraid that the explanation for why this
is so is necessarily rather long but I and others think that it needs to
be understood. So stock up with supplies for the journey and follow me
below the fold.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Before the
House of Representatives Committee on House Financial Services
Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion,
William C. Hughes, Senior Counsel &amp; Director of Global Regulatory
Matters for Consensys
<a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA21/20231115/116579/HHRG-118-BA21-Wstate-HughesB-20231115.pdf">testified

<blockquote>
Our firm develops and offers the most popular unhosted wallet software
in digital assets, the MetaMask wallet. This offering is open source
software that can be downloaded for free from the Apple app or Google
extension store, and installed on any Google Chrome browser, iPhone, or
Apple desktop computer. The wallet is an interface that allows the user
to read and write to the blockchain without any intermediary’s help,
akin to how a web browser is a consumer’s direct connection to the open
web.
</blockquote>
Why was Hughes stressing that the MetaMask wallet was open-source?
Consensys responded to the suit by claiming that MetaMask was
<a href="https://consensys.io/blog/company-statement-on-the-sec-action-against-consensys">just
software that they wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We are confident in our position that the SEC has not been granted
authority to regulate software interfaces like MetaMask.

Consensys claims that their

is open source</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Consensys is a leading Ethereum and decentralized protocols software
company. We enable developers, enterprises, and people worldwide to
build next-generation applications, launch modern financial
infrastructure, and access the decentralized web. … On this trusted,

Specifically including

It is true that MetaMask’s wallet <i>was</i> originally truly open
source, under the MIT license. But as of 4 years ago, the license
<a href="https://medium.com/metamask/evolving-our-license-for-the-next-wave-of-metamask-users-81b0b494c09a">changed</a>
to a Consensys-specific license that prevents commercial use if it
serves more than 10K users/month. So in this post “open source” means
readable, it does not mean the canonical definition of Free Open Source
Software.<br /> <br /> But notice Consensys’ focus on the wallet
software. That is not what the SEC is suing them about. The SEC’s
complaint is about the services MetaMask provides customers who use the
wallet. Consensys’ strategy is to conflate the wallet and the services,
and claim that all the wallet does is interface to the blockchain.<br />
<br /> Lets use an analogy to see why this distinction is important.
When I use an open-source browser to access a financial institution’s
website, such as <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/">Vanguard’s</a>
it receives a bunch of HTML and JavaScript. It isn’t technically open
source because it doesn’t carry an open source copyright license, but I
can read it. But it doesn’t implement any of the services Vanguard
offers me, such as trading mutual funds and transferring dollars to or
from my bank account. These are implemented as closed-source, the
browser under control of Vanguard’s HTML and JavaScript is just a
wrapper around them.<br /> <br /> Consensys seems to claim that because
the “smart contracts” implementing these services are just open source
software they do not control and in whose operations they are not
involved, they are not acting as a broker because they don’t take
custody of the customer’s tokens.<br /> <br /> I should pick a nit. I’ve
written before, for example in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/01/blockchain-gaslighting.html"><i>Blockchain
Gaslighting</i></a> and
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/03/more-cryptocurrency-gaslighting.html"><i>More
Cryptocurrency Gaslighting</i></a>, about the crypto-bros habit of
loudly and repeatedly making provably false statements in the hope that
no-one will bother to check them. This post is, strictly speaking, not
about gaslighting because the repeated statements are technically true,
but they are intended to be interpreted in a broader context in which
they are false.<br /> <br /> The reason Consenssys’ statements are
technically true is that the wallet functionality is open source, at
least in the sense that it can be read. But, a couple of weeks ago, Jon
Reiter and the team at Chainargos came out with a three-part series
examining how MetaMask’s services actually work that reveals the lie
underlying Consensys’ arguments:<br />

from one of them. It also discusses how one part of MetaMask Bridge
works.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-bridge-really-works-3a716db94c21"><i>How
MetaMask Bridge Really Works</i></a> covers the rest of MetaMask
Bridge’s functionality, again including a
<a href="https://bscscan.com/tx/0x06dc87b6344f161e7ee594cfda3cc8cecb43647a1882abadc38e3e8146c9f540">sample
transaction</a>.
</li>
</ol>
In each case the structure of the transaction is basically the same. For
the details you should read the three posts, but to oversimplify:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The customer’s wallet invokes a function, for example <tt>MetaMask:Swap
Router.swap()</tt>, on one of MetaMask’s open source contracts. The call
parameters identify a specific contract, which in the swap case MetaMask
calls the “aggregator” and Chainargos calls the
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a">“execution
strategy”</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is the algorithm that the user told their broker to use to execute
this order
</blockquote>
These contracts are closed-source, owned and controlled by Consensys.
Part of their function is to transfer the fees for executing the
transaction to a Consensys wallet.
</li>
<li>
The open-source function validates inputs, identifies the “adapter” that
implements the requested algorithm, and formats a block of parameters
with which to invoke it.
</li>
<li>
The open-source function <i>transfers control of the customer’s tokens
to a MetaMask contract</i>. In the case of MetaMask Swap this is an
open-source contract, in other cases it is an upgradeable or
closed-source contract.
</li>
<li>
That contract invokes the <i>closed-source, MetaMask owned</i> adapter
contract with the encoded parameters.
</li>
<li>
The adapter performs the transaction, returning the proceeds to the
customer after subtracting the fee, which it sends to the Consensys
wallet.
</li>
</ul>
Note first that the actual algorithm performing the transaction is
closed-source, MetaMask’s open-source software simply provides the
wrapper exposed to the customer. And second that in each case a
closed-source MetaMask contract takes control of the customer’s tokens
in order to perform the requested transaction. In some cases even the
open-source contract is upgradeable, meaning that MetaMask can change
what it does on a whim. In some cases the contracts have functions such
as <tt>pause()</tt> demonstrating MetaMask’s control over their
operation. At minimum, MetaMask needs this control to ensure that the
fees for the transaction are routed to their wallet.<br /> <br />
Chainargos concludes that this workflow
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a">looks
similar to the way a broker works</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
User enters order including an execution strategy.
</li>
<li>
This order is sent to an order router.
</li>
<li>
Router looks up the execution adapter for that strategy.
</li>
<li>
Router sends the tokens intended to be sold, the adapter address, and
the incoming order details to a spender contract.
</li>
<li>
Spender delegates control over the received tokens as required for order
execution.
</li>
<li>
Spender calls a closed-source contract which effects the execution
strategy.
</li>
<li>
Fees are sent from Spender to the “MetaMask Fee Complex”.
</li>
<li>
Sale proceeds are returned to the user.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
And they
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a">point
out that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
that steps 4, 5, and 6 look an awful lot like the concepts of
“transmittal order” and “transmittal of funds” from
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/12/04/2013-28951/definitions-of-transmittal-of-funds-and-funds-transfer">here</a>.
</blockquote>
“Here” is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s

of Transmittal of Funds and Funds Transfer</i></a>.<br /> <br /> The
parts of MetaMask that provide services for which Consensys gets fees
<i>cannot</i> be open source in the sense of readable. If they were,
anyone could copy them, modify them to direct the fees to themselves,
and deploy the result. This would kill off Consensys’ $250M cash cow.
Consensys has a belt-and-braces moat; if they did they would run into
the 10K users/month limit of the license for the open source parts of
the system. Note that the
<a href="https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/e4d4c9c45a134eace71d020ac0316deddc52213d/LICENSE">license</a>
appears to relate only to the open source parts, it isn’t clear under
what terms the closed source parts are used.<br /> <br />

The last of the three Chainargos posts was published July
15<sup>th</sup>, and on July 17<sup>th</sup> a brand-new blog appeared
whose first post was
<a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@proofs-and-protocols/examining-sec-v-consensys"><i>Examining
SEC v. Consensys</i></a> by Daniel Barabander. He is Deputy General
Counsel at the cryptocurrency VC Variant, so not an unbiased observer.
Early in the post, in the table at the right, Barabander simply asserts
that Consensys’ technology is non-custodial, i.e. that MetaMask does not
take custody of the customer’s tokens.<br /> <br /> How can Barabander
make this assertion when it is clear that MetaMask’s Spender delegates
control over the customer’s tokens and then invokes MetaMask’s
closed-source execution strategy? He relies on the fact that the
transaction is atomic, it either succeeds completely, or it fails
completely.
<a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@proofs-and-protocols/examining-sec-v-consensys">He
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Assuming the adapters are not malicious (which would be another issue
entirely), their job is to enable a user to perform an atomic swap—in a
single transaction take token A and exchange it for token B. This would
mean that transactions are “all or nothing”—either the tokens are
swapped or they are not, they cannot end up in possession of the
Spender.sol contract or Consensys
</blockquote>
If the transaction succeeds, <i>some</i> of the tokens involved end up
in possession of Consensys, because they get the fee. But that is not
the big problem with this claim. It is true that the transaction either
succeeds or fails completely, but what the transaction does with the
control it is delegated over the customer’s tokens is determined by
MetaMask’s closed-source adapters. The customer hands control to
MetaMask’s closed-source code and blindly trusts it will do what
MetaMask claims. Barabander admits that this is the case when he assumes
that “the adapters are not malicious”.<br /> <br /> Chainargos
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a">points
out that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If you can publish adapters, call setAdapter on the router and modify
the input “data” blob you can do anything you like.<br /> <br /> Even if
you only have some of that power you can do pretty much anything you
like with the input tokens.
</blockquote>
As I understand it, only MetaMask can do these things. Barabander
<a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@proofs-and-protocols/examining-sec-v-consensys">admits</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While there is some admin functionality on the smart contract for a
multi-sig that Consensys may control, there is no evidence to suggest
the company actively operates the smart contract’s code.
</blockquote>
Chainargos posted a response to Barabander entitled
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/in-re-examining-sec-v-consensys-1edfbfee6987"><i>In
Re: Examining SEC v. Consensys</i></a>. They note that the contract has
a <tt>renounceOwnership()</tt> function that Consensys has not called,
there are <tt>pauseSwaps()</tt> and <tt>unpauseSwaps()</tt> for use when
the contract gets hacked, and that the admin functionality has to be
used to set up the adapter mapping.<br /> <br />

In response to the SEC’s suit, Consensys

in the Northern District of Texas. In their complaint they state (my
emphasis):<br />
<blockquote>
MetaMask is simply an interface — like a web browser — that allows
digital asset holders to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum network,
including all other users and applications participating on the network.
<i>MetaMask neither holds customers’ digital assets nor carries out any
transaction functions</i>.
</blockquote>
<p>It is a little strange to say that MetaMask the wallet doesn’t hold
customer’s digital assets - what is a “wallet” for? But the MetaMask
wallet is unhosted, <i>Consensys</i> doesn’t hold customer’s digital
assets in MetaMask wallets. But Consensys’ services accessed via the
wallet do take control of them using closed-source “smart contracts”
that they control.<br /> <br /> It is possible that the court will
decide that Consensys is acting as a broker, but will accept their
assertion that the software they use to do it is open source. This would
be a problem, in that it could be a precedent for assigning liability to
the developers of open source software.<br /> <br /></p>

I should’ve known I’d be in for a wild conversation when Viv burst into
my room all like, “Did you hear what Canada is doing to the polar
bears?!?”
</p>
<p>
Apparently (I have not seen whatever he saw), some town in Canada is
trying to deter polar bears from entering the town by capturing them,
depriving them of food and subjecting them to “shock therapy” for two
months, before releasing them back into the wild? Like, what kind of
scheme is this. “Oh no no, we can’t <em>kill</em> the polar bears, so
we’re just going to lock them up for two months and torture them, before
dropping them off right back where there’s still no food.” And Viv is
raging, insisting that the mining companies should be required to
deposit truckloads of seals in the area where the polar bears are so
they have something to eat, and I’m like… I don’t think that’s the crux
of the issue here. Anyway, idk, it made me laugh (even though it sucks
for the polar bears). Very Canadian things.

<h2 id="the-nyt-is-weird">The NYT is weird</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Someone in charge at the NYT needs to take a step back and view events,
and the NYT role in those events, from the point of view of an ordinary
non-NYT-employed citizen, bewildered at the enormous risks journalists
are taking with the system of government of the United States.
</p>
<p>
In the context of who we are as a country, what the Repubs do and say is
to be very mild about it “weird.” What word would you prefer the
Democrats use? Imagine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William
Safire</a> were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, wrote
that column. (Safire was a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63">Republican</a>
btw.)
</p>
<p>
And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term.
This is where you get to speak out about what they’re doing over there,
and how it’s not journalism. One of the rare things you agree with Trump
on.

<p>
Podcast: <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/theNYTIsWeird.m4a">3
minutes</a>.

<p>
PS: Safire went to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science">Bronx
Science</a>! I did not know that. (So did I.) I love the idea of writers
who aren’t scared of tech stuff.
</p>
<p>
PPS: Even Richard Nixon would think today’s so-called Republicans were
weird.
</p>
<p>
PPPS: The NYT is totally unmoored, a word I bet Safire would like.

<p>People who get their sense of self-esteem from having procreated are
placing a heavy burden on their children. What if the child doesn’t live
up to their expectations? How will they treat the child then! Creating a
new human is not an accomplishment. Treating that new life as a full
person starting at birth, and through their whole life, <i>that’s</i> an
accomplishment. For a man to father a child just means they have a
functioning reproductive system. It’s not anything to be proud or to
expect to be rewarded or respected for.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://this.how/podcast0/">Podcast0</a> project is
teaching me how to read the archive of my own blog. Until now I had not
carefully read the story I tell on my blog more than a few days after it
happened. Here’s I’m learning to reconstruct the summer of 2004, one of
the most creative periods of my life, at least that’s viewable in such a
public and preserved way. Am I the first to do this for any blog? If you
know of an example of historic research done using the archive of a
blog, please send me a note. I’d love to learn about what you learned!
Also because of its longevity and continuity, I offer
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html">this blog</a> as some
kind of record of what happened in the last 30 years or so. I see it as

<h2 id="childless-vs-childful">Childless vs childful</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Notes accumulated during the day – not in any particular order. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
I keep a solid line between my personal life and blogging, learned the
hard way. When I started blogging in 1994, I didn’t have such a solid
line, and found that I couldn’t have a personal life if I made it
public. But now I want to reveal something. I am “childless” which is a
term I find pretty insulting, as if being child<i>ful</i> is the only
normal state of being.
</p>
<p>
I find, in general childful people are not great friends or family
members. They want special privileges and they often get them. If
childful vs childless is going to be an issue in this campaign, I say –
bring it on. We should have this discussion.
</p>
<p>
I’m often tempted to offer advice to the parents, but I won’t offer it
unless asked, except this. If you have children, there’s a good chance
one or more of them will not have children, and you should love them the
same, and provide models of acceptance while they’re growing up, by
bringing childless people into your home, so the kids know that this is
one of the legitimate choices in life, offering proof that you won’t
love them any less if they go down that path. And here’s the hard part,
imho, for people with children – <i>keep that promise. </i>
</p>
<p>
BTW, people say it’s seflish to not have children, but I don’t agree, in
fact I think it’s the opposite. There was a point in human evolution
where the struggle to survive for our species was fed by procreation,
but some time in the last hundred years we crossed a line, where
increasing human population worked against species survival. Our
understanding of the meaning of procreating, like so much else about our
civilization, has not yet caught up with the current reality.

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I&#39;ve noticed some of my automation failing on Red Hat-derivative OSes like Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux. The reason for this has to do with the inclusion of a &lt;code&gt;curl-minimal&lt;/code&gt; package in some distros, which conflicts with &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; if you try installing the full package.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Unfortunately, the fix for this is a little strange, and so only ends up
in Ansible’s
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/dnf_module.html">dnf</a>
module, not in the more cross-compatible

<p>
Since boosting my Pi 5 from the default 2.4 GHz clock to
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-5-can-overclock-314-ghz">3.14
GHz on Pi Day</a>, I’ve wanted to go faster. Especially since many other
users have topped my Geekbench scores since then :)
</p>
<p>
In March, Raspberry Pi introduced new firmware that unlocked frequencies
above 3,000 MHz for overclocking. This summer,
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">NUMA
Emulation patches</a> boosted performance another 5-10% through memory
access optimizations.

But even with a

sample</a> Pi 5, I haven’t seen anybody go much beyond 3.1 or 3.2 GHz.
The problem seemed to be power supply—the Pi’s firmware limits the SoC
to a maximum of 1.000V.

<p>
Auto manufacturers are
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cars-are-now-rolling-computers-so-how-long-will-they-get-updates-automakers-cant-say/">just
starting to realize</a> the problems of supporting the software in older
models:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Today’s phones are able to receive updates six to eight years after
their purchase date. Samsung and Google provide Android OS updates and
security updates for seven years. Apple
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">halts servicing</a>
products seven years after they stop selling them.
</p>
<p>
That might not cut it in the auto world, where the average age of cars
on US roads is only going up. A
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/average-age-vehicles-united-states-2024.html">recent
report</a> found that cars and trucks just reached a new record average
age of 12.6 years, up two months from 2023. That means the car software
hitting the road today needs to work­—and maybe even improve—­beyond 2036.
The average length of smartphone ownership is just …

wanted to know whether I should just refuse delivery, or accept it and

and it gave me a detailed reply. Apple’s chatbot saw it as a “technical”
question and wasn’t prepared to help. Sales support is one of those
applications where cost is totally justified. A human helper would cost
a lot more I imagine than a LLM chat system. I tried calling

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The new tool the research project is unleashing on deepfakes, called
“MISLnet”, evolved from years of data derived from detecting fake images
and video with tools that spot changes made to digital video or images.
These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames,
manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames.
</p>
<p>
Such tools work because a digital camera’s algorithmic processing
creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships
between values are very different in user-generated or images edited
with apps like Photoshop…

2024-07-27 Tired of programming
</h1>
<p>
My summer break has begun, and I am tired.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on some sort of editor. I contributed some lines to
Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to
text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much
effort. So now I’m trying to use ed again… I’m experimenting with using
<code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it’s not so bad if you’re
just writing, like writing an email. But really writing, organizing,
moving things around… it really doesn’t work all that well. I had
imagined a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is
your grumpiest of companions! – and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu
site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of
editor would I need to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing
capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point. Then I
dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain. Then I
started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz,
Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per
language), and on and on. It’s too much.
</p>
<p>
But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed? Am I in fact
reinventing vi, badly?
</p>
<p>
<a href="2024-06-01-editor">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</a>,
<a href="2024-06-13-anvil">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple
cursors</a>, <a href="2024-07-24-ed">2024-07-24 My ed, wondering</a>
</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a
Javascript web application in production. This is a single file, a
stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a
native application that would work without a browser.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or
Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding. Vanilla JS and the
browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for
this Common Lisp app I’m looking at really makes me want to drop it all
for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead. It can’t be that
bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for
free…
</p>
<p>
And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various
states of neglect is draining. Switching from one to the other is tricky
since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other
is lacking. But the first one is lacking a gfx port. Then again, I guess
I can add circle drawing using lines.
</p>
<p>
Everything takes so long. So damn long.

<p>
A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on
browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks
were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was
Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep
<a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It’s great.
</p>
<p>
I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and
when new items get added, a feed is updated. Just a little program… it
doesn’t seem hard. So I gave it try. I like documentation first, these
days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that
perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses. So I needed
to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be? It’s a bit harder than
writing it in Perl. Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too. Or use
SQLite to store data. It keeps getting harder.
</p>
<p>
Well, I spent some time on it and now I’m tired again. This too, takes
too long!
</p>
<p>
I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?
</p>
<p>
I should read a book.

</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I
decided to spice up my shell life…
</p>
<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>
<p>
I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to
set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and
contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you know of other such tools.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the
bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl:
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>.
🔖 🤝 <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" />
</p>
<p>
I installed a daily cron job:
</p>
<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>
<p>
The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files…
feed-file</code>. The files it looks at once a day are my
<a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>. The feed it generates is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>. The database it uses is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40
items for the feed.
</p>
<p>
When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the
Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted –
they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the
whole category, which pretty weird.

<p>There have been some changes both on the hardware and the software
side. The hardware part was quite important yet simple: the current CPU
module has a WiFi chip without any cooling. As the CPU is relatively hod
(at least for the ARM) the WiFi part is hot, too - and it seems to work
bad when hot. So the quick fix is to add a small thermal pad (about 2 mm
thick) so the chip will be connected to the heatsink. The long-term
solution would be to use a cooler CPU.</p>

Twitter broke the API, it was a quick way for me to channel items from
my blog to almost all the people who follow me on the social web. Now it
isn’t even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing
tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything
like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can’t even reach
it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I
absolutely can’t do this on my own. No time, patience, and it’s not my
job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be
spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This
is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source
thing.</p>
