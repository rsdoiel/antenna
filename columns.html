2024-11-19 Suicide rates in Switzerland
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke" title="@mekkaokereke@hachyderm.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mekkaokereke">@mekkaokereke</span></a> was
posting about black men and suicides, saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Black men have one of the lowest age adjusted suicide rates.üëçüèø White
men? One of the highest. ‚Ä¶ Self imposed masculinity pressure isn‚Äôt the
only reason so many men are depressed. But it‚Äôs a big one.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It reminded me of some numbers for Switzerland I seen a long time ago. I
decided to go looking.
</p>
<p>
Here the suicide rate by gender in Switzerland. I knew it was bad, of
course. Men here are often lonely, the emotional labour of maintaining
relationships often falls on the shoulders of women so when men are
alone, they don‚Äôt manage to build the kind of network required to stay
well. And thus, where as the suicide rates are going down, men are still
doing very badly.
</p>
<p>
And this is without assisted suicides.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-19-suicide-1.jpg" alt="A graph showing the peak in 1980 with suicides of about 14 women and 37 men per 100000 inhabitants and a new low in 2020 with about 5 women and 14 men per 100000 inhabitants." /><br>

</p>
<p>
More specifically, the suicide rates go up, dramatically. The graph
below is again without assisted suicides (which are legal in
Switzerland).
</p>
<p>
Making friends and maintaining relationships requires emotional labour,
trust, openness, vulnerability, and it can be hard. I know it‚Äôs hard for
me and unfortunately I see myself in these statistics. We must learn to
do better.
</p>
<p>
Patriarchy is not helping.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-19-suicide-2.jpg" alt="Suicide rate for women starts at around 5 per 100000 inhabitants in teenage years and goes up to around 10 per 100000. For men, however, it starts at around 10 per 100000 and goes up to 60 per 100000 when they are about 80 years old." /><br>

In the aftermath of the 737 MAX crashes, I wrote
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/04/first-we-change-how-people-behave.html"><i>First
We Change How People Behave</i></a>.:<br />
<blockquote>
The fundamental problem of autonomous vehicles sharing roads is that
until you get to Level 5, you have a hand-off problem. The closer you
get to Level 5, the worse the hand-off problem.
</blockquote>
Three years earlier, Paul Vixie was more specific in
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/disciplining-unoccupied-mind-paul-vixie/"><i>Disciplining
the Unoccupied Mind</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Simply put, if you give a human brain the option to perform other tasks
than the one at hand, it will do so. No law, no amount of training, and
no insistence by the manufacturer of an automobile will alter this fact.
It‚Äôs human nature, immalleable. So until and unless Tesla can robustly
and credibly promise an autopilot that will imagine every threat a human
could imagine, and can use the same level of caution as the best human
driver would use, then the world will be better off without this
feature.
</blockquote>
Follow me below the fold for an update on the hand-off problem.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The 737 MAX crashes were a
specific, especially difficult, case of the hand-off problem. It wasn‚Äôt
that the automation recognized a situation it couldn‚Äôt cope with and
initiated a hand-off to the humans. It was that the automation was wrong
about the situation and the pilots had to decide to
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/simulations-show-lion-air-737-crew-had-little-time-to-prevent-disaster/">override
it</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In testing performed in a simulator, Boeing test pilots recreated the
conditions aboard Lion Air Flight 610 when it went down in the Java Sea
in October, killing 189 people. The tests showed that the crew of the
737 MAX 8 would have only had 40 seconds to respond to the Maneuvering
Characteristics Augmentation System‚Äôs (MCAS‚Äôs) attempts to correct a
stall that wasn‚Äôt happening before the aircraft went into an
unrecoverable dive, according to a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/business/boeing-simulation-error.html">report
by The New York Times</a>.<br /> <br /> While the test pilots were able
to correct the issue with the flip of three switches, their training on
the systems far exceeded that of the Lion Air crew‚Äîand that of the
similarly doomed Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which crashed earlier
this month. The Lion Air crew was heard on cockpit voice recorders
checking flight manuals in an attempt to diagnose what was going on
moments before they died.

people don‚Äôt get about why planes crash</i></a> stresses the hand-off
problem:
<blockquote>
‚ÄúIn the crash of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 landing in San Francisco
in 2013, investigators determined that a contributing factor was the
pilots‚Äô over-reliance on automated systems which led to an erosion in
their flying skills. The investigation of the fatal flight of an Air
France Airbus A330 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009 led to the
conclusion that the complexity of the fly-by-wire airplane befuddled the
pilots.<br /> <br /> The 737 Max probes suggest another variation on the
conundrum: Technology intended to protect against pilot error trapped
the pilots. Helpless in the cockpit, they were unable to do as Captain
Sully did and save the day.‚Äù

Now, <i>Road and Track</i>‚Äôs Joe Kucinski reports that
<a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a62919131/tesla-has-highest-fatal-accident-rate-of-all-auto-brands-study/"><i>Tesla
Has the Highest Fatal Accident Rate of All Auto Brands, Study
Finds</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The study was conducted on model year 2018‚Äì2022 vehicles, and focused on
crashes between 2017 and 2022 that resulted in occupant fatalities.
Tesla vehicles have a fatal crash rate of 5.6 per billion miles driven,
according to the study; Kia is second with a rate of 5.5, and Buick
rounds out the top three with a 4.8 rate. The average fatal crash rate
for all cars in the United States is 2.8 per billion vehicle miles
driven.
</blockquote>
How is this possible when ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù is standard on Teslas? The analyst
behind the study
<a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a62919131/tesla-has-highest-fatal-accident-rate-of-all-auto-brands-study/">explains</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
So, why are Teslas ‚Äî and many other ostensibly safe cars on the list ‚Äî
involved in so many fatal crashes? ‚ÄúThe models on this list likely
reflect a combination of driver behavior and driving conditions, leading
to increased crashes and fatalities,‚Äù iSeeCars executive analyst Karl
Brauer said in the report. ‚ÄúA focused, alert driver, traveling at a
legal or prudent speed, without being under the influence of drugs or
alcohol, is the most likely to arrive safely regardless of the vehicle
they‚Äôre driving.‚Äù
</blockquote>
<p>Precisely. It seems very likely that, lulled by the experience of
being cocooned in high-tech safety systems, the drivers were not focused
or alert, ready to take over from the automation in a split second when
danger threatened.<br /></p>

<h1 id="2024-11-18-being-on-small-fediverse-instances">
2024-11-18 Being on small fediverse instances
</h1>
<p>
The fediverse is the network of social media instances that communicate
via ActivityPub, mostly Mastodon but others exist as well. My own
instance runs GoToSocial. The benefit is that nobody can force you to
look at ads or sell your data.
</p>
<p>
Running such an instance means that you need the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a server and the admin skills to run it
</li>
<li>
space to store all the media files (my media folder currently uses about
19 GiB)
</li>
<li>
space to store all the messages (my database currently uses about 9 GiB)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But if you have a friend who runs one, or you‚Äôre a member of an
association that runs one, and you trust their admins, you can hop on.
Some friendly souls even run servers out of their own pockets, for free,
relying on donations to keep their servers up and running.
</p>
<p>
What I want to say: it‚Äôs possible to be part of the independent web.
</p>
<p>
There are, unfortunately, also problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
on larger instances, moderator burnout sometimes happens
</li>
<li>
on growing instances, budgets sometimes grow out of control
</li>
<li>
many people are harassed out of sight of the public
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think some people might prefer the bigger corporate players:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Twitter/X
</li>
<li>
Bluesky
</li>
<li>
Threads
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are a lot more people on those networks, that‚Äôs for sure.
Personally, I follow about 700 people with three accounts and I have
about the same number of people following me, I think. This is plenty! I
think it would be an illusion for me to think that in network with
millions more people my reach and influence would reach new heights. On
the contrary, the algorithm would probably bury my posts and even the
people who do want to see my posts would have to dig for them, past ads,
sponsored posts and posts with higher engagement metric.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that we often imagine our alternatives selectively. We
imagine the grass to be greener and our prospects to be better,
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
If you‚Äôre looking to get started, I‚Äôd be happy to help.
</p>
<p>
Some more notes: The Mastodon Client protocol is wholly separate from
the typical ActivityPub server-to-server protocol and not the same as
the rarely implemented ActivityPub server-to-client protocol. It‚Äôs
limited, but good enough for a large number of applications.
</p>
<p>
The two main uses I have seen:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
separate user interface implementations, be it new front-ends on the web
or apps on phones and desktops
</li>
<li>
bots
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ability to do all that without a corporation forcing you to only use
official apps so that they can spy on you or monetize you (forcing you
to watch the ads) is a great boon. In addition to that, some servers
have very different web front-ends and some servers (like the one I use,
GoToSocial), have no web front-end for reading and posting. This has
reduced the burden on developers considerably.

<p>
Although much attention is given to sophisticated, zero-click spyware
developed by companies like Israel‚Äôs NSO Group, the Italian spyware
marketplace has been able to operate relatively under the radar by
specializing in cheaper tools. According to an Italian Ministry of
Justice
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25260169-mod-bp-22-071-232_5622_1-4">document</a>,
as of December 2022 law enforcement in the country could rent spyware
for ‚Ç¨150 a day, regardless of which vendor they used, and without the
large acquisition costs which would normally be prohibitive.

<p>
As a result, thousands of spyware operations have been carried out by
Italian authorities in recent years, according to a ‚Ä¶

<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Zero-day vulnerabilities are
<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-317a">more
commonly used</a>, according to the Five Eyes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Key Findings</strong>
</p>
<p>
In 2023, malicious cyber actors exploited more zero-day vulnerabilities
to compromise enterprise networks compared to 2022, allowing them to
conduct cyber operations against higher-priority targets. In 2023, the
majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially
exploited as a zero-day, which is an increase from 2022, when less than
half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero-day.
</p>
<p>
Malicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting
vulnerabilities within two years after public disclosure of the
vulnerability. The utility of these vulnerabilities declines over time
as more systems are patched or replaced. Malicious cyber actors find
less utility from zero-day exploits when international cybersecurity
efforts reduce the lifespan of zero-day vulnerabilities‚Ä¶

I posted a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lb46hc76n22p">feature
request</a> on Bluesky that has gotten a lot of flow.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bluesky devs.. How about a compromise. Support inbound RSS. Let me enter
the URL of an RSS feed in settings. I‚Äôll ping a fixed location when the
feed updates. Would allow the same flow to go to other systems. This
would help a lot.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Imagine
a Bluesky-like network that you could post to through any blogging tool
that can create an RSS feed. Imagine the new tools that could be
created. All of a sudden a whole world of writing tools opens up.
</li>
<li>
It should happen faster than the proprietary format that Bluesky
defined, because RSS is so well understood in the developer world. Lots
of software out there for reading and writing. I have a couple of
toolkits of my own, for JavaScript, MIT licensed. In use in deployed
software so they work pretty well. (Knock wood.)
</li>
<li>
Also it would create an incentive for competitors to follow suit, and if
they do we suddenly have a strong and simple and broadly understood
basis for interop. It‚Äôs a brilliant competitive move, if they really
intend to give users choice, to not lock them in. It challenges their
competitors to follow suit. I don‚Äôt doubt that Mastodon would do it. And
Threads might even do it if they‚Äôre feeling competitive with Bluesky.
They‚Äôve already chosen ActivityPub as a basis for interop, but that‚Äôs
been slow to develop. RSS is so simple and well understood it should
take a small fraction of the time to adapt.
</li>
<li>
Bluesky has already pioneered in providing excellent outbound RSS
support. I helped them do it, a while back, before the huge onslaught of
users.
</li>
<li>
The fact that so many users loved the idea is enough to have made it
worthwhile to suggest it. But I wouldn‚Äôt be tremendously surprised if
they actually did it.

<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Why I haven‚Äôt created an account on <a href="https://sez.us/">sez.us</a>
yet.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They ask for my first and last name before I sign up. Ask for that info
later, after I‚Äôve created an account. I gave it a fake name to get to
the next screen.
</li>
<li>
Then they ask for my phone number. That‚Äôs when I hit the back button. I
already get too much spam on my phone, and the filters aren‚Äôt good
there. I am happy to provide an email address as my identifier as I do
on all other systems. Later, if I become a regular user, I don‚Äôt mind
providing the phone number as part of 2-factor identity, but not up
front.
</li>
<li>
Also I don‚Äôt like white on black letters. It‚Äôs hard for me to read. All
the competitive systems use black on white background. Offer it as an
option if it‚Äôs important to you, but please default to black on white.
</li>

<p>
When I try to log into the server using SSH it takes a long time. Why is
that? <code>iotop</code> doesn‚Äôt show anything suspicious. And yet,
since Saturday 18:00, <code>munin</code> shows that something is up.
</p>

<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a>

</p>
<p>
I was clearly doing something!
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs what I noticed: I uploaded a new version of the Norn bot, which
had an error. I replaced it. Was systemd spawning it again and again,
spamming the journal? Is that what caused the problem?
</p>
<p>
This is very strange.
</p>
<p>
But‚Ä¶ rebooting helped!

<p>
<strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Or did it? The initial connect to the web
server still seems to take a second or five. Once the initial handshake
is done, the site serves quickly. So what could it be? The problem seen
above really is gone.

<strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Around midnight, I was exchanging emails
with
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="akkartik">@akkartik</span></a> and
everything seemed slow again. Nearly eight hours later, the problem
seems to be gone. And the graph supports that. The question is: What
does this mean? If I‚Äôm assuming that I installed a faulty bot on
Saturday 18:00 and fixed it Sunday 18:00 (plus a reboot), what happened
from midnight to 2:00?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-8.jpg" alt="Another spike from 0:00 to 2:00." />
</p>
<p>
Strangely enough, this spike in CPU usage was not accompanied in a spike
in disk usage.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I noticed this morning: Not only is my SSH extremely
sluggish ‚Äì sometimes the command line takes half a minute or longer to
update ‚Äì but my IPv4 banlist also wasn‚Äôt around. I had to run
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> again to reconstruct it. I‚Äôve
been banning some more networks, too (mostly Contabo and Hetzner in
Germany). It doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping right now.
</p>
<p>
And while I‚Äôm snooping around: This hourly beat in Apache requests seems
like a clear sign of bot activity, too. Fuckers.

Buttigieg explains</a> what the Russians have done to the US. I see it
that way too. When
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/">Brian
Lehrer asked</a> a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest
Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election)
they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of
destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn‚Äôt have to
invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn‚Äôt think his plan would succeed so
spectacularly. BTW, I don‚Äôt think Trippi‚Äôs network is the answer, but
maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was
using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along
than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my
presence with only
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, in and out.
Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start
building. It‚Äôs why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as
a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last
couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new
shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when
people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.</p>
