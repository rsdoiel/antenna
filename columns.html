<h2 id="new-window-manager-niri">2025-03-15 New window manager:
niri</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-03-15-new-window-manager-niri">
2025-03-15 New window manager: niri
</h1>
<p>
I‚Äôm giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go. The
idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager (‚ÄúWayland compositor‚Äù)
is a better fit than just a tiling window manager. For tiling window
managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized. I really can‚Äôt
do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford. The
result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they‚Äôre
invisible and gone. I‚Äôm hoping that new windows popping up next to
existing windows makes it feel like a stack.
</p>
<p>
Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes
it already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is
that by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90¬∞
and that doesn‚Äôt work quite as well, maybe? I‚Äôm not sure. One of the
first changes I did was change the default widths from ‚Öì / ¬Ω / ‚Öî to 0.95
/ ‚Öî / ¬Ω with 0.95 being the default.
</p>

</p>
<p>
I didn‚Äôt find a solution for Gimp. And I already had no solution for
VASSAL under Sway. So for these applications, I still have Gnome
installed.
</p>
<p>
Currently my <code>~/.config/fish/conf.d/window-manager.fish</code>
says:
</p>
<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec startx
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty3&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec niri
</code></pre>
<p>
Oh well. üòÖ
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-03-19</strong>. I‚Äôm finding that there were too many
problems with apps that didn‚Äôt work or had very slow startup times. So
I‚Äôm back to <a href="2023-10-22-sway">using Sway</a>.

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is like that moment, five years ago, when we realized that Covid
was going to kill a lot of us but it hadn‚Äôt happened yet. A lot of
people weren‚Äôt yet aware. My
<a href="http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg">friend</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey">John Palfrey</a>,
who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn
and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I‚Äôm going to
publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the
places I‚Äôm hooked into.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lawyer friends and non-lawyer friends: has it become hard to say out
loud in public: ‚Äúwe believe in the rule of law in America‚Äù? That seems
not remotely controversial as a concept. The relative quiet on this
topic is what is striking me most at the moment.
</li>
<li>
It would be a good idea for our Republic to avoid sleepwalking through a
Constitutional crisis. Of course there are extremely talented lawyers
working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in
litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing,
to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law
slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the
rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with
impunity.
</li>
<li>
If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the
executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves
just one. This is not ‚Äúfancy law stuff‚Äù. This is ‚Äú4th grade civics
stuff‚Äù ‚Äì separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we
don‚Äôt teach civics enough in America‚Ä¶).
</li>
<li>
It is actually <em>not</em> more complicated than that. It can‚Äôt be that
hard to say out loud: ‚Äúwe value the rule of law in America‚Äù ‚Äì no matter
your politics or party.
</li>
</ul>

disrespectful of the Repubs, as a matter of principle. They were great.
Perfect. We need a voice for the Democrats on the social networks.

Would someone please send this to AOC, Jasmine Crockett, Bernie Sanders,
Mark Cuban, James Carville, anyone else you can think of.

The Dems only problem is there is no voice, no pulse, no heartbeat. Even
without this, they almost won the last election.

Really interesting research:

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: In human factor fields such as human-computer
interaction (HCI) and psychology, researchers have been concerned that
participants mostly come from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized,
Rich, and Democratic) countries. This WEIRD skew may hinder
understanding of diverse populations and their cultural differences. The
usable privacy and security (UPS) field has inherited many research
methodologies from research on human factor fields. We conducted a
literature review to understand the extent to which participant samples
in UPS papers were from WEIRD countries and the characteristics of the
methodologies and research topics in each user study recruiting Western
or non-Western participants. We found that the skew toward WEIRD
countries in UPS is greater than that in HCI. Geographic and linguistic
barriers in the study methods and recruitment methods may cause
researchers to conduct user studies locally. In addition, many papers
did not report participant demographics, which could hinder the
replication of the reported studies, leading to low reproducibility. To
improve geographic diversity, we provide the suggestions including
facilitate replication studies, address geographic and linguistic issues
of study/recruitment methods, and facilitate research on the topics for
non-WEIRD populations‚Ä¶

About a month ago,
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2025/02/indies-first-library-trip.html" title="Blog post from 15 Feb: Indie&#39;s First Library Trip">I
mentioned</a> that we‚Äôd borrowed a book from this ‚ÄúBig Ideas for Little
Philosophers‚Äù series called <cite>Love with Plato</cite>. Even though I
made fun of it at the time, it actually struck me as a really nice
little book, and since I was curious about what they would say about the
other philosophers, I shelled out to order the whole series:

<p>
I‚Äôm pleased to be able to offer a <em>positive</em> baby book review.
While I don‚Äôt think the books in this series have all accurately
outlined the core theses of their respective philosophers, they
<em>are</em> all really good, thoughtful books that invite kids to
grapple with questions about how we can be good and happy people.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned last time that I wished the library had had <cite>Equality
with Simone de Beauvoir</cite>, and that <em>is</em> one of my
favourites, now that I‚Äôve read it. It explains, in very ‚Äúsmall
child‚Äù-friendly language, that gender stereotypes are completely
artificial, that girls and boys are really much the same (we all cry
when we‚Äôre sad, and smile when we‚Äôre happy‚Ä¶), and that everyone is
happier when we can be our true selves without judgement. On one page
there is also a cute cat rockin‚Äô out with a walkman and a hula hoop in
the corner, so the book gets bonus points for that.
</p>
<p>
But then the one that really surprised me was <cite>Happiness with
Aristotle</cite>, which actually got into a deep rumination on
friendship and what it means to be a ‚Äútrue friend‚Äù that I think many
adults would benefit from reading. It talks about how some friends make
you laugh and feel good to spend time with, and other friends will help
you out when you need a hand, but a <em>true</em> friend is actually
someone who‚Äôll call you out on your shit, so you can grow as a person.
(Again, in kid-friendly language.) Not only that, but the book added
that before you can be a ‚Äútrue friend‚Äù to others, you need to be a ‚Äútrue
friend‚Äù to yourself, which means ‚Äúloving yourself as much as you love
your friends‚Äù. Like‚Ä¶ damn! Where was this book when I was 18‚Äì19 and
stuck in ‚ÄúI can fix him!‚Äù thinking? It‚Äôs so good! Again, I‚Äôm not sure
it‚Äôs an accurate description of the very core of Aristotelian
philosophy, but it‚Äôs a great message.
</p>
<p>
The books are board books (you know, the hard cardboard ones usually
intended for real babies), but they‚Äôre full of open-ended questions to
elicit discussion with a small child. I would love to read these with
Indie when she‚Äôs, like, five and actually able to engage with the ideas
therein. I‚Äôm glad to have bought our own copies, because I think we‚Äôll
get a lot of mileage out of them.
</p>
<p>
Having said this, the series <strong>is</strong> clearly missing a book
about one very important philosopher, one they could call something like
<cite>Communism with Marx</cite>. I guess we just can‚Äôt have it all üòî

Assisted Brute Force Cryptanalysis of GPRS, GSM, RFID, and TETRA: Brute

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Key lengths in symmetric cryptography are determined
with respect to the brute force attacks with current technology. While
nowadays at least 128-bit keys are recommended, there are many standards
and real-world applications that use shorter keys. In order to estimate
the actual threat imposed by using those short keys, precise estimates
for attacks are crucial.
</p>
<p>
In this work we provide optimized implementations of several widely used
algorithms on GPUs, leading to interesting insights on the cost of brute
force attacks on several real-word applications‚Ä¶

<h2 id="blogging-is-due-for-a-refresh">Blogging is due for a
refresh</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at
blogging. A few items, as examples.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
When RSS came along Markdown didn‚Äôt exist. The two technologies belong
together, imho.
</li>
<li>
Websockets have replaced long polling.
</li>
<li>
Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).
</li>
<li>
SQL is fast and the tools are much better.
</li>
<li>
The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn‚Äôt exist last time
we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from
twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have
innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But one thing stays the same ‚Äì all the components are replaceable.
Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist,
and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant.
