The ProtonMail people are accusing Microsoft’s new Outlook for Windows
app of
<a href="https://proton.me/blog/outlook-is-microsofts-new-data-collection-service">conducting
extensive surveillance</a> on its users. It shares data with
advertisers, a lot of data:

The lawsuit has been

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Google has agreed to delete “billions of data records” the company

<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24527732-brown-v-google-llc-settlement-agreement?responsive=1&#038;title=1">documents
filed in federal court</a> in San Francisco on Monday. The agreement,
part of a settlement in a class action lawsuit filed in 2020, caps off
years of disclosures about Google’s practices that shed light on how
much data the tech giant siphons from its users­—even when they’re in
private-browsing mode.

<p>date: 2024-04-02, updated: 2024-04-04, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The cybersecurity world got really lucky last week. An intentionally
placed backdoor in xz Utils, an open-source compression utility, was
pretty much
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">accidentally
discovered</a> by a Microsoft engineer—weeks before it would have been
incorporated into both Debian and Red Hat Linux. From
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">ArsTehnica</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the
way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the
executable file used to make remote SSH connections. Anyone in
possession of a predetermined encryption key could stash any code of
their choice in an SSH login certificate, upload it, and execute it on
the backdoored device. No one has actually seen code uploaded, so it’s
not known what code the attacker planned to run. In theory, the code
could allow for just about anything, including stealing encryption keys
or installing malware…

Applied Cryptography, for those who don’t read the internet news, is a

Schneier is a data security expert with a master’s degree in computer
science. According to his followers, he is a hero who has finally

Muyao Shen explains the concept of the Left Curve in

Big Winners of This Crypto Bull Market Are the `Left
Curves’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There is a surprising amount of respect for people who appear to know
nothing about the industry. They’re known as the “left curves.”<br />
<br /> The nickname comes from a popular meme in crypto that shows a
bell curve with investors on the left who know nothing, or very little,
and those in the fat middle of the curve who know something about
crypto. On the right are investors who seemingly know everything.

Why does Shen think those who know nothing about cryptocurrencies are
the big winners? Because they are jumping in to yet another
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves">cruptocurrency
bubble</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For example, a crypto project with pseudonymous co-founders including
“Smokey The Bera” and “Dev Bear” has become a unicorn after it raised
millions of dollars from institutional investors such as Brevan Howard
Digital. Another token with no real utility — only a cute picture of a
dog wearing a hat — has increased by more than 1,400 times its value
from three months ago. A developer of a sloth-themed memecoin called
Slerf claimed they accidentally burned a large amount of the tokens
after raising $10 million.<br /> <br /> What a great time to be a left
curve! In this bull market, forget about highbrow ideas like revamping
Wall Street. Give up on dreams of replacing traditional artwork with
nonfungible tokens. Instead, don’t overthink it. Just

How did this happen? How did crypto’s greatest comeback take place so
fast, so hilariously and — at times — so stupidly? Why did crypto
evangelists give up their dreams? At its core, it’s because the market
is still living under the shadows of past catastrophes like FTX’s
collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup.<br /> <br /> In the past bull markets,
when Bitcoin went up, everything else went up amid small-scale rotations
between major and small-cap coins. But in this bull market, the rotation
is more severe: As Solana went up in the past month, the price of Ether
went down dramatically — a simple piece of evidence that shows there’s
less money being thrown at the crypto market today than three years ago.

The “past catastrophes like FTX’s collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup” may be
old news but to their victims they aren’t even close to over. The best
FTX’s creditors can hope for is to get back what their HODL-ings were
worth <i>before</i> Bitcoin took off moon-wards, and who knows when that
might happen.<br /> <br /> Kevin T. Dugan’s
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html"><i>The
Crypto World Has a New Villain</i></a> starts with the story of one
victim of yet another “past catastrophe”:<br />
<blockquote>
“I had no idea who Barry Silbert was or anything until after November
16, 2022,” Eric Asquith told me. That date was when he was pretty sure
he had lost his family’s savings of $1,052,000.
</blockquote>
Asquith wasn’t on the Left Curve but just a bit
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">left
of the middle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He didn’t buy bitcoin or other meme tokens. Instead, earlier that year,
he moved over cash from his business — just a little at first, then more
— and converted it into digital currencies he thought were as good as
cash. The digital coins were called GUSD, and each was worth exactly $1
because the company that minted them —
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/12/how-the-winkleviis-second-act-in-bitcoin-went-bad.html">Tyler
and Cameron Winklevoss’s crypto exchange, Gemini</a> — backed each one
with real money and assets.
</blockquote>
But Asquith’s GUSD were deposited into Gemini’s Earn program to get its
5.5% interest, far more than banks were paying. But Asquith and the
other Earn depositors were far enough left on the curve that they didn’t
know Earn
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">wasn’t
like a bank savings account</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
What Asquith did not fully understand was that his money was no longer
with Gemini. In one sense, Genesis, a crypto company owned by Barry
Silbert had it, but even that wasn’t quite true. Soon-to-collapse hedge
funds with names like Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research — Sam
Bankman-Fried’s personal fund — were quietly borrowing from Silbert’s
shop. Asquith’s money, and that of tens of thousands of others, was
being used by SBF and others to make giant bets on some of the
highest-flying, most volatile digital tokens.
</blockquote>
Then Terra/Luna collapsed and things started to fall apart. Amy Castor

<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/11/25/crypto-collapse-ftx-first-day-hearing-genesis-screws-dcg-silvergate-bank/">reported</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of Genesis’s biggest customers was Three Arrows Capital (3AC), who
they’d lent $2.4 billion. After 3AC blew up in May, DCG assumed $1.2
billion of the liabilities to keep the hit off Genesis’ books. Genesis
had been the single largest creditor of 3AC.<br /> <br /> Genesis also
had money on FTX. As FTX was falling apart, Genesis tweeted on November
8 that they had no exposure, and it was fine. Two days later, Genesis
admitted they had “~$175M in locked funds in our FTX trading account,”
and they were not fine.<br /> <br /> Genesis scrambled to find more
capital. Genesis and DCG needed $1 billion in emergency credit by 10
a.m. EST on November 14, but didn’t get it. Even Binance turned them
down.<br /> <br /> So two days later, Genesis suspended
withdrawals,<br /> …<br /> One of Genesis’s biggest customers is Gemini
Trust, run by the Winklevoss twins, that operated its own “yield”
program, Gemini Earn, for retail investors.<br /> <br /> Gemini was
supposed to be the safe exchange — but it was exposed to risks via
Genesis. There’s now $700 million that Gemini Earn customers can’t
withdraw — because it’s stuck on Genesis.
</blockquote>
Gemini
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/01/12/crypto-collapse-dcgs-check-kiting-comes-home-to-roost-nexo-raided-voyager-sale-to-binance-progresses-unbanking-the-banked/">tried
to get the cash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On January 8, Gemini terminated the Master Loan Agreement with Genesis
and emailed customers accordingly. This “requires Genesis to return all
outstanding assets in the program.” Genesis did not return the funds by
the end of January 10 — so they were officially in default on the loan.
At this point, Genesis can pull the pin and try to put Gemini into
involuntary bankruptcy.
</blockquote>
They did, and there followed a year of legal wrangling between Gemini,
Genesis and Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis.
The
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/01/13/sec-sues-genesis-and-gemini-genesis-owes-3-billion-to-creditors/">SEC
sued both Gemini and Genesis</a>, and so did
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">the
New York Attorney General</a>. While the wrangling continued, another of
the semi-regular cryptocurrency bull markets took off until
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">in
February 2024</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the victims, Silbert’s now-bankrupt crypto-lending operation, the
Winklevoss twins, and regulators hammered out a deal to pay everybody
back in full. The crypto bull market of 2024 made it possible to pay
back Earn customers not some fraction of what they invested but the
generally much higher sum of what their holdings would now be worth.
</blockquote>
Everyone started
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">cele:wbrating</a>;<br />
<blockquote>
Except there was Silbert. Earn victims who had been unfamiliar with him
would soon learn that he had made his first fortune by studying the ins
and outs of the bankruptcy system and using it to his financial
advantage. Since February, the billionaire investor has been relying on
a controversial interpretation of bankruptcy law to stop Asquith and all
the other victims from getting the bigger payout, the one based on
current prices. Instead, to simplify a bit, he would prefer to keep that
money himself. “DCG cannot support a plan that not only deprives DCG of
its corporate governance rights but also violates United States
bankruptcy code,” a spokeswoman for the company said.<br /> <br /> The
victims have taken to calling it “the Barry Trade”: If Silbert is
successful, he would be able to pocket as much as $1 billion in funds
that would otherwise be returned to them. At the very least, Silbert may
substantially delay the money being returned to Earn customers.<br />
…<br /> Silbert’s legal logic is that the bankruptcy code sets a date to
value victims’ claims in U.S. dollars, and in Genesis’ case, it just
happened to be around the market’s lows.
</blockquote>
People started
<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-twins-crypto-firms-charged-by-sec">talking
to the press about Gemini</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Former Gemini employees told The Beast that Gemini Earn’s terms and
conditions were highly dubious from the outset. One staffer recalled
reading the fine print for the first time, saying, “[We] were like,
‘Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me?’”<br /> <br /> Among those
terms: Customer assets were loaned out on “an unsecured basis,” which
meant that their money would not be safe in the event of a market
collapse. The deposits were also not insured, nor were they guaranteed
against errors or fraudulent activity.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">And
Genesis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Whatever Gemini may or may not have done pales in comparison to what
you see at Genesis, which was more than negligent when it came to
protecting customer assets and complying with general best practices,”
one former employee said. Among those problems, the person said, was not
screening clients who were on, say, the Treasury’s blacklists — an
allegation that was supported by a separate January suit filed by New
York Department of Financial Services.
</blockquote>
This isn’t a “past catastrophe”. For the victims
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">there
is no end in sight</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A ruling isn’t expected until April. Since the settlement announcement,
the victims have resigned themselves to an even longer wait as Silbert
continues to fight. “A year ago, there was a deal that was proposed.
Everyone was celebrating in a very similar way,” Asquith said. “Now,
I’ll believe it when it’s in my account.”
</blockquote>
<p>This case, like Dickens’
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce">Jarndyce v
Jarndyce</a>, will run and run.<br /></p>
