An advocacy groups is
<a href="https://www.404media.co/lawsuit-argues-warrantless-use-of-flock-surveillance-cameras-is-unconstitutional/">filing</a>
a Fourth Amendment challenge against automatic license plate readers.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The City of Norfolk, Virginia, has installed a network of cameras that
make it functionally impossible for people to drive anywhere without
having their movements tracked, photographed, and stored in an
AI-assisted database that enables the warrantless surveillance of their
every move. This civil rights lawsuit seeks to end this dragnet
surveillance program,” the
<a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-1-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit
notes</a>. “In Norfolk, no one can escape the government’s 172
unblinking eyes,” it continues, referring to the 172 Flock cameras
currently operational in Norfolk. The Fourth Amendment protects against
unreasonable searches and seizures and has been ruled in many cases to
protect against warrantless government surveillance, and the lawsuit
specifically says Norfolk’s installation violates that.”…

<p>I think it’s probably too late, anyway. Journalism should have
reported, constantly, that the house is on fire. And nothing else.
Biden’s age didn’t enter into it you fools. The much bigger story was
and is that Hitler wants to be president, and this time he has a plan.
It was true then and it’s true now. The next question is what will Biden
do if Trump wins. It was tough watching Obama greet Trump at the White
House in 2016. I can’t see Biden doing that. I wonder what ideas they’re

might just have all media people euthanized.

2024-10-22 Preparing Chinese tea for beginners
</h1>
<p>
This is a continuation of
<a href="2021-07-12_Preparing_Japanese_green_tea_for_beginners">2021-07-12
Preparing Japanese green tea for beginners</a>. This page is about the
Chinese and Taiwanese tea I often drink: loose leaf oolong tea and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu%27er_tea">pu’er tea</a>
(fermented tea) in a brick (round disks about as big as two hands next
to each other). That would be tea costing around CHF 30/50g or CHF
220/375g.
</p>
<p>
The rule I use is simple:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
boil water
</li>
<li>
wet the tea leaves for a few seconds and throw the water away (“washing”
the leaves)
</li>
<li>
pour more hot water onto the leaves and let it steep for 1 minute
</li>
<li>
drink it
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Repeat the 1 min steep as often as you want.
</p>
<p>
I usually try to do this at least three times. I often find that the
fourth time around the flavour is much reduced and I will stop. In
addition to that, by the time I have drunk three cups of tea I’m usually
in a different mood and no longer into tea.
</p>
<p>
If the tea is good, it doesn’t matter if you forget it while it is
steeping. It doesn’t turn into the kind of bitterness that zombifies
your tongue. It’s just bitter but still tasty.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I forget the empty pot or cup and resume the steeping hours
later. In this time, bacteria haven’t eaten away the leaves. There is no
mould growing on the leaves. Just pour that hot water, let it steep for
a minute and keep drinking tea!
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I know that the tea is very mild and I’ll let it steep for 2
minutes the second time around and 3 minutes the third time around. No
problem at all. Tea is flexible. Good tea remains good tea. It tastes a
little different but it always tastes good.

<p>Former president Trump’s closing economic argument for the American
people is that putting a high tariff wall around the country will bring
in so much foreign money that it will fund domestic programs and bring
down the deficit, enabling massive tax cuts for the wealthy and
corporations.</p>

You said on your blog that you can’t imagine moving from WordPress
because “there isn’t anything else out there that’s offering something
new for the writers.” What about Ghost?
</p>
<p>
Bob’s site is <a href="https://www.bobsassone.com/">bobsassone.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>My response</b>:
</p>
<p>
Sorry it wasn’t clear – but as far as I know, Ghost isn’t built on
WordPress. It’s a completely different product.
</p>
<p>
My writing app runs on WordPress. So you can use it with your existing
wordpress.com sites.
</p>
<p>
It’s a browser-based JavaScript app that hooks into WordPress via the
wpidentity package I wrote.
</p>
<p>
And the codebase I’ve built will support lots of editors built using
WordPress as the backend.

I <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/21.html#a131028">posted a
bit</a> about the “million-plus Americans who died from Covid during
Trump’s tenure.” It wasn’t worded carefully enough, I should’ve had a
lawyer review it. Yes, a lot of them died during Biden’s tenure too. But
I don’t think of it that way. I think of the big con-job Trump pulled,
first denying there was a virus, then saying it would be done by Easter,
then telling people not to wear masks, then ridiculing Biden because he
was isolating during the campaign, and of course injecting bleach and
all the other
<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/">bullshit</a>.
Then the mofo got Covid, and our doctors saved his life, and he never
said geez I was wrong about this, it’s a killer, and btw thanks for
saving my life. So yes this was yet another mess a Democrat had to clean
up left by his Republican predecessor. Recall the economic collapse Bush
left for Obama. And btw, I used to vote Republican, so don’t tell me I’m
biased. There are a lot of lawyers out there who think a turn of a word
can exonerate the depravity and incompetence of Trump. Hopefully he’s
the worst the Repubs have to throw at us, but who knows what they will
come up with. And for crying out loud, if you haven’t voted yet, save us
from concentration camps and
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-where-rnc-delegates-stand-on-immigration">mass
deportation</a>. One million Americans dead is far too many, let’s not
try to top that. Thanks.

<h2 id="the-problem-with-podcasts">The Problem with Podcasts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>Why does every podcast have a six-minute lead of proverbial
throat-clearing, self-promotion, and advertising? I can understand that
mega podcasts like Joe Rogan’s have to deal with this — advertisers are
throwing money at people like him and Tim Ferriss.  The problem is more
acute with relatively smaller podcasts. I listen to many “intellectually
curious” podcasts that focus on subjects such as science,
history, design, and …</p>

<h2 id="hammers">Hammers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I bet if you were someone who could make a hammer that would have been a
good stable job for years, centuries even. Almost everyone needs a
hammer at some point in their life.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, where’d you get that hammer?”<br /> “Oh, you gotta talk to
Bartholomew.”
</p>
<p>
Then some guy, Greg, would see how busy the hammersmith is making
hammers one at-a-time and say, “I’m going to make hammers one hundred at
a time!” He’d pay Bartholomew not to make him one hammer, but to make a
mold that could make one hundred hammers at a time. Greg has rich
parents, he can afford this sort of risky business venture. One hundred
hammers for the price of ten, that’s profit.
</p>
<p>
After the hammer mold, Bartholomew would still get paid. No one actually
likes pouring molten iron and hammering, but Bartholomew doesn’t mind.
He’s making less money per hammer, but he’s also producing more hammers
with a lot less effort, so it nets out okay. The job is less interesting
– making hammers and nothing else – but he didn’t like being a salesman
and dealing with wayward customer requests anyways. There’s lots of
money in churning out hammers this way, it’s more efficient and people
like Greg love selling them and making money. Bartholomew buys himself a
new ox cart.
</p>
<p>
Then some other guy, Jeff, seeing all those hammers and all that money,
would say “I’m going to make a machine that makes a million hammers a
day.” Jeff knows a regional lord who is friends with the king and has
big treasure chests. He’d hire Bartholomew and his hammersmith friends
to build a giant complex machine with whistles and gauges and a furnace
that makes ten hammers a second. A million hammers a day for the price
of a thousand hammers, <em>now that’s profit!</em>
</p>
<p>
The profit charts are going up. Hammers are about as cheap as possible
to mass produce… except now Bartholomew and his hammersmith friends are
starting to catch the ire of bookkeepers. They’re starting to look
expensive compared to the penny hammers that sell for $10. They fire
Bartholomew. He’s given three months of pay, which is nice, but in
exchange he has to sign a contract saying he’ll never make another
hammer machine again in his life. Hopefully Bartholomew squirreled away
enough money to retire with dignity, otherwise what’s an old hammersmith
do when there’s no more hammers to make?

I <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/21.html#a131028">posted a
bit</a> about the “million-plus Americans who died from Covid during
Trump’s tenure.” It wasn’t worded carefully enough, I should’ve had a
lawyer review it. Yes, a lot of them died during Biden’s tenure too. But
I don’t think of it that way. I think of the big con-job Trump pulled,
first denying there was a virus, then saying it would be done by Easter,
then telling people not to wear masks, then ridiculing Biden because he
was isolating during the campaign, and of course injecting bleach and
all the other
<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/">bullshit</a>.
Then the mofo got Covid, and our doctors saved his life, and he never
said geez I was wrong about this, it’s a killer, and btw thanks for
saving my life. So yes this was yet another mess a Democrat had to clean
up left by his Republican predecessor. Recall the economic collapse Bush
left for Obama. And btw, I used to vote Republican, so don’t tell me I’m
biased. There are a lot of lawyers out there who think a turn of a word
can exonerate the depravity and incompetence of Trump. Hopefully he’s
the worst the Repubs have to throw at us, but who knows what they will
come up with. And for crying out loud, if you haven’t voted yet, save us
from concentration camps and
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-where-rnc-delegates-stand-on-immigration">mass
deportation</a>. One million Americans dead is far too many, let’s not
try to top that. Thanks.</p>

<h2 id="im-sticking-with-wordpress">I’m sticking with WordPress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m continuing to develop on WordPress. I see the opportunity regardless
of what else is going on.
</p>
<p>
I could be wrong, I have been before. I kept using Twitter for identity
after Musk took over, even though as time went by it was increasingly
obvious that developers weren’t part of his plan. I’ve been there
before, with Apple, after Jobs came back. We had a great developer
community for the web on the Mac, better than anything on Windows or
Unix, and the management before Jobs, Heidi Roizen advising Gil Amelio,
seemed to value our contribution, even if we weren’t prospering. But
there was a moment when Jobs introduced the open source equivalent of
some of our products – and that basically spelled the end of our little
adventure, since Apple was putting the spotlight on them and not us.
</p>
<p>
But it doesn’t always go that way. I kept investing in the Mac in 1985,
a very bad year for Apple, and in 1986 we had a huge hit, and because we
were almost alone in sticking it out, we were rewarded with booming
sales. Of course it mattered that MORE was a lovely product. But if no
one looks, it doesn’t matter how lovely it is!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the WordPress world is huge. Far bigger than the blogosphere in
the 90s and 00s. Maybe somehow the trouble with WordPress will mean that
people who see WordPress as a writing platform will all leave now, or
stop considering new ways of writing. But honestly I don’t think that’s
very likely. I have a few sites at wordpress.com that are archives, that
I pay for, that I will continue to pay for. My father’s memorial site,
for example. Things would have to get incomprehensibly bad for me to
consider moving it and where exactly would I move it?
</p>
<p>
But on the other hand, there isn’t anything else out there that’s
offering something new for the writers. I think I’m pretty much alone
working in this area. And maybe people need some good news?
</p>
<p>
My new product is a medium size writing tool. Less than a full word
processor and more than a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
box</a>. I think there are a lot of WordPress users who will like it.
And I think there’s a chance they might notice it. So I’m going all the
way with this one. I may lose the bet, but wtf, let’s give it a try.

<p>
Every fucking second‽
</p>
<p>
Now, a decision needs to be made:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I could ban all the requests this bot makes by banning the specific user
agent string.
</li>
<li>
I could ban the networks that host this bot on the premise that they’ll
probably also host other harmful bots.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Guess which option I’m taking?
</p>
<p>
Remember: <a href="2023-10-04-search">2023-10-04 Search engines, the
deal is off!</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For a while it seemed that we all benefited from search engines –
authors and readers both. These days, you’ll find that search results
are full of garbage sites. Big sites with the most flatulent of pages
explaining in great detail why the thing you’re looking for is important
and how to do it, clearly optimized for an ad company and not for a
reader. Big sites that have a gazillion answers are preferred over small
and individual sites. Perhaps that’s easier. Perhaps it allows them to
diffuse responsibility for the garbage, I don’t know. The effect is, in
any case, that there is no benefit to search engines for small site
authors, either. I was unable to find my own pages on the search
engines. If you you are a small site owner and you think you can find
your own pages on Google and Bing, I suspect that’s because they track
you. Try it on a different computer, anonymously. Perhaps you won’t find
yourself, either.
</p>
<p>
In any case, if I can’t get anything in return, both as a reader and as
an author, I feel that the deal is off. Why let them feed on my words
for free? Nay, at a cost, since they are keeping my website busy,
producing CO₂ and heating the planet for no benefit at all.
</p>
<p>
Better to block them all.
</p>

<h2 id="where-web-components-shine">Where web components shine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/cavern.jpg" alt="vintage illustration of three explorers in a cave holding torches to light their way" width="1000" height="734"/>
<p>
In this job
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">we
need to think a lot about the tools we choose and why</a>, so I
cataloged all the places where web components (for me) feel like “the
right tool for the job”. Your list may be different and I’d love to read
it. And because I don’t want this to be 100% propaganda, I’ll also cover
some of the not-so-great parts of web components as well.
</p>
<h2>
The good parts
</h2>
<p>
Here’s an incomplete list of situations where I think web components are
a good choice.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For leaf nodes -
<a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2023/08/23/use-web-components-for-what-theyre-good-at/">Web
components are great at leaf nodes</a>.
</li>
<li>
For presentational components that wrap other components - The
<code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> element is fantastic for this, but you could
write a basic CSS class instead. The first rule of web components is:
<em>Not everything needs to be a web component.</em>
</li>
<li>
For building a design system - <a href="https://nordhealth.design/">They
do this too.</a>
</li>
<li>
For progressively enhancing regular ass HTML -
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/11/01/blinded-by-the-light-dom/">Super
good at this.</a>
</li>
<li>
When you want to View Source - Most folks don’t care about this anymore
but debugging <code>my-button</code> is a lot easier than
<code>div.spf50</code> and you don’t have to rely on sourcemaps.
</li>
<li>
When you want to make a site without build tools -
<a href="https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/going-buildless/">Build
tooling is typically not the starting point</a> for most web component
projects.
</li>
<li>
When building a one-off project - In the same vein as “buildless”
components, eliminating dependencies decreases maintenance burdens over
the long haul when you have to come back to the project weeks, months,
or years later.
</li>
<li>
For prototyping - More buildless talk, but if you need to get up and
going fast, web components zoom.
</li>
<li>
When you need to keep a low-memory profile - I think you’ll find
<a href="https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2024/table_chrome_129.0.6668.58.html">on
average your performance floor is much lower with web components</a>,
which makes them blazingly fast.
</li>
<li>
When you need style encapsulation - imho, web components are a little
<em>too</em> good at this but good to know
<a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2021/08/15/does-shadow-dom-improve-style-performance/">Shadow
DOM style application is also blazingly fast</a>.
</li>
<li>
When you want small, atomic template updates - Some (not all) web
component libraries use an html tagged template literal which gives you
JSX-like template authoring without a transformer or compiler.
<a href="https://youtu.be/Io6JjgckHbg?si=gQ1REfZSsMIPnFxw&amp;t=383">Tagged
template literals are also blazingly fast with atomic updates</a> over
full component re-renders.
</li>
<li>
When your components need to exist across different tech stacks - If
your company lets departments pick their own tech stack or your company
acquires other companies and you need a bit of UI consistency between
projects, web components are a great choice.
</li>
<li>
When you’re demoing an accessibility pattern, animation, or CSS-Trick -
Why not package it in a web component so people can pick it up and drop
it into their project? These puppies are hyper-distributable.
</li>
<li>
When you make a third-party embed widget - If you need
<a href="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/spicy-iframes.png">a
spicy <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>, web components do that and the
style encapsulation of the Shadow DOM would probably make your life
easier with less code.
</li>
<li>
When you want to build big applications - You can build
<a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web">Photoshop with web
components</a>. Companies build apps with web components every day. And
they use Shadow DOM.
</li>
<li>
When you have designers who can code - Most designers don’t have an
appetite or ability to spin up a whole dev environment, but you might be
able to convince some to write HTML in a CodePen. If your designer is
cool with spinning up a local dev environment, pay them more.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
The not-so great parts
</h2>
<p>
No technology is perfect so here are some of the rough edges of web
components, where people commonly have trouble, or where I’ve found them
to not be the best abstraction.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Shadow DOM - I think everyone’s first encounter with the Shadow DOM ends
in catastrophe. It can be confusing and even smart people I know have
beef with it. I can say that the more you work with it the more
intuitive it becomes, but Shadow DOM does have some gotcha moments that
can be frustrating.
</li>
<li>
SSR - <a href="https://www.spicyweb.dev/web-components-ssr-node/">You
can SSR web components</a> using Declarative Shadow DOM, but there’s not
a lot of literature out there which leads me to believe it’s either
kludgy, too library-specific, or both. If this is a non-starter for you,
check out <a href="https://enhance.dev/">Enhance</a> which does this out
of the box.

Pages - You can use a web component as your page-level abstraction and
leverage some kind of <a href="https://github.com/vaadin/router">web
component-based router</a>… but you’re probably better off keeping it
simple and using server generated HTML as your page-level abstraction.
</li>
<li>
Accessibility - There’s been some long standing issues with Cross-Root
ARIA (e.g. associating a label in the document with an input inside a
shadow root). Workarounds exist but the good news is that
<a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/reference-target-explainer.md"><code>referencetarget</code></a>
is rolling out in Chromium and solves this problem. Hopefully other
browsers pick it up soon.

<li>
Making a compiler for your JS framework - This is another post entirely,
but I can say that over the last couple weeks I’ve had about three years
worth of Community Group discussions. Hopefully some ombudsman-ship and
progress can happen here.

</ul>
<p>
As always, your mileage may vary. Ultimately the technologies you choose
probably come down to
<a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/link/why-were-breaking-up-with-css-in-js/">what’s
cool at the time</a>,
<a href="https://alexsexton.com/blog/2014/11/the-monty-hall-rewrite">what
people <em>think</em> solves their problems</a>, and what your team and
decision makers feel comfortable with at the time. That said, in the
year 2024 of our <small>LORD</small>, despite the apparent limitations I
do think these are scenarios where web components are a great fit.

<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/18/grimace.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Last
night the Mets were eliminated by the Dodgers playing in Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>
And I don’t know about you but I’m really happy with how the season
turned out. I didn’t think the Mets would make it through any of the
hurdles, making the playoffs, and beating the Brewers and Phillies. That
was amazing. And the energy of this team, their humor and inventiveness,
professionalism and perseverance. The Mets of 2024 were a great team,
and they give us something to look forward to in 2025.
</p>
<p>
People say Mets pitchers walked too many Dodgers, but the walks were a
result of discipline on the part of the Dodgers hitters. Most pitchers
throw a lot of crap, and the hitters swing at it. The Dodgers are more
discerning. If the Mets pitchers had thrown strikes they would have hit
home runs. It’s another way of saying that the Dodgers, no matter how
much we despise them, this year at least, were the better team.
</p>
<p>
And there is a silver lining. I wasn’t sure I wanted the Mets to beat
the Dodgers once we knew the team from the “other” league was going to
be the Jankees. Last time the Mets played them in the World Series, they
beat us in Shea Stadium and as a result we had to tear it down and start
over. I don’t think any of us wanted that, or even to risk having to
tear down Citi Field. I don’t like to be reminded that the Jankees even
exist, much less be forced to watch them play. And honestly between the
Dodgers and the other NY team, I want them <i>both</i> to lose. Is there
any way to arrange that? I don’t even want to know.
</p>
<p>
Anyway thanks to the Mets for being such a wonderful team, a constant
inspiration. So onward. Next year. And now..

Tax farming is the practice of licensing tax collection to private
contractors. Used heavily in ancient Rome, it’s largely
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/article/abs/perils-of-privatization/ED0CC74ECD0C79B068BB3CE233932B04">fallen
out of practice</a> because of the obvious
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/11909/chapter-abstract/161083634">conflict
of interest</a> between the state and the contractor. Because tax
farmers are primarily interested in short-term revenue, they have no
problem abusing taxpayers and making things worse for them in the long
term. Today, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is
engaged in a modern-day version of tax farming. And the potential for
abuse will grow when the farmers start using artificial intelligence…

point the original “EurKey” layout. No big loss as the only important
symbol was missing (the tilde). Anyway, I have fixed it by replacing the
“us” by the “eur” in the $(HOME)/.config/sway/config.d/input file.
Anyway, configuration of 2 layouts and usual way to configure keys for
shifting them (xkb_options) haven’t work for me for same reasons.</p>

this morning about the reality of Musk owning Twitter, which is now
completely settling in. He might have enough influence on the election
to push Trump over. He wins even if Trump loses, he gets a moon mission

Probably will pick up what’s left over after Trump, who clearly is

of us do most of our writing on desktop computers. I guess we’re in a

the people who use mobile devices to tweet. I’m one of the desktop
people. So I want <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>.
Mobile people either don’t care or don’t want it. So it stands to reason
we need a different user interface. We can use the same network, we just
need a different UI for editing. Since the twitter-like systems already
carry links to stories written by people on desktops, there’s room in
their pipes for our writing too. And it can work more efficiently if the
stories are part of the message as opposed to living off-site. Think of
it as a web of writing. A writer’s web that also carries short
messages.</p>
