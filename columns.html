<p>date: 2024-05-07, updated: 2024-05-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/">attack</a>
has been feasible for over two decades:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Researchers have devised an attack against nearly all virtual private
network applications that forces them to send and receive some or all
traffic outside of the encrypted tunnel designed to protect it from
snooping or tampering.
</p>
<p>
TunnelVision, as the researchers have named their attack, largely
negates the entire purpose and selling point of VPNs, which is to
encapsulate incoming and outgoing Internet traffic in an encrypted
tunnel and to cloak the user’s IP address. The researchers believe it
affects all VPN applications when they’re connected to a hostile network
and that there are no ways to prevent such attacks except when the
user’s VPN runs on Linux or Android. They also said their attack
technique may have been possible since 2002 and may already have been
discovered and used in the wild since then…

<p>
Raspberry Pi today launched
<a href="https://connect.raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi Connect</a>, a
free remote VPN service for all Pi OS users.
</p>
<p>
If you create a <a href="https://id.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi
ID</a>, you can sign up for Connect, install <code>rpi-connect</code> on
a Pi 4 or 5 running 64-bit Pi OS 12 ‘Bookworm’, and register that Pi
with the service.
</p>
<p>
Then, on any other device’s web browser, you can log in and remote
control your Pi through Connect’s web-based VNC viewer.

<p>
The VNC server is based on
<a href="https://github.com/any1/wayvnc">wayvnc</a>, and the Connect
service allows for as many registered Pis as you want (though I’m
guessing the interface is optimized for the majority use case of one or
a few).

him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant,
plummeted. What’s wrong with people?” Bad news for Ben, he’s still is a
blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true

<h2 id="getting-back-into-the-sims-games">Getting Back Into the Sims
Games</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve felt this rising tide of nostalgia
building up in me and urging me to revisit the <cite>Sims</cite> games.
I used to be an avid player of <cite>The Sims 2</cite> in the late 2000s
and early 2010s, playing legacy challenges (where you strive to play the
same family over 10 generations) and participating in the thriving
LiveJournal Sims community of the era. Around the time this nostalgic
impulse started, I stumbled upon a corner of Reddit where people are
still talking about, and playing, <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, and that in
turn got me sucked into YouTube videos such as

on the scourge of hood corruption, and how many of the things Simmers
long thought cause it actually don’t.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it made me really want to play <cite>The Sims 2</cite> again. I
do actually own the Ultimate Collection via
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> Origin, but there was a slight
problem… the computer I use is a Mac. And we do have a Linux desktop as
well, and these days Wine/Proton/etc. is so good that
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> can easily be played on that
<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> now… but somehow that install
of Linux got borked and only works in recovery mode, which is sufficient
to run the Plex server I mainly use that desktop for these days, but not
really good enough for <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. Alas.
</p>
<p>
Another option would have been to purchase Aspyr’s Mac port – the Super
Collection – for AUD$50 in the App Store. I do want to admit that in
principle (even though I already own the game on another platform) this
seems like a worthy option. Unlike
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>, Aspyr has actually put the
effort in to keep their port updated for new versions of Mac OS,
including upgrading the game to 64 bits when Apple dropped support for
32-bit applications, and updating the game again to run natively on
Apple Silicon (the M1 chips and beyond). That’s great and they deserve
to be supported for that! My reasons for not just choosing that option
are a bit on the selfish and picky side. Firstly,
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> never allowed Aspyr to port the
last couple of expansion packs (<cite>FreeTime</cite> and
<cite>Apartment Life</cite>) to Mac OS, and <cite>FreeTime</cite> in
particular is so fundamental to all my nostalgic memories of the game
(plus, packed with quality of life features) that I just don’t know that
I’m willing to play without it. Secondly, the April Black video I linked
in paragraph #1 introduced me to the fact that Macs have a hardcoded
limit of approximately 10,000 files that can be open at one time… which
can be a potential cause of corruption in <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which
was designed to draw on a large number of tiny, atomic files (e.g. every
Sim in a neighbourhood gets its own individual file) instead of large
consolidated ones. Considering that on top of that, I have a folder of
all the custom content I was using at the time I stopped playing
<cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which I actually think is pretty lean, and yet
by itself it has 4,242 files in it… yeah, I was nervous about the
possibility that playing <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on a Mac
would not be very sustainable for me. Alas.

So, I turned my sights to the newest instalment of the franchise,
<cite>The Sims 4</cite>. Now I played this version of the game quite a
bit in 2017–8, and I remember being impressed at first by the graphics
(it’s <em>so</em> much prettier than unmodded
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>) and the quality of life
improvements offered by the game engine, like better routing and Sims’
new ability to multitask. However… the shine wore off. The main issue I
had with <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> was just that it wasn’t as
<strong>fun</strong> as <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. The zany
shit that used to keep me so entertained as a teen was just so much
rarer in <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr>. Most Sims’ personalities
were so bland, with personality points gone and replaced with just
<strong>three</strong> traits (plus an aspiration trait) and no more
than a handful of those traits did anything more than “give Sims an
emotion buff sometimes”. There were no more wants and fears, just
“whims” which were rarely interesting, and nothing bad happened if you
ignored them entirely (Sims couldn’t go into aspiration failure any
more). So… I started playing a legacy in <cite>The Sims 4</cite> and did
get up to generation 6. After a couple of fun generations where I really
put effort into making my Sims generate drama, I got a generation where
my heir had TRIPLETS and my entire game became a production line of
desperately trying to build up the toddlers’ potty training skill to the
point that they could at least fucking toilet themselves and it was
literally a neverending process and none of my adult Sims were doing
anything interesting either and I got so frustrated that I just… never
opened the game again. 😅
</p>
<p>
That said, quite a few years have passed since 2017–8. It occurred to me
that more mods might’ve come out giving the Sims more personality and
making their autonomous behaviour more individualised. It also seems
like the game itself has come out with updates addressing some of the
stuff I criticised (for example they supposedly replaced whims with
wants &amp; fears again, and as of a recent expansion Sims can
“self-discover” new traits?)… basically, I started to wonder if it was
worth trying again.
</p>
<p>
So, I installed the base game via the Origin app (which supposedly
already booted off everyone in favour of
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>’s new app, but it hasn’t booted
<em>me</em> off) and started a new save. I haven’t got very far into it
yet, and I’m also adding mods progressively, bit by bit, rather than
adding <strong>every</strong> “give your Sim more personality!” mod all
at once, to make the investigation easier for myself if I inadvertently
add something bugged or something that conflicts with another mod. That
said, some of the mods I’m interested in playing with are:

Now, having said all of this… I’m not sure how much it’ll satisfy that
part of me nostalgic for the Sims community on LiveJournal. Because a
big part of my fun wasn’t just <em>playing my game</em>, it was
publishing updates on my legacy and – perhaps even more important –
reading other people’s updates on their legacy. There are sooooo many
hilarious people whose legacies I used to read – hell, I started reading
them even before I owned a Windows computer to play
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on myself! – and I really also miss…
that. For nostalgia’s sake I went back to revisit some of them today,
but between Tinypic purging old pictures, Photobucket watermarking old
pictures, and LiveJournal itself becoming a gross ad-infested shell of
what it once was, it was just sad. I can put together legacy updates for
myself, and I can publish them on the internet (I even have
<a href="https://sims.jayeless.net">a dedicated
subdomain<span style="white-space: nowrap;"> <svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512">

originally to host my pictures, but when LJ went downhill I started
backing up the actual updates there too), but… I have no idea where a
Simmer <em>shares</em> these things, these days, for potential
interested readers to find. At least in 2017–8, I knew Tumblr was
popular, but I tried searching tags like “sims 4 legacy”, “sims 4
gameplay” and so forth today and did not find a single “legacy update”
as I would think of them. Mostly I found custom content, people posting
their own challenge rules based on the original legacy challenge, and
the occasional “artsy” highly edited screenshot with no or minimal
commentary. I don’t really want contextless game screenshots… I want
funny shit. I want quirky Sims autonomously starting drama and being
hilarious! Where is that?! Or does everyone who wants that just stick
with <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>? Because like, at least I found
<strong>one</strong> active <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> legacy
posting updates on Reddit… actually I found an active
<abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> legacy on Reddit too, but it’s a bit
more serious and less “this is what happened in my game lol”. Are people
just making <em>videos</em> of that style of content now, instead of
screenshots with commentary, and posting them on YouTube? Because… I am
not going to do that. Haha.
</p>
<p>
Well… anyway… step 1 is to actually play my game, right. Experiment with
mods and see if it feels fun enough for me to persist with it. It’s sad
about the difficulty finding or sharing legacy updates, but it’s really
just an adjunct to actually playing the game anyway, I suppose.

<p>
Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
I can’t send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface.
My way of doing it is now called “legacy.” The app that uses that
feature doesn’t work. But I don’t even remotely have the time to go back
and fix it.
</p>
<p>
The items in my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a>
come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on
Masto and Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
When I want broader distribution, I do this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open a new browser window.
</li>
<li>
Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don’t know why.
</li>
<li>
I write some text into the Twitter tab.
</li>
<li>
Paste an image if there is one.
</li>
<li>
I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.
</li>
<li>
I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.
</li>
<li>
I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I’m sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can
actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is
too.
</p>
<p>
One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit
is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can’t include them
in this rotation.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to see one of these support the features of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them
100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn’t be long before the
others did it, and we’d have a much more complete network writing
environment.

unsung miracle of ChatGPT. I usually write my prompts very carefully,
esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring,
and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was
repetetive and had an error I didn’t bother to correct, to see what
would happen. It didn’t even criticize me. It figured out what I was
trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am
aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I
have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep

when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the
XML people were asking developers to do that. “Now you can create your
own formats!” The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready
to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in
the back of my mind, “they don’t really mean it.” This was based on
experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized
their products when they were new, but took
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage">umbrage</a> at the
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah">chutzpah</a> of the
developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important,
don’t they know that’s what BigCo’s do. Anyway a few years later, that’s
exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft,
Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the
future, so they set about to do it as a “standard” and thus was born
Atom. My opinion,
<a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way is
better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> bandwagon. But
that’s not what they do. They’re still
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to make RSS
unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there’s no point
in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to do that.
It isn’t going away. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to
create a Busy Developer’s Guide to ActivityPub? Here’s the prompt. “I
want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that
runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are
basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post.
Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js.” I
asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1">ChatGPT

product of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut">Architecture

it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the
simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can
anything pragmatic. It’s why I said last week that they

asap</a>, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I
would help them design it, I’m a fairly typical “busy developer.” I
would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not
to be revised with breakage to apps. I’ve also seen this happen before,
in fact it happens more often than not. If you don’t understand a
format, you can’t actually support it. This is part of the

a former U.S. president. The most restrictive abortion laws in the
nation. Two horrific wars. All of this coming after the first pandemic
in living memory, one that claimed the lives of a million Americans. And
after the first attack on the U.S. Capitol in history, provoked by the
first president who refused to accept electoral defeat.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-light-dark-experiment">A quick light-dark()
experiment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I wanted to experiment with the new CSS function
<code>light-dark()</code> and get a sense of how to use it in a CSS
architecture of nested (web) components. I think it’s going to be a
powerful tool in <a href="https://web.dev/articles/new-responsive">the
new responsive</a> world of component architecture but I don’t want to
recommend something unless I have experience with it in a project first.
</p>
<p>
My first pass was to add <code>light-dark()</code> to my components…
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* global.css */</span>
<span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--dark</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--light</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
But if every component is in charge of it’s own
<code>light-dark()</code> handling for <code>border</code>,
<code>background</code>, and <code>color</code> on every element… the
codebase will get messy managing dark mode in a lot of different places,
leading to a lot of inconsistencies over time. A more elegant solution
for me would be to handle this job in a single location at the root
scope level and leverage the cascade a bit.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The nice thing about using <code>light-dark()</code> at the root token
level is your components can be dumber. You provide default light-dark
experience and, like good children, your components abide in their
parent’s decision. Of course, due to the nature of CSS custom
properties, your components aren’t locked into the system and your
component level styles can opt out (read: not include) or override the
global variables if necessary.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--surface-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--text-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">/* this is a real example from my past */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">"lunar-new-year"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
At this point in the experiment I was pleased with the results… until I
deployed it to production. I overestimated the browser support for
<code>light-dark()</code> and it didn’t work on my phone running Safari
17.4 (but it’s coming in Safari 17.5). I replicated the issue by
changing <code>light-dark()</code> to <code>light-d0rk()</code> to
verify and fixed it by adding a tried-and-true CSS <code><span
class="citation" data-cites="supports">@supports</span></code> query.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="c">/* NOTE: For Safari 17.4 (2024-05) */</span>
  <span class="err">@supports</span> <span class="err">(</span><span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">black</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
      <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now Safari 17.4 and other browsers that lack support will only have a
dark theme and newer browsers will get the <code>light-dark()</code>
enhancement. I also threw a little <code>NOTE:</code> and datestamp in
there so future versions of me will know when and

I built this fence</a>.

a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started
an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support
today’s students making their political opinions heard. I also see
journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on
violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn’t true then
and I’m pretty sure it isn’t true now.
</p>
<p>
And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not
what’s really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American
students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values,
only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war,
as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel.
</p>
<p>
We shouldn’t have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on
killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was
unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is
killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it’s exactly what
Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should
<i>not</i> be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust.

As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that’s
why I support the students. They aren’t right or wrong, but they are
continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and
journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the
2020s as it was in the 1970s.

<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
An unseasonable gloomy spring in Austin, TX. The kids are nearly done
with school for the year and summer plans are shoring up. My son goes to
middle school next year. Unbelievable.
</p>
<p>
We’ve battled some on-and-off sicknesses these past couple months and
with all the holidays every week has felt like a false start. But here
we are, barreling into summer. I’ve already been out on the lake to surf
on my cousin’s boat, so I’ve got that going for me.
</p>
<h2>
The Eclipse
</h2>
<p>
In April my wife’s entire family came out from Arizona to Austin for the
eclipse on April 8th. We got a big Vrbo near the lake right in the path
of totality. The weather was cloudy and dismal in Austin for the
eclipse. But then… ten minutes before full totality, the sky broke open.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen partial eclipses before and those were cool. But nothing
prepared me for seeing the total eclipse. The complete darkness. The
confused birds. The sudden drop in temperature. The fully visible halo
effect eminating from the sun. It’s other worldly to see the big space
rock that goes around our planet move in front of the big fireball that
keeps our planet alive.
</p>
<p>
Happy to get to celebrate something so cosmic with the family.
</p>
<h2>
44 and there’s so much more
</h2>
<p>
I turned 44 at the end of April and had an uneventful birthday. That’s
how birthdays go after the big four-oh. I spent most of my day cleaning
the house and watching anime. My family treated me to a “fancy dinner”
at a place with cloth napkins and the kids behaved themselves through
the whole meal.
</p>
<p>
The highlight of my birthday was exchanging texts with some old friends
who have known me for decades. Old friends like that – even though you
often live distant parallel busy lives – have the ability to tap into a
deep well of friendship. For that I am thankful.
</p>
<h2>
Making Games
</h2>
<p>
I haven’t talked about it much, because I don’t want to jinx it, but
I’ve been making some games in my spare time. And not one style of game
either, a big swath of random ideas in different formats.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A “Guess Who?”-style game for Panic’s
<a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>.
</li>
<li>
A one-page TTRPG. Almost everything is in place for this.
</li>
<li>
A 52-card deck game that I’m turning into a game for your mobile
computer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Making games has been a fun and different way to spend my time. I don’t
have much to show for all that tinkering right this minute, but soon
maybe?
</p>
<h2>
Waiting for a life-changing email
</h2>
<p>
You know that feeling when your boss emails you and asks “Hey, you got a
minute?” and those minutes until you talk to your boss feels like hours
as your amygdala floods your limbic system with intense, wet, hot
anxiety? That’s more or less what I’ve been feeling for the last two
months as I waited for a life-changing email. There were two emails
actually. Then that got stressful. Then I had to wait on a package.
</p>
<p>
To be totally honest, all that waiting nearly broke me. I’m a decently
patient person but a giant cloud LOOMING over me every day that I’m
unable to control is distressing. Then your friends and family and kids
ask you “Hey did that life-changing email come yet?” and you have to say
“Nope, not yet” over and over.
</p>
<p>
But the email did come. And so did the package. And the giant cloud of
concern is slowly dissipating. And on Monday I’ll embark on the next big
phase of my adult life. Ominous, I know.
</p>

<p>
What you jackals come here for…
</p>
<h3>
🧠 <strong>Learning</strong>
</h3>
<p>
I took some time to do some deep dives both formally and informally.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
TypeScript - Almost certain I’ll be using this sometime in the future,
so I took a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a>
course to connect all the pieces I had scattered about in my brain.
</li>
<li>
LLM Vector Embeddings - All this LLM search jazz is normal vector search
but with special GPT-based embeddings instead of Postgres’s default
embeddings. Way less threatening or opaque to me now that I understand
it.
</li>
<li>
Solo RPGs - I got a bit obsessed with the idea of playing a TTRPG by
yourself and it inspired me to make a game.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
💪 Wellness
</h3>
<p>
I’ve put on a bit of weight and that’s frustrating but I think again
it’s stress-related.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Taking walks
</li>
<li>
Got a weighted vest for “rucking”
</li>
<li>
Rode my new bike once
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
📖 <strong>Reading</strong>
</h2>
<p>
Reading is still on a book-a-week clip. This year I’m mulling around
tech and ethics, as well as reading about people who created or
harnessed a new technology. I also got back into comics and have read
some wonderful pieces. If it’s sci-fi themed and has good art, I’m
all-in.
</p>

<strong>Finished</strong>

around “containment” of this new technology.

📝 <strong>Blogging</strong>
</h3>
<p>
Slowed down a lot on blogging. That’s okay. I still have three dozen
drafts but I’m being pretty choosy about where I toil. It’s easy for me
to lose a weekend tinkering on a handful of posts, or piecing together a
giant overly complex post like this. I need to stop doing that. Or I
need to do that more often. Who knows.

<p>Adobe’s gambling that the creative industries will be replaced by
