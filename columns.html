<h2 id="pete-rose">Pete Rose</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-25, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
It was so predictable. Shortly after Pete Rose died, baseball
<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/calls-escalate-against-rob-manfred-220702792.html">rescinded
his lifetime ban</a>, and
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=May+13%2C+2025%2C+Manfred+instituted+a+change">now
he can</a> be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pete+rose+hall+of+fame+induction">inducted</a>
into the Hall of Fame.
</p>
<p>
He had
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#Records_and_achievements">more
hits</a> than any baseball player ever.
</p>
<p>
A role model in so many ways, and like all heroes he had fatal flaws.
You may think he set a bad example for kids, but I say the opposite. You
don‚Äôt give kids enough credit. What he taught was that a man with
average athletic ability could will himself to achieve.
</p>
<p>
I grew up with a Pete Rose ethos, why shouldn‚Äôt I go for it all? I feel
so sad that he couldn‚Äôt have gotten the acceptance he so totally
deserved. How could we not forgive him? He was Charlie Hustle! <span

<h2 id="iphone-gopro-tears">2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears</h2>

<h1 id="2025-05-25-iphone-gopro-tears">
2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears
</h1>
<p>
I have a GoPro which I used to take a nice
<a href="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-14.mov">6s video of a young
whale</a> when we went to the <a href="2024-04-06-maledives">Maledives
in 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
I also took hours of not so important video. There is, of course, an
iPhone app for the GoPro. It currently has 45 GB of videos on it. I
can‚Äôt access the iPhone from my wife‚Äôs Mac without upgrading it.
</p>
<p>
So I use my Linux Laptop to connect to the phone. And my wife‚Äôs Mac is
mounted via wifi, and it has the external hard disk where the videos
should go. Current transfer speed is 1.3 MB/sec.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I do feel the bars of the golden cage. üòî
</p>
<p>
And there so many random errors. Or a laptop that falls asleep. Or a
duplicate filename. These things always interrupt the process and wait
for user input.
</p>
<p>
This is where the tears come in.

The reviews for <cite>Face with Tears of Joy</cite> have started to come
in, and I am happy (and relieved) to say that reviewers seem to be
enjoying the book quite a bit! Here are a few quotes:

because it had not handed over information on foreign students‚Äô protest
activities, violent activity, and coursework, the university had ‚Äúlost
[the] privilege‚Äù of enrolling foreign students.</p>

day away from the blog. Really enjoying the NBA playoffs, even though
the Knicks are still in it. Nice turnaround after the first quarter for
the Minnesotas. Still hoping for a finals between them and the Knicks.
It‚Äôll be interesting to see how the Knicks change their lineup.
Hopefully no more isolation-ball with Brunson. It‚Äôs boring and doesn‚Äôt
work. Melo 2.0. Might make sense if he was LeBron, but he‚Äôs not and
LeBron‚Äôs game is boring anyway. Let‚Äôs do this well, win or lose.</p>
