<h2 id="its-still-adtech">It’s still adtech</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog</p>
<p>This morning Wired published This Ad-Tech Company Is Powering
Surveillance of US Military Personnel. It’s a good piece, which is
typical of Wired lately. But what caught my eye was “Ad-Tech” in the
headline. Some writers say “ad tech.” Others say “adtech” or “AdTech.”
I’m highly leveraged in “adtech,” since I’ve now posted 160 pieces
(including […]</p>

<h2 id="the-united-states-is-not-a-silicon-valley-company">The United
States is not a Silicon Valley company</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’ve had an experience few people have had, and it’s relevant to the way
all of us feel right now. The experience: Being part of a Silicon Valley
company that was acquired by another Silicon Valley company.
</p>
<p>
I was the CEO. I recognize the feeling, because Musk is acting as if he
is the acquirer of a Silicon Valley company, and the company he has
acquired in the USA. Or so he thinks. But the United States is not a
Silicon Valley company where, you have departments and managers at every
level, and each level must follow orders from the level above them. It
doesn’t work that way here. Deliberately. Very deliberately.
</p>
<p>
There never has been a Silicon Valley company that gives each employee
the rights and responsibilities of an American citizen. We don’t take
orders except in very exceptional circumstances, and then with all the
rights guaranteed by the Constitution. That’s why Musk and Trump are
having so much trouble coming to grips with how this place works,
because even the employees of the USA are voters and taxpayers and have
rights that must be respected. That <i>will</i> be respected or all hell
will break loose.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to Silicon Valley acquisitions. Up to the point when you,
the former CEO, are now a VP, and must take orders from the CEO, you
didn’t have to take orders from anyone, not even your board of
directors. The CEO of the tech company is a lot like a citizen of the
US, until they aren’t a CEO any longer and have to do the bidding of the
actual CEO (which is who Musk thinks he is relative to the USA). This is
why even MAGAs who love Trump (or really the idea of Trump) aren’t going
to put up with his bullshit. American citizens, rich or poor, old or
young, LBGTQ or whatever – we all are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state">sovereign</a>,
ie we don’t have to take orders from anyone, not even a supposed genius
like Musk (sorry, but I am free to doubt his genius, something might
take some getting used to by him). We don’t take orders from him, or
anyone else, except of course, as mentioned earlier under very special
circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Back to the disconnect in the Mind of Musk. Now you’re supposed to sit
here, quietly, while he rips apart the team you carefully built, the
people you formed into a family with all its strengths and dysfunction.
The new CEO (Musk) sweeps in with no idea what they’re fucking with, and
they don’t want to hear about it. Finally you have to quit after a short
time because you can’t be part of the disaster they’re creating. And
always is a disaster, and sometimes they can dig out of it as he has
done with Twitter, as we’ve seen many SV companies have. But again, for
the 18th time, <i>the United States of America is not a Silicon Valley
company.</i>
</p>
<p>
What triggered it for me was the story about how Musk didn’t know he had
terminated all cancer research being done by the US. Surrounded by yes
men, they never would have told him. And he didn’t want to hear it from
a founder (like a congressperson or the head of the NIH or the acting
Treasury secretary). This is going to be repeated over and over until
the acquirer writes off the investment or who knows. His experience
comes from acquiring Tesla and Twitter, which while they were large
organizations are nothing compared with the United States.
</p>
<p>
And ultimately the United States is going to chew up Musk and spit him
out. We may be very damaged by the experience, but he will come out much
worse than the country. Because we are not who he thinks we are.
</p>
<p>
A great scene in Schindler’s List. A concentration camp Jew, an
engineer, tells the Nazi colonel he’s fucking up. As he’s about to blow
her brains out, she says “this isn’t going to make a difference.” He
proceeds. She was right. Musk should pay attention. The Nazis killed a
lot of Jews, that’s true. But there was no
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/350uy7/where_did_hitler_come_up_the_idea_of_the_thousand/">thousand
year Reich</a>, and Musk isn’t going to Mars at least not this way.

Malware Through Abandoned Amazon S3 Buckets</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, updated: 2025-02-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Here’s a supply-chain attack just waiting to happen. A group of
researchers searched for, and then registered, abandoned Amazon S3
buckets for about $400. These buckets contained software libraries that
are still used. Presumably the projects don’t realize that they have
been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3
buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source
software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update
pipelines—and then abandoned…

<h2 id="trump-and-trudeau-chat">Trump and Trudeau chat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First, the
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191367/trump-treasury-default-bond-market">New
Republic</a> is beginning to think like Musk and Trump. But they have to
think a bit more and ask how does this all tie together?
</p>
<p>
Remember you have to consider events that would normally be unthinkable.
And believe that Trump isn’t actually president of the United States in
any sense of what that meant in the past. He is sitting in the seat of
the president. He has the powers of the president, but he does not
represent the interests of the United States.
</p>
<p>
He’s going to use the US Treasury and the power of the dollar as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#:~:text=A%20reserve%20currency%20is%20a,of%20their%20foreign%20exchange%20reserves.">reserve
currency</a>, to buy himself a few toys to play with, like Canada,
Greenland, Gaza and Panama, to start.
</p>
<p>
To illustrate, here’s the text of an imaginary conversation between
Trump and Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trump: Hey Justin, how’s it going?
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: You know, not so good.
</li>
<li>
Trump: I get it. Have you considered my offer?
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: Yes. Either we surrender and become the 51st state, or you
won’t honor Canadian deposits in the US Treasury.
</li>
<li>
Trump: That’s right my friend.
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: I don’t see how we have any choice.
</li>
<li>
Trump: I’m afraid that’s correct.
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: Semi-sarcastic: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
States of America and Canada.
</li>
<li>
Trump: You can leave out the Canada part.
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: You can’t blame me for trying.
</li>
<li>
Trump: Have a nice day. 😀
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And then this

Goodfellas</a> demonstrates what’s next for the former independent
country of Canada.

<p>As soon as President Donald Trump took office, his administration
froze great swaths of government funding, apparently to test the theory
popular with Project 2025 authors that the 1974 law forbidding the
president from “impounding” money Congress had appropriated was
unconstitutional.</p>

<h2 id="musk-roots-the-world-economy">Musk roots the world economy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First, that’s just a theory, but I need to get your attention.
</p>
<p>
Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can
do anything, install or uninstall anything.
</p>
<p>
Mostly journalism has been reporting “He has our social security
numbers.” Sigh. That’s not nearly the problem folks.
</p>
<p>
With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete
debt. Trump
<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud">threatened</a>
to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows
those guys.
</p>
<p>
You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to
the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don’t believe me.
</p>
<p>
More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then
they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It’s
clever because it doesn’t require soldiers, not one shot will be fired.
My guess is that they already have this power.
</p>
<p>
BTW, here’s SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table
named inventory.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>delete from inventory where rand () &lt; 0.2;</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the
greatest depression ever.
</p>
<p>
You don’t have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21">ask
ChatGPT</a>. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early
exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.
</p>
<p>
Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your
account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an
account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world
economy. It’s where people store their money.

<p>
I buy tea about once a year. I also buy a lot of coffee but I have never
compared the two. Probably a mistake. At one point I weighed the coffee
beans for my Mokka pot and got 17g. I make two of these per day. That’s
about 12.5kg per year and probably costs CHF 250.- per year, plus coffee
in coffee houses and restaurants.

<ul>
<li>
Ye Lai Xiang (50g / CHF 41.50),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E5%87%A4%E5%87%B0%E5%8D%95%E4%B8%9B&amp;define=1">凤凰单丛</a>,
Phoenix Single Bush, descended from Shuixian trees growing in
Fenghuanshan, i.e., the Phoenix Mountains in Chao An, called 夜来香 or
Nocturnal Fragrance, maybe due to roasting over lychee wood (although
last time I bought it wasn’t nearly as strong as I remembered I still
want back that lychee fragrance)
</li>
<li>
Ya Shi Xiang Dong Pian (50g / CHF 55.00), another 凤凰单丛, this one
being
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%B8%AD%E5%B1%8E%E9%A6%99%E5%86%AC%E7%89%87&amp;define=1">鸭屎香冬片</a>
or “Smells Like Duck Shit” – this is confusing! – from Taiwan
</li>
<li>
Gang Kou Cha Meer Oolong (100g / CHF 55.00),
<a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%B8%AF%E5%8F%A3%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">港口茶</a>,
harbour tea from Pingtung in Taiwan
</li>
<li>
Jinggu 2016 ( 357g / CHF 180.00),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%99%AE%E6%B4%B1%E7%94%9F%E9%A5%BC%E5%8F%A4%E6%A0%91%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">普洱生饼古树茶</a>,
Pu Er Shen Bing Gu Shu Cha, i.e., raw Pu Er from old trees in 景谷,
Jinggu; this one is the cheapest I could get, being neither from the
east nor west of the Mekong river from from further north; they had
cakes from 2015 up to 2024, all at the same price, and I didn’t know
which ones to pick so I picked an older one – was this a good choice?
</li>
<li>
Jin Jiang Hui Ming (50g / CHF 40.00),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%87%91%E5%A5%96%E6%83%A0%E6%98%8E&amp;define=1">金奖惠明</a>,
green tea grown by the She Zu; it got a gold medal in 1915! 😄 Huiming
is the name of a local temple

<li>
Tama Ryokucha Hinpyoukai (50g / CHF 35.00),
</li>
<li>
Gen Mai Bancha (125g / CHF 17.50)
</li>
<li>
Hojicha (70g / CHF 13.50)
</li>
<li>
Shincha Yame (100g / CHF 40.00)
</li>
<li>
Sencha Hoshino (50g / CHF 42.50)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some everyday tea like Genmaicha and Hojicha; some Sencha; some green
tea from China, and a Pu Er cake. I am an absolutely clueless buyer of
tea and essentially I just know that my price range goes up to around
CHF 60.-/50g.

Nevertheless, in my hubris I wrote

<p>date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Here’s an <a href="https://ksze.github.io/PeerAuth/">easy</a> system for
two humans to remotely authenticate to each other, so they can be sure
that neither are digital impersonations.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To mitigate that risk, I have developed this simple solution where you
can setup a unique time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) between any pair
of persons.
</p>
<p>
This is how it works:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Two people, Person A and Person B, sit in front of the same computer and
open this page;
<li>
They input their respective names (e.g. Alice and Bob) onto the same
page, and click “Generate”;
<li>
The page will generate two TOTP QR codes, one for Alice and one for Bob;
…
</li>
</li>

to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group
developing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> in
the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up
with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a
year or two (I don’t have the exact date of the meetup) he commited
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html">suicide</a>.
It was a real shock. Now, many years later – a statue. And the
