<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/"><i>When
Online Content Disappears</i></a> by Athena Chapekis, Samuel Bestvater,
Emma Remy and Gonzalo Rivero reports results from this research:<br />
<blockquote>
we collected a random sample of just under 1 million webpages from the
archives of <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a>, an
internet archive service that periodically collects snapshots of the
internet as it exists at different points in time. We sampled pages
collected by Common Crawl each year from 2013 through 2023
(approximately 90,000 pages per year) and checked to see if those pages
still exist today.<br /> <br /> We found that 25% of all the pages we
collected from 2013 through 2023 were no longer accessible as of October
2023. This figure is the sum of two different types of broken pages: 16%
of pages are individually inaccessible but come from an otherwise
functional root-level domain; the other 9% are inaccessible because
their entire root domain is no longer functional.
</blockquote>
Their results are not surprising, but there are a number of surprising
things about their report. Below the fold, I explain.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The Web is an evanescent medium.
URLs are subject to two kinds of change:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<b>Content drift</b>, when a URL resolves to different content than it
did previously.
</li>
<li>
<b>Link rot</b>, when a URL no longer resolves.
</li>
</ul>
The Pew team found link rot in
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/">Common
Crawl’s collections</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>A quarter of all webpages that existed at one point between 2013 and
2023 are no longer accessible,</b> as of October 2023. In most cases,
this is because an individual page was deleted or removed on an
otherwise functional website.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>For older content, this trend is even starker.</b> Some 38% of
webpages that existed in 2013 are not available today, compared with 8%
of pages that existed in 2023.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
And in
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/">news
sites, government sites and Wikipedia</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>23% of news webpages contain at least one broken link, as do 21% of
webpages from government sites.</b> News sites with a high level of site
traffic and those with less are about equally likely to contain broken
links. Local-level government webpages (those belonging to city
governments) are especially likely to have broken links.
</li>
<li>
<b>54% of Wikipedia pages contain at least one link in their
“References” section that points to a page that no longer exists.</b>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
There is a long history of research into both phenomena. Content drift
is important to Web search engines. To keep their indexes up-to-date,
they need to re-vist URLs frequently enough to capture changes. Thus
studies of content drift started early in the history of the Web. Here
are some examples from more than two decades ago:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=f66149e4bc6109512003acbf844b7f3072c08ca3"><i>The

</li>
</ul>
Link rot is a slower process than content drift, so research into it
started a bit later. Here are some examples from more than two decades
ago:<br />

I have written about this topic
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/link%20rot">many times</a>,
first in 2008’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/12/persistence-of-poor-peer-reviewing.html"><i>
Persistence of Poor Peer Reviewing</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
I like to cite an example of really bad reviewing that appeared in AAAS
<i>Science</i> in 2003. It was
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1088234">Dellavalle RP,
Hester EJ, Heilig LF, Drake AL, Kuntzman JW, Schillin MGLM: Going,
Going, Gone: Lost Internet References. <i>Science</i> 2003, 302:787</a>,
a paper about the decay of Internet links. The the authors failed to
acknowledge that the paper repeated, with smaller samples and somewhat
worse techniques, two earlier studies that had been published in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/602421.602422"><i>Communications of
the ACM</i></a> 9 months before, and in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/2.901164"><i>IEEE Computer</i></a> 32
months before. Neither of these are obscure journals. It is particularly
striking that neither the reviewers nor the editors bothered to feed the
keywords from the article abstract into Google; had they done so they
would have found both of these earlier papers at the top of the search
results.
</blockquote>
<p>The first surprise is that the Pew report lacks any acknowledgement
that the transience of Web content is a long-established problem; like
Dellavalle <i>et al</i> it is as if it was a new revelation.<br />
<br /> Even before published research had quantified it, link rot and
content drift were well understood and efforts were underway to mitigate
them. In 1996 Brewster Kahle had founded the
<a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, the first of several
archives of the general Web. Two years later, the
<a href="https://lockss.org">LOCKSS Program</a> was the first effort to
establish a specialized archive for the academic literature. Both were
intended to deliver individual pages to users. A decade later,
<a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> was set up to
deliver Web content in bulk to researchers such as the Pew team; it is
not intended as a mitigation for link rot or content drift.<br /> <br />
Although Common Crawl was a suitable resource for their research, the
second surprise is that the Pew report describes and quantifies the
problem of link rot, but acknowledges none of the multiple, decades-long
efforts to mitigate it by archiving the Web and providing users with
preserved copies of individual pages.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="why-tesla-fsd-is-unsafe">Why Tesla FSD is unsafe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here’s
what I’ve learned from
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla">owing</a>
a Tesla Model Y with
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html">Full Self
Driving</a>. I don’t believe it’s safe. It absolutely does require your
full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I’ve seen it
do crazy stuff in simple situations. I’ve seen it panic, basically throw
its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That’s why you
always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because
at any moment you could be. You never know when it’s going to happen.
Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving
over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know
where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If
you’re an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely
programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don’t have to think
at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years
experience with this connection, then I guess it’s probably safe. But
not the way it is.
</p>
<p>
I’m amazed there aren’t more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla
still promotes this as “self-driving,” which it is not.
</p>
<p>
Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel
privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I
might still switch to a
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9">Kia EV9</a>, at some
point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest
Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the
<a href="https://www.romeokia.com/">Kia dealer</a> is in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York">Kingston</a>
which is practically in the neighborhood.

<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983">something</a>
you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext.
Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any
direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two
parties work with each other, and that never happened.
</li>
<li>
In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep
developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn’t wait to
figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way
links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on
top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off,
broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.
</li>
<li>
A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants
to layer a new protocol on top of the web – the Semantic Web. He wanted
people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. “show
me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20.” Like that.
</li>
<li>
It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn’t, it
required cooperation. You couldn’t just throw together a demo in an
afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak
from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking
minutes).
</li>
<li>
Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like
functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL’s
Semantic Web. It won’t require any cooperation and that’s why it will
work.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Borgmann opposed devices to what he called focal things. Focal things
demand something of us. They require a measure of care, practice, and
engagement that devices do not. Our use of them induces our focus, which
they invite by design. “The experience of a [focal] thing,” Borgmann
also notes, “is always and also a bodily and social engagement […]</p>

<p>
IBM is
<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-analytics/ciso-grapple-with-ibm-unexpected-cybersecurity-software-exit">selling</a>
its QRadar product suite to Palo Alto Networks, for an undisclosed—but
probably surprisingly small—sum.
</p>
<p>
I have a personal connection to this. In 2016, IBM
<a href="https://www.securityweek.com/ibm-acquire-resilient-systems/">bought</a>
Resilient Systems, the startup I was a part of. It became part if IBM’s
cybersecurity offerings, mostly and weirdly subservient to QRadar.
</p>
<p>
That was what seemed to be the problem at IBM. QRadar was IBM’s first
acquisition in the cybersecurity space, and it saw everything through
the lens of that SIEM system. I left the company two years after the
acquisition, and near as I could tell, it never managed to figure the
space out…

Over the last year and a half I ran the entirety of the River Thames! In

Let’s get the obvious question out the way first: “why?” And I, errr,
don’t have a good reason. It’s
<a href="/blog/2021/5/3/visiting-the-eu/">not the first time</a> I’ve
done a big themed running project, but it’s by far the biggest I’ve
<em>ever</em> done.
</p>
<p>
Second obvious question: “was it a good idea?” Kinda… I really enjoyed
running through a lot of the countryside, and for the most part the
Thames Path is very easy to run on. It’s also mostly well connected with
public transport, which makes the point-to-point nature of the runs
manageable. But on the other hand I often spent far more time travelling
than running, which made it a much larger time commitment than “just” 20
weekend half marathons.
</p>
<p>
The best part of this project was seeing the contrast in landscapes and
communities across the length of the river. Until now my only
familiarity with the Thames was with its murky, curvy path through
London or the college boathouses in Oxford.
</p>

<p>
An interesting historical pattern with the Thames — as with
<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713101">many
English cities</a> — is that effluence flows downstream and affluence
upstream. A lot of this has to do with the Thames’s role in London’s
history: for centuries waste water was literally dumped in the river.
Land up river became more desirable. It’s no historical accident that
the royal court at Hampton Court Palace was far west of the City of
London.
</p>
<p>
Those historical trends are reflected today, even as sewage practices
have improved
(<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-67357566">a
little</a>) and London de-industrialised. House prices are twice as high
in Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London than Bexley, in south-east
London. Further out of London, on an Essex-bound train I overheard a
group of men lamenting the loss of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_men%27s_club">working
men’s clubs</a>, an important
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third place</a> in
their communities, whilst in Oxfordshire I sat near a
<em>frightfully</em> posh former Home Secretary concluding with a group
of friends that taking the train to a party was a “terrifically smart”
decision. (Decisions they made in government weren’t quite so clever.)
</p>
<p>
Deeper into the country the Thames cuts a path through “green and
pleasant” English countryside. Over the course of my 20 runs I developed
a newfound appreciation for it. I’ve genuinely come to believe that
we’re <em>incredibly</em> fortunate in the UK to be so well connected to
so much accessible, open space.

<p>
I ran with a running vest, a 1.5L Osprey water bladder, a handful of
snacks (Clif bars in particular), gels, AirPods, iPhone, and Apple Watch
Ultra. I experimented with cheaper water bladders but they’re a false
economy: after a few runs they’d start to leak and I’d have to replace
them.

<p>
The Watch was the MVP of all these: I used
<a href="https://pedometer.app">Pedometer++</a> to display my planned
route and route taken throughout each run. The app supports both
OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey tiles; I generally preferred the
former as they were clearer on the small display.
</p>
<p>
For the most part I was following the Thames Path, but I often deviated
around it to either explore other countryside or take shortcuts on
routes that would otherwise be too long in one go.
</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesconditions">
Conditions
</h2>
<p>
I ran mostly in winter and spring 2023 and spring 2024. In the winter
months the path was often <em>very</em> muddy, whilst in spring there
were sections with very overgrown grass (which was joyless with my
hayfever). The Thames burst its banks last year, flooding parts of the
path. The
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-restrictions-and-closures">Environment
Agency has pages monitoring current river conditions</a>.
</p>
<p>
Towards the source of the river the Thames Path is often just a trodden
path along the edge of fields. This makes for a very uneven surface: I
had to slow down to avoid turning an ankle.
</p>
<p>
I only ran in the summer once, but even in spring it was often 20º+ and
sunny. Most of the route is <em>very</em> exposed: by the end I
regularly ran with a baseball cap.
</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thameslogistics">
Logistics
</h2>
<p>
I live in London, which made travel to and from each run easy. (Cities
in the UK are well connected by rail to London and <em>far</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts">less well to one
another</a>.) All in I spent about £400 on train tickets, local buses,
and (only twice) taxis. I used a railcard to decrease costs but
otherwise I generally optimised for time. I’ve no doubt that booking
advance singles, split tickets, or cheaper train lines could reduce the
cost by at least £100.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each run I made a tradition of buying a meal deal (or
equivalent) and extra snacks: I spent a further £200 on these.
</p>
<p>
Between Lechlade, Gloucestershire and Teddington, London the Thames is
interrupted by dozens of locks. These locks often have extra facilities
for boaters, which
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-locks-and-facilities-for-boaters">the
Environment Agency lists here</a>. I learned way, way too late
(literally at the <em>last</em> lock I ran past) that this often
includes drinking water taps that you can use to refill water bottles. A
lock keeper recommended running the tap for 30s before using it.
</p>
<p>
I’ve posted GPX files for all the routes below.

<p>
For all the London and Kent routes I took South Western trains, TfL
services, or High Speed 1.
</p>
<p>
The best sections were from Battersea Power Station to Greenwich: you
get far more diversity in the built environment on this leg than any
other section of the Thames (beyond these points London is mostly just
suburbs).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_1_N_Teddington_Lock_to_Barnes_Bridge.gpx">[1/20]
Teddington to Barnes Bridge (12.7km)</a>: I started by running west with
one of the shortest runs. All of the London sections were very flexible
as the Thames path is rarely more than a few hundred meters from a TfL
connection. Teddington is the final lock on the River Thames and
therefore the start of the “tidal Thames”.

For all the Essex routes I took c2c trains from West Ham and Fenchurch

run the Thames Estuary Path instead of the Thames Path as it was
<em>far</em> better connected to London.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_6_N_Tilbury_to_Stanford_le_Hope.gpx">[6/20]
Tilbury to Stanford-le-Hope (17km)</a>: I ran fairly far inland from the

recommend this path in winter.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_7_N_Stanford_le_Hope_to_Benfleet.gpx">[7/20]

<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_8_N_Canvey_Island_Loop.gpx">[8/20] Canvey

Stone</a> at Chalkwell, which marks the end of the Port of London’s
Authority. However I continued to Southend-on-Sea because I figured if
they’re claiming it’s at the seaside rather than the estuary-side that
was good enough for me. Finished with fish and chips and ice cream on
the beach.

west. At Weybridge I had to cross the river via a ferry. Although it
felt delightfully old-fashioned to cross the river by ringing a bell to
call the ferryman, it was still 2023 so he took Apple Pay.

Marylebone).

<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_14_N_Henley_on_Thames_to_Pangbourne.gpx">[14/20]
Henley-on-Thames to Pangbourne (30.9km)</a>: Around this time I grew a
bit more confident with distance but I had the option to cut the run
short at Reading. The area around Reading was the last busy part of the
Thames Path.

<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_15_N_Pangbourne_to_Wallingford_and_Chorley_.gpx">[15/20]
Pangbourne to Wallingford (25.1km)</a>: I ran a lot of this on
<a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/the-ridgeway/">The
Ridgeway</a> rather than the Thames Path. I originally plotted this
route with a plan to take a train back from Wallingford Station … only
to discover it was a heritage station with <em>very</em> infrequent
services so afterwards I looped back and took a train back to London
from nearby Chorley.

Wallingford to Radley (30.3km)</a>: I took a train to Didcot Parkway and
a bus to Wallingford for the start of this one. The Thames Path crosses
the river at Benson Lock but at the time the footbridge was closed; a
ferry operated across the river instead. I suffered my worst hay fever
reaction ever towards the end of this run so my pace dropped completely
and I walked the last few kilometers back to Radley, where I then took a
train to Oxford and another back to London.

Radley to Appleton (31.4km)</a>: This section loops through Oxford, so
aside from colleges’ dreaming spires you also see Port Meadow, The Trout
Inn (which features prominently in Philip Pullman’s <em>The Book of
Dust</em>), and the ruins of Godstow Abbey (which features prominently
in <em>Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again</em>). I’d argue these are the last
tourist attractions on the run: the remainder is all through countryside
and very small towns. I had virtually no service for the second half of
the run which made navigating back to Oxford a bit of a challenge; I
eventually walked to the A420 and got a local bus back.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_18_N_Bablock_Hythe_to_Lechlade.gpx">[18/20]
Bablock Hythe to Lechlade (33.1km)</a>: The Thames Path switches to the
opposite side of the river between Bablock Hythe and Appleton. I believe
<a href="https://theferrymaninn.co.uk">the pub at Bablock Hythe</a>
operates a ferry service, but at the time I was running it was closed. I
therefore took a taxi from Oxford to start this run. St John’s Lock is
the final (or first!) lock on the river, about a kilometer downstream
from Lechlade. At Lechlade I took a local bus to Swindon and trains back
from there.

runners.

Cricklade to Thames Head (22km)</a>: For the final leg through the
Cotswolds I didn’t push the pace at all. The Thames Path hugged the
river tightly but my route deviated slightly from it. The only challenge
I had was when I encountered a herd of cows that took a little too much
interest in me for my liking … the correct solution was <em>not</em> to
climb through a barbed wire fence but instead to walk around them
calmly, which I unfortunately learned the hard way.
</p>
<p>
By May the spring at Thames Head had dried up, but I instead found the
spring that was the current source of the Thames tucked away in some
woodland between the A433 and the A429. I wouldn’t recommend doing what
I did, which was to wade through the Thames (it was only a few
centimeters deep here!), cut myself on a whole bunch of brambles, and
then get stung by a bunch of stinging nettles to find it. But on the
other hand there was no chance I was going to run 400km and <em>not</em>
find the start.
</p>
<p>
I continued on to Thames Head, the traditional start of the river and of
the Thames Path. There I met a friendly group of walkers and runners,
most of whom were about to set off down the path in the opposite
direction. I considered getting a pint in at the Thames Head Inn nearby,
but instead opted to avoid train delays and cancellations so I caught
the train back to London from Kemble.

The final obvious question: “what’s next?” … A break?! The lesson from
this project has been that I don’t mind travel for runs, just so long as
the travel doesn’t take significantly more time than the run itself.
That said, I’ve definitely got a couple more daft projects in the
pipeline…

I were desiging a system to compete with Twitter, I’d implement a
one-click Block button. It should be as easy to block someone as it is
to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To
users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don’t think about it
too much, and certainly don’t be intimidated into not doing it. It must
be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent
blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an
account but not quite this easy. I think they’re probably heading
there.</p>
