of the things that makes me want to see Automattic stick around and grow
is that they have a really large codebase that has been scaled, debugged
and maintained for over 20 freaking years. And the most important thing
– they don’t break users. The code I wrote to run against WordPress in
the 00s still runs today. To me as a developer this speaks very loudly.
It means it’s safe to develop here. It means there’s discipline in their
development organization. Most companies don’t do this, but the ones who
do, have earned my deep respect. For all of Microsoft’s sins, they were
incredibly good at this too. It’s why I liked working with them, and
also why we laughed at each others’ jokes if you can believe that. In
some ways all the open source stuff is too complicated. I understand the
concept of “development org” – so I look at it that way. I dig around
their codebase, see how they do things, and figure it’ll work out pretty
well if I just do it that way. Because the last people they’re going to
break are themselves. What I see on their latest APIs is maturity and
completeness. They didn’t rush off to the next thing before finishing. I
found that in their Calypso API, which I’ve been building on. Honestly
this is my kind of platform, it’s what Manila’s API would look like
today probably if we had continued developing it. I’ll see if I can find
the docs around here somewhere. Long time ago. ;-)</p>

made the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple">reallySimple
package</a> for Node.js because I wanted to make it as easy as possible
to read feeds in Node apps. It should be as easy as reading a file. Give
it the URL of a feed, get back a JavaScript object that’s as simple as
feeds are. It can read RSS, Atom and RDF feeds, but you get the same
object regardless of what form the feed was in. I’m up for creating some
example apps if you’re interested. There is a very simple
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/example">Hello
World app</a> included in the package and a set of
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos">demo
apps</a>. It’s MIT-licensed, so you can do whatever you want with the
code. It would lovely to see it ported. The idea is to plant some seeds
in the Node.js world to make it easy for developers to try out new ideas
with feeds, figuring the easier it is, the more people will do it. Be
creative. Blow our minds! :-)</p>

question has come up in various contexts, is a Substack feed a blog?
Yes, I think it can be. For some reason people thought I’d say no. In
2003, I compiled a list of
<a href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">things
that make a blog a blog</a>, and it’s not about the software you use,
rather it’s about who’s writing it, and whether they’re being edited.
Now it’s a different question to ask if I would use it. I would not.
Because it forces you to use their editor. And that’s a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pernicious">pernicious</a> form
of lock-in. It might sound like a small thing, but it means you can’t
easily try out something new. You are not available to other software
developers as a possible user, so no software will be designed for you.
I know how well that kind of system works. And that’s probably why they
lock you into using their editor. If I can’t switch without breaking
everything, I’m not going there.</p>

<a href="https://tormentnexus.substack.com/p/is-ai-going-to-save-us-or-kill-us">asks</a>
if AI will save us or kill us. It could both save and kill us. That’s
what’s so disturbing about evolving. We live such short lives, people
aren’t really designed to evolve, but because of medicine and other
tech, we are often forced to do it. Evolution can come many ways. Losing
a job may force you to evolve. The dissolution of a marriage. Having
life-saving surgery with a long recovery saves you for sure, but it
might also kill you because you can’t go back to being the person you
were before. There might not be a path back. One thing’s for sure we
<i>need</i> saving. We can’t survive without radical change. We’re on a
path that doesn’t work. Is there any way for us to change radically
without a complete collapse? Well, actually kind of looks like we might
have been given a path out through AI. But it means we must give up
control. But here’s the funny thing about that. We aren’t giving up
anything because no one has any control. That’s a political question in
the US, can one person become a mad king and thus gain complete control.
But he’s 78 and not in good health, and that control could only last a
few years at most. We will need saving from that. If somehow we could
configure AI so it did what humans can’t and won’t do, at least our
civilization might have a way forward if not our species. Just some
random thoughts. Maybe unthinkable, but they occur to me anyway, which
is why I have a blog. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<a href="https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113322998712983125">WordPress/Mastodon
blog</a> at my kitchen table. This morning I wrote about why I don’t
believe in the Ya Gotta Believe, a baseball slogan coined by a 1973 Mets
pitcher Tug McGraw. It’s on-topic because the Mets are in a challenging
series with the Dodgers for the National League championship. No matter
how it turns out, this is a historic year for the Mets, and no matter
how it turns out I won’t love the Mets any less if they lose. I think
true believers believe in that – love – without any expectations, win or
lose, or maybe <i>even more</i> if they lose. BTW, I know the rendering
of the post isn’t complete on Mastodon, and there are errors. I’m
working with the people at Automattic at getting this right. I’m glad to
see that Mastodon has the flexibility to do that. Anyway, I believe in
the things I believe in, not because I “gotta.” I don’t like the slogan
because it doesn’t reflect how I feel about the team. My philosophy is
respectful (in a way) of the teams the Mets beat, because I understand
that their fans don’t love them any less because they lost. If anything
I think the better slogan for the Mets would be this:

<h2 id="whats-up-with-wordpress">What’s up with WordPress?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A long time ago I ran a free service
<a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/faq">called</a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/http://weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a>.
It was the <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">early days</a> of
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+weblogs.com">blogs</a>.
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> didn’t exist
yet, so there was no way to find out which blogs had new stuff other
than going through your blogroll and clicking links.
</p>
<p>
So I built a simple server, running in
<a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>, that handled pings.
When you updated your blog, you’d send a message to weblogs.com saying
your blog updated. It would then read the HTML of the blog and verify
that it changed, and it would be added to a list of blogs that updated,
in reverse chronologic order. It also published an XML version of the
update list called
<a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/changesXml">changes.xml</a>,
so if you wanted to run a search engine off the list, you could do that
too.
</p>
<p>
There were several ways to send a ping. You could go to a web page and
enter the URL of your blog. Or you could save the URL as a bookmark and
click the bookmark when you updated. Or if you used blogging software
like our Manila or Radio UserLand, or later EditThisPage.com or
weblogs.com (which eventually hosted blogs itself), it could ping on
your behalf, automatically.
</p>
<p>
Aside: Here’s a
<a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/historyOfWeblogs">snapshot</a>
of the weblogs.com site, preserved.
</p>
<p>
A number of search sites appeared. And we were happy, until another
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati">developer</a>, funded
by venture capitalists, who expected a return on their investment, built
on our open and free
<a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/changes.xml">changes.xml</a>
list, started asking for and receiving pings on their own, and (key
point) they didn’t make their change list public. This struck me as
highly un-weblike and unfair, but they could do it and we had to live
with it.
</p>
<p>
Based on what Matt has been saying it sounds to me like it’s something
like our experience. Except weblogs.com was a short term thing, and not
a business, and it didn’t last twenty years, and it didn’t have a
payroll to support.
</p>
<p>
But it still felt wrong that they weren’t giving back as they received.
If it had persisted like WordPress has, it would have eventually been a
seriously diseconomic and unsustainable problem. And I can imagine I
might write about it publicly as Matt has and maybe even get a famous
lawyer like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Katyal">Neal
Katyal</a> to advise me. And here we are.
</p>
<p>
Have we heard anything from the other side, or anyone who is familiar
with what their position might be. Do they not feel obligated to support
the continued development of WordPress or maybe there’s another issue we
haven’t heard about.
</p>
<p>
I can’t imagine that Matt would make such a big deal out of this if it
weren’t actually a big deal. He probably knew in advance how disruptive
this would be. And I imagine the others knew it would be too and counted
on him not wanting to make a fuss.
</p>
<p>
I have gotten embroiled in these kinds of things in the past, and I
don’t like it. I love to make software and make users happy and then
make more software, round and round. Anything that involves lawyers is
not me doing what I was made to do.
</p>
<p>
And I do see a silver lining. As with twitter-like systems, I now see
the possibilty to help WordPress serve writers better in the future.
Before this, people didn’t think change was possible in the WordPress
world, like they didn’t see the possibility of change with Twitter. But
now Twitter has quite a bit of viable competition. I know that WordPress
could be better tuned for writers, and the product has a very nice API
that would make it possible for lots of writing tools to flourish. It is
a strong platform that’s debugged, scaled, documented and worked on for
a long time, and they don’t tend to break users. And where commercial
vendors like Facebook and Twitter often have excellent technology,
ultimately they are run by execs and bankers who don’t believe in being
open, where this is something that has been deeply ingrained in the
WordPress culture from the beginning and would be hard to change and
that’s a good thing for users and developers.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the exciting part – between WordPress and Twitter lies a product
that would bring the web back to life. Imagine a twitter-like system
with the writers features of WordPress. Amazingly, we are on the cusp of
that being a reality.
</p>
<p>
There’s lots of opportunity to better serve writers here, and that’s
what I love to do, and honestly I think Ghost and Substack have left
themselves open to a writing environment built on WordPress that doesn’t
try to lock users in. And at the same time, I think we can use this
platform to help all the twitter-like services to support all kinds of
writing, not just severely limited tweets typed into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>. Somewhere along the line they got the wrong idea that taking
features out of the web was a good thing. I want to bring these features
back so we can get going again with the web as a writer’s platform.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I don’t need to think anyone is right or wrong here, and I don’t
think anyone else should either. I think this platform is very nicely
open and we can do lots of interesting new stuff here. I hope to open a
new thread here, focused on writers and the web. It’s been too long.

The sales pitch came from a marketing official trusted by Hezbollah with

<p>
When my wife was a kid, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened. The
next year, she had leukaemia, spent months in a clean room, spent years
with chemo and recovery. Nuclear energy will always be personal.
</p>
<p>
Also, I grew up in two A zones and one C zone around nuclear reactors.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The plant has been operating since September 1969. … Beznau 2 operated

Council removed the limitation. –

<p>
Lucky how close the borders are! Half the people at risk can’t complain
because they can’t vote. Strange how this seems to be a popular nuclear
power plant building strategy in densely populated, fragmented political
landscapes.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The last significant change to the KKG was the construction of a new
storage facility for spent rods. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s right. There is no solution for the spent rods for all Swiss
nuclear power plants. Whenever they start digging the locals launch
political movements to stop it. The solution was ingenious: now such
protest must happen at the federal level, not at the local level. And
this is how we’ll force that pesky radioactive waste repository on
somebody. Genius.
</p>
<p>
I don’t even want to talk about nuclear energy vs other types of energy.
Just use less fucking energy. As long as I see energy being wasted, I
don’t feel like I need to accept new power plants into my life. Let
alone nuclear power plants.
</p>
<p>
Let alone artificial intelligence.

Nuclear energy for artificial intelligence:

I’m less interested in learning facts than gaining understanding (though
sometimes facts support the understanding). I want to build a mental
scaffold to hook future facts and related concepts onto. I want to build
a story. This connects to the “big questions” approach, which gives

Israel is planning to conquer and annex parts of Gaza. To do so, they
will need to exterminate the Palestinians there.

<p>
Despite watching a year worth of their extermination campaign, they
still manage to impress with new and innovative approaches. We are out
of words for this carnage.

Trump said he’s use the military to arrest and in some cases kill

have to create new channels for news flow that have credibility and

piece</a> of malware:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The malware has been circulating since at least 2021. It gets installed
by exploiting more than 20,000 common misconfigurations, a capability
that may make millions of machines connected to the Internet potential
targets, researchers from Aqua Security said. It can also exploit
CVE-2023-33246, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10
that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming
platform that’s found on many Linux machines.
</p>
<p>
The researchers are calling the malware Perfctl, the name of a malicious
component that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency. The unknown
developers of the malware gave the process a name that combines the perf
Linux monitoring tool and ctl, an abbreviation commonly used with
command line tools. A signature characteristic of Perfctl is its use of
process and file names that are identical or similar to those commonly
found in Linux environments. The naming convention is one of the many
ways the malware attempts to escape notice of infected users…

why doesn’t Netflix buy <a href="https://metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a>
and integrate their ratings aggregator in their user interface. I
predict I’d watch far more stuff on Netflix than I do now. Or Apple TV,
Max, Hulu, Disney, etc. The idea that such a valuable resource is not
part of the user experience is crazy imho. What a waste. What reminded
me of this is Plex has integrated the equivalent of Bingeworthy in their
service, which is also a good idea and will glue communities of users to
you. The idea is to systematize recommendations. If I know a specific
friend liked a movie or a show is valuable information for me, not just
advertisers.</p>

40 Banditen haben beispielsweise 40 × 4.5 = 180 Trefferpunkte. Auf der
Tabelle unten hat es viele vorberechnete Werte.
</p>
<p>
Initiative, Bewegung, Angriffe und so weiter funktionieren wie immer.
Rüstungsklasse, Bewegungsrate, Moral und Rettungswürfe bleiben
unverändert.
</p>
<p>
Im Nahkampf kann eine Einheit, welche mit mehreren Gegnern im Kontakt
ist, alle gleichzeitig angreifen!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gewicht</strong>: Schaden wird von Angreifer und Verteidiger
nach untenstehender Tabelle gewichtet, da in der Masse und wegen dem
Gelände nie alle gleichzeitig angreifen können: Der Schaden wird mit dem
Gewicht des Angreifers multipliziert und durch das Gewicht des
Verteidigers geteilt.
</p>
<p>
40 Banditen haben ein Gewicht von ×6. Landen sie einen Treffer und
würfeln 4 Schaden teilen sie 4 × 6 = 24 Schaden aus. Ein Bandit mehr und
das Gewicht würde auf ×7 steigen.
</p>
<p>
Haben die Banditen mit TW 1 noch 53 Trefferpunkte, sieht man in der
Tabelle, dass es 11–20 Banditen mit Gewicht ×5 sind.
</p>
<p>
Die genaue Anzahl ist im Kampf egal. Wer es genau wissen will: 53/4.5 ≈
12 (aufrunden).

</table>
<p>
Steht eine Einheit mit mehreren Gegnern im Kontakt, können alle Gegner
gleichzeitig angegriffen werden.
</p>
<p>
Spielercharaktere und ihr Gefolge werden von ihrer Einheit gedeckt.
Erleidet die Einheit Schaden, nehmen Spielercharaktere und Gefolgsleute
zuletzt Schaden.
</p>
<p>
Spielercharaktere und ihr Gefolge greifen wie immer mit eigenen
Trefferwürfen und Zaubern an. Zauber werden auf Trefferpunkte
umgerechnet. Zaubersprüche wie <em>Donnerkeil</em> oder
<em>Feuerball</em>, werden genau so gegen Einheiten verwendet.
</p>
<p>
Schlafen 10 Banditen mit je 1 TW ein, so entspricht das 10 × 4.5
Schaden. Der genaue Wirkungsbereich der Zauber und die Marschordnung der
einzelnen Kreaturen werden vernachlässigt.
</p>
<p>
Wenn eine Einheit ihr erstes Mitglied oder die Hälfte ihrer Mitglieder
verliert, muss ein Moralwurf bestanden werden. Spielercharaktere
verleihen ihrer Einheit den Charisma Bonus für Moralwürfe. Die
Moralwürfe sind wichtig! Ist der Moralwurf misslungen, gilt die Einheit
als gebrochen. Sie weicht zurück, sucht Deckung und hört auf zu kämpfen.
</p>
<p>
Spielercharaktere oder Gefolgsleute in gebrochenen Einheiten können
diesen wieder Mut zusprechen. Pro Einheit kann dies nur eine Person pro
Runde versuchen. Das Ermutigen einer Einheiten kann jede Runde
wiederholt werden. Einer ermutigten Einheit steht ein erneuter Moralwurf
zu. So oder so kann die Einheit diese Runde sonst nichts tun.
</p>
<p>
Erleidet eine gebrochene Einheit erneut Schaden, flieht sie vom
Schlachtfeld. Alle weiteren Einheiten im Nahkampf erhalten einen freien
Angriff mit einem +2 Bonus.
