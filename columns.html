<p>But what about Substack and Ghost? A lot of people do their writing
there too? What about those people. Here’s the cool part for all people
who write on the web. The API we use in WordLand to hook up to WordPress
is
<a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js">open
and documented</a>. They don’t break their APIs in WordPressLand. At
least so far. You could say that API is a standard. And I bet it would
be a lot easier for Ghost, for example, to support a limited subset of
that API than it has been to get ActivityPub support implemented.
Because the WordPress API is what I would call “really simple,” and
that’s the thing I value most about a good API.</p>

<p>Now here’s the real reason I need WordLand and if you write for
WordPress sites, I think you’ll want it too. It’s because WordPress is
like the Microsoft Word of web writing. If you ask someone how they do
their site, in 2025, it’s probably going to be WordPress. So if someone
invites you to write a guest post on their blog, chances are pretty good
I can write it in WordLand, and it’ll be archived in my collection of
writing, and easy for me to find, because that’s what WordLand does for
writers. So I was able to create the new post on the WordCamp site in
less than a minute, and it was completely painless. And that’s the
point. Here’s the screen shot:</p>

<p>Listened to a segment on today’s
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">Brian Lehrer podcast</a> about
how to keep the good feelings from a vacation when you get back home.
Here’s my idea. Before you leave make a list of the things you like
about being on vacation. Take it home, put it somewhere you can find it
when you’re feeling down and want that feeling back. Pick one of the
things on the list and do it. Your subconscious will tune into it as an
act of self-love and give you some of the body
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin">chemistry</a> that you
felt when you were hanging out at the beach or hiking the Applachian
Trail. A similar idea in a

<p>Everything in ChatGPT is <i>so</i> nice. I just asked it about a
random plant I got as a gift, and it gave me a beautiful
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/28/deltaDawn.png">one
pager</a> with everything I would have had to spend time searching for
all right there, beautifully laid out, and all the fine UI touches you
might think of already in. It’s studying us and learning, and picking
out the good stuff, at least so far. The web was like this too in the
beginning, mind-exploding inventions every day. We called them
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/08/26/mindBombsForY2k.html">mind
bombs</a>. The journalists and social media influencers all just
complain, while there is a revolution happening, progress that had
slowed to a snail pace, or very often went in reverse, is now coming at
breakneck speed. This is as transformative innovation as there has ever
been, not that I have much perspective on those that happened before I
was invented, but it’s as big as the Beatles, the PC, web, mobile.</p>

I need <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. I’m primarily a
writer, my podcasts reflect that, so most of the work I do on each
podcast is in writing the show notes. I have a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/69436e223b212315846f5944e0957504">template</a>
the writing and audio flow through. Fairly standard stuff, the same
approach used by Tumblr and many other blogging systems, including
UserLand’s Manila and Radio UserLand. Here’s an
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">example</a>
of a page rendered through that template. We’re doing similar things
with WordPress using themes. The idea of WordLand is to do all the
block-oriented work once, outside of the writing environment, then flow
my writing through it, far away from the heavy lifting. It’s always how
I’ve done my blogging tools. I understand WordPress so far has a steady
workflow thru the block editor, but these are workflows for designers
and programmers. WordLand is the flow for writers.</p>

<h1 id="2025-07-27-my-one-page-dungeon-contest-submission">
2025-07-27 My One Page Dungeon Contest submission
</h1>
<p>
It all started with agroschim proposing a game on the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/Discord_Server">Grenzland
Discord</a>: A pulp cover gets posted and we propose the title and
elevator pitch for the module we’d write for it.
</p>
<p>
The first cover was
<a href="https://www.perrypedia.de/wiki/Datei:PR0780.jpg">issue 780</a>
of the longest running Science Fiction series, Perry Rhodan. It shows
some dinosaurs, a river, canyon walls, and a flying golf-ball with
antennas like some sort of spy-satellite.
</p>
<p>
I wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Ugh Nugh and the bleeping Invasion: Gather your stoner friends, pick up
those spears and travel through the subterranean dinosaur refuge to find
the source of the flying drones that keep pestering your tribe.
Infiltrate the lair of the rocket men and wrest the eye of eyes from
their cold gauntlets and return your land to peace and quiet. A 16 page
module for Wolf Packs &amp; Winter Snow and other old school
role-playing games.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Once the words stood there, I liked it. The premise seemed to be
somewhat non-violent. This was a mission to stop some activity, not to
kill anything. It was about privacy and drones, which makes it relevant
to today. It’s about tech level differences and power differences. It
was intriguing.
</p>
<p>
And then I wrote up a One Page Dungeon based on that. 😍 There are
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2025/bleeping-bots/">two
versions</a> for the entry: the one-page PDF for submission to the
contest and
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2025/bleeping-bots/bleeping-bots.html">a
web page</a> with some old school D&amp;D stats.
</p>
<p>
It’s no way close to <a href="https://themetalearth.blogspot.com/">Metal
Earth</a>’s
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2011/Michael%20Gibbons%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Forgotten%20Depths.pdf">The
Forgotten Depths</a>, but clearly inspired by that 2012 entry, of
course. Back then I wrote up
<a href="2012-05-15_The_Forgotten_Depths">some stats</a> to go along
with the stat-less submission.
</p>
<p>
I feel that a first level group could conceivably beat it: get a suit at
the volcano or enlist the dragonodon, approach the tower undetected and
enter from above, then trick the only guard. Something like that. And I
feel the entry provides enough opportunities for a careless party to
mess up. 😆
</p>
<p>
Sadly, there’s no treasure to be found except blasters, rocket suits and
a charging station. But perhaps that is enough.

<p>On July 23 the X account of the Department of Homeland Security
posted an image of an 1872 oil painting by John Gast, titled American
Progress. Gast represented the American East on the right side of the
painting with light skies, a rising sun, and the bustling port of New
York City, full of ships. He painted the American West in darkness,
through which bison and Indigenous Americans flee the people in the
middle of the painting: white hunters, farmers, settlers, and stagecoach
riders. Over the scene floats a giant, blonde Lady Liberty, evidently
moving west, carrying a schoolbook and a telegraph wire being laced on
poles along a train track behind her.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wasn’t planning on this, but there was a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/bingeworthySupport/issues/5">report</a>
that there was a problem with
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>, looked into it
and was able to fix it.
</p>
<p>
Source of problem: When I added a feature that lets you ask ChatGPT to
review the program you’re looking at, I broke the ability to add a new
program to the database. It took about 15 minutes to track down and
verify and another few minutes to fix – and now that important function
works again.
</p>
<p>
As long as I was in there working around, I updated the
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml">Bingeworthy RSS feed</a> to
only report program additions. The other events it was reporting just
weren’t as interesting.
</p>
<p>
I also added that feed to my
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/27/blogrolledBingeworthy.png">blogroll</a>
on <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’d say it works a lot better now.

<h1 id="2025-07-23-testing-a-reset-of-the-one-week-jail">
2025-07-23 Testing a reset of the one week jail
</h1>
<p>
I’ve had a number of people complaining about being banned and I’ve been
wondering whether I should reduce the ban-time for the escalation jail.
Right now, if you’ve been banned for 1h five times in a 24h period,
you’re banned for one week. What I f I reduced this one week to three
days (“one long weekend”), for example?
</p>
<p>
As a test, I wanted to reset all the one week bans and see whether load
explodes or not. If most of the scraping has ceased, then perhaps there
would be no problem?
</p>
<p>
So around 10:30 local time, I made a backup of the weekly jail:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned &gt; butlerian-jihad-week.json
# sed s/\'/\&quot;/g &lt; butlerian-jihad-week.json | jq length
2862
# fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned
[]
</code></pre>
<p>
The backup has 2862 entries, the jail is now empty.
</p>
<p>
Let’s watch Munin!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-1.jpg" alt="The graph shows the one week jail pretty constant at nearly 3000 entries dropping to zero moments ago." />
</p>
<p>
40 minutes later. What are you dooooing‽
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-2.jpg" alt="10 minutes after the reset, the 1h jail already has over 700 entries and in another 10 minutes, it has 850 entries." />

And who’s doing it?

The only obvious thing I can see is that Semrush and Microsoft are
trying to crawl the site using their bots, one for their marketing and
search engine optimisation and the other for their search engine itself.
But remember: <a href="2023-10-04-search">2023-10-04 Search engines, the
deal is off!</a>. I am no longer convinced that being listed by search
engines is in my best interest.

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-3.jpg" alt="A few hours later, the scene appears unchanged. There are four waves of blocks, going up to between 1000 and 1500 banned entries and coming back down again." />
</p>
<p>
If that’s the image, then perhaps the long term punitive ban doesn’t
have to be that long.
</p>
<p>
And what’s the situation 24h later?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-4.jpg" alt="The fifth wave generates entries in the one-week ban. But the cycles for the one-hour ban continues and so more entries keep getting added to the one-week ban." />
</p>
<p>
And another day later:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-5.jpg" alt="The situation has stabilised around 1400 blocked entries." />
</p>
<p>
And another day later:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-6.jpg" alt="The bots were back and now we&rsquo;re at 2900 entries blocked for a week." />
</p>
<p>
Every day is worse. If you look at the graph below, you’ll notice that
Saturday morning just after 2:00 there was a huge wave of about 6000
entries that got blocked for an hour. The same wave repeats around 9:00,
13:00, 18:00. And then, nearly 24h later, just before 2:00, the fifth
such wave rolls in. At at that point, the bans are added to both the
one-hour and the one-week jail.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-7.jpg" alt="The one-week ban now has 9000 entries after a surge at 1:50 in the morning adding about 6000 new entries" />

<strong>2025-07-25</strong>. So now, two days after a reset, I’d like to
see who’s hovering just below those limits I’ve set. If they seem to be
innocents, that would be an argument to raise the limits. If they seem
to be bots, that would be an argument to lower the limits or, given that
the system load is OK at the moment, to leave the limit as it is.
</p>
<p>
Let’s go through the various test.
</p>
<p>
First, “active autonomous systems”. On a good day, the limit is 500
requests per autonomous system.
</p>
<pre><code># show-active-autonomous-systems --top 3
count   percent ASN AS
234 4.54    45102   ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN
172 3.33    208258  ACCESS2IT Access2.IT Network, NL
158 3.06    12880   DCI-AS, IR
total: 5158
</code></pre>
<p>
Clearly, Alibaba is a bot hoster in China. What about Access2.IT in the
Netherlands?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 208258 | log-request | rank-lines 
    176 /
</code></pre>
<p>
Clearly, that is also a bot. 2h is 120 minutes. This company is checking
more than once per minute whether my sites are up. That angers me. They
probably sell uptime data to other companies.
</p>
<p>
What about the autonomous system from Iraq?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 12880 | log-request | rank-lines 
    164 /
</code></pre>
<p>
The same bullshit! 😲
</p>
<p>
So my conclusion is that the limit could be lower! 😠
</p>
<p>
Next, let’s look at “expensive end-points”. These are the endpoints I’m
planning to <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/2025-07-13_AI_Scrapers">do
away with</a>, eventually.
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log \
    | egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | asncounter --top 3 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null
count   percent ASN AS
27  4.42    7922    COMCAST-7922, US
11  1.8 6939    HURRICANE, US
8   1.31    7713    TELKOMNET-AS-AP PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, ID
total: 611
</code></pre>
<p>
Comcast in the United States seems to request all sorts of things:
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 7922 | log-request | rank-lines
      7 /1pdc/2024/
      4 /view/index.rss
      4 /osr/feed.xml
      4 /osr/atom.xml
      3 /

      1 /zoom-frm.el
      1 /zen?action=rss&amp;all=0&amp;days=90&amp;rcfilteronly=%22WikioStyle%22&amp;showedit=1
</code></pre>
<p>
Note how only one of these requests is one of the “forbidden” URLs. But
apparently it’s also attempting to upload images! Looks like spiders, if
you ask me.
</p>
<p>
What about Hurricane in the United States?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 6939 | log-user-agent | rank-lines

      4 Feedbin feed-id:2584020 - 2 subscribers
      4 Feedbin feed-id:1821891 - 1 subscribers
</code></pre>
<p>
What the hell is wrong with these people? Do I really have these many
interesting feeds?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 6939 | log-request | rank-lines
      9 /view/index.rss
      8 /osr/feed.xml
      6 /view/RPG.rss
      5 /files/osr-discord.xml
      4 /wiki/?action=journal;title=Roleplaying%20Games;full=1;search=tag:RPG
      4 /view/index.rss?action=journal;title=Roleplaying%20Games;full=1;search=tag:RPG
      4 /rpg/feed.xml
      4 /podcast/hh.xml
      3 /wiki/feed/full/RPG
      3 /wiki/feed/full/Old_School
</code></pre>
<p>
Maybe. 😬
</p>
<p>
Four requests means one request every half hour, for every feed. I guess
it makes sense.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I seems that maybe these autonomous systems are hitting a
lot of expensive end-points but in general, they are all focused on feed
processing.
</p>
<p>
The autonomous system from Indonesia looks even more like a bot but in
addition to that it also goes through all the archives, for every single
page:
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 7713 | log-request | rank-lines
      1 /wiki/Older_Upgrading_Issues
      1 /wiki/CategoryWiki

      1 /wiki?action=admin&amp;id=UserInterfaceValidator
</code></pre>
<p>
Hopefully most of that will be fixed once the forms all change from GET
to POST. 😬
</p>
<p>
In any case, I don’t feel like lifting this limit!
</p>
<p>
The last instance involves banning all the autonomous systems that are
hitting “no bots” warnings. The web server does this redirect for
various requests, including all user agents containing the words “bot”,
“spider”, “crawl” etc.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to change all my <code>robots.txt</code> files to the
following:
</p>
<pre><code>User-agent: *
Disallow: /
DisallowAITraining: /
