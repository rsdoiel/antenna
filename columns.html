LogicPro also lets you add "Apple Audio Units" as filters, instead of
the LogicPro ones, and those get an uglier interface that seems
auto-generated, but still looks like some attention went into doing some
custom mappings.
</p>
<p>
I tried to get similar effects for comparison. Godot odds, LogicPro
evens:

<p>
In Godot's AudioBus system, you can add effects, and when you get an
effect, you get a window with properties you can edit.
</p>
<p>
I went to see what Logic Pro did for something similar, and I was in
awe, every effect has a custom and glorious UI.
</p>
<p>
I don't think I am going to get around to this before the 1.0 release,
but I now have a new goal.

<p>
This is the pitch shifter in Godot and Logic Pro.

<h2 id="dont-try-to-change-the-world">Don’t try to change the world</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Silicon Valley encourages entrepreneurs to think in terms of changing
the world. I was one of them when I arrived there in 1979 at the age of
24, with world-changing software ready to go (or so I thought). A few
years later, I shipped a way of writing that was only possible on a
computer, and in a small way I suppose it did change the world. I kept
innovating, but over time I came to realize that one person trying to
change the world is usually futile, but what’s even worse, you might
actually manage to change the world, and that’s going to be a disaster
for you and the world. As Elon Musk is doing right now.
</p>
<p>
Musk is the perfect cautionary tale for “be careful of what you wish
for.” No one person should change the world. We are a creation of
evolution, and we also are creators of evolution, but evolution is the
result of lots of infinitesmal events, not some great god-like creation
that young people tend to dream of. That’s what he’s doing wrong, trying
to force his vision on all of the rest of us. We’d be crazy to wish for
what he wants, and we’re not that crazy.
</p>
<p>
I have a pretty good idea of what he wants because like him, I think in
terms of what you can do with networks of computers and people. And I
understand their weakness, and also believe in the good intentions of
99.99% of the people, so even though our networks are not perfectly
secure somehow we seem to get by. But Musk has gotten inside, and is
doing what he wants, and the rest of us don’t get a say, and he’s of the
0.01% you absolutely <i>don’t</i> want to have the keys to the treasury
or nukes of the United States in 2025.
</p>
<p>
A lot of wise people over a few hundred years set up a system where we
all get a say, and it’s gotten us by pretty well. When one person takes
control, that’s disaster, because no one, not even Musk, is an immortal
god. He’s got huge blind spots. If you try to rewrite every bit of code
too fast you end up with a broken system. He’ll leave and we’ll have to
deal with what remains. And hopefully after we get over that, we’ll
figure out how to not let a future Musk get in there again. And that’s
going to involve a fair amount of pain for the billionaires. If you all
want to start helping to solve the problem, now would be a good time to
get involved, Mr and Ms Billionaire. Thanks for listening.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I’ve
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/03/201849.html">mentioned</a> this
<a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/13.html#a141000">before</a> –
there’s a
<a href="https://clip.cafe/sleeper-1973/what-happened-everybody/">great
joke</a> in the Woody Allen movie Sleeper. It was about Albert Shanker
playing the role of Elon Musk, who wasn’t born when the movie came out.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/21/miceAndMen.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
know this is ancient history, but I was thinking the other day about how
Tim O’Reilly kept saying he had nothing to do with the temporary
takeover of the name
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> by RDF
advocates. But it was an O’Reilly exec, Dale Dougherty, who drove it. I
suppose perhaps Tim was saying, effectively, that Dougherty never told
him what he was doing. But the information of his involvement was
available publicly. At the time, we had the web (obviously) and good
search engines. And O’Reilly Associates was a journalistic organization
– he could have asked someone to research it for him. Also the tech guy
who ran the project was an O’Reilly employee. Maybe Tim didn’t know. But
he sure took it out on me personally. A lot of doors were closed to me
because of this clash. But I don’t apologize for anything I said. It
<i>was</i> a company thing. If Tim wasn’t aware of what his #2 guy was
doing, sorry that’s not on me. But everyone involved knew it was
O’Reilly doing it.
</p>
<p>
Anyway – if ChatGPT had existed at the time, he could have asked for an
impartial opinion. I’m going to try it now. Here’s the prompt I wrote.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In 1999 or 2000 (not sure of the exact date) there was a fork of RSS,
turning it into a dialect of RDF, a format that was being promoted by
the W3C. They called it RSS 1.0.
</li>
<li>
It never really took hold, never became widely used, because the earlier
version of RSS, v0.91 was being adopted at a very high rate because it
was being supported by all the blogging platforms of the day, and by
major publishers, including Salon, Red Herring, Motley Fool and Wired.
Later the NY Times would support RSS 2.0, which was an evolution of RSS
0.91, and then the entire news industry followed their lead, and RSS
quickly became the most popular way to read news on the web.
</li>
<li>
Here’s the question. Was O’Reilly Associates involved in the RSS 1.0
fork? Tim O’Reilly, at the time, said it wasn’t involved. But Dale
Dougherty, the #2 exec at O’Reilly lead the effort, and the technical
lead was an O’Reilly employee. Would it be fair to say that ORA was
involved. Would the fork have happened without their involvement? Try to
be as impartial as you can.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have asked ChatGPT to give me a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680644ab-ee60-8012-b3b5-77ddc2300958">shareable
version</a> of its answer – but I find that often people say they can’t
read it. But you have the prompt so you can ask ChatGPT or any other AI
app, for it’s (hopefully) impartial response.
</p>
<p>
Update: I fed the same prompt into
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/e347df31-c906-4db1-bb16-909f9e15541f">Claude.ai</a>

<h2 id="another-view-of-me-via-chatgpt">Another view of me via
ChatGPT</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
People who look down their noses at ChatGPT and its cousins tend to say
it’s not art. Hardly the most interesting thing, but as I’ve
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/28/124753.html">written</a>, art
lives mostly in the mind of the viewer, it’s the effect it has on the
viewer – that imho is the art. BTW I can tell when people have actually
used the product, and most of the critics haven’t. Sorry but until you
use it you won’t know how obvious that is to someone who does.
</p>
<p>
A lot of what I do with ChatGPT and images is like what they do with
audio
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)">sampling</a>. I
say here’s a photo of me, and here’s a drawing someone else did. Can you
render the image of me in that style? As I did
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/20/200843.html">yesterday</a> with
my niece’s portrait of herself. Think of it as Uncle Davey viewed
through the mind of Emma Louise? I don’t know if it is or isn’t, but
that’s what I think of when I see the picture. Also I think of how large
it is, and how old I’ve gotten, realizing that picture is already two
years old itself. ;-)
</p>
<p>
Today I came across a cartoon of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>,
the US Secretary of Defense drawn by
<a href="https://www.deadder.net/home">Michael de Adder</a>. I thought
wow that’s different. I wonder what ChatGPT would do if I asked it to
render my headshot in the style of that drawing? While it was doing the
work, I tried to imagine what it would do with it! Would I be wearing a
military uniform? Would I salute the viewer? Would it change my
expression? Here’s the drawing, and below it, the rendering.

At first I figured “ten minute hack”, only to later notice the marker
numbers, the uneven odd long/short marks and then the very subtle
differences in ranges on the right side.

I thought I could implement this LogicPro control in a couple of hours
for Godot, but under the surface, the marks and acceleration of the
volume from LogicPro and Godot are not the same - after some four hours
of false starts I gave up.
</p>
<p>
I think I will just implement the Godot behavior for now, and live to
fight another day.

My niece sent me a self-portrait, which I liked very much.
</p>
<p>
So I tried an experiment. I pasted her self-portrait and my head shot of
myself and asked ChatGPT to render my photo in the style of her art.
</p>
<p>

ChatGPT renders my headshot in a familiar style.
