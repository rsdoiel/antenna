id="why-are-hobbyist-21st-century-8-bit-computers-so-constrained">Why
are hobbyist 21st century 8-bit computers so constrained?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: Liam on Linux</p>
I learned about a new DIY machine to me, the
<a href="https://www.codycomputer.org/">Cody Computer</a>. <br />
<div class="comment_text" role="heading" aria-level="3">
<p>
It looks kind of fun, but once again, it does make me wonder why it’s so
constrained. Extremely low-res graphics, for instance. TBH I would have
sneered at this for being low-end when I was about 13 years old.
(Shortly before I got my first computer, a 48K ZX Spectrum.)
</p>
<p>
Why isn’t anyone trying to make an easy home-build high-end eight-bit?
Something that really pushes the envelope right out there – the sort of
dream machine I wanted by about the middle of the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
In 1987 I owned an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW#PCW_9512_and_9256" rel="ugc">Amstrad
PCW9512</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
4MHz Z80A
</li>
<li>
512 kB RAM, so 64kB CP/M 3 TPA plus something over 400kB RAMdisc as
drive M:
</li>
<li>
720 x 256 monochrome screen resolution, 90 x 30 characters in text mode
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Later in 1989 I bought an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_Coup%C3%A9" rel="ugc">MGT SAM
Coupé</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
6MHz Z80B
</li>
<li>
256 kB RAM
</li>
<li>
256 x 192 or 512 x 192 graphics, with 1/2/4 bits per pixel
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both had graphics easily outdone by the MSX 2 and later Z80 machines,
but those had a dedicated GPU. That might be a reach but then given the
limits of a 64 kB memory map, maybe a good one.
</p>
<p>
Another aspirational machine was the BBC Micro: a expandable, modular OS
called MOS; an excellent BASIC, BBC BASIC, with structured flow, named
procedures, with local variables, enabling recursive programming, and
inline assembly language so if you graduated to machine-code you could
just enter and edit it in the BASIC line editor. (Which was weird, but
powerful – for instance, 2 independent cursors, one source and one
destination, eliminating the whole “clipboard” concept.)
Resolution-independent graphics, and graphics modes that cheerfully used
most of the RAM, leaving exploitation as an exercise for the developer.
Which they rose to magnificently.
</p>
<p>
The BBC Micro supported
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro_expansion_unit" rel="ugc">dual
processors</a> over the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_(BBC_Micro)" rel="ugc">Tube
interface</a>, so one 6502 could run the OS, the DOS, and the
framebuffer, using most of its 64 kB, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC#BBC_Micro" rel="ugc">Hi-BASIC</a>
could run on the 2nd 6502 (or Z80!) processor, therefore having most of
64 kB to itself.
</p>
<p>
In a 21st century 8-bit, I want something that comfortably exceeds a
1980s 8-bit, let alone a 1990s 8-bit.
</p>
<p>
(And yes, there were new 8-bit machines in the 1990s, such as the
<a href="https://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Plus" rel="ugc">Amstrad CPC
Plus range</a>, or
<a href="https://www.msx.org/wiki/MSX_turbo_R" rel="ugc">MSX Turbo
R</a>.)
</p>
<p>
So my wish list would include…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>At least</em> 80-column legible text, ideally more. We can forget
analog TVs and CRT limitations now. Aim to exceed VGA resolutions. 256
colours in some low resolutions but a high mono resolution is handy too.
</li>
<li>
Lots of RAM with some bank-switching mechanism, plus mechanisms to make
this useful to BASIC programmers not just machine code developers. A
RAMdisc is easy.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_BASIC" rel="ugc">Beta
BASIC</a> on the ZX Spectrum 128 lets BASIC declare arrays kept in the
RAMdisc, so while a BASIC program is limited to under 30 kB of RAM, it
can manipulate 100-odd kB of data in arrays. That’s a simple, clever
hack.
</li>
<li>
A really world-class BASIC with structured programming support.
</li>
<li>
A fast processor (double-digit megahertz doesn’t seem too much to ask).
</li>
<li>
Some provision for 3rd party OSes. There are some impressive ones out
there now, such as <a href="http://www.symbos.de/" rel="ugc">SymbOS</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki" rel="ugc">Contiki</a>,
and <a href="https://www.fuzix.org/" rel="ugc">Fuzix</a>. GEOS is open
source now, too.
</li>
</ul>

It’s becoming an

<blockquote>
<p>
Card draining is when criminals remove gift cards from a store display,
open them in a separate location, and either record the card numbers and
PINs or replace them with a new barcode. The crooks then repair the
packaging, return to a store and place the cards back on a rack. When a
customer unwittingly selects and loads money onto a tampered card, the
criminal is able to access the card online and steal the balance.

<p>
For <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/twenty-twenty-three/">last
year’s check-in</a>, I foreshadowed a year of changes for ol’ Dave
Rupert and boy was I not kidding. New job, new car, new pets. But before
we get into all that – for accountability’s sake – let’s check in on my
resolutions from last year and see how I did…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Activate an active lifestyle</strong> - Nope.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write more shitty sci-fi</strong> - Nope.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Draw more</strong> - Nope.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write for other publications</strong> - Yes, I wrote for
<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/">Frontend Masters’ Boost
blog</a> and <a href="https://multipa.ge/">Wilto’s Multipage Version</a>
zine.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Survive the 2024 US Election</strong> - Yes, but what a
disappointment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Make a video game?</strong> - Yes,
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/12/my-little-games-workshop/">I
made and released a few</a> but also went beyond video games a bit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Final score: 50%-ish. That’s better than I expected. What did I do with
the other 50% of my time if I wasn’t crushing it on my SMART goals?
Let’s see…

Finding a job dominated the first half of my year. After some ups and
downs I ended up in a good place at Microsoft. There’s a lot of
positives going from self-employment to the corporate world (hey! actual
benefits! stocks even!) but also a lot of organizational bureaucracy
that I’m not used to navigating. I’m happy with the work I’m doing and
feel lucky to get to work on web components each day.
</p>
<p>
My wife and I’s trip to Pittsburgh for Frostapalooza was a big crescendo
for the year. Months and months of practicing culminating in one big
night. It’s hard to describe it other than some kind of nerd-flavored
camp reunion but with guitars instead of computers. We had such a good
time and the amount of music filling our house on a daily basis has
increased ten-fold this year. For that I’m thankful.
</p>
<p>
I often judge years based on if we hit our health insurance deductible
and we hit it again this year. A lot of medium grade background stress:
job hunt stress, new job stress, healthcare stress, election stress,
etc. Thankfully – and I could be basking in the limelight of a good
Christmas holiday and a week off from work – I hardly remember that
stress anymore. It feels like I’ve shedded those layers of anxiety.
</p>
<h2>
Stats for 2024
</h2>
<p>
With all the qualitative out of the way, let’s get more quantitative
about what we did this year…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">52 books</a> - Still in the
book-a-week club. I’m comfortable here but need to mix it up. I’m
becoming cynical when I hear the same ten facts and sociological studies
regurgitated to meet some new popular science zeitgeist. Political
biographies are all the same five liberal or conservative party tent
poles supported by some personal anecdote. I think I’m going to lean
hard into sci-fi “snacks” – short, easy books – for the next year while
supplementing with beefier book recommendations from trusted peers.

<a href="https://daverupert.com/archive/">61 blog posts</a> - Not a

<p>
A pretty good year for me and it’d be great to maintain that pace next
year. To be totally honest, my actual goal would be to do less next
year. Sounds crazy, I know, numbers should only go up and to the right.
But hear me out… what if they didn’t? Have we considered that option?
</p>
<p>
I didn’t play video games as much as I would have liked to this year, so
I’ll need to remedy that. I’ve got a backlog brewing but I’m having a
good time <em>making</em> games and that’s a time tradeoff I’m okay
with. But from a “great writers read” perspective, I should play more
games. Related, I had to quit late night gaming with the boys because it
effected my sleep and stress levels, but I want to get back to that. AAA
gaming is in a rough state though.
</p>
<h2>
Hopes for 2025
</h2>
<p>
There’s five focus areas I’d like to pursue next year and I already have
traction on most of these feel achievable, But I’ve been wrong about
that in the past.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Seize work opportunities -</strong> It’s been a great first 7
months at Microsoft but I have some big projects shipping in the next
quarter so I need to shift out of my “learning the ropes” mode into a
more melee combat ready position.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hunker down and be creative</strong> - I’m not excited about the
state of the union right now, so I’m going to trust my instinct to
burrow. I’ve got some apps, games, and shitty sci-fi ideas that I’d be
happy to work on instead of doomscrolling the news. I feel okay about
pursuing those ideas rather than getting mired in political headlines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Slow down to 1x mode</strong> - The ability to consume books,
podcasts, and videos at 2x is a super power but I feel a nudge to take
life slower. Slowing down would hopefully increase the time-cost and
make me more discerning about what I choose to consume. The fact that I
view listening at 1x as a challenge tells me I should probably pursue
it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Join a club</strong> - Inspired by the documentary
<a href="https://www.joinordiefilm.com/">Join or Die</a>, I think I need
to join a club and participate in IRL more. Clubs give me an opportunity
to burst my personal/internet bubble and meet people who don’t share my
background, income, or political beliefs. But I can’t even think of what
I’d want to do. Perhaps something hobby-related? Join a lodge? Volunteer
at a food bank? I feel woefully unprepared that I don’t even have the
beginning of an answer here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Understand myself</strong> - Beyond work and side projects, the
biggest project I’ll be undertaking in 2025 is going to be… me. Since
the Summer, I’ve been on a mission to understand myself at a clinical
level. Last year I lost a lot of weight, more than half of it has come
back without much change in diet. I want to know what’s in this mountain
of flesh and bones and brains that God gave me. I want to begin to
untangle the Gordian Knot of Anxiety, Weight, and ADHD. This has meant
seeing a new doctor, getting blood work done, seeing a therapist,
evaluating medication, and a whole lot more. I even made it a “Project”
in Notion so I’d actually follow through on it. My ideal outcome is to
come up with a plan to get through the next five, ten, fifteen, thirty
years and beyond. In the immediate future an unexpected medical malady
has presented itself and I’ll probably have to undergo surgery next
year.
</p>
<h2>
We’ll take a cup of kindness yet, for auld lang syne
</h2>
<p>
I know some had an awful 2024. I’d say mine was hard but good over the
long haul. 2025 seems primed to bring its own existential challenges and
I hope you find shelter. Tech is still in shambles right now but I’m
starting to see hints of the icy job market thawing, but I’m unsure if
it will ever go back to “normal”. And politics… oof. We’re already
seeing the outputs of the self-inflicted chaos machine. Keep in mind
that chaos is the goal; chaos to exhaust and disarm us, to
<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation">flood
the zone with shit</a>. So hold fast to your principles and conserve
energy for the long haul. Keep your hand on the plow and keep your eyes
on the prize. Hold on.

took me a long time to figure out that when people respond to you on
twitter-like systems they aren’t actually speaking to <i>you,</i>
they’re talking over your shoulder to the masses they imagine are
reading what you posted. Three comments. 1. There are no masses. You can
see this by looking at the stats for each tweet, available on most
platforms. 2. Most users on the social web are trying to get attention
for themselves, the only reason they read the posts is to see if there’s
a place for them to attach their message. 3. A simple tweak to the
software would make it so that only the author of the post being
responded to could see the replies. Then they could RT a reply if they
thought everyone should see it. This would make the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> a lot more useful
imho.</p>
