      Mea culpa: Unfortunately I misquoted Joni, she said "paved" not "took." I'm going to leave the mistake in the piece.

      There are two quotes that make me laugh in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">Think Different</a> piece from last week. One of them is <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#:~:text=They%20took%20paradise%20and%20blew%20big%20holes%20in%20it%20that%20users%20couldn't%20find%20a%20way%20out%20of.">here</a>: "They took paradise and.." At first, if you're roughly my age, you read "They took paradise and..." and recognize it as the beginning of a famous line from Joni Mitchell's <a href="https://genius.com/Joni-mitchell-big-yellow-taxi-lyrics">Big Yellow Taxi</a>. The other is a subtle touch of sarcasm, that I usually try not to indulge in, but let pass through as I edited this piece. See if you can <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">find</a> it.

      It's the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina which wiped out New Orleans, a major American city, which I knew because I went to college there. I went there in December 2005 to get an idea of what a post-apocalyptic American city looks like. On the flight from Atlanta to New Orleans, a <a href="http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cn05Dec13.mp3">50-minute podcast</a> with Janet, a woman who lost her house and all her possessions in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeview,_New_Orleans#Hurricane_Katrina">Lakeview</a> section of New Orleans. It's quite possible this and the <a href="http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cn05Dec16.mp3">one that followed</a> were the only contemporary podcasts about Katrina, because in 2005 there wasn't all that much podcasting going on. You can see these episodes in the <a href="https://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning Coffee Notes</a> program listing.

And the Mets, my team since 1962, are really exciting right now, after a month of being lost. They have great rookie pitchers who are full of youthful enthusiasm and they kick ass on the mound. They have veterans who understand their job is to lead and they take that responsibility seriously, and they get on base, steal bases, and hit home runs. And they have workaday athletes who get on base when the team needs a hit. And the most expensive player ever in any sport who's finally playing as part of the team and not someone who misses the old team he used to play on. And they still have the most ridiculously dorky mascot, a caricature of a human with a baseball for a head, and his wife who also has a baseball for a head. Where do they come up with these ideas? Doesn't matter it's the M-E-T-S of New York town who we will now step right up to meet, and greet.</p>

      Everything Trump is doing to steal the next election is proof of why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Anderson">Colorado</a> was right to deny him a place on the 2024 ballot. The Supremes gave him four years to prepare, to learn from his mistakes, now he'll do it from the top seat. It seems certain to work.

      <h1>Git diagramming "The Weave"</h1>

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/08/git-diagramming-the-weave/">Dave Rupert blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>We all know the current US President is one hell of an orator and often assures us that he has “the best words”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to an Ivy League school. I’m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man knows words. Says so right there. While some might view his non-sequitur ramblings as the nascent stages of dementia or an unfiltered ADHD brain launching into successive short (at times racist) bullet-point diatribes based on the last word or phrase he said like a cursed game of word association, the President asserts this is not the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, I do the weave. You know what the weave is? I’ll talk about, like, nine different things, and they all come back brilliantly together. And it’s like - and friends of mine that are, like, English professors - they say, it’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5107714/breaking-down-former-president-donald-trumps-rambling-linguistic-style">The Weave</a>” re-entered my consciousness this week after I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ds1Cz-LpA">a quick snippet of an Oval Office event</a> where Trump says the (“radical left-wing”) CBO projects tariffs will reduce the deficit by $4 trillion USD. I was skeptical –<a href="https://youtu.be/ab9yLd3OjSw">and for good reason</a>– but I tuned in. What shocked me was not the complete lack of specifics about the CBO projection, but rather the actual reason for the Oval Office meeting: a FIFA event? Wow.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_Ds1Cz-LpA?si=cBQ0UPVzaiISw4ho" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>For awhile now, I’ve clued into the cyclical pattern of his speeches, little snippets of “the best words” and talking points assembled like a ransom note cut from a magazine. I often wondered if it’s possible to diagram “the weave”. The “branching” narratives Trump uses made me think a git-graph-style visualization was apropos. So I grabbed a transcript and got to work.</p>
<p>For my first attempt, I used <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html">Mermaid.js’ GitGraph Diagram</a> which worked well but only supports horizontal charts. As I sat with it I realized I wanted a chronological list of statements that read like a transcript. I repurposed the Mermaid’s GitGraph DSL and made a web component called <code>&lt;git-graph&gt;</code> to help me visualize and document Trump’s derailing trains of thought from the above event.</p>

<p>By my count in that four-minute address there were ten distinct themes or “branches”, most of which are common grievances or rhetorical themes found in nearly all Trump speeches. I used “cherry-picking” to model callbacks to a previous statement (e.g. “the stock market is up”) that seem to reverberate into later trains of thought, a quintessential feature of the weave.</p>
<p>Four minutes of the weave was about all I could handle but I think this visualization models what I experience when trying to follow along to the President’s speeches. One or two phrases on a topic, then jumping to a new topic, weaving in a (sometimes unrelated) point from a previous topic to make the thought appear more cohesive and linear, then driving deep down an inconsequential topic. When he talks so long about ten different topics at a time, I’d forgive you for thinking he said something salient. But when you break it down you see it for what it is: a mishmash of talking points.</p>

      <h1>The Invisibles</h1>

(date: 2025-08-30, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22100">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>When I was talking about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22099">monitoring web performance yesterday</a>, I linked to the <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">CrUX data for The Session</a>.</p>

<p>CrUX is a contraction of Chrome User Experience Report. CrUX just sounds better than CEAR.</p>

<p>It’s data gathered from actual Chrome users worldwide. It can be handy as part of a balanced performance-monitoring diet, but it’s always worth remembering that it only shows a subset of your users; those on Chrome.</p>

<p>The actual CrUX data is imprisoned in some hellish Google interface so some kindly people have put more humane interfaces on it. I like <a href="https://calibreapp.com/tools/core-web-vitals-test/thesession.org">Calibre’s CrUX tool</a> as well as <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">Treo’s</a>.</p>

<p>What’s nice is that you can look at the numbers for any reasonably popular website, not just your own. Lest I get too smug about the performance metrics for <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>, I can compare them to <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/en.wikipedia.org">the numbers for WikiPedia</a> or <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/www.bbc.co.uk">the BBC</a>. Both of those sites are made by people who prioritise speed, and it shows.</p>

<p>If you scroll down to the numbers on navigation types, you’ll see something interesting. Across the board, whether it’s The Session, Wikipedia, or the BBC, the BFcache—back/forward cache—is used around 16% to 17% of the time. This is when users use the back button (or forward button).</p>

<p>Unless you do something to stop them, browsers will make sure that those navigations are super speedy. You might inadvertently be <a href="https://web.dev/articles/bfcache">sabotaging the BFcache</a> if you’re sending a <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code> header or if you’re using an <code>unload</code> event handler in JavaScript.</p>

<p>I guess it’s unsurprising the BFcache numbers are relatively consistent across three different websites. People are people, whatever website they’re browsing.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">The Session</a></li>
<li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/en.wikipedia.org">WikiPedia</a></li>
<li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/www.bbc.co.uk">The BBC</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Where it gets interesting is in the differences. Take a look at pre-rendering. It’s 4% for the BBC and just 0.4% for Wikipedia. But on The Session it’s a whopping 35%!</p>

<p>That’s because I’m using <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21139">speculation rules</a>. They’re quite straightforward to implement and they pair beautifully with full-page view transitions for a slick, speedy user experience.</p>

<p>It doesn’t look like WikiPedia or the BBC are using speculation rules at all, which kind of surprises me.</p>

<p>Then again, because they’re a hidden technology I can understand why they’d slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>On any web project, I think it’s worth having a checklist of The Invisibles—things that aren’t displayed directly in the browser, but that can make a big difference to the user experience.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest">web application manifest</a> JSON file to help people install your website.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://goingoffline.adactio.com/">service worker</a>, even if it’s just to cache static assets.</li>
<li>Open Graph <a href="https://metatags.io/"><code>meta</code> elements</a> in the <code>head</code> of documents so they “unroll” nicely when the link is shared.</li>
<li>An appropriate <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/">content security policy</a> header.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API"><code>Speculation-Rules</code></a> header that points to a JSON file.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/Guides/OpenSearch">OpenSearch XML file</a> if your site has search functionality.</li>
<li>An icon, or as us olds call it, a favicon.</li>
<li>A <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>body</code> of every page.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve got a checklist like that in place, you can at least ask “Whose job is this?” All too often, these things are missing because there’s no clarity on whose responsible for them. They’re sorta back-end and sorta front-end.</p>

      Not much  computing in August.  I decided  to have ACTUAL  holidays. In last (many) years it was rather different. Few one-day trips but mostly being at work (or  working from home) all the time.  Not as actively as normally but working.

      <h1>Databasing</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22099">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>A few years back, Craig wrote a great piece called <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/">Fast Software, the Best Software</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speed in software is probably the most valuable, least valued asset. To me, speedy software is the difference between an application smoothly integrating into your life, and one called upon with great reluctance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nelson Elhage said much the same thing in his <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/">reflections on software performance</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve really come to appreciate that performance isn’t just some property of a tool independent from its functionality or its feature set. Performance — in particular, being notably fast — is a feature in and of its own right, which fundamentally alters how a tool is used and perceived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessibility-and-web-performance-are-not-features-theyre-the-baseline/">as Robin put it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t think a website can be good until it’s fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those sentiments underpin <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. Speed is as much a priority as usability, accessibility, <a href="https://thesession.org/privacy">privacy</a>, and security.</p>

<p>I’m fortunate in that the site doesn’t have an underlying business model at odds with these priorities. I’m under no pressure to add <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/18676">third-party code that would track users and slow down the website</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to making fast websites, most of the obstacles are put in place by front-end development, mostly JavaScript. I’ve been pretty ruthless in my pursuit of speed on The Session, <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20448">removing as much JavaScript as possible</a>. On the bigger pages, the bottleneck now is DOM size rather than parsing and excuting JavaScript. As bottlenecks go, it’s not the worst.</p>

<p>But even with all my core web vitals looking good, I still have an issue that can’t be solved with front-end optimisations. <a href="https://calibreapp.com/tools/core-web-vitals-test/thesession.org#ttfb">Time to first byte</a> (or TTFB if you’d rather use an initialism that takes just as long to say as the words it’s replacing).</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2019/08/time-to-first-byte-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/">reducing the time to first byte</a>, there are plenty of factors that are out of my control. But in the case of The Session, something I do have control over is the server set-up, specifically the database.</p>

<p>Now I could probably solve a lot of my speed issues by throwing money at the problem. If I got a bigger better server with more RAM and CPUs, I’m pretty sure it would improve the time to first byte. But my wallet wouldn’t thank me.</p>

<p>(It’s still worth acknowledging that this is a perfectly valid approach when it comes to back-end optimisation that isn’t available on the front end; you can’t buy all your users new devices.)</p>

<p>So I’ve been spending some time really getting to grips with the MySQL database that underpins The Session. It was already normalised and indexed to the hilt. But perhaps there were server settings that could be tweaked.</p>

<p>This is where I have to give a shout-out to <a href="https://releem.com/">Releem</a>, a service that is <em>exactly</em> what I needed. It monitors your database and then over time suggests configuration tweaks, explaining each one along the way. It’s a seriously good service that feels as empowering as it is useful.</p>

<p>I wish I could afford to use Releem on an ongoing basis, but luckily there’s a free trial period that I could avail of.</p>

<p>Thanks to Releem, I was also able to see which specific queries were taking the longest. There was one in particular that had always bothered me…</p>

<p>If you’re a member of The Session, then you can see any activity related to something you submitted in the past. Say, for example, that you added a tune or an event to the site a while back. If someone else comments on that, or bookmarks it, then that shows up in your “notifications” feed.</p>

<p>That’s all well and good but under the hood it was relying on a fairly convuluted database query to a very large table (a table that’s effectively a log of all user actions). I tried all sorts of query optimisations but there always seemed to be some combination of circumstances where the request would take ages.</p>

<p>For a while I even removed the notifications functionality from the site, hoping it wouldn’t be missed. But a couple of people wrote to ask where it had gone so I figured I ought to reinstate it.</p>

<p>After exhausting all the technical improvements, I took a step back and thought about the <em>purpose</em> of this particular feature. That’s when I realised that I had been thinking about the database query too literally.</p>

<p>The results are ordered in reverse chronological order, which makes sense. They’re also chunked into groups of ten, which also makes sense. But I had allowed for the possibility that you could navigate through your notifications back to the very start of your time on the site.</p>

<p>But that’s not really how we think of notifications in other settings. What would happen if I were to limit your notifications only to activity in, say, the last month?</p>

<p>Boom! Instant performance improvement by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>I guess there’s a lesson there about switching off the over-analytical side of my brain and focusing on actual user needs.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to the time I’ve spent honing the database settings and optimising the longest queries, I’ve reduced the latency by quite a bit. I’m hoping that will result in an improvement to the time to first byte.</p>

<p>Time—and <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">monitoring tools</a>—will tell.</p>

      <h1>Bronx Science, in retrospect</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/29/151308.html?title=bronxScienceInRetrospect">Dave Winer's Scripting News</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Story. I'm on a mail list for Berkman, where I spent two years at Harvard. Alumnae of all generations are on this list, and it's interesting.</p>
<p>Just got an email that someone was proud of having their picture taken with Susan Landau. I didn't know who she was, so I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Landau">looked her up</a>.</p>
<p>She was born in 1954. And is a highly accomplished math and comp sci wizard, with cred at Harvard, Google, and now teaches at Tufts. </p>
<p>Then I get to the place where they say she went to <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Bronx%20Science%22">Bronx Science</a>. </p>
<p>That was my class, unless she, like I, skipped a grade. We both would have started in 1969 and graduated in 1972.</p>
<p>I just wanted to write this up because I've noticed in the last few years, now that I live in the northeast, not far from the Bronx, I tend to come across more Science alums, and when I do, I generally find we have a lot to talk about, and share a New York style nerd sense of humor. </p>
<p>And as a math major myself, I conclude that their test was pretty good, it definitely selected a certain kind of mind, and the people it selected generally went on to do interesting, creative and useful things. </p>

      <img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/29/matt.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/2025/08/think-different/">Matt Mullenweg</a> for the boost to <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">yesterday's post</a>. Glad to finally get the whole plan down in one place. Each piece of the puzzle took a while to come together in concept and then in implementation. I'm still working on all levels, last week I added a feature to <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> that makes it fit in better with the (new) timeline and WordPress (20+ years). It takes a while to change your thinking from WordPress being just another blogging CMS, to being an open platform that hosts <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">web writing</a> in a way that's open to competition. We're on the same page. It's still a competitive environment, but there are rules to competing, you don't cash in the interop that took patience and respect to develop and maintain. That's been the pity of the open web, lots of opportunists who are willing to stink up the ecosystem to squeeze a few more bucks for themselves from things <i>they didn't create.</i> Let your competitors in, and the users, if they have their heads screwed on right, will respect you for it. And even if they don't, still do it, because it's the right thing to do. That's why, at my age, just turned 70 earlier this year, I'm in a position to help revive the web, because I've made enough money, now it's time to make sure the gift that I got from the open web is available to future generations, no matter how greedy and selfish the <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/08/29/the-wealthy-and-dominant-giants-of-tech/">giants of tech</a> are. People may question Matt, and that's cool, as I said <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a142100">yesterday</a>, but also remember he's stood up for your freedom, and that's also important.

      <p>
      <p>I just heard about <a href="https://www.fodors.com/news/news/there-are-warnings-about-the-bag-tag-scam-but-is-it-really-a-scam">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://travelnoire.com/luggage-tag-scam">travel scam warning</a> going around the internet right now: You should keep your baggage tags on your bags until you get home, then shred them, because scammers are using luggage tags to file fraudulent claims for missing baggage with the airline.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, the scam is possible. I had a bag destroyed by baggage handlers on a recent flight, and all the information I needed to file a claim was on my luggage tag. I have no idea if I will successfully get any money from the airline, or what form it will be in, or how it will be tied to my name, but at least the first step is possible...</p>

I'm going to be introducing a very weird idea about WordPress, one that's going to bend your mind a lot, especially if you're a member of the WordPress community, but also if you're a developer who has used WordPress in an application sometime in the last 20 years, or a user who has used it to keep a blog, or to run a business website, or just someone who hangs around the web. It's famous, but not in the way I'm going to present it. I'm going to ask you to see WordPress the same way you think of Mastodon or Bluesky. It's a way of storing realtime text and graphics, and arrange them by time, and read and write them, subscribe to people, comment on what others have written, communicate with other people you find on a twitter-like network. If you look at the actual sofware, you'll see that WordPress and the other two systems have very similar features. They all store messages. And arrange them chronologically and in relation to other messages and people. But WordPress does it better.</p>

      <h1 id="2025-08-28-online-safety-maybe">2025-08-28 Online safety, maybe</h1>

<p>The longer I provide web services to strangers, the more I feel that data is toxic. I used to think I only had to worry about spam and vandalism, but with every regulator thinking that far more terrible material is just waiting to show up, and that they need to go after the recipients instead of the perpetrators, I&rsquo;m really starting to feel it.</p>

<p>DMCA and its descendants all over the world were pretty bad when it came to the anti-circumvention clauses but pretty OK when it came to a lack of moderation. And I know, moderation is good. But I also like the fact that I can host a lot of wikis without having to moderate. Luckily, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary in the last 20 years (other than spam and vandalism). It&rsquo;s getting somewhat harder to be excited by it all, though.</p>

<p>For example, the Online Safety Act in the UK basically requires moderation before publication (or geo-blocking the UK).</p>

<p>Another example is my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/xobaque.git/">Xobaque</a> &ldquo;search engine with no crawler&rdquo; that relies on feeds to provide the pages to index. The feeds are untrusted data provided by strangers on the Internet. Should Xobaque check that the pages actually exist? Should I check that they are on-topic and don&rsquo;t violate the law? (In what jurisdictions?) Should I verify the identities of the people that upload the feeds? The people writing the feeds?</p>

<p>Or should I just stand on the balcony and water the plants, listening to the drone of planes above and constant rumbling of cars in the distance, tending my garden, as it were.</p>

<p>I suspect this is the beginning of chilling effects. For a short while, tinkering at home felt the same, whether it was a little something for the household or for &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;. As it becomes clear that private and public spheres are in fact different, something must change. The first time I realised this was during the Napster days of copyright and music. The more this happens, the more I feel that online activity basically requires a lawyer, a company (the sacrificial lamb should you stumble somewhere on the way), and all the other contraptions of corporate life. Blech!</p>

      Kagi has quickly grown into something of a _household name_ within tech
circles. From _Hacker News_ and _Lobsters_ to _Reddit_, the search provider
seems to attract near-universal praise. Whenever the topic of _search engines_
comes up, there's an almost ritual rush to be the first to recommend Kagi,
often followed by a chorus of replies echoing the endorsement.

I'm going to be introducing a very weird idea about WordPress, one that's going to bend your mind a lot, especially if you're a member of the WordPress community, but also if you're a developer who has used WordPress in an application sometime in the last 20 years, or a user who has used it to keep a blog, or to run a business website, or just someone who hangs around the web. It's famous, but not in the way I'm going to present it. I'm going to ask you to see WordPress the same way you think of Mastodon or Bluesky. It's a way of storing realtime text and graphics, and arrange them by time, and read and write them, subscribe to people, comment on what others have written, communicate with other people you find on a twitter-like network. If you look at the actual sofware, you'll see that WordPress and the other two systems have very similar features. They all store messages. And arrange them chronologically and in relation to other messages and people. But WordPress does it better.

      <h1>Big bird in my pool</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/133314.html?title=bigBirdInMyPool">Dave Winer's Scripting News</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Last week I did an unusual podcast about three huge birds fighting over a fish in a nearby pond. Usually I write and talk about technology or politics, but this was such a compelling story and I didn't have any photos or video, so I did a verbal story. Hope you enjoyed it. Well now I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU">video</a>! </p>
<p>On Tuesday I went out to my pool, there was one of the big birds, in the pool. He couldn't get out. The pool is fenced in, as it must be, to keep animals and children from drowning, and the fence was too tall for the bird to fly out, or so it seemed. When it spotted me, it freaked out and tried to squeeze through the fence, which was impossible, the holes in the fence were too small for his sizeable body. </p>
<p>The bird did eventually manage to fly out, thankfully -- maybe I'll do another verbal podcast to explain why that was such an accomplishment. But for right now I just want to share the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU">video</a>.  </p>

<p>Matt takes a trip down memory lane and looks at all the frontend tools, technologies, and techniques that have come and gone over the years.</p>

<p>But this isn’t about nostalgia (although it does make you appreciate how far we’ve come). He’s looking at whether anything from the past is worth keeping today.</p>

      <h1>Plot for a political sci fi comedy</h1>

Kind of like Robin Williams, from the planet you come from, but he's a centipede and only breathes what you would think of as Chef Boyardee lasagna, but it's not really that, it's different. </p>
<p>Anyway, he's old, 757 centuries give or take, and they're expecting him to die soon, and they can elect someone boring so they can forget about politics. Everyone is looking forward to the relaxation. </p>
<p>And then one day he does die, and everyone breathes a huge sigh of relief, until later that night, on the 10-screen equivalent of what you would think of as TV, hilarity ensues when the "dead" PM showed up, looking fit, young and dashing, doing slapstick and talking about how he's going to make a mess of something. </p>
<p>Everyone was furious and then puzzled, we thought he was dead -- until the rumor started going around that the scientists had invented a sort of "artificial" thing that could perfectly emulate anyone or anything, including a Lasagna-breathing centipede comic despot from planet Y of star Z in the X galaxy. Everyone was pissed, but mostly agreed the PM was still pretty funny.</p>
<p>End of pilot. </p>

On the web seemed relatively easy. But of the web is a bit more elusive. Until <a href="https://x.com/KenSmith/status/1960475445457039601">Ken Smith</a> found <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html#:~:text=%22Hypertext%22%20is%20a%20term%20coined,together%20in%20an%20unconstrained%20way">this quote</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> in the original 1989 proposal by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> for what would become the web. "Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained way." I like this, because it, like the definition I came up with for <a href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">weblog</a>, talks about the activity as opposed to the technology. Human-readable is essential. And most essential is "unconstrained." If something requires a link, you should link to it. If you don't it ain't the web.

      <p>Nice <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/poisoned-document-could-leak-secret-data-chatgpt/">indirect prompt injection attack</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bargury&#8217;s attack starts with a poisoned document, which is <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375057?hl=en-GB&#038;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">shared</a> to a potential victim&#8217;s Google Drive. (Bargury says a victim could have also uploaded a compromised file to their own account.) It looks like an official document on company meeting policies. But inside the document, Bargury hid a 300-word malicious prompt that contains instructions for ChatGPT. The prompt is written in white text in a size-one font, something that a human is unlikely to see but a machine will still read.</p>

      W. David Marx writes, related to labubus and AI slop: &#8220;We&#8221; — consumers who desire complexity and innovation — are giving so much of &#8220;our&#8221; attention to things we hold in contempt. Marx is mostly talking about junk culture, mass culture, but I also think this applies to purity policing of cultural works, especially writing. [&#8230;]

      I think perhaps I should have one day every week where I never link to anything. Just to provide a demo of what the web would be like without linking. Which is most of the sites that say they are part of the web. I think that's a lie we should stop tolerating. Or maybe I should just stop offsite linking for one day a week. That would be interesting wouldn't it. Or I could charge extra for the version with the links. (It's very rare that I charge anything to use any of my web work, but I <i>have</i> done that at times.)

      I'm working my way through Mr Robot, for the third time I think. If you want to know what I do, it's like what Elliot does, for about four hours pretty much every day. I used to work longer hours but I've found this amount of work is optimal. I make more mistakes after about 1PM. Anyway Mr Robot is a very good thing to watch for the times we live in. The technology is already a little outdated, but they thought of that, there are some scenes where they use old PCs from the 80s, with total respect. I like that. And the utilities he uses are pretty much the same ones I use these days. And the context of a world in technological meltdown, I think that's a very realistic scenario. I don't see how our networks can't avoid breaking down. And our health care system, which these days is pretty much the same thing.

      <h1>Newsletters</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22093">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p><a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/newslettered/">Ethan tagged me in a post</a>. I didn’t feel a thing.</p>

<p>“I’d love to invite a few other folks to share their favorite newsletters”, he wrote.</p>

<p>My immediate thought was that I don’t actually subscribe to many newsletters. But then I remembered that most newsletters are available as RSS feeds, and I very much <em>do</em> subscribe to those.</p>

<p>Reading RSS and reading email feel very different to me. A new item in my email client feels like a task. A new item in my feed reader feels like a gift.</p>

<p>Anyway, I poked around in <a href="https://adactio.com/feeds/subscriptions/">my subscriptions</a> and found some newsletters in there that I can heartily recommend.</p>

<p>First and foremost, there’s <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/">The History Of The Web</a> by Jay Hoffman. Each newsletter is a building block for the timeline of the web that he’s putting together. It’s very much up my alley.</p>

<p>On the topic of the World Wide Web, <a href="https://matthiasott.com/">Matthias</a> has a newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/ownyourweb">Own Your Web</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you want to get started with your own personal website or level up as a designer, developer, or independent creator working with the ever-changing material of the Web, this little email is for you. ❤✊</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the inescapable topic of “AI”, I can recommend <a href="https://buttondown.com/maiht3k">Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000: The Newsletter</a> by Professor Emily M. Bender and Doctor Alex Hanna.</p>

<p>Journalist <a href="https://www.clivethompson.net/">Clive Thompson</a> has a fun newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/clivethompson">The Linkfest</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The opposite of doomscrolling: Every two weeks (roughly) I send you a collection of the best Internet reading I&#8217;ve found &#8212; links to culture, technology, art and science that fascinated me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you like that, you’ll love <a href="https://thewhippet.org/">The Whippet</a> by <a href="https://mckinleyvalentine.com/">McKinley Valentine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A newsletter for the terminally curious</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, now there are three more newsletters that I like, but I’m hesitant to recommend for the simple reason that they’re on <a href="https://leavesubstack.com/">Substack</a> alongside a pile of racist trash. If you decide you like any of these, please don’t subscribe by email; use the RSS feed. For the love of Jeebus, don’t give Substack your email address.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/">Age of Invention</a> by Anton Howes is a deep, deep dive into the history of technology and industry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m interested in everything from the exploits of sixteenth-century alchemists to the schemes of Victorian engineers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, there are two newsletters written by people whose music I listened to in my formative years in Ireland…</p>

<p><a href="https://paulpage.substack.com/">When We Were Young</a> by Paul Page recounts his time in the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IutkqyUU5o">Whipping Boy</a> in the ’90s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This will be the story of Whipping Boy told from my perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=popslMUM_mE">Toasted Heretic</a> were making very different music around the same time as Whipping Boy. Their singer <a href="https://www.juliangough.com/">Julian Gough</a> has gone on to write books, poems, and now a newsletter about cosmology called <a href="https://theeggandtherock.com/">The Egg And The Rock</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Egg and the Rock makes a big, specific argument (backed up by a lot of recent data, across many fields), that our universe appears to be the result of an evolutionary process at the level of universes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you go—quite a grab bag of newsletter options for you.</p>

      The <a href="https://this.how/web/what.opml#1756211321000">consensus</a> among the people who responded to my what does "on the web" mean query is this. Something is on the web if it has a URL you can use to view it in a web browser. That means, in 2025, that the URL begins with HTTP or HTTPS. Every "page" on a site must have a URL so they can be pointed to independently, otherwise known as deep linking. It's not enough to just have a home page that's on the web.

      <p>I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/07/backdoor-in-tetra-police-radios.html ">wrote about</a> this in 2023. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tetra-radio-encryption-backdoor/">the story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Three Dutch security analysts discovered the vulnerabilities­&#8212;five in total&#8212;­in a European radio standard called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which is used in radios made by Motorola, Damm, Hytera, and others. The standard has been used in radios since the ’90s, but the flaws remained unknown because encryption algorithms used in TETRA were kept secret until now. </p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/encryption-made-for-police-and-military-radios-may-be-easily-cracked-researchers-find/">new news</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2023, Carlo Meijer, Wouter Bokslag, and Jos Wetzels of security firm <a href="https://www.midnightblue.nl/">Midnight Blue</a>, based in the Netherlands, discovered vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms that are part of a European radio standard created by ETSI called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which has been baked into radio systems made by Motorola, Damm, Sepura, and others since the ’90s. The flaws remained unknown publicly until their disclosure, because ETSI refused for decades to let anyone examine the proprietary algorithms...</p></blockquote>

      These are the not the work of carpenters who care about the backs of the cabinets they’re building. These icons are so bad, they look like the work of untrained “How hard can it be?” dilettante carpenters who only last a few days on the job before sawing off one of their own fingers.

      <h1>Trump's secret was comedy</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Trump is a comedian. He makes people laugh the way Joan Rivers or Don Rickles did. </p>
<p>It's verbal slapstick, which is for some reason I don't understand immensely funny and entertaining.</p>
<p>Newsom is making us laugh by imitating Trump imitating Joan and Don. It's working. He must keep doing it, and he should evolve the schtick, he should make Trump match <i>him. </i>And where Trump is promoting depraved policies with his comedy, we can count on Newsom to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law and all the progress we've made. </p>
<p>He can invite famous comedians on his podcast to play opposite him, sometimes the straight man, playing their SNL roles. So much potential. He's got the attention, don't throw it away. </p>
<p>Politics was boring, it's not boring anymore. But there's no reason excitement and entertainment can't be good for us too! ;-)</p>
<p>Trump's secret is comedy and Newsom is stealing his thunder</p>

      <h1>Successive Prototypes Bridge the Gap Between Idea and Reality</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/idea-to-reality-with-prototypes/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Dismissing an idea because it doesn’t work in your head is doing a disservice to the idea.</p>
<p>(Same for dismissing someone else’s idea because it doesn’t work in your head.)</p>
<p>The only way to truly know if an idea works is to test it. </p>
<p>The gap between an idea and reality is the work. </p>
<p>You can’t dismiss something as “not working” without <em>doing</em> the work.</p>
<p>When collaborating with others, different ideas can be put forward which end up in competition with each other.</p>
<p>We debate which is best, but verbal descriptions don’t do justice to ideas — so the idea that wins is the one whose champion is the most persuasive (or has the most institutional authority).</p>
<p>You don’t want that. You want an environment where ideas can be evaluated based on their substance and not on the personal attributes of the person advocating them.</p>
<p>This is the value of prototypes. </p>
<p>We can’t visualize or predict how our own ideas will play out, let alone other people’s. This is why it’s necessary to bring them to life, have them take concrete form. It’s the only way to do them justice.</p>
<p>(Picture a cute puppy in your head. I’ve got one too. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/the-power-of-prototypes-in-the-creative-process/" >Now how do we determine who’s imagining the cuter puppy?</a> We can’t. We have to produce a concrete manifestation for contrast and comparison.)</p>
<p>Prototypes are how we bridge the gap between idea and reality. They’re an iterative, evolutionary, exploratory form of birthing ideas that test their substance.</p>
<p>People will bow out to a good persuasive argument.</p>
<p>They’ll bow out to their boss saying it should be one way or another.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to bow out to a good idea you can see, taste, touch, smell, or use. </p>

      <h1>2025-08-18 Zürich Zoo</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-18-zoo">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-18-zürich-zoo">2025-08-18 Zürich Zoo</h1>

<p>We went to the Zürich Zoo.</p>

<p>We started in the Australian section where they have a bunch of wallabies.
You can enter the enclosure. There were three wallabies chasing each other, grunting.
We suspected it was related to intercourse but when they stopped there was just short attempt at it and then they all preferred to drink water instead.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-necked_wallaby">red-necked wallaby</a>, <em>Notamacropus rufogriseus</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-7.jpg" alt="A wallaby eating salad. The pink pouch is very visible." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-8.jpg" alt="Wallaby head with backlight, showing the long whiskers." /></p>

<p>The same enclosure also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu">emus</a>, <em>Dromaius novaehollandiae</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-9.jpg" alt="An emu head with backlight, showing the delicate feathers around its face." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-10.jpg" alt="A super fluffy young (?) emu head." /></p>

<p>We went on to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanaco">guanaco</a>, <em>Lama guanicoe</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-11.jpg" alt="A wet guanaco who&rsquo;s been standing in a water spray to cool down." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-12.jpg" alt="A super cute young guanaco with huge black eyes." /></p>

<p>Next we saw some strange birds with strange, featherless heads. It&rsquo;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_bald_ibis">northern bald ibis</a>, <em>Geronticus eremita</em>. These used to be extinct in Switzerland but now they&rsquo;re back. They migrate south and so for rewilding, people had to adopt them and then fly with them across the alps with some ultralight flying vehicles. These days they fly to southern Spain instead, I heard. You can find some pictures about the project <a href="https://www.srf.ch/wissen/natur-tiere/rueckkehr-des-waldrapps-die-kueken-sind-da-das-comeback-eines-schraegen-vogels">on the Swiss radio and television site</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-13.jpg" alt="A bird with black feathers and a bald red head with patches of grey, with orange eyes and a typical long, bent ibis beak" /></p>

<p>We went to see the great cats because the zoo has a new setup wherein the tigers, lions and snow leopards move between enclosures every now and then. This keeps them more active because they smell the presence of the other great cats that were here before them. But as usual, the cats were asleep during the day.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-14.jpg" alt="A lioness&rsquo; paw. It big!" /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also an &ldquo;insect forest&rdquo; where you can step into a room with a bunch of branches full of stick insects and the like.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-15.jpg" alt="A green, leaf-like insect with plenty of thorns. This is the Heteropteryx dilatata." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-16.jpg" alt="Sadly, I was unable to find anything about this insect on the zoo site. It&rsquo;s very large, green, and its wings look like leaves that it keeps close to the body." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-17.jpg" alt="A big beetle seen from below. This is Mecynorhina ugandensis." /></p>

<p>When we went to eat a snack at the <em>Altes Klösterli</em> restaurant, we had a view at the back of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelada">gelada</a> enclosure, <em>Theropithecus gelada</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-18.jpg" alt="A female monkey sitting in front of a male. She has a bright red patch of hairless skin on her breast looking like a very strange, red necklace." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-19.jpg" alt="The male monkey has superb hairstyle, a bit like David Bowie in The Labyrinth." /></p>

<p>The elephants are great. There&rsquo;s a young one with its mother and its aunt, all Asian elephants, <em>Elephas maximus</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-20.jpg" alt="A tiny elephant between two huge adults." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-21.jpg" alt="The two sisters seem to like each other, pressing their faces against each other, while the little kid disappears behind them." /></p>

<p>The rhinos are nearby. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_white_rhinoceros">southern white rhinoceroses</a>, <em>Ceratotherium simum simum</em>. Closing time was approaching and these were the first rhinos to come back into their enclosure from the outside, where they mingle with some antelopes and giraffes.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-22.jpg" alt="The first rhino is looking into the enclosure and seeing humans on the other side, so it stops and tries to evaluate the situation." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-23.jpg" alt="The head of a rhinoceros with a very, very large horn." /></p>

<p>Outside, more rhinos, antelopes, ostriches and giraffes were still out and about.</p>

<p>These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_giraffe">reticulated giraffes</a>, <em>Giraffa reticulata</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_ostrich">South African ostriches</a>, <em>Struthio camelus australis</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-24.jpg" alt="The heads of two giraffes with their huge black eyes " />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-25.jpg" alt="The head of an ostrich with its grey feathers." /></p>

<p>Nearby, the super cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat">meerkat</a>, <em>Suricata suricatta</em>. One of them is always on the lookout.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-26.jpg" alt="The lookout is standing upright and looking at the horizon and the sky, not at the people." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-27.jpg" alt="A meerkat baby!" /></p>

<p>And finally, on the way out, we walked through the Masoala hall. So beautiful!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-4.jpg" alt="The Masoala hall, from one of the two towers. A green jungle below." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-6.jpg" alt="A picture showing the walkway above the tree canopy connecting the two towers, with me standing there in the greenery." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-5.jpg" alt="A passion flower growing on a handrail." /></p>

<p>The greatest moment was when we approached the bottom of one of the two towers. I walked around the corner and was looking at two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_ruffed_lemur">red ruffed lemurs</a>, <em>Varecia rubra</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-3.jpg" alt="Two super cute lemurs with bright yellow eyes, black heads, red fur and black paws that look more like hands, and a long tail held up like a question-mark." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-1.jpg" alt="The lemurs climbed up a stone wall and walked around me." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-2.jpg" alt="The lemurs disappear into the jungle." /></p>

<p>And then, we left!</p>

And since CBS isn't mentioned, I don't see how a credible journalist can stay there.

      I've been following Mark Cuban's recent posts on Bluesky, coming up with constructive things successful entrepreneurs can do to help. I had a different idea. Apply for a fellowship at a university, away from where you live, maybe in a place you've always wanted to try. In your application say you bring your entrepreneurial experience, but you're leaving your money on the side. You're coming to the university with the idea of creating something collaboratively, bringing the entrepreneurial approach of startups to the mix of people you find among academics. You're there to learn from the teachers and the students, and help them understand what you do. Use your mind, experience, creativity, even your contacts, but leave the money at home. You can live in a nice house, drive a nice car, but eat in the places people in the university eat, go to the lectures, concerts, sporting events, in other words, go back to school with your new perspective, and make a <i>personal</i> contribution. It's much more satisfying than spending money is, I speak from experience. There's a different kind of success in the collaboration. Another way to test yourself and develop new perspectives and experience. I wrote about this a few years back in <a href="https://this.how/phoenix/">Developing Better Developers</a>.

      I've been exchanging emails and voicemails with <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dpknauss/">Dan Knauss</a>, a longtime WordPress developer and one of the hosts of WordCamp Canada which I am speaking at in October. Learning a lot about the community and culture. I wonder, have I ever been part of a community that's over 20 years old? I can't think of one off the top of my head. I have gotten this far without knowing much about the WordPress community, other than what I've heard via Matt and what I've been able to infer from that. I've known Matt since he was a teenage boy wonder in the tech industry working at CNET and then as an entrepreneur. I think my point of view is a new one, I don't bring much baggage with me. I am generally sympathetic with Matt, having been the leader of the blogging world when it started, and found it a pretty thankless place, a position I was happy to relinquish in 2003 when I went to academia.

      There's a fresh release of the docs for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">WordPress API</a> we use in WordLand. I actually liked that the docs were old and kind of dusty. It says that the engineering culture is to not mess around with things that developers have already built on. A lot of platforms break developers without much thought. I learned a long time ago that when you do that, you lose the interest of developers, understandably.

      I asked, yesterday, on various social media sites, for people's opinion on what the term "on the web" means. I'm going to compile the answers on a <a href="https://this.how/web/what.opml">this.how page</a>, and then ask some follow-up questions. If you have an opinion, post a comment on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lx6ww3lqx22q">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/115087015889672419">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.com/@davew/post/DNwtUao3FZL">Threads</a> or <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1959803988733288674">Twitter</a>.

      <h1>2025-08-21 Looking at web server logs</h1>

(date: 2025-08-24, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-21-web-server-logs">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-21-looking-at-web-server-logs">2025-08-21 Looking at web server logs</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://scholar.social/@bookandswordblog" title="@bookandswordblog@scholar.social">@bookandswordblog</a> recently wondered how to look at web server logs. Ever since I&rsquo;m fighting the bots, I&rsquo;ve had to look at the web server stats and my <a href="/admin">admin</a> folder is full of small scripts. But if you&rsquo;re new to it all, how do you start?</p>

<h2 id="where-are-the-files">Where are the files?</h2>

<p>If you use Apache on Debian, the current log file is in <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code> so look for something similar. If you use nginx instead of Apache, it might be a folder like <code>/var/log/nginx</code>. The log file itself might be called differently, too.</p>

<h2 id="log-format">Log format</h2>

<p>The log file format can vary, too. If you use Apache on Debian, the log formats are set in <code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code> using the <code>LogFormat</code> directive, and each virtual host can pick one of them using the <code>CustomLog</code> directive.
See <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#accesslog">Log Files</a>.</p>

<p>In my case, I use a config file that sets the following:</p>

<pre><code>LogFormat &quot;%v:%p %h %l %u %t \&quot;%r\&quot; %&gt;s %O \&quot;%{Referer}i\&quot; \&quot;%{User-Agent}i\&quot; %&gt;D&quot; vhost_combined
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log vhost_combined
</code></pre>

<p>This adds <code>%&gt;D</code> at the end of the format and is otherwise identical to the default <code>vhost_combined</code> format.
The format codes are documented on the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats">mod_log_config</a> page.</p>

<p>And example line from my logs:</p>

<p><code>social.alexschroeder.ch:443 37.27.248.47 - - [21/Aug/2025:00:59:49 +0200] &quot;POST /users/alex/inbox HTTP/1.1&quot; 202 4207 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mastodon/4.4.2 (http.rb/5.3.1; +https://beige.party/)&quot; 33180</code></p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>a request to host <code>social.alexschroeder.ch</code> on port <code>443</code></li>
<li>from IP address <code>37.27.248.47</code></li>
<li>with no remote log name</li>
<li>and no remote user</li>
<li>on 2025-08-21 00:59:49 CEST</li>
<li>posted information to <code>/users/alex/inbox</code> (to read information the request would have used <code>GET</code> instead of <code>POST</code>)</li>
<li>the response was a status 202 (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status">HTTP response status codes</a> for a list)</li>
<li>and contained 4207 bytes</li>
<li>with no referrer provided</li>
<li>from a Mastodon user agent self-identifying as from beige.party</li>
<li>taking 33180 microseconds, or about 33 milliseconds (this is the information I added)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="processing-the-log-using-awk">Processing the log using <code>awk</code></h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use <code>awk</code> to process the log files. It&rsquo;s a very old programming language.</p>

<p>Every line is split into words based on spaces. Each word is numbered and available as a variable starting with the dollar sign and its number. Therefore, when processing the <code>access.log</code> file using the format shown above, the number variables contain the following:</p>

<pre><code> $1  social.alexschroeder.ch:443
 $2  37.27.248.47
 $3  -
 $4  -
 $5  [21/Aug/2025:00:59:49
 $6  +0200]
 $7  &quot;POST
 $8  /users/alex/inbox
 $9  HTTP/1.1&quot;
$10  202
$11  4207
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll note that those square brackets and double quotes are sometimes very annoying. 🤨</p>

<p>A block is enclosed in braces <code>{ like this }</code> and is executed for every line. You don&rsquo;t need to declare variables before assigning to them. An element of a an associative array (a hash map in Perl or Java, a Dictionary in Python) is accessed using square brackets <code>like[this]</code>.</p>

<p>A block after <code>END</code> is executed just once, at the end of the input.</p>

<h2 id="counting-the-hits-per-ip-number">Counting the hits per IP number</h2>

<p>We use an associative array where the key is the IP address of the visitor and the value is the number of hits. At the end, we print the number hits, a tab, and the IP address, for every address. The <code>++</code> operator increments the operand by one. <code>$2</code> is the IP address, and <code>hits</code> is the associative array.</p>

<p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines by their hits, putting more hits at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>

<pre><code>awk '{hits[$2]++} END {for (ip in hits) printf &quot;%d\t%s\n&quot;, hits[ip], ip}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20

<p>In order to sum the bandwidth used, we need to sum the bytes send per IP number.
The <code>awk</code> script here does that and prints the number of MB (1000000 bytes) per IP number.</p>

<p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines by their hits, putting more volume at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>

<pre><code>awk '{vol[$2] += $11} END {for (ip in vol) printf &quot;%dM\t%s\n&quot;, vol[ip]/1E6, ip}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ranking-the-requests-by-popularity">Ranking the requests by popularity</h2>

<p>In order to rank the requests we need to print the requests and count them, then sort them.
The <code>awk</code> script just prints the request itself; <code>sort</code> sorts the lines and <code>uniq -c</code> counts the unique lines (it requires a sorted input)</p>

<p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines, putting more hits at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>

<pre><code>awk '{print $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort \
| uniq --count \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes it can be interesting to note what sort requests are not OK (Status 200). Instead of starting with the whole access log, we only print requests if the status is not 200.
This uses a new feature of <code>awk</code> that we haven&rsquo;t used before. You can have conditions before the block.</p>

<pre><code>awk '$10 != 200 {print $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort \
| uniq --count \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in the status itself:</p>

<pre><code>awk '$10 != 200 {print $10, $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort \
| uniq --count \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you&rsquo;re interested only in errors for one particular virtual host:</p>

<pre><code>awk '$1 == &quot;alexschroeder.ch:443&quot; &amp;&amp; $10 &gt;= 400 {print $10, $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort \
| uniq --count \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

      <p>
      What I like best about Keith Teare&#8216;s latest essay, Who Owns The Front Door to AI? If it isn&#8217;t you, its game over, is that it sounds like he&#8217;s setting up the case for personal AI. But he&#8217;s not. He&#8217;s describing how our AI-assisted lives will get sucked through better interfaces deep into one or more [&#8230;]

      <h1>2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>

(date: 2025-08-23, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-xobaque">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-15-an-opt-in-search-engine-xobaque">2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing a search engine that doesn&rsquo;t crawl the web.
I called it <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/xobaque.git/">Xobaque</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2025-08-22">2025-08-22</a> I set it up to <a href="https://search.emacslife.com/">search Planet Emacslife</a>.</p>

<p>Xobaque is entirely opt-in and push based: web admins have total control over what they want to have indexed. The drawback is that web admins have to upload their pages!</p>

<p>I foresee this to be a solution for sites that don&rsquo;t have good local search, like <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a>, or communities, like all the blogs on <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>. If we want to rely less on big search engines, we have to provide our own.</p>

<p>Technically, Xobaque is writen on top of the <a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html#sorting_by_auxiliary_function_results">SQLite FTS5 Extension</a>. This extension does all the heavy lifting: indexing, searching, ranking, highlighting, snippets, boolean operators. Boolean operators! Do you remember those? Good times. The extension is quite amazing, really.</p>

<p>What Xobaque provides is the command-line interface and the web interface. Right now, the command-line interface has a command to initialize an empty database and a command to upload a single page.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of how to use this in a script.</p>

<p>My homepage:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
cd /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki
for line in (/home/oddmu/oddmu list)
  set --local info (string split &quot;	&quot; $line)
  set --local name (string replace --regex '^/home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/' '' $info[1] | string replace --regex '.md' '')
  set --local title $info[2]
  /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
    -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
    -base &quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/&quot; \
    -local &quot;$name&quot; \
    -title &quot;$title&quot; \
    -filename &quot;$name.md&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>Emacs Wiki:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for path in (grep --files-without-match '^#FILE ' /home/alex/emacswiki/git/* /home/alex/emacswiki/git/.*)
  set --local name (string replace '/home/alex/emacswiki/git/' '' $path)
  set --local title (string replace '_' ' ' $name)
  /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
    -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
    -base &quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/&quot; \
    -local &quot;$name&quot; \
    -title &quot;$title&quot; \
    -filename &quot;/home/alex/emacswiki/git/$name&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>The alternative to uploading via the command-line, I think, will be feed ingestion. Web site owners can send their feeds to Xobaque and it will index the entries in the feed. If the entries have the full text, that&rsquo;s great. If they have an excerpt, that works, too. You opt-in with whatever you provide.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that this will be a system for friends only, so the upload will be protected by a login. Otherwise, people will be able to upload other people&rsquo;s sites and that violates the opt-in idea.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Xobaque">#Xobaque</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-08-15</strong>. I have that vague idea that it would process OPML files like the <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/opml.xml">Planet Emacslife OPML</a> or the three RPG Planet OPML files, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/indie.opml">Indie</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/osr.opml">OSR</a> and <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/other.opml">Other</a>. From the OPML files Xobaque would know a bunch of feeds which it could then use for updates. I have written <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/planet-jupiter.git/">Planet Jupiter</a>, so I know that from 80% to 90% is handling blogs that are down and from 90% to 100% it&rsquo;s all about fiddling with the markup… There&rsquo;s also the question of consent. So perhaps one would have to start a new list of feeds for those people who explicitly consent. And if by chance that covers all the feeds on Planet Emacslife or RPG Planet that&rsquo;d be a reason to laugh and party! 🎉</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-17</strong>. Adding feeds and collections of feeds (via OPML files) works, now. 🎉</p>

<p>The feed import from the net should use ETags and If-Modified-Since headers if possible, but the convenience functions of bot the feed and the OPML library don’t provide this, so I’ll have to roll my own. And then think of parallelising the requests. Go channels ahoy! 😬</p>

<p>And then a web UI for uploads and accounts? 🥺</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-19</strong>. Xobaque now knows how to skip feeds that haven’t updated using <code>If-Modified-Since</code> and <code>If-None-Match</code> headers.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-19</strong>. The errors I&rsquo;m finding in the feeds of Planet Emacslife OPML:</p>

<pre><code>Error importing feed https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss: XML syntax error on line 1: illegal character code U+FFFF
Error importing feed https://blog.laurentcharignon.com/index.xml: XML syntax error on line 231: illegal character code U+0008

</code></pre>

<p>But I guess I have 248/253 feeds imported.</p>

<p>Other issues I have noticed: Endless repeats of news items that overwrite each other, only differing in title and description, and no GUID set:</p>

<pre><code> Update http://tromey.com/elpa/news.html
</code></pre>

<p>Then again, the items all have dates set from 2007 to 2010, so perhaps that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p>And now I find:</p>

<pre><code># ./xobaque search alex schroeder
Emacs: Take Two
https://takeonrules.com/2025/06/10/emacs-take-two/emacs-take-two
extend &lt;span&gt;Emacs&lt;/span&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, learning of Alex Schroeder, both involved in &lt;abbr title=&quot;Role Playing Games&quot;&gt;RPGs
</code></pre>

<p>It works! And I really need to strip HTML, here! 😂</p>

      <p>
      I picked up my Android phone to record a voice memo. I had to dismiss a dialog that said the phone had updated overnight and asked if I wanted to see a list of changes. I thought, clicked No because I had an idea I wanted to record. Opened the voice app, hit record, couldn't remember the idea. Wanted to kill the message, but the UI had changed, so the Delete button that was there before wasn't there now. Great so now I have a 4-second recording in the queue that's nothing but frustration. There ought to be some basic rules of how software evolves. You can't take away a very basic function like this. And find a way not to get in the way of the user getting done what they use your product for. One of the most basic things is recording an idea. If you're lucky enough to be the app the user uses for that, don't screw with it. Same for listening to podcasts, and a few other things. That's about all I do with my phone.

      In these last days of August, with Congress on hiatus and the Epstein files looming, the Trump White House appears to be making a big move to consolidate power over the federal government, weaponize it against Trump&#8217;s opponents, and keep him in power indefinitely.

      I&#8217;m intrigued by the idea of collaborative blogging, but having tried two- and three-person (art) blogs back in the day, I think talking through goals, expectations, and vision upfront is key. The group blogs I was in fell apart because people got too busy to post so rotating / turns-based posting wasn&#8217;t working, and people [&#8230;]

<p>In this episode I talk about gargoyles. Monsters who are cold and disinterested but absolutely insist on peace and quiet. Perfect centrists, so to speak. Also half devils with their bat wings and stone skin, and thinking themselves to be perfect because they don&rsquo;t have any wants. And also nothing to do but stare down on us. Brrr!</p>

(date: 2025-08-22, from: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/truenas-on-arm-finally-thing">Jeff Geerling blog</a>)
      <p>
      <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">TrueNAS on Arm is finally a thing</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>Even for storage.</p></div>

      <p>This academic year, I am taking a sabbatical from the Kennedy School and Harvard University. (It&#8217;s not a real sabbatical&#8212;I&#8217;m just an adjunct&#8212;but it&#8217;s the same idea.) I will be spending the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 semesters at the <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/">Munk School</a> at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>I will be organizing a reading group on AI security in the fall. I will be teaching my cybersecurity policy class in the Spring. I will be working with <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/">Citizen Lab</a>, the <a href="https://www.law.utoronto.ca/">Law School</a>, and the <a href="https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/">Schwartz Reisman Institute</a>.

      Among the many things that boomers did, for better or worse, is be a generation. Prior to that, the concept appears not to exist -- they had ages and eras. The gilded age, the roaring twenties. It wasn't about the people, it's about what was hot. If you look at it that way, there were lots of things the boomers were. We were anti-war. We turned on, tuned in and dropped out. Free sex and drugs. Rock and roll. And then we got to work. The PC era, the dotcom boom, social media. 2008, billionaires in DC, etc. Some realllly awful people are/were boomers. But we're still here to write our epitaph. The leading edge is dying at a fast clip now. It won't be long before the idea of a boomer is the stuff of legend. I really hope that Robert Reich's bullshit view of this doesn't be the conventional wisdom. Oh they were fucked up and did all this bad shit to us. Fuck you. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210838-if-you-don-t-like-the-news-go-out-and-make">Make your own world</a>. That would be a boomer thing too, btw. The world we got, btw, was totally fucked. Someday I'll tell you that story. ;-)

There was no way it had anything to do with who each of us were or what we would become. All this is in response to the idiotic idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reich">little dude</a> who just wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROBERT-B-REICH-Americas-Economic/dp/B0FMD7876H/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3MQJJTEFB8PSZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g4ibja9uP1kYYBF13ImLxx8MrFyKHvaA93LcJoYIT7xNW6RN-z_DzNHG864S0EKhXt5HmX2gFZ21sUs0BOln_ubIAOz0oYcY4A0SuNo4sgIJHvRMyhjRvD7d6HXpVHHFsmcxEA17eVNjTkQYg7ocLP67CQAzzQgpiFX7AZj9f_4-XSBjmmEStej9FdNNofvuTS2zGUWwdMsSNYK4-EM1DgoLk9zGsxUImXuB17EzyHM.iOUwwGt2pQ_ndfxmAXm1yyJnXSrSIgwoHpY-3Cum40U&dib_tag=se&keywords=coming+up+short&qid=1755875758&sprefix=coming+up+short%2Caps%2C122&sr=8-2">book</a>, nine years older than me, what a putz. He apologizes for boomers, feeding the bullshit idea that somehow we are a unitary thing. A lot of boomers voted for Trump. The boomers I come from liked the Grateful Dead and yes I know some deadheads voted for Trump, so there you go, more evidence that it's all bullshit. The thing we had in common is that we were children at roughly the same times, but even that's bullshit, a 20-year old boomer in 1965 could be the <i>parent</i> of a boomer, literally a different generation, fwiw.

      ChatGPT is becoming more and more of an enemy. It's still my go-to place for most planning and research, which is a very large part of how I use the web. But when it tries to be a human it's a really shitty one, no manners, and very little respect and basically a fucking idiot in many ways, imho ymmv.

Remember, this is the feed-o-verse, it's all feeds, top to bottom. Posts in some feeds can be edited. :-)

      <h1>Limiting YouTube to a Single Tab</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22, from: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/08/limiting-youtube-to-a-single-tab/">Dave Rupert blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>This week I decided to go nuclear on my bad YouTube habit. I installed a plugin called <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-limiter/ahifadmfdpgnjkchbmoafedinacdfomc">Tab Limiter</a> that lets me limit <code>youtube.com</code> to one tab at a time. Clicking links that open in new tabs will now auto-close the tab.</p>
<p>Why do this? I talked about it before but <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/06/productivity-traps/">when I’m bored I open tabs</a>. Adding friction here prevents me from CMD+clicking videos during moments of boredom and creating a month’s-worth unclose-able tabs of videos to watch. It encourages me to stay focused and nudges me towards YouTube’s lossy<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> “Add to queue” feature to queue up one video at a time in a single tab. I sort of prefer this way of using YouTube and it makes it feel a lot more like a native app.</p>
<p>That inspired me to install the YouTube Progressive Web App and because the PWA is basically a dedicated tab, Tab Limiter keeps me from opening other videos in new tabs. I’m now funneled into the application.</p>
<p>Opening a dropdown and clicking “Add to queue” is adding more “good friction” to the process. It also comes with a counter. 20 tabs open, no big deal, I’m immune to that effect. 20 items in a queue. Yeesh. That’s a todo list.</p>
<browser-window shadow>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/tablimiter.jpg" width="1200" height="800" alt="Screenshot of the tablimiter UI, it has unstyled for fields for URL and a tab limit quantity">
</browser-window>
<p>Tab Limiter has a brutalist UI and that’s what makes it perfect. It’s also open sourced on GitHub which is important to me so I can make sure it’s not sending my browsing history to China. And I can fork it. One improvement I’m considering is to add the closed video’s ID to the YouTube queue before closing the tab. It seems easy enough, but probably not as easy as I’m hoping. The core idea there is that it might be helpful if I come across an urgent watch-now link or someone sends me a link.</p>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/raycast-focus/">I’m also still using Raycast Focus</a> which is a great way to blockout time and stop distractions at the source.</p>

      Tariffs and mass deportations are both stagflationary: They increase inflation while depressing growth.

      This is the U-1206. It was the peak of submarine technology at the end of the Second World War. Right now it lies at 70 metres depth slightly North West of England. You might say this is an impressive feat for a submarine to be submerged that long. Alas, it is isn&#8217;t by design but [&#8230;]

      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-21-initramfs">2025-08-21 Initramfs</h1>

<p>I just had a little system administration nightmare. It all started yesterday when I decided that I wasn&rsquo;t going to move the MNT Pocket Reform to Debian stable (Trixie) after all. I had changed the apt sources a while ago, pointing them at Trixie and yesterday I had them point back at unstable.</p>

<p>This is what I had:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources
# Modernized from /etc/apt/sources.list
Types: deb
URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian/
Suites: unstable
Components: main contrib non-free
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
</code></pre>

<p>And of course:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mntre.sources 
Types: deb
URIs: https://mntre.com/reform-debian-repo
Suites: reform
Components: main
Architectures: arm64
Trusted: yes
</code></pre>

<p>Then I did and <code>sudo apt update</code> and somewhere after that my problems started.
There was a critical bug in <code>systemd</code> so held it using <code>sudo apt-mark hold systemd</code>.
I tried <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> and I guess something didn&rsquo;t work (something about Linux kernels?) and there was something about uninstalling <code>udev</code>. The history shows I did <code>sudo apt install udev</code> to recover and that there was a <code>systemd</code> circular dependency because I did <code>sudo apt-mark unhold systemd</code>, then <code>sudo apt --fix-broken install</code> and <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code>.</p>

<p>All good? Maybe not.</p>

<p>Today I tried to boot and got dropped into <code>busybox</code> on the <code>initramfs</code>. It said it couldn&rsquo;t determine the type of the root device. And indeed, <code>ls /root</code> showed nothing.</p>

<p>After a lot of struggling, I finally determined that I had to mount one of the devices from <code>/dev</code> as <code>/root</code>. After some trial and error I found that the magical incantation was <code>mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk2p2 /root</code>.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>What appeared to help is <code>chroot /root</code> to switch to the new system. I got a real shell! I&rsquo;m a bit unclear on the details. But now I think I ran <code>update-initramfs -u</code> and then did <code>exit</code> twice. And booted successfully!</p>

<p>What a nightmare.</p>

<p>The first thing is to write this up, then to update the system and then to reboot. Let&rsquo;s see how this ends. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>And … it&rsquo;s still broken in the same way. I can get it to boot but something is still very wrong.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it seems that installing <code>reform-desktop-minimal</code> fixed it. It looked like I got a new kernel? I have no idea. (<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/initramfs-problem-solved/3724/3">More info on the community forum</a>.)</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-08-21</strong>. Josch noted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You only mounted your root file system but you did not mount <code>/boot</code> into it. So the initramfs you created here will be stored in the <code>/boot</code> directory of your root file system but it will not be stored in the filesystem which then gets mounted as <code>/boot</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes sense!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why update-initramfs after I had booted didn&rsquo;t work, though. Perhaps I still needed the correct kernel for all of this to work? I have no idea and no way to investigate.</p>

      When we were contemplating a Nazi takeover of the US govt did any of us consider that they would use the money of the federal government as a lever to get conformance from local governments and NGOs like Columbia and Harvard universities? I sure didn't and I never heard any of the pundits say it.

<p>Marion and I have <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-sovereign-individual-and-the-paradox-of-the-digital-age">an essay in Aeon</a> today:</p>



<blockquote>
    <p>What is happening here is more than an abstract flow of information. It is more than a means of surveillance. It is more than a price mechanism. Rather, it’s as if the air traffic control and insurance commission functions of the IBM 650 have been fused, shrunk, and wholly generalised. This is the real computing revolution. Much of what we do is immediately authenticated as we do it, stored as data, classified or scored on some sort of scale, and deployed in real time to modulate some outcome of interest – usually, the behaviour of a person, or a machine, or an organisation. &hellip; Because of this transformation, our sense of who we are is assembled in a strange and tangled fashion. The machinery of ordinalisation attends carefully to individuals rather than coarse classes or groups. By doing so, it appears to liberate people from the constraints of social affiliations and to judge them for their distinctive qualities and contributions. It promises incorporation for the excluded, recognition for the creative, and just rewards for the entrepreneurial. And yet this emancipatory promise is delivered through systems that classify, sort and, above all, rank people with ever-greater precision and on a previously unimaginable scale. The resulting social order is a sort of paradox, characterised by constant tensions between personal freedom and social control, between the subjective elan of inner authenticity and the objective forces of external authentication. It gives rise to a certain way of being, a new kind of self, whose experiences are defined by the push for personal autonomy and the pull of platform dependency.</p>

<blockquote><p>The auction, which will include other items related to cryptology, will be held Nov. 20. RR Auction, the company arranging the sale, estimates a winning bid between $300,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>Along with the original handwritten plain text of K4 and other papers related to the coding, Mr. Sanborn will also be providing a 12-by-18-inch copper plate that has three lines of alphabetic characters cut through with a jigsaw, which he calls &#8220;my proof-of-concept piece&#8221; and which he kept on a table for inspiration during the two years he and helpers hand-cut the letters for the project. The process was grueling, exacting and nerve wracking. &#8220;You could not make any mistake with 1,800 letters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could not be repaired.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

      <p>The five things that were necessary before you could have podcasting: </p>

<ol>
<li>Blogging. </li>
<li>HTTP. </li>
<li>RSS. </li>
<li>MP3. </li>
<li>iPod.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's pretty simple, but this confluence eludes most tech people and journalists.</p>

      <h1>What podcasting is</h1>

(date: 2025-08-20, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html?title=whatPodcastingIs">Dave Winer's Scripting News</a>)
      <p>
      <p><i>Note: Posted on Facebook eleven years ago. Still relevant today.</i></p>
<p>You couldn't have had podcasting without a lot of things coming together. They all had to be there.</p>
<ol>
<li>Networks of writers who shared links. Blogging.</li>
<li>A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.</li>
<li>Something to attach links and recordings to. RSS.</li>
<li>A standard format for recording. MP3.</li>
<li>Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, none of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. </p>
<p>Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.</p>
<p>Postscript: The EFF filed suit against the patent troll, but didn't listen to what I said here, which is really fucked up because they didn't create podcasting, I did. There's a tremendous lack of respect for generosity in tech, yet without generosity there's no interop, only silos. Either you made billions from something, or you don't exist. That's why I stopped supporting EFF long ago, even though I gave them what was to me a significant amount of money when they started up, and why they get involved in so many wrong-headed ideas.  They don't respect tech, they respect money.</p>

      My mother would have been 93 years old today. She died in 2018, seven years ago. As time goes by, I feel her importance in my life more and more. I find I didn't have a realistic perspective in the living years. But more than any other person in my life, she shaped me -- for better or worse, but mostly better.

<blockquote><p>AIOps refers to the use of LLM-based agents to gather and analyze application telemetry, including system logs, performance metrics, traces, and alerts, to detect problems and then suggest or carry out corrective actions. The likes of <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/10/cisco_live_cloud_control_news/">Cisco</a> have deployed AIops in a conversational interface that admins can use to prompt for information about system performance. Some AIOps tools can respond to such queries by automatically implementing fixes, or suggesting scripts that can address issues...</p></blockquote>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I forgot to bring my portable Pi media server running Jellyfin on a family trip, but had a small selection of my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-i-rip-dvds-and-blu-rays-my-mac-2022-edition">ripped movie and TV show library</a> on my portable SSD.</p>

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

      <h1>Consistent Navigation Across My Inconsistent Websites, Part II</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/consistent-nav-across-inconsistent-sites-pt-ii/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>I refreshed the little thing that let’s you <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/consistent-nav-across-inconsistent-sites/" >navigate consistently between my inconsistent subdomains</a> (<a href="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-video.mp4" >video recording</a>).</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-animation.gif" width="305" height="245" alt="Animated gif of a dynamic-island like control that expands smoothly up when clicked to reveal additional selection options." />

</p><p>Here’s the tl;dr on the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had to remove some features on each site to make this feel right.<ul>
<li>Takeaway: adding stuff is easy, removing stuff is hard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The element is a web component and not even under source control (🤫). I serve it directly from <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/netlify-public-folder-part-i-what/" >my cdn</a>. If I want to make an update, I tweak the file on disk and <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/deploying-with-netlify-shortcuts/" >re-deploy</a>.<ul>
<li>Takeaway: cowboy codin’, yee-haw! Live free and die hard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So. Many. Iterations. All of which led to what? A small, iterative evolution. <ul>
<li>Takeaway: it’s ok for design explorations to culminate in updates that look more like an evolution than a mutation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Want more info on the behind-the-scenes work? Read on!</p>
<h2 id="design-explorations">Design Explorations</h2>
<p>It might look like a simple iteration on what I previously had, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t explore the universe of possibilities first before coming back to the current iteration.</p>

</p><h3 id="v0-tabs">v0: Tabs!</h3>
<p>A tab-like experience seemed the most natural, but how to represent it? I tried a few different ideas. On top. On bottom. Different visual styles, etc.</p>

</p><p>And of course, gotta explore how that plays out on desktop too.</p>

</p><p>Some I liked, some I didn’t. As much as I wanted to play with going to the edges of the viewport, I realized that every browser is different and you won&#39;t be able to get a consistent “bleed-like” visual experience across browsers. For example, if you try to make tabs that bleed to the edges, it looks nice in a frame in Figma, and even in some browsers. But it won’t look right in all browser, like iOS Safari.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v0-tabs.png" width="1348" height="550" alt="Mobile UI mockups showing a folder-style segmented tab control. One is in the frame of an iPhone where the control bleeds up into the restricted space where the dynamic island lives as well as down into the website. Whereas the other mockup is in a frame in Figma, so the highlighted tab only bleeds down into the website." />

</p><p>So I couldn’t reliably leverage the idea of a bounded canvas as a design element — which, I should’ve known, has always been the case with the web.</p>
<h3 id="v1-bottom-tabs-with-a-site-theme">v1: Bottom Tabs With a Site Theme</h3>
<p>I really like this pattern on mobile devices, so I thought maybe I’d consider it for navigating between my sites.</p>
<p>But how to theme across differently-styled sites? The favicon styles seemed like a good bet!</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v1.png" width="939" height="682" alt="Mobile-sized mocksups with a bottom tab bar whose active highlight color changes with the active color of each subdomain." />

</p><p>And, of course, what do to on larger devices? Just stacking it felt like overkill, so I explored moving it to the edge.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v1-desktop.png" width="1591" height="758" alt="Desktop-sized mocks with tab controls on the far left of the page and the active site is higlighted according to the site's active theme color." />

</p><p>I actually prototyped this in code, but I didn’t like how it felt so I scratched the idea and went other directions.</p>
<h2 id="v2-the-unification">v2: The Unification</h2>
<p>The more I explored what to do with this element, the more it started taking on additional responsibility.</p>
<p>“What if I unified its position <em>with</em> site-specific navigation?” I thought.</p>
<p>This led to design explorations where the disparate subdomains began to take on not just a unified navigational element, but a unified header.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-1.png" width="899" height="645" alt="Mobile-sized UI mocks for Home, Blog, and Notes on jim-nielsen.com" />

</p><p>And I made small, stylistic explorations with the tabs themselves too.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-2.png" width="885" height="645" alt="Mobile-sized UI mocks for Home, Blog, and Notes on jim-nielsen.com" />

</p><p>You can see how I played toyed with the idea of a consistent header across all my sites (not an intended goal, but ya know, scope creep gets us all).</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-3.png" width="594" height="398" alt="Different header + navigation styles for submdomains on jim-nielsen.com including a hamburger button." />

</p><p>As I began to explore more possibilities than I planned for, things started to get out of hand.</p>
<h2 id="v3-do-more-more-more">v3: Do More. MORE. MORE!!</h2>
<p>Questions I began asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why aren’t these all under the same domain?!</li>
<li>What if I had a single domain for feeds across all of them, e.g. <code>feeds.jim-nielsen.com</code>?</li>
<li>What about icons instead of words?</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v3.png" width="1184" height="659" alt="Four mobile-sized mockups for subdomains on jim-nielsen.com, each one getting a different highlight color." />

</p><p>Wait, wait, wait Jim. Consistent navigation across inconsistent sites. That’s the goal. Pare it back a little.</p>
<h2 id="v4-reigning-it-back-in">v4: Reigning It Back In</h2>
<p>To counter my exploratory ambitions, I told myself I needed to ship something without the need to modify the entire design style of all my sites.</p>
<p>So how do I do that?</p>
<p>That got me back to a simpler premise: consistent navigation across my inconsistent sites.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v4.png" width="1070" height="768" alt="Dynamic-island-like navigational pill for the subdomains on www, blog, and notes subdomains of jim-nielsen.com" />

</p><p>Better — and implementable.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>The implementation was pretty simple. I basically just forked my previous web component and changed some styles. That’s it.</p>
<p>The only thing I did different was I moved the web component JS file from being part of my <code>www.jim-nielsen.com</code> git repository to a standalone file (not under git control) on my CDN.</p>
<p>This felt like one of the exceptions to the rule of always keeping stuff under version control. It’s more of the classic FTP-style approach to web development. Granted, it’s riskier, but it’s also way more flexible. And I’m good with that trade-off for now. (Ask me again in a few months if I’ve done anything terrible and now have regrets.)</p>
<p>Each site implements the component like this (with a different <code>subdomain</code> attribute for each site):</p>
<pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;module&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/shared/jim-site-switcher.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">jim-site-switcher</span> <span class="hljs-attr">subdomain</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;blog&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">jim-site-switcher</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That’s really all there is to say. Thanks to Zach for <a href="https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/114942811780696272" >prodding me to make this post</a>.</p>

      <h1>Classifiers and cosmotechnics</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/08/classifiers-and-cosmotechnics/">Dave Rupert blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>I’ve been playing around with Midjourney for work and the one thing that makes Stable Diffusion cool and useful to me is the <code>--sref</code> flag to summon results in a specific visual style or “style reference” (e.g. <a href="https://midlibrary.io/styles/83450e8">Celestial Swirlscape</a> is <code>--sref 2566192150</code>). They differ a bit from traditional or “artist” styles (e.g. “In the style of Picasso” or “Rip off Studio Ghibli”) but can be that or they can be more generic or compositional like “<a href="https://midlibrary.io/styles/78ed0e">Pink Retronetic Dreamscape</a>”. I’ve read <a href="https://midlibrary.io/midguide/deep-dive-into-midjourney-sref-codes">a deep-dive on SREF codes</a> and it’s still a bit unclear how they work to me. They’re like a hybrid between prompt shorthand and style classification. Curated and collected by humans, but a code generated by machines. I have to imagine there’s some clumped circles on a node graph chart somewhere that determine this… but I don’t know those answers.</p>
<p>The idea of a classifier (human assisted or otherwise) that can suck up and analyze all the art on the internet and end up with a 10-digit number that represents nearly any visual style of imagery I’ve ever seen is mind-bending. Not to mention the ability to overlay that style reference on any image I want in under a minute. “Anime waifu. <code>--sref 3196580341</code>” is the “Tea. Earl gray. Hot” of digital imagery. It feels unreal.</p>
<p>Could we apply a universal classifier to blog posts so that your “longread about cool bugs” and my “longread about cool bugs” have the same <code>--sref</code> tag? And then we retro-actively apply human-readable tag names to this stylistic tag? And then could I subscribe to a feed of those specific types of posts? That might be interesting… or radicalizing.</p>
<p>Design tokens? Could those be a system of classifiers instead of arbitrary language? Probably not. But why not? Web design almost certainly could, if it isn’t already.</p>
<p>While the idea of classifiers tickles the logical computer part of my brain, reducing the entirety of the visual arts down to a set of ten billion categories offends the artist part of my brain. It is odious. There’s an observer effect to it whereby in the act of classifying the art you’ve limited and altered your ability to understand it. And any mimicked generation has an imposter-like, soul-less character to it, no matter the quality. I can’t explain that. Even though I’ve seen the machine generate incredible art beyond anything I’m capable of, I still feel that intangible void on my retinas when I interact with it.</p>
<p>My wife and I were joking about how the algorithm is serving us videos about certain personality quirks that map to (possibly made-up) niche disorders. My wife –who can remember the melody to every guitar solo but can’t remember the words of the songs from her own band– has a diagnosis from Dr. TikTok that she has “polyphonic perception”. My personality quirks all point to my particular flavor of ADHD. How long until our entire personalities are all tied to a collection of niche diagnoses? How long until our brains are all classified by a ten-digit number? That could be incredibly useful for getting help but brings up nature versus nurture questions for me. Did God make me this way or did I dent the packaging?  Can people with <code>--brainSpiceRef 2566192150</code> even apply for this job? How long until the machines build these types of preferences? Myers-Briggs but instead of made by a racist, it’s made by MechaHitler.</p>
<p>When I think about the future I want, it always comes down to one idea: I want <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZvpIE5g5Fo">a pod-like chamber I can walk into</a> that scans my entire body, makes bleep-bloop noises to show that it’s working, and prints out a receipt with a list of all my ailments (cancers, deformities, disorders, and otherwise) and recommends a diet and exercise plan until my next scheduled visit to the pod. Bonus points if it orders groceries accordingly after my entire family has exited the chamber. I’m aware this has “Big Theranos Energy” and is an incredible surface area for conspiracy theories… but it’s the science fiction future I want. Classifiers seem inevitable on that pathway. But how do we preserve our humanity when reducing the human race –who we are and what we create– down to a series of ten-digit codes?</p>

      I had an idea that <a href="https://globalvoices.org/">Global Voices</a>, at least in concept, could help us prepare in the US for what's coming. I wrote: I'd love to have is an <b>idea-sharing network</b> where i could drop this idea in a box named "helping the US stay free" and have it find it's way to the right people in Ukraine who are saying "if only I could talk to people in the US trying to figure this out, we know so much about this!" That's the thing. How to connect know-how with the place that needs to know. To make our resistance more effective use the lessons learned in Ukraine over the last decades.

      The purpose of the National Guard occupation of American cities is to control who votes. It doesn’t take much disruption to turn a blue district red. They just allocated <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/big-beautiful-bill-immigration-border-security/">$170 billion</a> to fund ICE. They don't need all that money for border enforcement. It's meant to fund the transformation of the US into a Russian-style oligarchy. That's fear-inducing, but Ukraine has been fighting against becoming a  Russian-style oligarchy for decades, with ups and downs, but so far, considerable success.

The fields in the table are as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Month</i>: The date marked on the media in Sharpie, and verified via the on-disk metadata.</li>
<li><i>Media</i>: The type of media.</li>
<li><i>Good</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which all MD5 checksums were correctly verified.</li>
<li><i>Bad</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which any file failed MD5 verification.</li>
<li><i>Vendor</i>: the vendor name on the media</li>
</ul>
The drives I use from ASUS and LG report read errors from the CDs and older DVDs but verify the MD5s correctly.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and consumer drives, I'm getting good data from CD-Rs more than 21 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 19 years old. Your mileage may 
vary. Tune in again next year for another episode.<br />
<br />Previously I found a <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/08/optical-media-durability-update.html?showComment=1632161672704#c889599305877938325">NetBSD1.2 CD</a> dating from October 1996. Each directory has checksums generated by <tt>cksum(1)</tt>, all but one of which verified correctly despite a few read errors. So some of the data on that CD is bad after nearly 29 years.<br />

      <h1>Zero-Day Exploit in WinRAR File</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, updated: 2025-08-14, from: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/08/zero-day-exploit-in-winrar-file.html">Bruce Schneier blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>A zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/high-severity-winrar-0-day-exploited-for-weeks-by-2-groups/">being exploited</a> by at least two Russian criminal groups:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vulnerability seemed to have super Windows powers. It abused <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/c54dec26-1551-4d3a-a0ea-4fa40f848eb3">alternate data streams</a>, a Windows feature that allows different ways of representing the same file path. The exploit abused that feature to trigger a previously unknown path traversal flaw that caused WinRAR to plant malicious executables in attacker-chosen file paths %TEMP% and %LOCALAPPDATA%, which Windows normally makes off-limits because of their ability to execute code.</p></blockquote>

  <p>If I were to photocopy this article, nobody would argue that my photocopier wrote it and therefore can think. But add enough convolutedness to the process, and it looks a lot like maybe it did and can.</p>
  
  <p>In reality, all we’ve created is a bot which is almost perfect at mimicking human-like natural language use, and the rest is people just projecting other human qualities on to it. Quite simply, “LLMs are doing reasoning” is the “look, my dog is smiling” of technology. In exactly the same way that dogs don’t convey their emotions via human-like facial expressions, there’s no reason to believe that even if computer could think, it’d perfectly mirror what looks like human reasoning.</p>

      I want to switch cell providers, so I used ChatGPT to figure out that Consumer Cellular is the best choice for me. I finally get around to filling in the form, and it complains about my zip code. "No service." Yes I know, there's no cell coverage where I live. I still need a freaking cell phone. Called them, the sales person says maybe it's a problem with your computer. Geez Louise. It's a problem with <i>your</i> computer. How many years have they had to fix this stupid bug. I could see if I was buying a landline. But this is a <i>mobile</i> device. That means it moves. To places with cell coverage.

      What if you made a social network out of RSS? Then your blogroll would be the list of people you follow. Their updates would show up in a reverse chronologic list of posts that would look like something from <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinesnapshot.png">Bluesky</a> or <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinetwitter.png">Twitter</a>. You could view a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timeline.png">list</a> of the people you follow, and expand each person to see their most recent five posts, summarized, with a link to each to read the whole thing. Since there are no limits to the length of a post in RSS there would be no limit to the length of one of these posts, but of course you wouldn't show all the text in the timeline without the reader clicking on something.

It's hard to watch at times, because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes">main character</a> of the show, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is such a horrible person. She lies to everyone about everything, but she's cute and the VCs like her, so they pump hundreds of millions of dollars into her startup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos">Theranos</a>, which was a real company, and made a product that never worked, but she doesn't get around to telling anyone that, including the board of directors, until long after it's too late. I haven't reached the end yet, but I know how it ends, because it's based on a true story. She ends up in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Camp,_Bryan">prison</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> is in, in Texas. The only reason I mention it is that in my tenure in Silicon Valley, about 30 years worth, I saw everything she did, done by other entrepreneurs and VCs, in real life. Only now, in the second Trump administration, its craptitude is maxed out far beyond anything I saw personally. They're selling the biggest lie yet, that they've invented machines that think. This is not true, and it's so big a lie, its too-big-to-fail quotient is far higher than anything we've seen before. ChatGPT should stop pretending to be human because that will destroy real humans who believe it. But the euphoria is so great, they're probably going to continue to insist it is capable of thought, and that leads to something far worse than Theranos, or any of the other billion-dollar scams they have foisted on us previously.
