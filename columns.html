<p>Just added to my todo list – add the option to use the
<a href="https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi">WordPress REST
interface</a> in place of the
<a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wpcom.js">WPCOM interface</a>,
this will give <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> the
ability to edit WordPress sites anywhere, not just on wordpress.com.
When I made the choice to go with WPCOM I didn’t have ChatGPT to look at
the other options, I was surprised to find that WordPress actually had a
good JavaScript API. It doesn’t look like the conversion will be too
bad. It’s obviously better to be able to work with all WordPress
sites.</p>

<h2 id="intermittent-fasting">Intermittent fasting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<aside>
<p>
⚠️ Content warning: Weight loss, feel free to skip if that is not a good
topic for you.
</p>
</aside>
<p>
A doctor told me to look into intermittent fasting. Not for weight loss,
but for ADHD. There’s some
<a href="https://www.addrc.org/the-role-of-brain-insulin-in-adhd-emerging-evidence/">new
data that suggests a link between ADHD and insulin in the brain</a>.
Based on that science, intermittent fasting or a ketogenic diet –which
can help improve insulin resistance– might help my brain. I’m a week
into it and am seeing some weight loss, but it’s hard to tell with the
ADHD without measuring my brainflorps per second. I might be more
focused, but hunger and “hangry” bring their own distractions.
</p>
<p>
I’m skeptical, to say the least. Intermittent fasting makes frequent
appearances in my YouTube shorts with balding Joe Rogan clones dressed
in all black selling workout supplements. It has a whiff of being a
cure-all. To counter that skepticism, I read a book called
<a href="https://amzn.to/4fRPUMt"><em>Life in the Fasting Lane</em></a>
co-authored by Dr Jason Fung, who was specifically recommended to me.
It’s a mix of doctorly advice and testimonials from advocates who have
had success with fasting. As scientific as the book tries to be, it
undoes its own credibility pitching intermittent fasting with all the
hallmarks of a fad elimination diet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lose weight in 30 days
</li>
<li>
Reduce cravings
</li>
<li>
Live longer
</li>
<li>
Reverse diseases
</li>
<li>
Helps you focus at work
</li>
<li>
Improves your sex life
</li>
<li>
Big pharma doesn’t want you to know about this one weird trick!
</li>
<li>
Used by ancient civilizations. Ugh. The appeal to history (ancient,
therefore good!) is a major pet peeve of mine.
</li>
<li>
And my least favorite: It doesn’t cure cancer, but it cures obesity,
which causes all different kinds of cancer… so we’re not gonna say it
cures cancer because that’s a douchebag thing to say, but it <em>doesn’t
not</em> cure cancer if you catch our drift (wink).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I do appreciate that the book calls out “Calories-In/Calories-Out” as a
myth that works 1% of the time. But it’s hard to shake the feeling that
eliminating meals or days worth of food isn’t a macro-version of
calories-in/calories-out, where you measure calories in weeks instead of
per meal. I suppose the key difference is the duration between meals
allows my body to enter ketosis (read: a starving state) which will
consume my excess fat stores instead of my morning breakfast tacos
adding to those fat stores.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I’m a good candidate for this fad diet. I can sustain
myself on a couple meals a day. I could skip lunch most days. Skipping
breakfast though is hard. Not putting creamer in my morning coffee is
hard. Not having a little after dinner snack with the kids is hard. Not
eating is not my favorite, but I’m going to trust the process for a bit
and hopefully it’ll help a weary brain like mine.

<h2 id="burned">2024-12-09 Burned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-12-09-burned">
2024-12-09 Burned
</h1>
<p>
This page is about me burning myself on a Raclette table-grill.
</p>
<p>
I’m no longer quite sure of the timeline. I think I got the burn on
2024-12-03 or 2024-12-04.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-05</strong>: Two days ago I got myself a second degree
burn about one inch in diameter from our Raclette oven. I hadn’t burned
myself in about forty years, I think and I feel like a kid again,
observing the body as it reacts. The healing powers are so weird.
</p>
<p>
Also I’m thankful for these self-healing capabilities we have! And
thankful for this accident to be a curiosity instead of an emergency. A
good reminder to be thankful for all the good days we have and I hope
you’re having a good day! Live long and prosper. Or, as I usually tell
me wife: healthy, happy, and in love. Be well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-07</strong>: The skin around the burn had reddened and
had swollen a bit. I went to the pharmacy and got a disinfectant cream
and wound pads. This was Saturday afternoon and no more doctors were
available. Since this wasn’t an emergency, there’s was rush.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-09</strong>: The minor burn resulted in some sort of
low-key infection, so now it’s antibiotic to swallow and antibiotics to
apply.
</p>
<p>
Some things I’m learning from this experience:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I knew about cold, running water and left my arm under that cold tap for
many long minutes. Maybe not long enough? I don’t know. It felt ready to
fall off. 😆
</li>
<li>
The burn might look like a typical abrasion but you have to keep it
super clean. Best cover it with those special wound covers that don’t
stick to the wound (nothing we would have had at home so off to the
pharmacy you go, immediately, unlike me).
</li>
<li>
It might look dry and clean like blisters you got from a long hike but
the bedsheets or long sleeves or whatever will pass on germs and since
there is a piece of your exterior protection missing, you’ll get an
infection. The skin around the wound is a bit red, the area a bit
swollen, a bit warmer. And that already concerns the doctors.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria yesterday took
oxygen away from the airing of President-elect Trump’s interview with
Kristen Welker of NBC’S Meet the Press. The interview told us little
that we didn’t already know, but it did reinforce what we can expect in
the new administration.</p>

<h1 id="2024-12-09-ed-is-the-standard">
2024-12-09 ed is the standard
</h1>
<p>
<code>ed</code> is <a href="true-path">the standard editor</a>, they
say. I have strange fascination with it.
</p>
<p>
<code>ed</code> is a window in the past. This is a line-based editor,
not a screen-based editor. It can be used with a line-printer instead of
a screen. This also means that working with it is very different. I’ll
try to collect some interesting command sequences on this page.
</p>
<p>
I use <code>ed</code> to send mail from the command line. One way I do
this is by using <code>mail</code> on the server. It’s a line-oriented
mail client. You can use any editor with it, but the default feels very
close to <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
When I started reading newsgroups again, I used <code>tin</code> and
made it use <code>ed</code> as the editor.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, it’s growing on me. 😅
</p>
<p>
And I’m not alone! On fedi, I’m following
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@aartaka" title="@aartaka@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aartaka">@aartaka</span></a> who
occasionally posts things about <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
And so, in order to get better with it, I decided to write this page. I
expect to be adding to it.
</p>
<p>

commands available to you within <code>ed</code>.

motivated me to get into <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="create-a-new-file">
Create a new file
</h2>
<p>
Start <code>ed</code> without a file name. You’ll be editing “lines” in
a “buffer”.
</p>
<p>
The commands to use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>i</code> to insert a few lines
</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the insertion of lines
</li>
<li>
<code>w filename</code> writes the buffer to a file (and prints the
number of bytes written)
</li>
<li>
<code>q</code> quits the editor
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed
i
Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you.
.
w hello.txt
47
q
</code></pre>
<h2 id="edit-an-existing-file">
Edit an existing file
</h2>
<p>
When we provide ed with a filename, it is read into the buffer (and the
number of bytes read are printed). The current line is the last line of
the buffer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>a</code> appends new lines after the current line
</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the appending of lines
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed hello.txt 
47
.
This is a letter from me to you.
a

And that was it!
.
w
65
</code></pre>
<p>
Now, <code>ed</code> is line-oriented and so we can provide line numbers
and line ranges to our commands. If you omit a line number or the range,
these commands apply to the current line only. A range is two
comma-separated line numbers. If you omit numbers, defaults are “from
the first line” and “to the last line”. Thus, a single comma means “all
the lines”. <code>$</code> is always the last line. Relative addressing
with negative offsets like <code>-1</code> and positive offsets like
<code>+1</code> works as well.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>p</code> prints the lines
</li>
<li>
<code>n</code> numbers the lines
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are all equivalent:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>1,5p</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>1,$p</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>,p</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So now let’s number the lines and then append to the first paragraph.
Use <code>n</code> to find the right line number to append to, and use
<code>p</code> at the end to proofread.
</p>
<pre><code>,n

It's pretty short, I know. I didn't have enough time to make it longer.

And that was it!
</code></pre>
<p>
Notice how we could only append new lines after the third line. We
couldn’t append new words to the third line itself. What we can do is
join two lines, though. Unfortunately, that doesn’t add a space!
</p>
<p>
One option is to add a single line containing a space. The other option
is to use a substitution to add a space. That’s what we will use.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>s/from/to/</code> replaces regular expression <code>from</code>
with string <code>to</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>j</code> joins lines in the range
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowing that this concerns lines 3 and 4 there is no need to use
<code>n</code>.

<h2 id="processing-with-other-tools">
Processing with other tools
</h2>
<p>
There is no way to process the buffer with external tools, but there is
a way to do it with the current file.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>w</code> writes the file
</li>
<li>
<code>e</code> edits a filename, replacing the current buffer; or if the
argument starts with an exclamation mark, executes the command and
replaces the buffer with the output
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>w

I like to start my blog posts with a level one heading, a date, and some

the <code>#</code>.

<ul>
<li>

current buffer; or if the argument starts with an exclamation mark,

<h2 id="using-the-buffer-as-a-workspace">
Using the buffer as a workspace
</h2>
<p>
OK, I know this is weird. But in theory we can think of the buffer as a
huge one-dimensional workspace. We can insert lines from files and
process output here and there, and we can write line ranges to files.
</p>
<p>
Here we are writing a haiku, don’t like the last line, insert a new
third line and then write just the first three lines to the file. The
fourth line not saved but it is still available in the buffer.
</p>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed

</code></pre>
<p>
In this sense it’s unclear what the default filename of the buffer is.
It’s the one-dimensional desktop!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>f</code> prints the default filename, or sets it if a filename is
provided
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>f
haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-marks-and-line-arithmetic">
Using marks and line arithmetic
</h2>
<p>
Perhaps working with the buffer as a long, one-dimensional workspace
makes more sense if you drop markers as you work with files. Use
<code>k</code> followed by a lower case letter.
</p>
<p>
Here we insert a first haiku, mark the first line, insert a new haiku,
mark its beginning, and then we print the two, using the marks and some
line arithmetic.
</p>
<pre><code>r haiku.txt

<h2 id="hit-enter-too-soon">

<p>
Something I do often enough: I hit the Enter key when I didn’t mean to.
Fix it by beginning the new line with a space. Finish the line, and join
the previous line with the current line:
</p>
<pre><code>i

sounds like what we’re waiting for in the social web and in journalism.

<p>I’ve got the
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/09/bingeworthyScreenShot.png">new
version of Bingeworthy</a> running here. When I saw how the database
code worked, I had to redo it from scratch. It was probably my first SQL
project, and I barely knew what I was doing. It’s too bad, because
looking at it from that point of view I could see how SQL could have
been much simpler by making some of the optional features automatic. A
higher layer on top of SQL is possible, it seems to me. Having ChatGPT
review my ideas has been invaluable in this project. I’m going to use it
myself for a while, and see how I want to reorganize the user interface.
There were opportunities for factoring I didn’t take back then because I
was in a rush to do something else.</p>

<h2 id="trust-issues-in-ai">Trust Issues in AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
For a technology that seems startling in its modernity, AI sure has a
long history. Google Translate, OpenAI chatbots, and Meta AI image
generators are built on decades of advancements in linguistics, signal
processing, statistics, and other fields going back to the early days of
computing—and, often, on seed funding from the U.S. Department of
Defense. But today’s tools are hardly the intentional product of the
diverse generations of innovators that came before. We agree with
Morozov that the “refuseniks,” as he
<a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/the-ai-we-deserve/">calls</a>
them, are wrong to see AI as “irreparably tainted” by its origins. AI is
better understood as a creative, global field of human endeavor that has
been largely captured by U.S. venture capitalists, private equity, and
Big Tech. But that was never the inevitable outcome, and it doesn’t need
to stay that way…

reflections on their past, and their role in our multi-device,

has repositioned itself as “a global crew of activists, technologists
and builders, all working to keep the internet free, open and
accessible.” These are all worthy goals, but in my experience Mozilla
has been an <i>obstacle</i> to these things. I wrote in a
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/113617569413777710">comment</a>
on Mastodon, “A long time ago they invited me to present my ideas, and
like an idiot I thought that’s what they wanted, instead it was an
ambush, people mostly wanting to ridicule me because they thought
anything that a person does can’t be any good, it has to come from a big
company like Mozilla or Google. I thought then and still do now, how do
they justify wasting their time on such a ridiculous thing. I kept on
doing what I was doing, but switched off their browser first chance I
got.” If they really want to get behind projects that make the open web
stronger, I’d be happy to help guide them, but only if they’ve sobered
up and take that mission statement seriously, instead of just as a
justification for holding on to their jobs a little bit longer.</p>
