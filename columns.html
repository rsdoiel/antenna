got a new project called
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt">davegpt</a>, it’s in
GitHub, open source of course. I also created a ChatGPT project with the
same code (new feature introduced on Monday). Presumably I can ask it
questions about the code. Because I have a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a>
file in the GitHub project, ChatGPT understands where I want to take
this project. Most amazing, it wrote a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">summary</a>
of what it saw in the project. I
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">added
that</a> to the GitHub project, of course, and since it was in Markdown,
it fit right in with no mods. The power of standards. I love it when
things that should work, do. The next step is to implement a feature in
the new Bingeworthy that can only be done with an AI bot like ChatGPT.
It’s such a thrill to be working on this stuff as it’s happening. And
what a delight that it has an API. I don’t mind that I’m paying for it,
I love the idea of paying to break down walls to create new things that
couldn’t have been created before.</p>

<p>What could journalism do to help the country? Move your shows out
into the red territories. Make it a requirement that Chris and Joy,
Lawrence or Rachel, if they want to stay on the air, have to broadcast
from one of the red states. It could be a large city in a red state. The
reason is symbolic and practical. The red state voters wouldn’t be such
a mystery if you knew some of them from your everyday life. And you
might have a few of them on the show. You have some selling to do, the
idea you’re selling is that you care about the people you don’t
know.</p>

Democrats are, of course, failing to lead the 75 million who voted for
them in the last election, which was a bit over a month ago. Maybe they
should factor that into their thinking, what kind of relationship would
you have with an organization that only cared about what you thought if
they needed something very specific from you in that exact moment. Any
other time, who are you again? We are without leaders.</p>

get my greatest ideas walking, riding my bike, on a ski lift, or sitting
in a hot tub esp when it’s really cold out and there’s a full moon as
there was last night. Sometimes the ideas prove workable and other times
they’re like the great brainstorms one had with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_boom">cocaine</a> in the
80s, not that I would know, but have heard. Anyway, I was daydreaming
about what I’d do with
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bingeworthy">Bingeworthy</a>
if I was going to continue working on it. I thought about the mode I
want to use it in. I want to watch a series that I would like, not that
Netflix thinks I’d like, because their idea of what I’d like is
bullshit. I find that I’ll like almost anything that’s rated in the 80s
by Metacritic, but really only if the NYT reviewed it well. I’ll give
almost any NYT <i>critics choice</i> a go. So what I really want in the
middle of the Bingeworthy display of a program is 250 words about the
program aggregated from various critics as Metacritic does so well.
Unfortunately neither Metacritic or the NYT offer an API for this as far
as I know. Oh too bad, same old thing. No access to the data where you
need it (btw, ideally Bingeworthy would be baked into the TV set, or all
the streamers could be played in the context of Bingeworthy). Anyway,
then <i>boom</i> it hit me, holy shit the thing I was farting around
with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/17.html#a164345">in the
outliner</a> could actually do this. Now I’m going to need to be able to
call ChatGPT from a Node app.</p>

Plates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Not everything needs to be digital and “smart.” License plates,
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/digital-license-plate-jailbreak-hack/">for
example</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Josep Rodriguez, a researcher at security firm IOActive, has revealed a
technique to “jailbreak” digital license plates sold by Reviver, the
leading vendor of those plates in the US with 65,000 plates already
sold. By removing a sticker on the back of the plate and attaching a
cable to its internal connectors, he’s able to rewrite a Reviver plate’s
firmware in a matter of minutes. Then, with that custom firmware
installed, the jailbroken license plate can receive commands via
Bluetooth from a smartphone app to instantly change its display to show
any characters or image…

<p>I’m farting around with the OpenAI API. I have a nice encapsulation
for calls to ChatGPT, one that hides all the tricky stuff, all you need
is an apiToken to make it work, something that is available for free.
The first place I put it is in an outliner. Basically I can write a
question in a headline, click an icon and the response from ChatGPT is
placed in a series of sub-heads. Interesting to see that they use
Markdown to convey the response. The logical choice. I’m not sure how or
if I will use this in my writing, but now I have an idea what it’s good
for. Here’s a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/17/fartingAroundWithOpenAiApi.png">screen
shot</a> of a question I asked and the answer. Also the API is very
slow. A question like that would be displayed instantly in their app, in
my app it takes a half minute. And I have to pay for it, whereas in
their app it’s all covered by my $20 a month subscription.</p>

Via <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2024/12/weekend-reads-642/">Barry
Ritholtz</a> we find this infographic entitled <i>Top Performing S&amp;P
500 Stocks</i> showing the best total return over the past 5, 10, 15 and
20 years. Ritholtz sourced it from
<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-top-performing-sp-500-stocks-in-the-last-two-decades/"><i>Ranked:
The Top Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last Two Decades</i></a> By
Marcus Lu with graphic design by Miranda Smith.<br /> <br /> In each
case, Nvidia is the best performing stock, and it is the only stock to
appear in all four periods. Sounds great, doesn’t it? Why wouldn’t you
just hold NVDA all the time and be guaranteed to beat the market?<br />
<br /> But follow me below the fold for more detail from someone who has
been long NVDA for more than three decades..<br />

Alas, this infographic is deeply misleading because they cherry-picked
their data. Nvidia’s stock price is extraordinarily volatile. The log
plot of NVDA shows that on average over its history every three years it
suffers a drop of between 45% and 80%. Fortunately, over the same time
it has had much larger rises. Thus when discussing the return for being
long NVDA for a period the start and end dates matter a lot.<br />

This table shows the performance of NVDA and the S&amp;P 500 over each
of the 5-year periods in the infographic. Over three of the 5-year
periods NVDA out-performed the S&amp;P 500, and over the remaining one
it under-performed. By choosing appropriate starting points it is easy
to find other 5-year periods when NVDA under-performed the S&amp;P 500.
For example, from 8/2007 to 8/2012 NVDA returned -63.7% but the S&amp;P
returned -5.6%. Or from 11/2001 to 11/2006 NVDA returned +10.7% but the
S&amp;P returned +23.5%.<br /> <br />

<p>Although the infographic suggests that the huge out-performance
started 20 years ago and has been decreasing, this is misleading for two
reasons. First, the infographic’s numbers are for the whole 20-year
period, not for each 5-year period. Second, they are dominated by the
rise in the most recent 5-year period. The linear plot of NVDA makes it
clear that, had the most recent 5-year period been like any of the
others, Nvidia would not have been in the infographic at all.<br />
<br /> None of this is financial advice. Nevertheless, Nvidia is a great
company, and it is possible to make money in its stock. There are two
ways to do it, trading on the stock’s volatility, or buying low and
being prepared to hold it for many years.<br /> <br /> Remember, past
performance is no guarantee of future performance. If NVDA were to
repeat the past 5-year return over the next 5 years, it would be around
$3,100. To maintain its current P/E of 52.85 it would need annual
revenue of around $2.6T.<br /> <br /></p>

Certificates Coming to Let’s Encrypt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Starting
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/11/eoy-letter-2024/">next
year</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our longstanding offering won’t fundamentally change next year, but we
are going to introduce a new offering that’s a big shift from anything
we’ve done before—short-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates
with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of
the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key
compromise event.
</p>
<p>
Because we’ve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade,
most of our subscribers aren’t going to have to do much in order to
switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going
to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as
many certificates as we do now. It’s not inconceivable that at some
point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000
certificates per day…
