<h2 id="implementing-cryptography-in-ai-systems">Implementing
Cryptography in AI Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, updated: 2025-02-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research: “<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/288">How to
Securely Implement Cryptography in Deep Neural Networks</a>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) raises
the question of how can we equip them with a desired cryptographic
functionality (e.g, to decrypt an encrypted input, to verify that this
input is authorized, or to hide a secure watermark in the output). The
problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run
on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to
sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer
that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to
vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and
continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best
way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether
DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new
setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose
“bits” are arbitrary real numbers…

As you can see the metadata, in the screen shot below, overwhelms the

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a set of templates to choose from, post

<h2 id="who-is-elon-musk">Who is Elon Musk?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Journalism is as usual writing news they could have written last year
and should have if they weren’t dreaming that somehow we’d escape End of
Democracy 2.0. And we know how that turned out, about the same as
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Hillary%27s%20Emails%22">Hillary’s
Emails</a>.
</p>
<p>
Who is Elon Musk? Until I read his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Wikipedia profile</a>
last week, I only had a vague idea. I wanted to know if he was actually
raised in South Africa, when he left, and what influence it had on him.
I’ll let you read the article. We should be examining every nook and
cranny of who this unelected guy who never was in a debate, or won a
primary or an election, or had his background investigated, and remains
untouched by any kind of examination.
</p>
<p>
His security detail was just
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/elon-musk-private-security-deputized-marshals-service/index.html">deputized</a>
by the <a href="https://www.usmarshals.gov/">US Marshals Service</a>.
What next? Maybe they’ll just give him control of the military and get
on with it. You can see that’s coming, maybe in March, or sooner.
</p>
<p>
Do you think he’d have any
<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/compunction">compunction</a>
against using the military against Americans? This isn’t his country. So
Americans probably mean nothing special to him. Since we played a role
in the overthrow of their apartheid, probably the opposite. I wonder who
or what he cares about. Has he ever answered a question without
deflecting? Is there any reporter who could or would interview him?
</p>
<p>
If journalism were really doing their job seriously, they would report
on this because this is what we’re thinking. When will jouralism get
that they are one of us, not above us? The sooner that light goes on,
the better.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a good story for one of fierce courageous reporters at the NY
Times. Who should be more scared of what’s coming? Blacks or Jews?

you hear from Democratic politicians and MSNBC hosts. “We know why Musk
is cutting so much, it’s to fund a huge tax cut for billionaires.” They
don’t actually know that and I doubt it’s true. Show me another example
where Musk did anything to benefit anyone but himself? Why should he
share the loot he’s grabbing with other rich folk? What did they do to
help? Nah I think it’s all for him, with a taste going to the Trump and
Putin families. He’s going to use his new power to buy something else.
The question is what? What else could he want? I imagine he wants <i>all
the money</i> in the world not just the most.</p>

In October 2023, the <abbr class="initialism">UK</abbr> government
passed into law the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">Online
Safety Act</a>, a set of regulations intended to make online services
more responsible for the content they carry. It is a laudable aim, but
unfortunately the distinctions the Act draws between large sites such as
Facebook and Google and smaller sites such as this one are
insufficiently well defined. The upshot is that complying with the Act
places a much larger burden on the owners of sites such as <cite>Shady

<h1 id="2025-02-19-bots-again-cursed">
2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed
</h1>
<p>
I’m on a trip and once again the bot fuckers are at it. Long term load
average is 0.5; I have two cores so I can handle an average load of 2.0;
but when I looked at my sites this morning load was at 110. Some idiot
is training their AI again, is my guess.
</p>
<p>
I switched off Emacs Wiki and Community Wiki for the time being. They’ll
be back when the AI bros are tired of downloading every link.
</p>
<p>
Munin shows load goin up and up and then Munin breaks down…
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-1.jpg" alt="A Muningraph" />
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Emacs">#Emacs</a>
</p>
<p>
Compare this shit I should be dealing with to the stuff I want to look
at:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-2.jpg" alt="Sunrise" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-3.jpg" alt="Mountains" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-4.jpg" alt="Snow" />
</p>
<p>
So here’s the new deal: I’m redirecting any request containing
“rcidonly” in the query string to
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/nobots">nobots</a>. This parameter is
used when showing recent changes for just a single page (“show all
changes”), or for showing a feed for just one page. These are valid
links but when the Internet ingesting machines start slurping, these
endpoints are too expensive. This redirect to the static page already
saves us a lot of resources.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, I wrote a fail2ban filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> containing this:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
# www.emacswiki.org:443 000.000.000.000 - - [19/Feb/2025:00:05:14 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1728421966&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_FacesPerBuffer&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 7168 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.127 Safari/537.36&quot;
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added a section using this filter to my jail
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>
<p>
And when I check it, it already contained some bots:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client status alex-bots
Status for the jail: alex-bots
|- Filter

   `- Banned IP list:
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2025-02-20</strong>. I had some further problems.
</p>
<p>
The web interface to my IRC servers no longer worked. The Lounge
reported timeout errors.
</p>
<p>
So I investigated the IRC server and that seemed to work. I noticed that
no numbers appeared on Munin so I was confused. I added a config for
Monit, thinking that perhaps I’d get more info. But no, everything
seemed to work. I even managed to log on using the <code>irc</code>
program (ircII):
</p>
<pre><code>irc blog-reader SSLIRC/campaignwiki.org:6697
</code></pre>
<p>
Munin also didn’t show other info, like Apache data. Apparently that’s
due to me deleting the <code>000-default.conf</code> file which ensures
that localhost is in fact a virtual host. Without it, there’s no way to
access <code>http://localhost/server-info</code> and
<code>http://localhost/server-status</code>. Well, I fixed that, but
still no numbers.
</p>
<p>
This is when I realized that The Lounge managed to connect to other IRC
servers. It was only failing for my own server. And I started thinking.
</p>
<p>
All these symptoms pointed to me being blocked by my own firewall. And
so it was!
</p>
<p>
This even explained another small setup problem where two of my sites
behind Apache were being served by one service that listened on the same
port but for two domains. Those requests also were getting lost. I
rewrote that particular setup so that each site is now proxied directly
and therefore listens for <code>localhost</code> and a port instead of a
hostname and a port. Because that second pathway goes through the
firewall.
</p>
<p>
Yikes! So much headache only because I had blocked myself.

<p>Once again Maddow is must-watch destination TV this year. Keep on
going. One thing to watch out for, Bluesky <i>will</i> disappoint you.
Don’t blame them when it happens, because they can’t be as good as
people think they are. They’re a startup in a tough market. Sooner or
later Musk is going to aim at them (maybe he already is) and they will
have to seek refuge somewhere, and all big tech companies are bastards.
There isn’t one of them you can trust with your democracy. So keep that
in mind, and when you see open billionaire-proof social networks rise
up, give them a little the Rachel we love.</p>

you need to do is open the context menu on any video file, go to “Quick

<p>One more thing. I like watching Maddow nowadays. She seems unstuck.
And she’s talking straight to the Repubs, and not with resignation, with
the idea that maybe finally enough is enough, and they might work with
us to save what we can of this great country. Also like that Bernie
Sanders is on the road campaigning in swing districts that are held by
Repubs, to see if he can squeeze out a few defectors from the ranks of
House Republicans. Very important, because the Repub margin there is
only 3. Just have to flip 2. America has to start moving now, or it’s
going to take a long long time to come back from this. The sooner we all
get that, and that <i>we</i> are part of it, the better things will turn
out, imho.</p>

don’t like
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3likjorqzmk23">social
networks</a> as they’re currently configured. The idea that it’s some
kind of conversation – no it really doesn’t resemble a conversation. I
would like to try a social network that didn’t have the concept of
replying to a post. Give each other a little more distance. It still
would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn’t be
able to insert something into someone else’s flow, which is where all
the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the
person it’s in reply to, so you don’t end up getting speeches under your
posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don’t bother reading
anything that’s related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can
enter the flow. We’ve been doing this, the way we do it, since the
inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network
is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics,
specifically graph theory – and the Twitter way of organizing people and
discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged.
Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the
structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way
might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can’t
intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we
should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the
other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or
whatever bullshit the influencers have made up). And with that I wish
you a good evening and note that tomorrow is another day. <span

<p>date: 2025-02-19, updated: 2025-02-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This isn’t new, but it’s
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">increasingly
popular</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The technique is known as device code phishing. It exploits “device code
flow,” a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-07#section-3.4">OAuth
standard</a>. Authentication through device code flow is designed for
logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These
devices typically don’t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in
using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user
names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained
device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a
link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a
computer or other device that’s easier to sign in with and enters the
code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained
device that logs it into the account…

kind of surprising how someone's existence fits into a single scrolling

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How
to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
<em>How do you recompile Linux?</em>
</p>
<p>
In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild
<a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi’s Linux
kernel fork</a> instead of ‘mainline’ linux (the upstream
<a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).
</p>
<p>
Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building
and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly
goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more
convenient):

<h2 id="an-example-of-ai-use">An example of AI use</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to
ChatGPT. Here’s the prompt.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>I’m thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it
in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to
ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the
trip, I don’t mind going out of my way.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and
Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services
and notable bike trails.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place
that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.
</p>
<p>
It also offered information about weather considerations. It’s not
necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.
</p>
<p>
I’m not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example
because I’ve done this trip a number of times and was curious how things
had developed.
</p>
<p>
Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I
find a Starbucks not too far off the route I’m on. If you were plotting
the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a
continuum of services that have developed over the years that make
information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers
questions you have in the way you think of asking them.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a

to the response</a>. I’ve heard that sometimes people have trouble
accessing these files.

<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can’t moderate
comments under your own posts.
</p>
<p>
If someone says something abusive, it’s there for everyone to see,
forever.
</p>
<p>
I’ve come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full
discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes.
</p>
<p>
I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to
feel respected.
</p>
<p>
A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful.

<p>
A simple idea, a quid pro quo.
</p>
<p>
If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate
that we will support them.
</p>
<p>
We are the government of the US, Congress represents us.
</p>
<p>
We have been too passive.
</p>
<p>
But then, they have to include us in governing.
</p>
<p>
No more shutting off the connection after the election.

<p>
Seems like a fair deal.

If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I’d restart the
online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election
Day. 2. I’d get out the message over and over about how things are going
too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what’s happening.
Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the
US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes
will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun
to make my statement, but I’m afraid this is going too far. I think we
can all relate to that. We aren’t being represented here.
</p>
<p>
I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to
visualize what it feels like to be watching what’s happening in the US
from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have
expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure
out what you’re doing.

stacks were the equivalent of websites.
</p>
<p>
If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">it</a> had been
built around the Macintosh Toolkit, and had an API that fit in with Mac
apps, there wouldn’t be a web, we’d all be using Macs. Alas it was all
on its own, didn’t work with anything but itself.
</p>
<p>
A lot was lost because the Mac development model was far in advance of
what existed on the web, and it was well-thought-out unlike the app
model of the web, which is a hodgepodge of horribly designed modules
that don’t work well together.
</p>
<p>
I was a Mac developer at the time, so I know a lot about this moment of
history.

<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
The first big autumnal blast of the year has hit. We took Indie on her
first trip to the local library (where she gave the most ENORMOUS grin
to the librarian, it was really sweet), craving more diversity in books
than “Colours”, “Shapes” and the ever-frustrating “Goodnight Stories for
Rebel Girls”. This was our haul…

<p>
The Plato one was funny. The back indicated there was another in the
series called “Equality with Simone de Beauvoir”, so I went, “Ooh, well
if they have it, I’d rather get that one.” They didn’t have it. So I
turned to Indie and said, “Well, we can get the Plato one, and you can
listen to me trash-talk him!” Then Viv (Philosophy major – not that
you’d ever know by just meeting him) asked, “What’s wrong with Plato?”
and I explained my opinion.
</p>
<p>
But anyway, the book is called <cite>Love with Plato</cite>. So I was
like, “What did Plato even say about love? I don’t remember that from
year 12 Philosophy. I remember PHILOSOPHER-KINGS and the allegory of the
cave…” Just from reading the book now, it seems like Plato said it’s
good to love things. So, OK, Plato. Thanks for that brilliant insight.
(This is me expecting too much out of baby books again, isn’t it?)

<p>
And this was one of the books we did NOT get. I pointed it out to Viv
and went, “Oh man, what is this, pro-cop propaganda for babies?! Get it
out of here,” and Viv started teasing me: “Come on, the police are
lovely people. Who else are you going to call when you need the police?”
and I told him to stop brainwashing the baby.

<p>
We had a nice little excursion, anyway.

<p>On this day, I always like to tell the story of Theodore Roosevelt’s
terrible 1884 Valentine’s Day and how it led to the Progressive Era, but
things are happening too fast these days to leave a gap in the record,
so you’ll have to look back at last year—or forward to next—for that
story.</p>

After using SwiftUI’s new macro-based observable system, it is hard to
think about using anything else.
</p>
<p>
Then I realized I would love to have a language that is based entirely
on that concept.
</p>
<p>
A bit like a spreadsheet, with data flowing and propagating as needed,
rather than our current approach of moving data from one point to
another like donkeys pulling carts.
