This is the second week of our holidays. We stayed in Z√ºrich and decided
to live as if we‚Äôre on a trip: hikes, runs, activities (today:
cycling!), restaurants, museums or concerts. I told myself that we can
spend the hotel budget on cultural events and train rides and suddenly
everything seems possible where until now I would have hesitated. Is it
really worth that much money? But since we‚Äôre not paying for the hotel ‚Ä¶
I convinced myself that it‚Äôs OK.

<p>Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting ‚Äúboth
sides,‚Äù how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens
specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course
individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he
<i>doesn‚Äôt</i> threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very
revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for
you all to get in sync with the actual American history that‚Äôs being
made.</p>

<p>To my programmer friends, how long would it have taken to answer
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/66f038e3-7218-8012-a294-05bb7afa9b97">this
question</a> using Google and StackExchange. There was a bug in this one
line of code, a call to <i>new Date ()</i> in JavaScript, that was
behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The
problem: I was specifying the day as 0 and month, correctly, but the day
had to be 1 in order for it to work and without thinking I had specified
it as 0.</p>

<p>On Thursday, September 19, the day after the Federal Reserve began to
lower interest rates two and a half years after it began to raise them
to get inflation under control, President Joe Biden spoke to the
Economic Club of Washington, D.C., a nonprofit, nonpartisan forum where
leaders from around the world can speak to larger questions about the
global economy.</p>
