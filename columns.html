<p>This evening, President Joe Biden awarded twenty Americans the
Presidential Citizens Medal, which is given to those “who have performed
exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.”
Biden chose these particular individuals because he “believes these
Americans are bonded by their common decency and commitment to serving
others” and that “[t]he country is better because of their dedication
and sacrifice.”</p>

<h2 id="little-feed-reader-on-bluesky">Little Feed Reader on
Bluesky</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
My
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy">little
feed reader</a> on Bluesky is
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lerbu7ugvc2i">ready</a>
for you to follow.
</p>
<p>
Technically, this is how the pieces fit together.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I’m using the
<a href="https://viewfeedlist.opml.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll">OPML
file</a> for my <i>blogroll</i> category on feedland.social to determine
what’s posted on Bluesky. When I add or remove feeds from the category,
the OPML adjusts dynamically.
</li>
<li>
I’m running a new Node app that has a
<a href="https://javascript.info/websocket">websocket</a> connection to
feedland.social. It receives all the new items as they are found from
all feeds over the socket. It’s feedland.social’s
<a href="https://www.pubnub.com/learn/glossary/firehose-api/">firehose</a>.
Since I’m currently the only user of that server, it’s getting news from
the all feeds I follow, not just the ones in the blogroll category.
</li>
<li>
The Node app checks each new item to see if it’s in one of the feeds in
the OPML list. If so, it reformats it to fit in a Bluesky post and sends
it to the
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy">feediverse
account</a>.
</li>
<li>
If you’re subscribed you should see the item, with a link, in your
Bluesky timeline.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Notes</b>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The Node app re-loads the OPML subscription list every minute so any
change is quickly reflected.
</li>
<li>
It’s the same <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> you
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/expandedBlogScreen.png">see</a>
on my <a href="http://scripting.com/">blog’s home page</a>.
</li>
<li>
The biggest
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/issues/1">problem</a>
in getting this running was rate-limiting. I have dealt with this on
Twitter and other services, but Bluesky was not, for a while, letting
anything through with the error message that we were over the limit. It
was suggested that we should cache the accessToken rather get a new one
for every message. I did that and cautiously turned the server on again
at first with a 5 message per hour self-imposed limit, then gradually
increased it to 10 per hour. The latest version only requires that there
be at least five minutes between posts, so that means no more than 12
per hour.
</li>
<li>
Thanks to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lerhvj52pk27">Mark
Cuban</a> for the initial idea and his support. He saw a
<a href="https://news.scripting.com/">river of news</a> from
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> and asked if it could work
in Bluesky. That was the idea. I have always wanted a tight coupling
between Bluesky and
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> but didn’t know
how to do it. We may have just skipped a step.
</li>
<li>
We realllly could use some more formating features in Bluesky messages.
This is a really strong use-case imho for the
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> idea.
</li>
<li>
The coolest thing from my point of view is that I already had all the
pieces, fully developed, the only thing that remained was to hook them
together.
</li>
<li>
Finally, there’s a
<a href="https://this.how/feediverse/bluesky/">this.how page</a> for
Little Feed Reader. It’s purposely brief, but I have put a link to this
post on that page.

<p>Twenty-five years ago today, Americans—along with the rest of the

<p>This year I’m sorting books by vibes instead of genres, sorry not
sorry 😉 This was a bit of a rough reading year, so these are
“favorites,” distinct from “best” or even necessarily “recommended” (if
you’re ever looking for SFF or romance book recs, feel free to email
me).  See all the books I read. […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-12-31-perry-rhodan">
2024-12-31 Perry Rhodan
</h1>
<p>
Not too long ago I wanted to <a href="https://perry-rhodan.net/">buy
some Perry Rhodan ebooks</a>.
</p>
<p>
Who is Perry Rhodan? It’s a series of dime novels
<a href="https://www.perrypedia.de/wiki/Titelbildgalerie_PR_1_-_99">going
back to the sixties</a>. Shortly before the landing on the moon, this
German series of A5 booklets, each more or less 60 pages long, started
to appear. The main character is one of the astronauts landing on the
moon. On the dark side of the moon, they discover aliens, and with this
technology they return to Earth, end the cold war, explore the galaxy,
gain immortality, and on and on.
</p>
<p>
The series has slowed down somewhat. They’re on a biweekly schedule,
now. Not too long ago, episode 3300 was published.
</p>
<p>
I had subscribed to the series when I was between 14 and 16 years old. I
wanted some of this back. An optimism, that humans were good, the some
humans in power had integrity and good will and the energy to put things
right. A tolerance, curiosity, a trust in science and technology – a
deserved trust! – stories without terrible violence and torture.
</p>
<p>
When I tried to order those ebooks, I had to provide an address and when
I tried to enter an address, I could only enter an address in Germany or
Austria. I contacted their support and they told me it had to do with
taxes. I guess it has to do with value-added tax (VAT) and Switzerland
not being in the European Union? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
I started looking around on the second hand market and found somebody
selling their collection from volume 1800 up to 3100 and more. Amazing.
Think about it: A year has about 50 weeks, so 1300 volumes is the
equivalent of 26 years of dime novels. 1300 volumes of 60 pages each is
78,000 pages of Science Fiction.
</p>
<p>
I am so into it.
</p>
<p>
I just finished reading volume 1816. I have read 17 volumes of the 1300+
I have – more than 1%! 🤭
</p>
<p>
I’ll be reading for a few more years.

The Cambridge dictionary defines the verb to
<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bullshit">bullshit</a>
as:<br />
<blockquote>
a rude word meaning to try to persuade someone or make them admire you
by saying things that are not true
</blockquote>
The essence of successful bullshit is that it should be both plausible
and presented authoritatively. Bullshitters are always tempted to
buttress the appearance of authority by including actual evidence rather
than just their interpretation of the evidence, but this is often a
fatal mistake. Below the fold I discuss a classic example from MAGA’s
campaign to demonize immigrants.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>

𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬</b>: <br /> <br />In 1924, President Calvin
Coolidge signed the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act, which halted mass
immigration into the United States. <br /> <br />The act completely
stopped immigration from Asia, and set strict quotas on immigration from
other places including Europe. <br /> <br />Wages began to dramatically
increase. <br /> <br />By the 1950s, America reached the peak of its
economic and industrial might. Economic inequality was low. Large
businesses and workers alike were prospering. <br /> <br />Then, in 1965
the Hart-Cellar Immigration Act was signed by President LBJ, opening the
floodgates and allowing for massive unchecked immigration, especially
from the global south. <br /> <br />Immediately, income growth and wage
growth for the bottom 90% of earners came to an abrupt halt. <br />
<br />Soon after, the incomes for the top 1% of earners skyrocketed,
leading to the massive wealth inequality in America we see today. <br />
<br />The political left attributes this to simply a lack of proper
taxation and regulation, but that’s mainly not the case. <br />
<br />Mass immigration has allowed for modern scab labor to become the
norm, allowing large companies to pay lower wages for foreign migrants
who demand less. <br /> <br />The loser? America’s middle class, which
has been deteriorating for more than half a century now. <br />
<br />When you see wealthy technocrats argue in favor of mass “skilled”
immigration, keep this in mind.

on immigration from other places including Europe.<br /> <br /> Wages
began to dramatically increase.

Whose wages had the dramatic increase in 1924? Right, the 1%. Whose
wages were flat from 1924 until the Great Depression? Right, the bottom
90%. Guidarini is just wrong. The dramatic increase in the wages of the
bottom 90% happened in 1940, 16 years later. Can you think of a cause
for the dramatic increase in 1940? It surely wasn’t the

Immigration Act</a> of 1924.<br /> <br /> Second, we have Guidarini’s
claim that:<br />
<blockquote>
By the 1950s, America reached the peak of its economic and industrial
might.
</blockquote>
If America’s “economic and industrial might” peaked in the 50s, why did
the incomes of the bottom 90% continue rising until 1973?<br /> <br />
Third we have Guidarini’s claim that:<br />
<blockquote>
Then, in 1965 the Hart-Cellar Immigration Act was signed by President
LBJ, opening the floodgates and allowing for massive unchecked
immigration, especially from the global south.<br /> <br /> Immediately,
income growth and wage growth for the bottom 90% of earners came to an
abrupt halt.

Lets put 1965 on the graph.<br /> <br />

<br />Can you see the income growth for the bottom 90% come to an
immediate halt? No, wages continued rising as they had been since 1940
until 1973, another 8 years. Did the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965">Hart-Cellar
Immigration Act</a> of 1965 cause wages to flatten in 1973? Whose income
flat-lined after 1965 for a decade and a half? Right, the 1%.<br />
<br /> Lastly, we have Guidarini’s claim that soon after 1965:<br />
<blockquote>
the incomes for the top 1% of earners skyrocketed, leading to the
massive wealth inequality in America we see today.

<p>Can you see when the “incomes for the top 1% of earners skyrocketed”?
That’s right, it was in 1985, so “soon” means 20 years! And can you
guess who was President of the US, and from what party, then? Right, it

id="why-are-hobbyist-21st-century-8-bit-computers-so-constrained">Why
are hobbyist 21st century 8-bit computers so constrained?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: Liam on Linux</p>
I learned about a new DIY machine to me, the
<a href="https://www.codycomputer.org/">Cody Computer</a>. <br />
<div class="comment_text" role="heading" aria-level="3">
<p>
It looks kind of fun, but once again, it does make me wonder why it’s so
constrained. Extremely low-res graphics, for instance. TBH I would have
sneered at this for being low-end when I was about 13 years old.
(Shortly before I got my first computer, a 48K ZX Spectrum.)
</p>
<p>
Why isn’t anyone trying to make an easy home-build high-end eight-bit?
Something that really pushes the envelope right out there – the sort of
dream machine I wanted by about the middle of the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
In 1987 I owned an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW#PCW_9512_and_9256" rel="ugc">Amstrad
PCW9512</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
4MHz Z80A
</li>
<li>
512 kB RAM, so 64kB CP/M 3 TPA plus something over 400kB RAMdisc as
drive M:
</li>
<li>
720 x 256 monochrome screen resolution, 90 x 30 characters in text mode
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Later in 1989 I bought an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_Coup%C3%A9" rel="ugc">MGT SAM
Coupé</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
6MHz Z80B
</li>
<li>
256 kB RAM
</li>
<li>
256 x 192 or 512 x 192 graphics, with 1/2/4 bits per pixel
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both had graphics easily outdone by the MSX 2 and later Z80 machines,
but those had a dedicated GPU. That might be a reach but then given the
limits of a 64 kB memory map, maybe a good one.
</p>
<p>
Another aspirational machine was the BBC Micro: a expandable, modular OS
called MOS; an excellent BASIC, BBC BASIC, with structured flow, named
procedures, with local variables, enabling recursive programming, and
inline assembly language so if you graduated to machine-code you could
just enter and edit it in the BASIC line editor. (Which was weird, but
powerful – for instance, 2 independent cursors, one source and one
destination, eliminating the whole “clipboard” concept.)
Resolution-independent graphics, and graphics modes that cheerfully used
most of the RAM, leaving exploitation as an exercise for the developer.
Which they rose to magnificently.
</p>
<p>
The BBC Micro supported
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro_expansion_unit" rel="ugc">dual
processors</a> over the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_(BBC_Micro)" rel="ugc">Tube
interface</a>, so one 6502 could run the OS, the DOS, and the
framebuffer, using most of its 64 kB, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC#BBC_Micro" rel="ugc">Hi-BASIC</a>
could run on the 2nd 6502 (or Z80!) processor, therefore having most of
64 kB to itself.
</p>
<p>
In a 21st century 8-bit, I want something that comfortably exceeds a
1980s 8-bit, let alone a 1990s 8-bit.
</p>
<p>
(And yes, there were new 8-bit machines in the 1990s, such as the
<a href="https://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Plus" rel="ugc">Amstrad CPC
Plus range</a>, or
<a href="https://www.msx.org/wiki/MSX_turbo_R" rel="ugc">MSX Turbo
R</a>.)
</p>
<p>
So my wish list would include…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>At least</em> 80-column legible text, ideally more. We can forget
analog TVs and CRT limitations now. Aim to exceed VGA resolutions. 256
colours in some low resolutions but a high mono resolution is handy too.
</li>
<li>
Lots of RAM with some bank-switching mechanism, plus mechanisms to make
this useful to BASIC programmers not just machine code developers. A
RAMdisc is easy.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_BASIC" rel="ugc">Beta
BASIC</a> on the ZX Spectrum 128 lets BASIC declare arrays kept in the
RAMdisc, so while a BASIC program is limited to under 30 kB of RAM, it
can manipulate 100-odd kB of data in arrays. That’s a simple, clever
hack.
</li>
<li>
A really world-class BASIC with structured programming support.
</li>
<li>
A fast processor (double-digit megahertz doesn’t seem too much to ask).
</li>
<li>
Some provision for 3rd party OSes. There are some impressive ones out
there now, such as <a href="http://www.symbos.de/" rel="ugc">SymbOS</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki" rel="ugc">Contiki</a>,
and <a href="https://www.fuzix.org/" rel="ugc">Fuzix</a>. GEOS is open
source now, too.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Card draining is when criminals remove gift cards from a store display,
open them in a separate location, and either record the card numbers and
PINs or replace them with a new barcode. The crooks then repair the
packaging, return to a store and place the cards back on a rack. When a
customer unwittingly selects and loads money onto a tampered card, the
criminal is able to access the card online and steal the balance.

<h2 id="twenty-twenty-four">Twenty Twenty-Four</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
For <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/twenty-twenty-three/">last
year’s check-in</a>, I foreshadowed a year of changes for ol’ Dave
Rupert and boy was I not kidding. New job, new car, new pets. But before
we get into all that – for accountability’s sake – let’s check in on my
resolutions from last year and see how I did…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Activate an active lifestyle</strong> - Nope.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write more shitty sci-fi</strong> - Nope.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Draw more</strong> - Nope.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write for other publications</strong> - Yes, I wrote for
<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/">Frontend Masters’ Boost
blog</a> and <a href="https://multipa.ge/">Wilto’s Multipage Version</a>
zine.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Survive the 2024 US Election</strong> - Yes, but what a
disappointment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Make a video game?</strong> - Yes,
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/12/my-little-games-workshop/">I
made and released a few</a> but also went beyond video games a bit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Final score: 50%-ish. That’s better than I expected. What did I do with
the other 50% of my time if I wasn’t crushing it on my SMART goals?
Let’s see…
</p>

<p>
Finding a job dominated the first half of my year. After some ups and
downs I ended up in a good place at Microsoft. There’s a lot of
positives going from self-employment to the corporate world (hey! actual
benefits! stocks even!) but also a lot of organizational bureaucracy
that I’m not used to navigating. I’m happy with the work I’m doing and
feel lucky to get to work on web components each day.
</p>
<p>
My wife and I’s trip to Pittsburgh for Frostapalooza was a big crescendo
for the year. Months and months of practicing culminating in one big
night. It’s hard to describe it other than some kind of nerd-flavored
camp reunion but with guitars instead of computers. We had such a good
time and the amount of music filling our house on a daily basis has
increased ten-fold this year. For that I’m thankful.
</p>
<p>
I often judge years based on if we hit our health insurance deductible
and we hit it again this year. A lot of medium grade background stress:
job hunt stress, new job stress, healthcare stress, election stress,
etc. Thankfully – and I could be basking in the limelight of a good
Christmas holiday and a week off from work – I hardly remember that
stress anymore. It feels like I’ve shedded those layers of anxiety.
</p>
<h2>
Stats for 2024
</h2>
<p>
With all the qualitative out of the way, let’s get more quantitative
about what we did this year…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">52 books</a> - Still in the
book-a-week club. I’m comfortable here but need to mix it up. I’m
becoming cynical when I hear the same ten facts and sociological studies
regurgitated to meet some new popular science zeitgeist. Political
biographies are all the same five liberal or conservative party tent
poles supported by some personal anecdote. I think I’m going to lean
hard into sci-fi “snacks” – short, easy books – for the next year while
supplementing with beefier book recommendations from trusted peers.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/archive/">61 blog posts</a> - Not a
record but I’m happy with that number. Over a post a week is a good pace
for me, doubly so if you consider that I fell off a blogging cliff since
going corporate.
</li>
<li>
9 gunpla - Way down from my 2023 peak.
</li>
<li>
3 releases - <a href="https://mundango.daverupert.com/">Mundango</a>,
<a href="https://pentablaster.daverupert.com/">Pentablaster</a>, and
<a href="https://hardcodesoftskills.daverupert.com/">Hard Code &amp;
Soft Skills</a>. My previous record was one, so this is stellar.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">49 episodes of ShopTalk</a> - I love
hanging out with <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">my friend Chris</a>.
</li>
<li>
3 guest appearances -
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azUEOy8_GHo">Bad @ CSS</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hXmRkM7dsQ">Smashing Hour</a>,
and <a href="https://changelog.com/friends/72">Changelog &amp;
Friends</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A pretty good year for me and it’d be great to maintain that pace next
year. To be totally honest, my actual goal would be to do less next
year. Sounds crazy, I know, numbers should only go up and to the right.
But hear me out… what if they didn’t? Have we considered that option?
</p>
<p>
I didn’t play video games as much as I would have liked to this year, so
I’ll need to remedy that. I’ve got a backlog brewing but I’m having a
good time <em>making</em> games and that’s a time tradeoff I’m okay
with. But from a “great writers read” perspective, I should play more
games. Related, I had to quit late night gaming with the boys because it
effected my sleep and stress levels, but I want to get back to that. AAA
gaming is in a rough state though.
</p>
<h2>
Hopes for 2025
</h2>
<p>
There’s five focus areas I’d like to pursue next year and I already have
traction on most of these feel achievable, But I’ve been wrong about
that in the past.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Seize work opportunities -</strong> It’s been a great first 7
months at Microsoft but I have some big projects shipping in the next
quarter so I need to shift out of my “learning the ropes” mode into a
more melee combat ready position.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hunker down and be creative</strong> - I’m not excited about the
state of the union right now, so I’m going to trust my instinct to
burrow. I’ve got some apps, games, and shitty sci-fi ideas that I’d be
happy to work on instead of doomscrolling the news. I feel okay about
pursuing those ideas rather than getting mired in political headlines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Slow down to 1x mode</strong> - The ability to consume books,
podcasts, and videos at 2x is a super power but I feel a nudge to take
life slower. Slowing down would hopefully increase the time-cost and
make me more discerning about what I choose to consume. The fact that I
view listening at 1x as a challenge tells me I should probably pursue
it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Join a club</strong> - Inspired by the documentary
<a href="https://www.joinordiefilm.com/">Join or Die</a>, I think I need
to join a club and participate in IRL more. Clubs give me an opportunity
to burst my personal/internet bubble and meet people who don’t share my
background, income, or political beliefs. But I can’t even think of what
I’d want to do. Perhaps something hobby-related? Join a lodge? Volunteer
at a food bank? I feel woefully unprepared that I don’t even have the
beginning of an answer here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Understand myself</strong> - Beyond work and side projects, the
biggest project I’ll be undertaking in 2025 is going to be… me. Since
the Summer, I’ve been on a mission to understand myself at a clinical
level. Last year I lost a lot of weight, more than half of it has come
back without much change in diet. I want to know what’s in this mountain
of flesh and bones and brains that God gave me. I want to begin to
untangle the Gordian Knot of Anxiety, Weight, and ADHD. This has meant
seeing a new doctor, getting blood work done, seeing a therapist,
evaluating medication, and a whole lot more. I even made it a “Project”
in Notion so I’d actually follow through on it. My ideal outcome is to
come up with a plan to get through the next five, ten, fifteen, thirty
years and beyond. In the immediate future an unexpected medical malady
has presented itself and I’ll probably have to undergo surgery next
year.
</p>
<h2>
We’ll take a cup of kindness yet, for auld lang syne
</h2>
<p>
I know some had an awful 2024. I’d say mine was hard but good over the
long haul. 2025 seems primed to bring its own existential challenges and
I hope you find shelter. Tech is still in shambles right now but I’m
starting to see hints of the icy job market thawing, but I’m unsure if
it will ever go back to “normal”. And politics… oof. We’re already
seeing the outputs of the self-inflicted chaos machine. Keep in mind
that chaos is the goal; chaos to exhaust and disarm us, to
<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation">flood
the zone with shit</a>. So hold fast to your principles and conserve
energy for the long haul. Keep your hand on the plow and keep your eyes
on the prize. Hold on.

<p>Sometimes you need to run a forked version of Wagtail - for example
if you are waiting for a pull request to get merged. The JavaScript
parts of the package are committed as source files so you need to build

They say babies aren’t supposed to have any screen time (except video
calls) until they’re two, and one of the reasons why is that it can be
overstimulating (preventing them from learning how to cope from
boredom). On this basis I was like, “Oh, well test cricket is fine
then.” Seems that I was hasty – the baby is actually entranced by the
cricket when she notices it on TV 😂

I am not actually parking my baby in front of the TV to watch test
cricket, lol. I am doing all the normal things to interact with my baby
when she’s awake and give her time to take peaceful naps. I am just not
so paranoid about screen time that I refrain from having screens on to
entertain <em>myself</em> in and around parenting…

took me a long time to figure out that when people respond to you on
twitter-like systems they aren’t actually speaking to <i>you,</i>
they’re talking over your shoulder to the masses they imagine are
reading what you posted. Three comments. 1. There are no masses. You can
see this by looking at the stats for each tweet, available on most
platforms. 2. Most users on the social web are trying to get attention
for themselves, the only reason they read the posts is to see if there’s
a place for them to attach their message. 3. A simple tweak to the
software would make it so that only the author of the post being
responded to could see the replies. Then they could RT a reply if they
thought everyone should see it. This would make the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> a lot more useful
imho.</p>

Related to the below quote: I can’t stand fantasy novels that are like
“feudalism but we’re pretending it was good”, lol. I’ve read too many YA
books in particular that want to pretend you can have feudalism without
patriarchy or feudalism <em>with</em> gay rights and I’m just like no… I
cannot suspend my disbelief enough to accept this. Find a way to
incorporate the mediaeval aesthetic you love so much without trying to
glorify literal feudalism.

“Medievalism was an inherently nostalgic movement, and not only because
it was a bedrock of so much children’s literature. People loved it
because it promised a bygone past that never existed. The visual and
written languages of feudalism, despite it being a terrible system, came
into vogue because it wasn’t capitalism. We must remember that the 19th
century saw industrial capitalism at its newest and rawest. Unregulated,
it destroyed every natural resource in sight and subjected people,
including children, to horrific conditions. It still does, but we’re
somewhat used to it by now. The shock’s worn off.”
