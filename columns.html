The stories of the atrocities committed by the Israelis in Gaza are so
horrifying they make me want to puke. I can’t read this shit.

<p>
How will they ever dig themselves out of this again? Will they say that
they didn’t know?
</p>
<p>
And what happens when these soldiers come back home? Will their deeds be
forgotten or will these demons rear their ugly head in years to come?
How will they treat their partners, their children, their neighbours if
they have already shown this level of violence against fellow humans?

<p>I have a fairly large and old
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier">C application</a> that
was written to run on the Mac and Windows. I still use it today on a
relatively modern Macintosh. I wonder if it will soon be possible to
turn this project over to an AI like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity or
some other, to convert it to run on Linux, where it should be able to
run in perpetuity, or at least a lot longer than on the Macintosh. I
would be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to do this work.</p>

<p>Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. It was what I needed
to build <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, it defines
its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features
writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no
character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of.
Defining a new network where if you want to play you’ll need to start
thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can’t be on the
open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like
features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into
copying and pasting into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>, that’s how you know you’re in a silo. If you can use any
writing tool to post to a network, then it <i>is</i> on the web. Pretty
simple. Right now – <i>none</i> of the popular ones qualify. None.</p>

possible for one company to control. All it will take is one popular
podcast client to get the

This is how it worked with podcasting. Steady mission broadcasting, keep
beating the drum, and if it’s the right idea and when it’s the right
time, eventually, it happens. It will be that way too for this layer of
the network, but at this time I don’t own a podcast client, and that’s
the most basic ingredient in this bootstrap, so we wait, and keep
beating the drum.</p>

<h2 id="css-wants-to-be-a-system">CSS wants to be a system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’ve realized something obvious again, this time about CSS; that CSS
wants to be a system. At the core of CSS is a series of cascading rules
and classes marrying and mingling in an elegant symphony of style
application. Dozens and dozens of declarative instructions for painting
pixels on the screen come together in under a millisecond. Sometimes it
creates magic, other times it creates memes.
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/cssisawesome.png" alt="CSS is aweso-me" height="436" width="600" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
<p>
At its core, CSS wants to be a system and – besides its quirky selector
power ranking algorithm – it doesn’t come with one out of the box. CSS
wants you to build a system with it. It wants styles to build up, not
flatten down. It even has
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer">layers</a>
as a feature! You can start small with a
<a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/">minimalist
reset</a> or satisfy your inner typenerd with a
<a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2433">typographic default</a> and
build up from there. You can make your own reset. You can establish your
own naming convention. You can decide to nest or not. You can use IDs.
You can use only-classes. You can even dip a toe into the Shadow DOM if
you crave the dark arts. Hell, I encourage you to use
<code>!important</code> just to feel something.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone wants to conduct that symphony and I understand that. A
nice thing about that CSS is that it’s sharable! Plenty of pre-built
systems exist to let you offload that skill. Through the magic of
copy-and-paste, you too can have high quality design! But don’t mistake
a shortcut as the only valid option. We as humans and technologists like
to compare objects and declare winners – to be kingmakers! – but it’s a
mistake to shop at only one store and only eat meatballs despite the
ubiquitous appeal of Scandinavian design.
</p>
<p>
CSS wants to be a system and it’s not an impossible task to make your
own. Will there be mistakes and bad assumptions? Yeah. Will there be a
<code>junk.css</code> file? Probably. Will you commit CSS crimes?
Indubitably. Is CSS just thousands of key-value pairs with random
collisions implemented in an uneven distribution among a handful of
different browsers? It sure is, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.
</p>
<p>
In all my years of programming I have never loved a language more than
CSS. There’s no other programming language that sparks my brain and
lights up my imagination like CSS. Even after thirty years, there’s a
rush of adrenaline when I see a complex design and I wonder “How am I
going to make that happen?” which leads me to “And how am I going to
make that happen on a phone and older browsers?” That’s the fun part of
the job. And it’s good to know that there are other people out there who
are great at CSS, people who can build up and tear down these systems
with ease, people I can siphon knowledge from and build up my own skills
when a new challenge arises.
</p>
<p>
So cheers to the CSS folks, the tinkerers. Your obsessive animations,
pixel pushing, and system building – both delicate and strong – are fun
to see and experience.

of having the Dems redefine the Dems, how about the people who vote for

important, are not. End arguments about whether the Dems are this color

common interest and leave out everything else. Draw the biggest circle

<p>BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not
staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for
software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook
was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users
are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end
while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral
reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from.
Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in
the 60s,. You would have missed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all
that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the
2020s. That story is far from over.</p>

we need, now, is a system to compete with Twitter. A system as capable
as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted
not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can’t be
guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly.
Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and
quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what’s
needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than
Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.</p>

Godot on iPhone, I forgot to disable it from the TestFlight and it sort
of runs.

<p>
My opinion was that we should block it, but people love it. And in the
last 12 hours I can’t stop thinking of some easy wins to make it at
least passable.

<p>
But perhaps the right thing is still to prevent from running on iPhone
or be destroyed by unhappy users reviews
