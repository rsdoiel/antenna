      <h1>Eavesdropping on Phone Conversations Through Vibrations</h1>

      <p>Researchers have managed to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3734477.3734708">eavesdrop</a> <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/engineering/story/conversations-remotely-detected-cellphone-vibrations-researchers-report">on</a> cell phone voice conversations by using radar to detect vibrations. It&#8217;s more a proof of concept than anything else. The radar detector is only ten feet away, the setup is stylized, and accuracy is poor. But it&#8217;s a start.</p>

      In August 16 2025 I did a keynote with this title on the FrOSCon conference in Bonn, Germany. The room held a few hundred seats and every single one was occupied with people also filling up the stairs and was standing along the walls. Awesome!

      <h1>Vibe Check №39</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/08/vibe-check-39/">Dave Rupert blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>In the middle of the night on the morning of July 4th, a storm parked over the Texas Hill Country and caused the Guadalupe river to rise more than 25 feet in two hours. 135 dead, including dozens of children from summer camps along the river. As a parent, this is the greatest tragedy you could imagine. My heart goes out to the families and friends who lost a little one that week.</p>
<p>As a Texan, this is yet another tragedy in a growing list of rare but forecastable tragedies where federal, state, and local officials failed Texans. I’m tired.</p>
<p>With that event casting a dark shadow on the summer acknowledged, here’s a recap of the last couple months.</p>
<h2>A trip to the Grand Canyon</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/grandcanyon.jpg" width="1200" height="675" alt="the grand canyon near bright angel trailhead"/>
<p>In late June my family stole away for a quick trip to Arizona. My in-laws bought a vacation place in Flagstaff to escape the Phoenix heat. We wanted to check out the new place and figured we could do something American and tag on a quick trip to the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>On the morning of the second day we arrived at Grand Canyon National Park early. We found a good parking spot steps from the canyon’s edge and told our kids to get out and see the view. I’ve been to the canyon a couple times but nothing can truly prepare you for the enormity and pastel grandeur you’re about to see. I enjoyed re-living the first glimpses through my kids’ collective gasps of awe… and after about 10 minutes they were ready to go home and get on their iPads.</p>
<p>We milled around the park for nearly two hours making frequent stops. We stopped at the Devil’s Watchtower on the way out of the park which I’d recommend. All-in-all, we saw something truly remarkable together and my wife and I felt like we checked off a big “This is good for you and you’ll thank us later” parenting checkbox.</p>
<p>The next day the kids rode back with the grandparents to Phoenix while my wife and I took a short detour to go see Sedona. All these years visiting Arizona and I’d never been. We don’t buy into all the energy crystal woo-woo the town advertises, but it’s a beautiful and inspiring piece of America with incredible vistas and sculpture-like red stone mountains. I’d like to spend more time there.</p>
<p>We had a couple days in Phoenix to hang with cousins and celebrated my great-nephew’s second birthday. He’s a cool dude. Mid-week we headed back to Austin to send the kids to summer camp. That week could have been a great one for my wife and I to enjoy an empty house, but I ended up (over-)working all week.</p>
<h2>Trip to San Diego</h2>
<p>The day after the kids got back from summer camp we packed our bags again and headed to San Diego with my wife’s entire family. The next four days were beach days; digging holes, <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/07/always-buy-the-yamaha/">playing guitar</a>, hitting the smashball, dozing off to books, and chasing a toddler around. I stayed in my solar fortress most of the time to avoid my enemy: The Sun.</p>
<p>But it wouldn’t be a Rupert Family Vacation without some calamities! On the second day my son got the worst sunburn of his life; no blisters, just red. He’d survive… but he didn’t know that. I sympathize because I had tons of sunburns as a kid. When it itches, it sucks.</p>
<p>And then there’s my daughter…</p>
<p>At the end of the week we tagged on a couple more days and visited Austin friends who spend the summer in Encinitas. Our daughters who have been besties since daycare slotted right back into their brand of silly lip sync routines and giggling. To soak up more beach time, we hiked down the cliff to Beacons beach and set up some chairs in the rocks while the girls boogie boarded their hearts out having the time of their life until…</p>
<p>My daughter comes to us holding her arm crying. When she reached for the loose boogie board leash she slammed her hand down and said she felt something fold over her arm and sting her. We walked over to the lifeguard stand and got the bad news, “That looks like a sting ray.”</p>
<p>The untold irony here is all week long my daughter was telling anyone who would listen that her two greatest fears about the ocean were: getting caught in a rip current and getting stung by a stingray. We tried to diffuse those fears but she kept talking about it. And here we were, the prophecy came true.</p>
<p>“I can call a lifeguard truck to meet you at the top of the hill but you have to take care of it now.” Uh-oh. That’s when I knew we were in a serious situation. We said no to the lifeguard truck but needed to submerge her arm in 115ºF water (hot tap water) for 30-90 minutes to neutralize the proteins in the venom. We hiked back up the cliff and walked the three blocks to the house. Tears the whole way.</p>
<p>After a couple hours everything was sore but stable. She’s a tough kid and that was a difficult situation. What a champ.</p>
<h2>We survived: A skunk attack</h2>
<p>Late one night my daughter (who has a sensitive smeller) said “Something smells like skunk!” I caught a faint whiff of it and thought “It’s probably some neighbors smoking weed” and opened the back door to assess the situation and in rushed my two mutts, one of them covered in skunk juice! Yikes!</p>
<p>We did our best to corral them to the garage where we washed them with an internet-recommended concoction. I can’t even describe the degree to how awful this was. The smell infiltrated our house and sulfur burned in the eyes and nose all night long. We spent the next day Fabreezing and disposing of any rogue object the smell might have transferred to: the backdoor mat, collars, one kids sandal, the dead skunk near the trash… Ah, gross.</p>
<p>A skunk attack is not a situation you can control (dogs being dogs) but it’s not one I want to relive any time soon.</p>
<h2>Another school year begins</h2>
<p>This week we strap ourselves into the bobsled and push the sled downhill on an out-of-control course where the breaks do nothing and it sends us crashing into Christmas. Feeling optimistic about this year, but there will be more homework for both our kids which is historically not a strength we operate in as a family. Lord help us.</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Here you go, number perverts. All the dopamine deep-dives and drive-thrus I collected over the summer.</p>
<h3>🧠 <strong>Learning</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sovietology -  Based on a space race analogy I heard at work I made a deep-dive on the Soviet space program which led me to Sovietology and trying to understand how the Soviet central planning system (“cybernetics”) failed its fellow comrades.</li>
<li>ADHD - Been watching a lot of videos on ADHD and trying to understand it more</li>
<li>Minimalism and decluttering - ADHD videos lead me into minimalism and decluttering videos and it makes a difference if you view clutter as stimulus. If I could just get the rest of the family on board…</li>
<li>Drawing - I’d like to be good at drawing, so I spent a lot of learning about shapes, perspectives, sketching, and more</li>
<li>Studio Setups - Because ShopTalk has a YouTube now, I’ve become a little bit obsessed with optimal YouTube setups but I haven’t done anything… yet</li>
<li>Budgeting - After all our summer trips and feeling spent (physically and fiscally), I sat down one weekend and did some budgeting and ingested a lot on the subject.</li>
</ul>
<h3>❤️‍🩹 Health and wellness</h3>
<p>A lot of updates here but still untangling the Gordion knot of stress, anxiety, weight, and ADHD. I’m talking to doctors and making some changes and I believe they are helping even if it’s not fully realized yet.</p>
<h3>📝 <strong>Blogging</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/42C0Bx1">System Collapse</a> <small>★★★</small> - The last book in the Murderbot Diaries. This one was a slog, to be honest. The action at the end was good but the crescendo right before that, the big group project… was disappointing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3SZMflH">The Wrong Stuff</a> <small>★★★★★</small> - A great book about the relative failure of the Soviet Cosmonaut program compared to NASA even though the USSR had many “firsts” they did so without regard to the safety and stability of their program and rockets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/43qaO1z">Space Battleship Yamato</a> <small>★★★½</small> - Got this from Kinokuniya to satiate my retro space manga obsession. It delivered on the space opera promise but had a lot of the early-days manga pitfalls. That wasn’t a deal-breaker for me but could be for some I’m sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/447GMzL">Red Plenty</a> <small>★★★</small> - A historical fictional narrative about site managers and scientists under Khrushchev’s rule. It paints a nice picture about the economics (“cybernetics”) and central planning of that time, but sometimes the narrative was too thick (like Dostoyevsky thick). Reaffirming I’m a non-fiction guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3TZuW4Y">ADHD and Us</a> <small>★★★★</small> - A good book for people in a relationship where one or more partners are neurodiverse. Recommended by my psychiatrist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4o98ggp">A Different Kind of Power</a> <small>★★★★½</small> - Jacinda Arden’s autobiography is a bit hard to read because of how calm, cool, collected, and capable she seems compared to her American contemporary Donald Trump who was nothing but chaos and incompetence.</p>

<h3>📺 Media</h3>
<p>Saw some good movies this period… which is rare.</p>
<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>28 Years Later - Good movie. Lots of zombie dong, or… it’s more accurate to say one notably huge alpha hog.</li>
<li>Superman - I enjoyed a DC movie; a Superman movie! Unbelievable. Has James Gunn saved the DC cinematic universe? Hopefully.</li>
<li>K-Pop Demon Slayers (Netflix) - An wonderful animated film and you can see the foundation of fun from the creative and technical teams come out. Great job Sony Animation.</li>
<li>Fantastic Four: First Steps - The art direction in this movie is incredible… fantastic even. A real cinematic feat. Worth seeing in theaters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TV</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to Wrexham S4 (Hulu) - Up the town. Unreal ending.</li>
<li>Murderbot (Apple TV) - Loved the books… and uh… you can watch the show, if you want to, it’s fine I guess.</li>
<li>Mythic Quest S5 (Apple TV) - Not for everyone but feels algorithmically generated for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Streaming</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Game Changer S7 (Dropout) - This season of Game Changer has managed to outdo itself and that’s an incredible a feat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anime</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Suite Gundam Gquuuuuux (Prime)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Podcasts</strong>
I purged my podcasts and abandoned some of my favorites (like The Adventure Zone), but I think I’m better for it. Now I can focus on the ones I enjoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Books Could Kill…</li>
<li>Maintenance Phase</li>
<li>Living Planet</li>
<li>ATXplained</li>

<h3>🤖 Gunpla</h3>
<p>This hobby isn’t dead yet! I’ve got five or so in the backlog but three of them are practice kits for a larger project I have in mind. In service to that project, I tried my hand at anime cel-shading an Entry Grade RX-78-2. I tried half-a-dozen application techniques and didn’t find a way that I liked. I need to do more research and keep trying.</p>
<h3>🌱 Digital Gardening</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made my homepage tie-dyed for funsies. It’s based off the accent color and changes a bit every day.</li>
<li>Built some automation for my vibechecks, will hopefully post more later.</li>
<li>Added more pentatonic scales to <a href="https://pentablaster.daverupert.com/">Pentablaster</a>… it’s in a messy state right now but I wanted to play with Ethiopian scales. I have plans to fix it up.</li>
<li>Regenerated cover images for my <a href="/stories">stories</a> page using Midjourney. I think I did better this time around.</li>
</ul>
<h3>👾 <strong>Video games</strong></h3>
<p>Mostly puzzles, but I did go reopen the door to a city builder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cities Skylines - I hooked up SteamLink to play my PC games from the shed inside the house on my Mac. Trying to play enough Cities Skylines 1 to justify buying Cities Skylines 2.</li>
<li>Balatro - The joker addiction continues. Feel like if I beat one more stake I’ll be happy and can quit.</li>
<li><a href="https://cluesbysam.com/">Clues by Sam</a> - A daily caper! If you’re not playing this you should be.</li>
<li><a href="https://inkwellgames.com/games/stars">Stars</a> - A sudoku-like puzzler from Inkwell Games</li>
<li><a href="https://inkwellgames.com/games/fields">Fields</a> - A difficult pattern game from Inkwell which I first thought was impossible but now feel like I’m getting the hang of it.</li>

      <p>I would like to get on the record. </p>
<ol>
<li>The only <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22billionaire-proof%22">billionaire-proof</a> social network will be based on RSS. </li>
<li>The shortest path to being <a href="https://billionaireproof.com/">billionaire-proof</a> for Bluesky is well thought-out inbound and outbound RSS. </li>
</ol>
<p>We're going to have some interop based on RSS not too far down the road. A network that will only require an RSS feed for entry. It's what we should've built in 2006 and didn't. </p>

      <h1>2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-xobaque">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-15-an-opt-in-search-engine-xobaque">2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing a search engine that doesn&rsquo;t crawl the web.
I called it <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/xobaque.git/">Xobaque</a>.
You can test it <a href="http://search.transjovian.org/search">here</a>.
(I&rsquo;m currently having problems with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt and therefore this is HTTP only, for the moment.)</p>

<p>Xobaque is entirely opt-in and push based: web admins have total control over what they want to have indexed. The drawback is that web admins have to upload their pages!</p>

<p>I foresee this to be a solution for sites that don&rsquo;t have good local search, like <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a>, or communities, like all the blogs on <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>. If we want to rely less on big search engines, we have to provide our own.</p>

<p>Technically, Xobaque is writen on top of the <a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html#sorting_by_auxiliary_function_results">SQLite FTS5 Extension</a>. This extension does all the heavy lifting: indexing, searching, ranking, highlighting, snippets, boolean operators. Boolean operators! Do you remember those? Good times. The extension is quite amazing, really.</p>

<p>What Xobaque provides is the command-line interface and the web interface. Right now, the command-line interface has a command to initialize an empty database and a command to upload a single page.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of how to use this in a script.</p>

<p>My homepage:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
cd /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki
for line in (/home/oddmu/oddmu list)
  set --local info (string split &quot;	&quot; $line)
  set --local name (string replace --regex '^/home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/' '' $info[1] | string replace --regex '.md' '')
  set --local title $info[2]
  /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
    -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
    -base &quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/&quot; \
    -local &quot;$name&quot; \
    -title &quot;$title&quot; \
    -filename &quot;$name.md&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>(The index file grows from nearly zero to about 40M.)</p>

<p>Emacs Wiki:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for path in (grep --files-without-match '^#FILE ' /home/alex/emacswiki/git/* /home/alex/emacswiki/git/.*)
  set --local name (string replace '/home/alex/emacswiki/git/' '' $path)
  set --local title (string replace '_' ' ' $name)
  /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
    -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
    -base &quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/&quot; \
    -local &quot;$name&quot; \
    -title &quot;$title&quot; \
    -filename &quot;/home/alex/emacswiki/git/$name&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>(The index file grows from about 40M to 290M.)</p>

<p>The alternative to uploading via the command-line, I think, will be feed ingestion. Web site owners can send their feeds to Xobaque and it will index the entries in the feed. If the entries have the full text, that&rsquo;s great. If they have an excerpt, that works, too. You opt-in with whatever you provide.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that this will be a system for friends only, so the upload will be protected by a login. Otherwise, people will be able to upload other people&rsquo;s sites and that violates the opt-in idea.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Xobaque">#Xobaque</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-08-15</strong>. I have that vague idea that it would process OPML files like the <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/opml.xml">Planet Emacslife OPML</a> or the three RPG Planet OPML files, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/indie.opml">Indie</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/osr.opml">OSR</a> and <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/other.opml">Other</a>. From the OPML files Xobaque would know a bunch of feeds which it could then use for updates. I have written <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/planet-jupiter.git/">Planet Jupiter</a>, so I know that from 80% to 90% is handling blogs that are down and from 90% to 100% it&rsquo;s all about fiddling with the markup… There&rsquo;s also the question of consent. So perhaps one would have to start a new list of feeds for those people who explicitly consent. And if by chance that covers all the feeds on Planet Emacslife or RPG Planet that&rsquo;d be a reason to laugh and party! 🎉</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-17</strong>. Adding feeds and collections of feeds (via OPML files) works, now. 🎉</p>

<p>The feed import from the net should use ETags and If-Modified-Since headers if possible, but the convenience functions of bot the feed and the OPML library don’t provide this, so I’ll have to roll my own. And then think of parallelising the requests. Go channels ahoy! 😬</p>

<p>And then a web UI for uploads and accounts? 🥺</p>

      <h1>Bottomless Subtleties</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/bottomless-subtleties/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Jason Fried writes in his post <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/knives-and-battleships-ac8dc8c2" >“Knives and battleships”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific tools and familiar ingredients combined in different ratios, different molds, for different purposes. Like a baker working from the same tight set of pantry ingredients to make a hundred distinct recipes. You wouldn&#39;t turn to them and say &quot;enough with the butter, flour, sugar, baking powder, and eggs already!&quot;</p>
<p>Getting the same few things right in different ways is a career&#39;s worth of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mastery comes from a lifetime of putting together the basics in different combinations. </p>
<p>I think of Beethoven’s 5th and its famous “short-short-short-long” motif. The entire symphony is essentially the same core idea repeated and developed relentlessly! The same four notes (da-da-da-DAH!) moving between instruments, changing keys, etc.</p>
<p>Beethoven took something basic — a four note motif — and extracted an enormous set of variations. Its genius is in illustrating how much can be explored and expressed within constraints (rather than piling on “more and more” novel stuff).</p>
<p>Back to Jason’s point: the simplest building blocks in any form — music, code, paint, cooking — implemented with restraint can be combined in an almost infinite set of pleasing ways.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/precarious-modern-computing/" >Devine noted</a> (and I constantly link back to): we haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with less.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before starting the upgrade, make sure your <code>/boot</code> partition is at least 768 MB in size, and has about 300 MB free. If your system does not have a separate /boot partition, there should be nothing to do. &ndash; <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/release-notes/issues.html#ensure-boot-has-enough-free-space">5.1.5. Ensure /boot has enough free space</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am missing 34M for boot!</p>

<pre><code># df -h | grep boot
/dev/sda2               734M  141M  540M  21% /boot
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m ignoring this for the moment. :(</p>

<p>Deleting files from the last upgrade:</p>

<pre><code>find /etc '(' -name '*.dpkg-*' -o -name '*.ucf-*' -o -name '*.merge-error' ')' -exec rm '{}' ';'
</code></pre>

<p>Purging config files:</p>

<pre><code>apt purge '?narrow(?config-files)'
</code></pre>

<p>Removing old stuff and making space:</p>

<pre><code>apt autoremove
apt clean
</code></pre>

<p>Lots of reading.
Replacing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Types: deb
URIs: https://deb.debian.org/debian
Suites: trixie trixie-updates
Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg

Types: deb
URIs: https://security.debian.org/debian-security
Suites: trixie-security
Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
</code></pre>

<p>And then:</p>

<pre><code>apt update
apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
apt full-upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m ignoring the warnings about directories the upgrade process was unable to delete:
The ones I did check contained scripts and the like.
I would have felt OK to delete directories with generated files, or files modified by me.
But this? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Conflicts I ran into:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/exim4/conf.d/main/03_exim4-config_tlsoptions
</code></pre>

<p>This file showed up as a conflict but it was nothing I remember doing. Install the maintainer version!</p>

<pre><code>/etc/systemd/journald.conf
</code></pre>

<p>I had added <code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code> and <code>MaxRetentionSec=7d</code> because I didn&rsquo;t want to give the log files that much space. So I redid those changes for the maintainer version.</p>

<pre><code>/etc/pam.d/login
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what this is about. Did I comment <code>session    optional   pam_motd.so motd=/run/motd.dynamic</code>? Perhaps I did. Let&rsquo;s go with the maintainer version and see if that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p>To do after the upgrade:</p>

<pre><code>rm /var/log/wtmp* /var/log/lastlog* /var/log/btmp*
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that the sway background image is back.
I had to add a line at the very end of my config file:</p>

<pre><code>#
# Debian
#
# Include all the extra config
include /etc/sway/config.d/*
# Override the background
output * bg &quot;#333333&quot; solid_color
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2025-08-11</strong>. The things that aren&rsquo;t working on the server:</p>

<p>Getting Node.js installed was a pain. It has a separate sources list from NodeSource. ☹️</p>

<p><em>Solved, hopefully.</em></p>

<p>Services that rely on Monit starting a Mojolicious app via Hypnotoad no longer work.
Monit claims &ldquo;File &lsquo;/home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/hypnotoad&rsquo; does not exist&rdquo;. ☹️</p>

<p><em>Rewriting the wrappers as systemd services.</em></p>

<p>My local Emacs can no longer connect to the server via Tramp. It just hangs. <code>ssh</code> and <code>mosh</code> still work, the config files are unchanged. ☹️</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-12</strong>. Ah, if I start Gnome, my old enemy is back: <code>localsearch-3</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at <a href="2018-05-07_Laptop_Fan">2018-05-07 Laptop Fan</a> and trying to disable to crawling:</p>

<pre><code># gsettings get org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files crawling-interval 
-2
# gsettings get org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files enable-monitors
false
</code></pre>

<p>The old <code>tracker</code> package is now a transitional package that depends on <code>tinysparql</code>. Trying to <code>apt remove</code> either of them will attempt to remove <code>gnome-session gnome-sushi tinysparql xdg-desktop-portal-gnome gnome-session-xsession nautilus tracker-extract</code>. Fuuuck.</p>

<p>Looking at the man pages, I get the feeling that <code>localsearch-daemon(3)</code> is what I need kill the processes. But how to disable them?</p>

<pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .service
/etc/systemd/user/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-control-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-writeback-3.service
/usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
/var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/localsearch-3.service.dsh-also
/var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
</code></pre>

<p>OK, some candidates!</p>

<p>The manual page for <code>localsearch-3(1)</code> mentioned that it was started by a <code>.desktop</code> file.
But perhaps I can just disable the service?</p>

<p>Maybe not.</p>

<pre><code># systemctl --user disable localsearch-3
The following unit files have been enabled in global scope. This means
they will still be started automatically after a successful disablement
in user scope:
localsearch-3.service
# sudo systemctl disable localsearch-3.service
Failed to disable unit: Unit localsearch-3.service does not exist
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to do.</p>

<pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .desktop
/etc/xdg/autostart/localsearch-3.desktop
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/localsearch-3.0/extract-modules/libextract-desktop.so
/usr/share/localsearch3/extract-rules/10-desktop.rule
/usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s that first file. But how to disable <em>that</em>?</p>

<p>Ah, I am not alone. With that info I found <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=299586">a discussion on the Arch Linux forum</a> with various strategies being discussed. I will try to change the <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled</code> line to <code>false</code> and see whether that helps. And while I am at it, I will also change <code>X-GNOME-HiddenUnderSystemd</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and I can no longer edit remote files with my Emacs at home. It just hangs there and waits for the prompt or something, I guess.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and that annoying Gnome keyring? <a href="https://www.xmodulo.com/disable-gnome-keyring-linux-desktop.html">How to disable GNOME Keyring on GNOME desktop</a> by Dan Nanni suggests to copy the <code>gnome-keyring-*.desktop</code> files from <code>/etc/xdg/autostart</code> to <code>~/.config/autostart</code> and append the line <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false</code> to each one.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-14</strong>. The chkrootkit mail I get every day has a lot of useless information. One looks like <em>all</em> the dotfiles? Ugh.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-17</strong>. Ah, at the very end of the <code>chkrootkit</code> email is the answer:</p>

<pre><code>cp -a /var/log/chkrootkit/log.today /var/log/chkrootkit/log.expected
</code></pre>

      <p>Cory Doctorow bends over backwards to praise the creators of Bluesky, but also explains why it would be nuts to trust them. Bluesky is the least billionaire-proof system imaginable and they keep saying how they <em>are</em> billionaire-proof. What's so admirable about that Cory (sarcasm, sorry).  And if it weren't for the character limit, I could say how much I admire Cory (I really do, not just saying that, he's stood up for the right things, most of the time and the times he hasn't it's probably just because I haven't had a chance to bend his ear. 😀</p>

I'm working a few hours a day on the integration of writing and timelines built around feeds. Instead of using Bluesky or Mastodon, with their limits, we use WordPress for storage. It has none of their limits, has a high performance open source server back-end, debugged complete API, it's not without problems, but far ahead of where the competition is in terms are reliablity and ease of implementation. <i>To be part of this network, all you need is an RSS feed. </i>Seems pretty openly billionaire-proof wouldn't you say.

<p><a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/connection-refused-status-400-apache-mod-md-and-mod-proxy-fail2ban/240429">On the forum</a>, I learned that Let&rsquo;s Encrypt currently has one primary and 4 secondary centres; the primary and all but one of the secondaries must succeed. So I though, I must be blocking these at the firewall. Let&rsquo;s try to unban them all:</p>

<pre><code># fail2ban-client unban --all
663
</code></pre>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-15-lets-encrypt-1.jpg" alt="The graph shows the number of banned addresses and address ranges dropping from around 700 to zero." /></p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t help. 😭</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s the banger: When I run <code>iptables --list</code> I see a ton of entries in the <code>f2b-butlerian-jihad</code> chain! 😨</p>

<p>This is not good. At one point, the two must have gone out of sync.</p>

      I want a new ChatGPT mode where I drive the work, not the bot. I don't want it giving me answers to questions I didn't ask, because it's trying to navigate in my mind, and it has no information about that, so it's basically always wrong. I keep looking back on problems that took hours to solve because it drove the process and I went along with it. I want to tell it in advance to not make suggestions, to just answer questions. I call this "behave like a computer, not a human." Because it's a fanstastic computer, but not a good partner.

      <p>Conrad Irwin has an article on the Zed blog <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software" >“Why LLMs Can&#39;t Really Build Software”</a>. He says it boils down to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the distinguishing factor of effective engineers is their ability to build and maintain clear mental models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a mental model of what <em>you want</em> to do</li>
<li>Building a mental model of what the <em>code does</em></li>
<li>Reducing the difference between the two</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s kind of an interesting observation about how we (as humans)  problem solve vs. how we use LLMs to problem solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>With LLMs, you stuff more and more information into context until it (hopefully) has enough to generate a solution.</li>
<li>With your brain, you tweak, revise, or simplify your mental model more and more until the solution presents itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>One adds information — complexity you might even say — to solve a problem. The other eliminates it.</p>
<p>You know what that sort of makes me think of? NPM driven development.</p>
<p>Solving problems with LLMs is like solving front-end problems with NPM: the “solution” comes through installing more and more things — adding more and more context, i.e. more and more packages.</p>
<ul>
<li>LLM: Problem? Add more context. </li>
<li>NPM: Problem? There’s a package for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast that with a solution that comes through simplification. You don’t add more context. You simplify your mental model so you need less to solve a problem — if you solve it at all, perhaps you eliminate the problem entirely!</p>
<p>Rather than install another package to fix what ails you, you simplify your mental model which often eliminates the problem you had in the first place; thus eliminating the need to solve any problem at all, or to add any additional context or complexity (or dependency).</p>
<p>As I’m typing this, I’m thinking of that image of the evolution of the Raptor engine, where it evolved in simplicity:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/more-context-bro-rocket-1.jpg" width="540" height="339" alt="Photograph of three versions of the raptor engine, each one getting progressively simplified in mechanical parts." />

</p><p>This stands in contrast to my working with LLMs, which often wants more and more context from me to get to a generative solution:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/more-context-bro-rocket-2.jpg" width="540" height="339" alt="Photograph of three versions of the raptor engine, but the image is reversed showing the engine get progressively complicated in mechanical parts over time. Each engine represents an LLM prompt." />

</p><p>I know, I know. There’s probably a false equivalence here. This entire post started as <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com" >a note</a> and I just kept going. This post itself needs further thought and simplification. But that’ll have to come in a subsequent post, otherwise this never gets published lol.</p>

      <h1>2025-08-15 The liberal democrats in Switzerland</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-fdp">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-15-the-liberal-democrats-in-switzerland">2025-08-15 The liberal democrats in Switzerland</h1>

<p>One of the founding parties of the current state are the liberal democrats. My limited understanding of the situation is that they were all about liberty – against the ancient régime (the semi-feudal system before Napoleon and the French revolution helped us get rid of them) and against the church. My wife still remembers the small-scale feuding betweens catholics and protestants. My father in law still remembers that uneasy peace: going to school as a protestant in a mostly catholic village. His father was very much engaged in that struggle against the powers of the church.</p>

<p>These days, those battles are no longer that important. And so the liberal democrats turned to economic freedom. They turned into the part of bankers and industrialist. They rode that neoliberal devil. And now as it is faltering, a new change is afoot. Sadly, when they last looked for leadership, the only candidate who stood up was a xenophobe. But we already have a party of racists! The Swiss people&rsquo;s party. These people were originally more of a farmer&rsquo;s party but under the influence of billionaire Blocher they also rode that neoliberal horse. Down with taxes! Up with the banks! Down with regulation! Down with the European Union! Yeah, Blocher was a good demagogue.</p>

<p>The liberal democrats liked what they heard about taxes and didn&rsquo;t mind kicking out foreigners and so they worked together. But you know how it is: When in doubt, people prefer the clearer message. And on the non-demagoguery front, there was a strange thing that happened with the Green party. Like in many places, they had a left wing and a right wing. And their differences became so large, that the split! The Greens are now &ldquo;melon green&rdquo;: green on the outside and red on the inside. They work well with the socialists. The right wingers were the green liberals. The rational voice calling for a lowering of taxes.</p>

<p>A while ago there was a session of the liberal democrats where one of the delegates present was muttering against some decisions in favour of the environment. &ldquo;If we continue like this we might as well join the liberal greens!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, and that&rsquo;s the dilemma. Those who want less taxes and don&rsquo;t mind kicking foreigners around can join the Swiss people&rsquo;s party. Those who want less taxes and still save at least some of the planet can join the liberal greens.</p>

<p>Naturally, one of the more famous members of the Anti-Vaccination party, whose star has not been rising in recent months, wants to join the liberal democrats again.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how far this party has fallen.</p>

Then I realized that sometimes in software I'm climbing a cliff that's too tall to climb in one session, so I have to carry a tent and backpack with food and water. I hate this kind of programming more than anything, because it comes from not having a high-level enough runtime to support me in big corner turns. Or not having invested enough time in creating a layer I can build on. Anyway I'm in the middle of one of those corner-turns now. Hell has not broken loose although at times it looks like it might have. I'm being sure not to create another mess that needs to be cleaned up in the future. Not stressful, but I'd rather be doing anything but this. :-)

<p><a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Ashigaru" title="@Ashigaru@dice.camp">@Ashigaru</a> mentioned how D&amp;D 3.0 was really important for him at the time and <a class="account" href="https://metalhead.club/@dereisenhofer" title="@dereisenhofer@metalhead.club">@dereisenhofer</a> mentioned him playing DSA (Das Schwarze Auge, i.e. The Dark Eye). And I thought about my gaming history.</p>

<p>I moved from The Dark Eye 1st ed that I played as a kid and again as a 15-year old to AD&amp;D 1st ed when I was around 16 because a Canadian exchange student said it was the original and obviously it had to better. Some mere months later my group switched to the new AD&amp;D 2nd ed because obviously new had to be better. And then my interest waned.</p>

<p>Years later, I got into M20 because of the blogs, and my players wanted to play the just released D&amp;D 3.5 because obviously new had to better. With the switch to D&amp;D 4 I put my foot down and went with Labyrinth Lord – and lost almost all my players. 🥺</p>

<p>But I found new ones and kept on playing. So for me, D&amp;D 3.5 stands for those special years just before the OSR blogs took off, when I came back to the game.</p>

      Today, flanked by California&#8217;s Democratic elected officials and union leaders, California governor Gavin Newsom responded to Trump&#8217;s attempt to strongarm the Texas legislature into redistricting the state to give Trump the five additional congressional representatives to which he feels &#8220;entitled.&#8221; Newsom announced that California will hold a special election on November 4 for voters to consider redistricting their state temporarily if Texas redistricts, so that California can neutralize Trump&#8217;s rigging of the state of Texas.

      What today’s workaround does is process and display the blood oxygen sensor data on your watch’s paired iPhone, rather than on the Apple Watch itself. That, apparently, is what the new US Customs ruling holds does not violate Masimo’s patent.

In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/07/the-selling-of-ai.html"><i>The Selling Of AI</i></a> I compared the market strategy behind the AI bubble to the drug-dealer's algorithm, "the first one's free". As the drugs take hold of an addict, three things happen:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Their price rises.</li>
  <li>The addict needs bigger doses for the same effect.</li>
  <li>Their deleterious effects kick in. </li>
</ul>
As expected, this what is happening to AI. Follow me below the fold for the details.<br />

Ethan Ding starts <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed"><i>tokens are getting more expensive</i></a> thus:<br />
<blockquote>
imagine you start a company knowing that consumers won't pay more than $20/month. fine, you think, classic vc playbook - charge at cost, sacrifice margins for growth. you've done the math on cac, ltv, all that. but here's where it gets interesting: you've seen the <a href="https://a16z.com/llmflation-llm-inference-cost/">a16z chart showing llm costs dropping 10x every year</a>.<br />
<br />
so you think: i'll break even today at $20/month, and when models get 10x cheaper next year, boom - 90% margins. the losses are temporary. the profits are inevitable.<br />
<br />
it’s so simple a VC associate could understand it:<br />
<br />
year 1: break even at $20/month<br />
<br />
year 2: 90% margins as compute drops 10x<br />
<br />
year 3: yacht shopping<br />
<br />
it’s an understandable strategy: "the cost of LLM inference has dropped by a factor of 3 every 6 months, we’ll be fine”

The first problem with this is that only <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/only-8-of-americans-would-pay-extra-for-ai-according-to-zdnet-aberdeen-research/">8% of the users</a> will pay the $20/month, the 92% use it for free (<a href="https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-consumer-ai/">Menlo Ventures</a> thinks it is only 3%). Indeed it turns out that an entire government agency only pays $1/year, as Samuel Axon reports in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-announces-deal-to-offer-chatgpt-to-us-executive-branch-at-almost-no-cost/"><i>US executive branch agencies will use ChatGPT Enterprise for just $1 per agency</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The workers will have access to ChatGPT Enterprise, a type of account that includes access to frontier models and cutting-edge features with relatively high token limits, alongside a more robust commitment to data privacy than general consumers of ChatGPT get. ChatGPT Enterprise has been trialed over the past several months at several corporations and other types of large organizations.<br />
<br />
The workers will also have unlimited access to advanced features like Deep Research and Advanced Voice Mode for a 60-day period. After the one-year trial period, the agencies are under no obligation to renew.
</blockquote>
Did I mention the drug-dealer's algorithm?<br />
<br />
But that's not one of the two problems Ding is discussing.  He is wondering why instead of yacht shopping, <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">this happened</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
but after 18 months, margins are about as negative as they’ve ever been… windsurf’s been sold for parts, and claude code has had to roll back their original unlimited $200/mo tier this week.<br />
<br />
companies are still bleeding. the models got cheaper - gpt-3.5 costs 10x less than it used to. but somehow the margins got worse, not better.
</blockquote>
What the A16Z graph shows is the rapid reduction in cost per token of <i>each specific model</i>, but also the rapid pace at which each specific model is supplanted by a better successor. Ding notes that users want the <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">current best model</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
gpt-3.5 is 10x cheaper than it was. it's also as desirable as a flip phone at an iphone launch.<br />
<br />
when a new model is released as the SOTA, 99% of the demand immediatley shifts over to it. consumers expect this of their products as well.

Which causes the first of the two problems Ding is describing. His graph shows that the cost per token of the model users actually want is <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">approximately constant</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the 10x cost reduction is real, but only for models that might as well be running on a commodore 64.<br />
<br />
so this is the first faulty pillar of the “costs will drop” strategy: demand exists for "the best language model," period. and the best model always costs about the same, because that's what the edge of inference costs today.<br />
...<br />
when you're spending time with an ai—whether coding, writing, or thinking—you always max out on quality. nobody opens claude and thinks, "you know what? let me use the shitty version to save my boss some money." we're cognitively greedy creatures. we want the best brain we can get, especially if we’re balancing the other side with our time.
</blockquote>
So the business model based on the cost of inference dropping 10x per year doesn't work. But that isn't the worst of the two problems. While it is true that the cost in dollars of a set number of tokens is roughly constant, the number of tokens a user needs <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">is not</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
while it's true each generation of frontier model didn't get more expensive per token, something else happened. something worse. the number of tokens they consumed went absolutely nuclear.<br />
<br />
chatgpt used to reply to a one sentence question with a one sentence reply. now deep research will spend 3 minutes planning, and 20 minutes reading, and another 5 minutes re-writing a report for you while o3 will just run for 20-minutes to answer “hello there”.<br />
<br />
the explosion of rl and test-time compute has resulted in something nobody saw coming: the length of a task that ai can complete has been doubling every six months. what used to return 1,000 tokens is now returning 100,000.

Users started by trying fairly simpple tasks on fairly simple models. The power users, the ones in the 8%, were happy with the results and graduated to trying complex questions on frontier models. So their consumption of tokens <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">exploded</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
today, a 20-minute "deep research" run costs about $1. by 2027, we'll have agents that can run for 24 hours straight without losing the plot… combine that with the static price of the frontier? that’s a ~$72 run. per day. per user. with the ability to run multiple asynchronously.<br />
<br />
once we can deploy agents to run workloads for 24 hours asynchronously, we won't be giving them one instruction and waiting for feedback. we'll be scheduling them in batches. entire fleets of ai workers, attacking problems in parallel, burning tokens like it's 1999.<br />
<br />
obviously - and i cannot stress this enough - a $20/month subscription cannot even support a user making a single $1 deep research run a day. but that's exactly what we're racing toward. every improvement in model capability is an improvement in how much compute they can meaningfully consume at a time.
</blockquote>
The power users were on Anthropic's unlimited plan, so <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">this happened</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
users became api orchestrators running 24/7 code transformation engines on anthropic's dime. the evolution from chat to agent happened overnight. 1000x increase in consumption. phase transition, not gradual change.<br />
<br />
so anthropic rolled back unlimited. they could've tried $2000/month, but the lesson isn't that they didn't charge enough, it’s that there’s no way to offer unlimited usage in this new world under any subscription model.<br />
<br />
it's that <b>there is no flat subscription price that works in this new world</b>.
</blockquote>
Ed Zitron's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/"><i>AI Is A Money Trap</i></a> looks at the effect of Anthropic figuring this out on Cursor:<br />
<blockquote>
the single-highest earning generative AI company that isn’t called OpenAI or Anthropic, and the highest-earning company built on top of (primarily) Anthopic’s technology.
</blockquote>
When Anthropic decided to reduce the rate at which they were losing money, Cursor's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">business model collapsed</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In mid-June — a few weeks after Anthropic introduced “<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/service-tiers">priority tiers</a>” that required companies to pay up-front and guarantee a certain throughput of tokens and increased costs on using prompt caching, a big part of AI coding — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/">Cursor massively changed the amount its users could use the product, and introduced a $200-a-month subscription</a>.<br />
</blockquote>
Cursor's customers <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">weren't happy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cursor’s product is now worse. People are going to cancel their subscriptions. Its annualized revenue will drop, and its ability to raise capital will suffer as a direct result. It will, regardless of this drop in revenue, have to pay the cloud companies what it owes them, as if it had the business it used to. I have spoken to a few different people, including a company with an enterprise contract, that are either planning to cancel or trying to find a way out of their agreements with Cursor.
</blockquote>
So Cursor, which was already losing money, will have less income and higher costs. They are the largest company buit on the AI major's platforms, despite only earning "around $42 million a month", and Anthropic just showed that their business model doesn't work. This isn't a good sign for the generative AI industry and thus, as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">Zitron explains in details</a>, for the persistence of the AI bubble.<br />
<br />
Ding explains why OpenAi's $1/year/agency deal is all about with similar deals at the <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">big banks</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
this is what devins all in on. they’ve recently announced their citi and goldman sachs parterships, deploying devin to 40,000 software engineers at each company. at $20/mo this is a $10M project, but here’s a question: would you rather have $10M of ARR from goldman sachs or $500m from prosumer devleopers?<br />
<br />
the answer is obvious: six-month implementations, compliance reviews, security audits, procurement hell mean that that goldman sachs revenue is hard to win — but once you win it it’s impossible to churn. you only get those contracts if the singular decision maker at the bank is staking their reputation on you — and everyone will do everything they can to make it work.<br />
</blockquote>
Once the organization is hooked on the drug, they don't care what it costs because both real and political switching costs are intolerable, <br />
<h3>Bigger doses are needed</h3>
Anjli Raval reports that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04a83e0d-0128-4f59-9835-cb434a4257ec"><i>The AI job cuts are accelerating</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Even as business leaders claim AI is “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5009fd1e-85db-433f-aa2b-55d9b88b6481">redesigning</a>” jobs rather than cutting them, the headlines tell another story. It is not just Microsoft but Intel and BT that are among a host of major companies announcing thousands of lay-offs explicitly linked to AI. Previously when job cuts were announced, there was a sense that these were regrettable choices. Now executives consider them a sign of progress. Companies are pursuing greater profits with fewer people.  <br />
<br />
For the tech industry, revenue per employee has become a prized performance metric. Y Combinator start-ups brag about building companies with skeleton teams. A <a href="https://tinyteams.xyz/">website</a> called the “Tiny Teams Hall of Fame” lists companies bringing in tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with just a handful of employees.<br />

Brandon Vigliarolo's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/it_job_market_july/"><i>IT firing spree: Shrinking job market looks even worse after BLS revisions</i></a> has the latest data:<br />
<blockquote>
The US IT jobs market hasn't exactly been robust thus far in 2025, and downward revisions to May and June's Bureau of Labor Statistics data mean IT jobs lost in July are part of an even deeper sector slowdown than previously believed.<br />
<br />
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported relatively flat job growth last month, but unimpressive payroll growth numbers hid an even deeper reason to be worried: Most of the job growth <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">reported</a> (across all employment sectors) in May and June was incorrect. <br />
<br />
According to the BLS, May needed to be revised down by 125,000 jobs to just 19,000 added jobs; June had to be revised down by even more, with 133,000 erroneous new jobs added to company payrolls that month. That meant just 14,000 new jobs were added in June.<br />
...<br />
Against that backdrop, Janco reports that BLS data peg the IT-sector unemployment rate at 5.5 percent in July - well above the national rate of 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, the broader tech occupation unemployment rate was just 2.9 percent, as reported by CompTIA. 
</blockquote>
Note these points from Janco's table:<br />
<ul>
<li>The huge spike of 107,100 IT jobs lost last November.</li>
<li>The loss of 26,500 IT jobs so far this year.</li>
<li>That so far this year losses are 327% of the same period last year.</li>

The doses are increasing but their effect in pumping the stock hasn't been; the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/index/ndxt">NDXT</a> index of tech stocks hasn't been heading moonwards over the last year.<br />
<br />
CEOs have been enthusiastically laying off expensive workers and replacing them with much cheaper indentured servnts on H-1B visas, as Dan Gooding reports in <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h1b-visa-immigrants-tech-jobs-impact-college-grads-2106392"><i>H-1B Visas Under Scrutiny as Big Tech Accelerates Layoffs</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The ongoing reliance on the H-1B comes as <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/microsoft-layoffs-h1b-visa-applications-2094370">some of these same large companies have announced sweeping layoffs</a>, with mid-level and senior roles often hit hardest. Some 80,000 tech jobs have been eliminated so far this year, according to the tracker Layoffs.fyi.
</blockquote>
Gooding <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h1b-visa-immigrants-tech-jobs-impact-college-grads-2106392">notes that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In 2023, U.S. colleges graduated 134,153 citizens or green card holders with bachelor's or master's degrees in computer science. But the same year, the federal government also issued over 110,000 work visas for those in that same field, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (IFSPP).<br />
<br />
"The story of the H-1B program is that it's for the best and the brightest," said Jeremy Beck, co-president of NumbersUSA, a think tank calling for immigration reform. "The reality, however, is that most H-1B workers are classified and paid as 'entry level.' Either they are not the best and brightest or they are underpaid, or both."
</blockquote>
While it is highly likely that most CEOs have drunk the Kool-Aid and actually believe that AI will replace the workers they fired, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lizthegrey.com/post/3lvkvyf3euc2u">Liz Fong-Jones</a> believes that:<br />
<blockquote>
the megacorps use AI as pretext for layoffs, but actually rooted in end of 0% interest, changes to R&amp;D tax credit (S174, h/t <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3y5mmnrkhxkv37szj7twlc6n">@pragmaticengineer.com</a> for their reporting), &amp; herd mentality/labour market fixing. they want investors to believe AI is driving cost efficiency.<br />
<br />
AI today is literally not capable of replacing the senior engineers they are laying off. corps are in fact getting less done, but they're banking on making an example of enough people that survivors put their heads down and help them implement AI in exchange for keeping their jobs... for now.
</blockquote>
Note that the megacorps are monopolies, so "getting less done" and delivering worse product by using AI isn't a problem for them — they won't lose business. It is just more enshittification.<br />
<br />
Presumably, most CEOs think they have been laying off the fat, and replacing it with cheaper workers whose muscle is enhanced by AI, thereby pumping the stock. But they can't keep doing this; they'd end up with C-suite surrounded by short-termers on H-1Bs with no institutional memory of how the company actually functions. This information would have fallen off the end of the AIs' context.<br />
<h3>The deleterious effects kick in</h3>
The deleterious effects come in three forms.
Within the companies, as the hype about AI's capabilities meets reality.  For the workers, and not just those who were laid off.  And in the broader economy, as the rush to build AI data centers meets limited resources.<br />
<h4>The companies</h4>
But Raval sees the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04a83e0d-0128-4f59-9835-cb434a4257ec">weakening starting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But are leaner organisations necessarily better ones? I am not convinced these companies are more resilient even if they perform better financially. Faster decision making and lower overheads are great, but does this mean fewer resources for R&amp;D, legal functions or compliance? What about a company’s ability to withstand shocks — from supply chain disruptions to employee turnover and dare I say it, runaway robots?<br />
<br />
Some companies such as Klarna have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-08/klarna-turns-from-ai-to-real-person-customer-service">reversed tack</a>, realising that firing hundreds of staff and relying on AI resulted in a poorer customer service experience. Now the payments group wants them back.<br />
</blockquote>
Of course, the tech majors have already enshittified their customer experience, so they can impose AI on their customers without fear. But AI is enshittifying the customer experience of smaller companies who have acutal competitors.<br />
<h4>The workers</h4>
Shannon Pettypiece reports that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/job-market-report-college-student-graduates-ai-trump-tariffs-rcna221693"><i>'A black hole': New graduates discover a dismal job market</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
NBC News asked people who recently finished technical school, college or graduate school how their job application process was going, and in more than 100 responses, the graduates described months spent searching for a job, hundreds of applications and zero responses from employers — even with degrees once thought to be in high demand, like computer science or engineering. Some said they struggled to get an hourly retail position or are making salaries well below what they had been expecting in fields they hadn’t planned to work in.
</blockquote>
And Anjli Raval note that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04a83e0d-0128-4f59-9835-cb434a4257ec"><i>The AI job cuts are accelerating</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Younger workers should be particularly concerned about this trend. Entire rungs on the career ladder are taking a hit, undermining traditional job pathways. This is not only about AI of course. Offshoring, post-Covid budget discipline, and years of underwhelming growth have made entry-level hiring an easy thing to cut. But AI is adding to pressures.<br />
...<br />
The consequences are cultural as well as economic. If jobs aren’t readily available, will a university degree retain its value? Careers already are increasingly “<a href="https://www.amazingif.com/">squiggly</a>” and not linear. The rise of freelancing and hiring of contractors has already fragmented the nature of work in many cases. AI will only propel this. <br />
...<br />
The tech bros touting people-light companies underestimate the complexity of business operations and corporate cultures that are built on very human relationships and interactions. In fact, while AI can indeed handle the tedium, there should be a new premium on the human — from creativity and emotional intelligence to complex judgment. But that can only happen if we invest in those who bring those qualities and teach the next generation of workers — and right now, the door is closing on many of them.

In <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34071"><i>Rising Young Worker Despair in the United States</i></a>,  David G. Blanchflower &amp; Alex Bryson describe some of the consequences:<br />

Between the early 1990s and 2015 the relationship between mental despair and age was hump-shaped in the United States: it rose to middle-age, then declined later in life. That relationship has now changed: mental despair declines monotonically with age due to a rise in despair among the young. However, the relationship between age and mental despair differs by labor market status. The hump-shape in age still exists for those who are unable to work and the unemployed. The relation between mental despair and age is broadly flat, and has remained so, for homemakers, students and the retired. The change in the age-despair profile over time is due to increasing despair among young workers. Whilst the relationship between mental despair and age has always been downward sloping among workers, this relationship has become more pronounced due to a rise in mental despair among young workers. We find broad-based evidence for this finding in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of 1993-2023, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2008-2023, and in surveys by Pew, the Conference Board and Johns Hopkins University.
</blockquote>
History tends to show that large numbers of jobless young people despairing of their prospects for the future is a pre-revolutionary situation.<br />

Bryce Elder's <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce"><i>What’ll happen if we spend nearly $3tn on data centres no one needs?</i></a> points out the huge size of the AI bubble:<br />
<blockquote>
The entire high-yield bond market is only valued at about $1.4tn, so private credit investors putting in $800bn for data centre construction would be huge. A predicted $150bn of ABS and CMBS issuance backed by data centre cash flows would triple those markets’ current size. Hyperscaler funding of $300bn to $400bn a year compares with annual capex last year for <i>all S&amp;P 500 companies</i> of about $950bn.<br />
<br />
It’s also worth breaking down where the money would be spent. Morgan Stanley estimates that $1.3tn of data centre capex will pay for land, buildings and fit-out expenses. The remaining $1.6tn is to buy GPUs from Nvidia and others. Smarter people than us can work out how to securitise an asset <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a96d65c1-8ba7-4055-b952-61c5b5d500fc">that loses 30 per cent of its value every year</a>, and good luck to them.
</blockquote>
Brian Merchant argues that this spending is so big it is offsetting the impact of the tariffs in <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-bubble-is-so-big-its-propping"><i>The AI bubble is so big it's propping up the US economy (for now)</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Over the last six months, capital expenditures on AI—counting just information processing equipment and software, by the way—added more to the growth of the US economy than all consumer spending combined. You can just pull any of those quotes out—spending on IT for AI is so big it might be making up for economic losses from the tariffs, serving as a <i>private sector stimulus program</i>.

Over-investment is back, but might this be a <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">good thing?</a><br />
<blockquote>
I think it’s important to look at the telecom boom of the 1990s rather than the one in the 2010s, because the former led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecoms_crash">a gigantic crash</a>. The railroad boom led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1873">a gigantic crash too</a>, in 1873 ... In both cases, companies built too much infrastructure, outrunning growth in demand for that infrastructure, and suffered a devastating bust as expectations reset and loans couldn’t be paid back.<br />
<br />
In both cases, though, the big capex spenders weren’t <i>wrong</i>, they were just <i>early</i>. Eventually, we ended up using all of those railroads and all of those telecom fibers, and much more. This has led a lot of people <a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2021/01/why-bubbles-are-good-for-innovation/">to speculate</a> that big investment bubbles might actually be <a href="https://slate.com/business/2007/05/why-bubbles-are-great-for-the-economy.html">beneficial to the economy</a>, since manias leave behind a surplus of cheap infrastructure that can be used to power future technological advances and new business models.<br />
<br />
But for anyone who gets caught up in the crash, the future benefits to society are of cold comfort.

How likely is the bubble to burst? Elder notes just <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce">one reason</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Morgan Stanley estimates that more than half of the new data centres will be in the US, where there’s no obvious way yet to switch them on:<br />
<br />
America needs to find an extra 45GW for its data farms, says Morgan Stanley. That’s equivalent to about 10 per cent of all current US generation capacity, or “23 Hoover Dams”, it says. Proposed workarounds to meet the shortfall include scrapping crypto mining, putting data centres “behind the meter” in nuclear power plants, and building a new fleet of gas-fired generators.
</blockquote>
Good luck with that! It is worth noting that the crash has <i>already happened in China</i>, as Caiwei Chen reports in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/"><i>China built hundreds of AI data centers to catch the AI boom. Now many stand unused.</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Just months ago, a boom in data center construction was at its height, fueled by both government and private investors. However, many newly built facilities are now sitting empty. According to people on the ground who spoke to <i>MIT Technology Review</i>—including contractors, an executive at a GPU server company, and project managers—most of the companies running these data centers are struggling to stay afloat. The local Chinese outlets <i>Jiazi Guangnian</i> and <i>36Kr</i> report that up to 80% of China’s newly built computing resources remain unused.
</blockquote>
Elder also uses the analogy with the late 90s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce">telecom bubble</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In 2000, at the telecoms bubble’s peak, communications equipment spending topped out at <a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/RichmondFedOrg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2003/fall/pdf/wolman.pdf">$135bn annualised</a>. The internet hasn’t disappeared, but <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/a-telecoms-bubble-or-a-tech-bubble">most of the money did</a>. All those 3G licences and fibre-optic city loops provided zero insulation from default:<br />
<br />
Peak data centre spend this time around might be 10 times higher, very approximately, with public credit investors sharing the burden more equally with corporates. The broader spread of capital might mean a slower unwind should GenAI’s return on investment fail to meet expectations, as Morgan Stanley says. But it’s still not obvious why creditors would be coveting a server shed full of obsolete GPUs that’s downwind of a proposed power plant. 
</blockquote>
When the bubble bursts, who will <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">lose money?</a><br />
<blockquote>
A data center bust would mean that Big Tech shareholders would lose a lot of money, like dot-com shareholders in 2000. It would also slow the economy directly, because Big Tech companies would stop investing. But the scariest possibility is that it would cause a financial crisis.<br />
<br />
Financial crises tend to involve bank debt. When a financial bubble and crash is mostly a fall in the value of stocks and bonds, everyone takes losses and then just sort of walks away, a bit poorer — like in 2000. Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2015) survey the history of bubbles and crashes, and they find that debt (also called “credit” and “leverage”) is a key predictor of whether a bubble ends up hurting the real economy.
</blockquote>
The Jorda <i>et al</i> paper is <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp11-27bk.pdf"><i>When Credit Bites Back: Leverage, Business Cycles, and Crises</i></a>, and what they mean by "credit" and "leverage" is <i>bank loans</i>.<br />
<br />
Smith looks at whether <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">the banks are lending</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
So if we believe this basic story of when to be afraid of capex busts, it means that we have to care about who is lending money to these Big Tech companies to build all these data centers. That way, we can figure out whether we’re worried about what happens to those lenders if Big Tech can’t pay the money back.
</blockquote>
And so does <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/07/31/who-will-pay-for-the-trillion-dollar-ai-boom"><i>The Economist</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
During the first half of the year investment-grade borrowing by tech firms was 70% higher than in the first six months of 2024. In April Alphabet issued bonds for the first time since 2020. Microsoft has reduced its cash pile but its finance leases—a type of debt mostly related to data centres—nearly tripled since 2023, to $46bn (a further $93bn of such liabilities are not yet on its balance-sheet). Meta is in talks to borrow around $30bn from private-credit lenders including Apollo, Brookfield and Carlyle. The market for debt securities backed by borrowing related to data centres, where liabilities are pooled and sliced up in a way similar to mortgage bonds, has grown from almost nothing in 2018 to around $50bn today.<br />
<br />
The rush to borrow is more furious among big tech’s challengers. CoreWeave, an ai cloud firm, has borrowed liberally from private-credit funds and bond investors to buy chips from Nvidia. Fluidstack, another cloud-computing startup, is also borrowing heavily, using its chips as collateral. SoftBank, a Japanese firm, is financing its share of a giant partnership with Openai, the maker of ChatGPT, with debt. “They don’t actually have the money,” wrote Elon Musk when the partnership was announced in January. After raising $5bn of debt earlier this year xai, Mr Musk’s own startup, is reportedly borrowing $12bn to buy chips.
</blockquote>
Smith focuses on <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">private credit</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
These are the potentially scary part. Private credit funds are basically companies that take investment, borrow money, and then lend that money out in private (i.e. opaque) markets. They’re the debt version of private equity, and in recent years they’ve grown rapidly to become one of the U.S.’ economy’s major categories of debt:

Are the banks vulnerable to <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">private credit?</a>.<br />
<blockquote>
Private credit funds take some of their financing as equity, but they also borrow money. Some of this money is borrowed from banks. In 2013, only 1% of U.S. banks’ total loans to non-bank financial institutions was to private equity and private credit firms; <a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/supervisory-research-and-analysis-notes/2025/bank-lending-to-private-equity-and-private-credit-funds.aspx">today, it’s 14%</a>.<br />
<br />
BDCs are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Development_Company">Business Development Companies</a>”, which are a type of private credit fund. If there’s a bust in private credit, that’s an acronym you’ll be hearing a lot.<br />
<br />
And I believe the graph above does not include <a href="https://www.wellington.com/en-us/institutional/insights/clos-four-hot-topics-for-2024">bank purchases of bonds (CLOs)</a> issued by private credit companies. If private credit goes bust, those bank assets will go bust too, making banks’ balance sheets weaker.
</blockquote>
The fundamental problem here is that an AI bust would cause losses that would be both very large and very highly correlated, and thus very likely to be a tail risk not adequately accounted for by the banks' risk models, just as the large, highly correlated losses caused the banks to need a bail-out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis">Global Financial Crisis</a> of 2008.<br />

      <h1>Underlines and line height</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22085">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>I was thinking about something I wrote yesterday when I was talking about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22084">styling underlines on links</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a start, you can adjust the distance of the underline from the text using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset"><code>text-underline-offset</code></a>. If you’re using a generous line-height, use a generous distance here too.</p>

<p>For some reason, I completely forgot that we’ve got a line-height unit in CSS now: <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_length_lh"><code>lh</code></a>. So if you want to make the distance of your underline proportional to the line height of the text that the link is part of, it’s easy-peasy:</p>

<pre><code>text-underline-offset: 0.15lh;
</code></pre>

<p>The greater the line height, the greater the distance between the link text and its underline.</p>

<p>I think this one is going into <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21896">my collection of CSS snippets</a> I use on almost every project.</p>

      <h1>Choosing Tools To Make Websites</h1>

(date: 2025-08-13, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/choosing-tools-for-making-websites/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Jan Miksovsky lays out his idea for <a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com/site-creation-as-content-transformation/" >website creation as content transformation</a>. He starts by talking about tools that hide what’s happening “under the hood”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A framework’s marketing usually pretends it is unnecessary for you to understand how its core transformation works — but without that knowledge, you can’t achieve the beautiful range of results you see in the framework’s sample site gallery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a <em>great</em> callout. Tools will say, “You don’t have to worry about the details.” But the reality is, you end up worrying about the details — at least to some degree.</p>
<p>Why? Because what you want to build is full of personalization. That’s how you differentiate yourself, which means you’re going to need a tool that’s expressive enough to help you.</p>
<p>So the question becomes: how hard is it to understand the details that are being intentionally hidden away?</p>
<p>A lot of the time those details are not exposed directly. Instead they’re exposed through configuration. But configuration doesn’t really help you learn how something works. I mean, how many of you have learned how typescript works under the hood by using <code>tsconfig.json</code>? As Jan says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configuration can lead to as many problems as it solves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nailed it. He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configuring software is itself a form of programming, in fact a rather difficult and often baroque form. It can take more data files or code to configure a framework’s transformation than to write a program that directly implements that transformation itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not a Devops person, but that sounds like Devops in a nutshell right there. (It also perfectly encapsulates my feelings on trying to setup configuration in GitHub Actions.)</p>
<p>Jan moves beyond site creation to also discuss site hosting. He gives good reasons for keeping your website’s architecture simple and decoupled from your hosting provider (something I’ve been a long time proponent of):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These site hosting platforms typically charge an ongoing subscription fee. (Some offer a free tier that may meet your needs.) The monthly fee may not be large, but it’s forever. Ten years from now you’ll probably still want your content to be publicly available, but will you still be happy paying that monthly fee? If you stop paying, your site disappears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In subscription pricing, any price (however small) is recurring. Stated differently: pricing is forever.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it’s a good read from Jan and lays out his vision for why he’s building <a href="https://weborigami.org" >Web Origami</a>: a tool for that encourages you to understand (and customize) how you transform content to a website. He just launched <a href="https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami/releases/tag/0.4.0" >version <code>0.4.0</code> </a> which has some exciting stuff I’m excited to try out further (I’ll have to write about all that later).</p>

      I&#8217;ve learned a ton about gardening in the past decade plus of owning a house. Gardens are so slow-moving that they&#8217;re anchored in our past choices, and don&#8217;t represent our current knowledge or skills &#8212; but we also can&#8217;t develop those skills without trying things, and making some mistakes.

      <h1>Style your underlines</h1>

(date: 2025-08-13, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22084">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>We shouldn’t rely on colour alone to indicate that something is interactive.</p>

<p>Take links, for example. Sure, you can give them a different colour to the surrounding text, but you shouldn’t stop there. Make sure there’s something else that distinguishes them. You could make them bold. Or you could stick with the well-understood convention of underlying links.</p>

<p>This is where some designers bristle. If there are a lot of links on a page, it could look awfully cluttered with underlines. That&#8217;s why some designers would rather remove the underline completely.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@matuzo@front-end.social/114674911039663634">As Manu observed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;ve done a lot of audits in the first half of this year and at this point a believe that designing links without underlines is a kink. The idea that users don&#8217;t understand that links are clickable arouses some designers. I can&#8217;t explain it any other way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But underlining links isn&#8217;t the binary decision it once was. You can use CSS to style those underlines just as you’d style any other part of your design language.</p>

<p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline">Here’s a regular underlined link.</a></p>

<p>For a start, you can adjust the distance of the underline from the text using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset"><code>text-underline-offset</code></a>. If you&#8217;re using a generous line-height, use a generous distance here too.</p>

<p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em">Here’s a link with an offset underline.</a></p>

<p>If you’d rather have a thinner or thicker underline, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-thickness"><code>text-decoration-thickness</code></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px">Here’s a link with a thin underline.</a></p>

<p>The colour of the underline and the colour of the link don&#8217;t need to be the same. Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-color"><code>text-decoration-color</code></a> to make them completely different colours or make the underline a lighter shade of the link colour.</p>

<p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%);">Here’s a link with a translucent underline.</a></p>

<p>That’s quite a difference with just a few CSS declarations:</p>

<pre><code>text-underline-offset: 0.2em;
text-decoration-thickness: 1px;
text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%);
</code></pre>

<p>If that still isn’t subtle enough for you, you could even use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-style"><code>text-decoration-style</code></a> to make the underline dotted or dashed, but that might be a step too far.</p>

<p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%); text-decoration-style: dotted">Here’s a link with a dotted underline.</a></p>

<p>Whatever you decide, I hope you&#8217;ll see that underlines aren’t the enemy of good design. They&#8217;re an opportunity.</p>

<p>You should use underlines to keep your links accessible. But you should also use CSS to make those underlines beautiful.</p>

I don't think I've ever said that on the blog before. I write my code in an outliner, and take advantage of its ability to collapse long comments into a single line. There are whole blogs at the top of some functions, notes about all the big changes in code, sometimes over years, and sometimes even decades of maintenance.  There's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/source.opml">source.opml</a> in most of the repos with a big comment at the top explaining what's going on. Also, most projects have a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a> file, and where there are dates in the source code, the refer back to dates in the worknotes.md file. Not always, but most of the time. Some of the code is very complex, I work really hard to make it simple so it can be worked on, but in some cases it's impossible to make it read casually. But it's all there, all the tools I use to write the code.

Or maybe hook up with another developer who can back into the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket">websocket hose</a> coming out of FeedLand.

I still want to use AI to power an RSS feed of news, customized to the interests of one person (me). My <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179118706">query</a> is this: "Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education, blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format, with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software will then create an RSS feed with this information.." The response was basically: "I'm sorry Dave." Groan. Here are <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179036482">the details</a>.

      <h1>The “Incriminating Video” Scam</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, updated: 2025-08-07, from: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/08/the-incriminating-video-scam.html">Bruce Schneier blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>A few years ago, scammers invented a new phishing email. They would claim to have hacked your computer, turned your webcam on, and videoed you watching porn or having sex. BuzzFeed has an <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/poojashah1/new-email-scam-house-address-sc">article</a> talking about a &#8220;shockingly realistic&#8221; variant, which includes photos of you and your house&#8212;more specific information.</p>
<p>The article contains &#8220;steps you can take to figure out if it&#8217;s a scam,&#8221; but omits the first and most fundamental piece of advice: If the hacker had incriminating video about you, they would show you a clip. Just a taste, not the worst bits so you had to worry about how bad it could be, but something. If the hacker doesn&#8217;t show you any video, they don&#8217;t have any video. Everything else is window dressing...</p>

      WordPress anniversary, and thoughts on blogging by Kris Howard (via) (I told him that URLs are meant to be forever, and that losing websites “creates gaps in humanity’s collective knowledge and holes in the fabric of our shared culture”). I’m not sure if this is a generational thing, or just different cultures and social norms. [&#8230;]

      <p>
      It’s reasonable — especially for paying customers — to expect at least some advance notice of older models going away. But it’s unreasonable to think that older models are going to remain available in perpetuity — especially in the current LLM climate, where model age is measured in months, or even weeks.

      With the fate of Goo.gl in the balance and many URL shortening/redirection services being either expensive or spammy, I wondered if I could find a free/cheap way of achieving the same. So I got myself a short domain (CLXI.org) and looked at using a GitHub repo with pages to redirect URLs. Turns out, this is [&#8230;]

      <h1>Session talk</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22080">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>I was in Nor’n Irelan’ at the end of July for my annual week of <a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">Belfast Tradfest</a>.</p>

<p>It was the best one yet. Classes in the morning, sessions all day, and concerts in the evening.</p>

<p>There were also some excellent events at Ulster University during the afternoons—talks, film screenings, interviews and discussions.</p>

<p>If you squint closely at <a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58da46ee15d5db0567e7ca1c/1750803556821-68NZW483810FRP1HALAG/Festival+Poster+-+Print_A4.png">the poster for this year’s event</a> you’ll see my name on there. That’s because one of those afternoon events was me giving a talk about <a href="https://thesession.org/">thesession.org</a>.</p>

<p>I’m no stranger to public speaking but this was a very different audience to the usual conferences I speak at. I had to make sure not to get technical. So I talked about the history of the site, <a href="https://thesession.org/help#houserules">the house rules</a>, changes made over time, and pointed out some features that people might’ve missed.</p>

<p>I also made sure not to speak for too long. I had an hour but I kept the presentation to just 25 minutes so that there’d be plenty of time for questions and discussions afterwards.</p>

<p>It went really well. People had lots of questions and ideas.</p>

<p>Some interesting themes emerged from the discussion…</p>

<p>There was no shortage of suggestions for features that were <em>technically</em> possible, but that I’m probably not going to add because of they might clutter up the interface.</p>

<p>Some other people had suggestions for features that were actually already on the site …but implemented in such a subtle way that you could easily miss them.</p>

<p>This highlights an ongoing balancing act I’ve been performing for the site’s two and a half decades of existence. I want to keep improving the site and ensuring that powerful features are available. But I also want to keep the site streamlined and easy to use.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, this is one of the things that sets The Session apart from other tune collections out there. Many of them have great content but it’s not always easy to get to grips with it, at least at first.</p>

<p>Still, I may have gone too far in the other direction with The Session. In trying to avoid cluttering up the interface, I might’ve buried some features a little deep.</p>

<p>Anyway, all of this has been great food for thought. I’m really glad I got to meet so many people who use The Session. It literally wouldn’t exist without them.</p>

Or if users get an idea for linking two products, they can do it with scripting. It was a dream we had for the Mac, but it fell apart because Apple wanted to control everything. I find it's better when developers are free to work with each other, without interference from a big company like Apple. That's why "platform without a platform vendor" was the most important thing about the web. That and the utter simplicity of HTTP and HTML. We lost our way in the early-mid 00s when Twitter took over at the center of the blogosphere. Now you couldn't just work with other developers, first you had to work with Twitter and accept its limits. In one swoop we lost all the features listed on the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> page. I am betting everything on the idea that we can build a collaborative environment like the web was before, and that the Mac had the promise of being before that and at the same time create a fantastic <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22">writer's web</a>, far beyond what Twitter and twitter-like systems can do.

      On Friday, Democracy Forward Foundation sued the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to make it respond to its request for the release of the Epstein files, as well as all communications the administration has exchanged over the files and President Donald Trump&#8217;s inclusion in them, as required under the Freedom of Information Act.
