markets have dominant products, evolution freezes. Google search, for
example. I should have great search for my blog by now, powered by
Google. It has been here for 26 years. They should have been doing
R&amp;D on how they can be part of a better reading environment on the
web. But reading on the web has just gotten worse over the years. It’s
why we don’t like clicking on links, usually what we find at the other
end of the link is obnoxious. To get some peace and quiet we had to go
to Twitter of all places, but now that’s gotten ridiculous too. The only
corner of the web where there’s real exciting innovation is ChatGPT. And
what’s tragic about that is we’ve never made search work on the web, and
search is valuable too, not just the digested version of what was said
that ChatGPT produces. Guy Kawasaki just sent a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/27/kawasakiGPT.png?nodialog=true">summary
of my career</a> created by his new chatbot. Very flattering, but it has
no nutritional value. I’d like some of my writing to survive the Great
Ingestion. Writing matters, how humans express themselves matters. In
other words we still have work to do in search, AI does <i>not</i> fill
that need.</p>

<p>An idea for a news org. I want a for-pay site where I can ask a
question about the news and get the most up-to-date answer. I’d like to
link to that page from a blog post, and have it either be frozen, to
document where we were on that day, or dynamic, so that it changes over
time. I’m sure this product will be here soon, so obvious.</p>

Recommends Some Common-Sense Password Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, updated: 2024-09-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
NIST’s second draft of its
“<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html">SP
800-63-4</a>“—its digital identify guidelines—finally contains some
really good rules about passwords:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The following requirements apply to passwords:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
lVerifiers and CSPs SHALL require passwords to be a minimum of eight
characters in length and SHOULD require passwords to be a minimum of 15
characters in length.
<li>
Verifiers and CSPs SHOULD permit a maximum password length of at least
64 characters.
<li>
Verifiers and CSPs SHOULD accept all printing ASCII [RFC20] characters
and the space character in passwords.
<li>
Verifiers and CSPs SHOULD accept Unicode [ISO/ISC 10646] characters in
passwords. Each Unicode code point SHALL be counted as a signgle
character when evaluating password length. …
</li>

do I care about what <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>
means? Because I plan to add functionality to this space. I’m tired of
all the stupid limits these products have. Titles or no titles. 300
character limits. No links, etc etc and on and on. Where did they get
the idea that taking features out of writing was something they could
do. What a wrong turn we took there. And now that once we have a chance
to erase the limits, maybe – none of the companies running their
products are doing it. I don’t want the way they do it to be the only
way, the products are <i>deliberately</i> incompatible. Social web is
the best name for what I’m working on. So I need to reserve this space.
They didn’t ask for my opinion, the first I heard of it was a press
release. When I ship my thing I want to point back at this and say look
– I did tell you this was going to be a problem.</p>

<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DAYZWUXpEyJ">question</a>
came up on Threads as to whether the ActivityPub support in Ghost will
be a full two-way presence in the fedisphere, and apparently the
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@quillmatiq/post/DALtxZ_PiiX">answer</a>
is yes. They are working on a feed reader that also hooks into AP.
That’s how I would have done it. Really feeds and tweets should always
have been peers. If you want to know the history, blame Google Reader
for that disconnect. Also it highlights the need for a
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DAYm3v5JLLe">news-zine</a>
focused on the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>. When
the PC first came out there was PC Mag and PC World and then PC Week.
Same for the Mac. And there was InfoWorld that covered everything. Now
we’re basically using smoke signals between users. A few really
interested users could bootstrap a blog to keep track of what’s going
on, and share what you learn publicly. That was the advice I gave
<a href="site:scripting.com arrington">Mike Arrington</a> and he started
TechCrunch and that acted as the glue that hooked together the early
blogosphere, feeds and ultimately twitter and its offspring. We need it
again. Users and developers party together has never been more needed as
now.</p>

<p>I’ve taken to ignoring all the autogenerated “memories” that my phone
would like to show me from four years ago — because while the system
simply matches the date, <em>I</em> know that four years ago was the
depths of despair of the pandemic. We were still waiting for a vaccine.

Friday we went to hear some classical music at the Tonhalle in Zürich.
Thorvaldsdottir’s composition was amazing. Apparently there will be more
Icelandic elements this season. 😄
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://tonhalle-orchester.ch/">Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich</a>,
Paavo Järvi, Music Director,
<a href="https://www.vikingurolafsson.com/">Víkingur Ólafsson</a>,
piano: Johannes Brahms Klavierkonzert Nr. 1 d-Moll op. 15.
</p>
<p>
Same director and same orchestra,
<a href="https://www.annathorvalds.com/">Anna Thorvaldsdottir</a>’s
«Archora» for orchestra.
</p>
<p>
Same director and same orchestra, Igor Strawinsky’s «L’oiseau de feu»,
Konzert-Suite (1919).
</p>
<p>
On Sunday we went to hear Old Music.
</p>
<p>
El Cant de la Sibil•la; Draumkvedet – Traumlied; Orlando di Lasso:
Prophetiae Sibyllarum.
</p>

This is the second week of our holidays. We stayed in Zürich and decided
to live as if we’re on a trip: hikes, runs, activities (today:
cycling!), restaurants, museums or concerts. I told myself that we can
spend the hotel budget on cultural events and train rides and suddenly
everything seems possible where until now I would have hesitated. Is it
really worth that much money? But since we’re not paying for the hotel …
I convinced myself that it’s OK.

<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Life">#Life</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-25</strong>. Today we went to the Tonhalle again.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich
</li>
<li>
Paavo Järvi Music Director
</li>
<li>
Golda Schultz Sopran
</li>
<li>
Anton Webern «Langsamer Satz» für Streichorchester (Arr. Gerard Schwarz)

<li>
Richard Strauss «Vier letzte Lieder» für Sopran und Orchester
</li>
<li>
Anton Bruckner Sinfonie Nr. 1 c-Moll «Linzer Fassung»
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I saw the third flutist sitting around a lot and not playing the flute
and when the volume went up he covered his ears. Poor lad. Did he just
play five notes early in the performance and then he had to wait until
the end? How strange!

<p>
Last week I was made aware that Elecrow, an electronics manufacturer and
distributor,
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/they-stole-my-voice-ai">was
using an unauthorized clone of my voice</a> in some of their YouTube
tutorials.
</p>
<p>
I couldn’t prove it at the time, but there are AI identity detection
services like <a href="https://www.resemble.ai">Resemble.ai</a> that can
at least give some input into whether it was a direct clone or just
something that sounds ‘midwestern US male.’
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMofZIT9FcQ">made a
short video about it</a>, because I wanted to make a point that it is
<em>not</em> okay for a corporation to clone someone’s voice and use it
in their videos without that person’s consent.

Malware Locks Computer in Kiosk Mode</h2>

<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-locks-browser-in-kiosk-mode-to-steal-google-credentials/">Clever</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A malware campaign uses the unusual method of locking users in their
browser’s kiosk mode to annoy them into entering their Google
credentials, which are then stolen by information-stealing malware.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the malware “locks” the user’s browser on Google’s login
page with no obvious way to close the window, as the malware also blocks
the “ESC” and “F11” keyboard keys. The goal is to frustrate the user
enough that they enter and save their Google credentials in the browser
to “unlock” the computer.
</p>
<p>
Once credentials are saved, the StealC information-stealing malware
steals them from the credential store and sends them back to the
attacker…

<p>It goes back to housing as an investment. Speaking very macro,
property, since the 1980s, has far eclipsed wages… And that—and
leverage—define our economy now. This makes design important, but
downstream, and in a narrower context than we think. Furniture must
reflect… the investment value a house has. For these types of houses,

<h2 id="a-hello-world-for-bluesky">A Hello World for Bluesky?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First, a couple of examples/case studies.
</p>
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>About ten years ago I was trying to figure out how to get started
with Node.js. I knew a little JavaScript, but nothing I read about Node
made it click. It’s server software, so there must be a way to write an
HTTP server? From there, I read all the details about the power it has,
but what I needed was a Hello World script.
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22">Brent
Simmons</a> gave me the script, and step by step
<a href="https://inessential.com/2013/12/09/getting_started_with_web_services_using_.html">instructions</a>
on how to write it.
</p>
<p>
I followed his steps, and it worked, and of course I wrote a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/01/29/imBecomingANodejsDeveloper.html">blog
post</a> about it. That was the key I needed that unlocked what Node is,
and helped me see what I could do with it. The first thing I did was
factor out some of the bits so I could make it even simpler and then I
built. I just wanted a few lines of code that created a server and
responded to requests. All I needed was a Hello World to get me going.
</p>
<p>
Now Brent knew that I knew the basics of HTTP servers, we both worked
together on a huge app that had as a small part of it a full HTTP
server, thanks to
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wes+felter%22">Wes
Felter</a> who wrote it, no one asked him to, one day he showed up with
a server that ran in
<a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. I was ecstatic.
That’s the key. If you have something that isn’t truly new, that might
have some analogies in other worlds, if you want people in those other
worlds to know how to get started, give them the beginning. The first
step.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Another example. How I learned to create and edit a website. It was
1994. I loved the web the way I love ChatGPT today. I knew how to use
it, but I didn’t know how to make it. Everyone told me it was really
simple and they sent me links to all the docs, but they made no sense,
because they talked about things I didn’t understand. What I really
needed was a way to make a web page that was as simple as the one Brent
provided for Node-based HTTP servers, with tools and concepts I knew how
to use. I found one, a service provided by
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howIDoNewThings.html">Ohio
State University</a>. You emailed a message to them and they put it “on
the web” and sent you back a link to the page. Click the link and
there’s what you typed. I tried <i>Hello World</i> and got back a link
to a page that said Hello World. So I tried something more complicated,
I did a view source of Hotwired.com’s home page, and copy and pasted it
into an email. That worked too (with broken images because the urls were
relative).
</p>
<p>
Everything I’ve ever learned how to do required me to first understand
it at this level.
</p>
<p>
Okay here we are in 2024, and I want to understand what Bluesky is. I
know how to use it, but I don’t know how to <i>make</i> it. But I would
be surprised if it is any more complicated that writing a web content
management system that uses feeds, something I’ve done many times. I
know the components of a message, have iterated over it for the last
thirty years. I even wrote the spec that defines them in RSS 2.0. We’re
all doing the same thing over and over and Bluesky is no different. I
hear there’s some nice design for the protocol, but right now I don’t
care. I want my Hello World. The minimal code I need to add a node to
the network defined by Bluesky and I want to see what it can do with the
same kind of aha moment I had with the web. I want it to work when I try
it, and I want it to reveal what Bluesky is beyond what I can see from
using it. I want to begin to understand the opportunities for interop.
</p>
<p>
Why do I ask? For one, I’m a student of this stuff, and I want to
understand. But I also am very active in this area, and
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop">interop
is my product</a> (really read that piece, I mean it, and I think it’s
Bluesky’s product too). I’m into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">working
together</a> – it happens so infrequently. So here I’m also trying to
show not just you how to explain what you do for a curious but
time-limited developer, but I want to make this a this.how document that
explains how to do it for everyone, hoping that we as an art and
industry start explaining ourselves better to each other, because we
absolutely need to do this much better imho, ymmv, mmlm, etc.
</p>
<p>
To summarize – assume I know how the web works. I’ve worked with the
structures and protocols for systems that are very much like Bluesky.
Don’t try to explain the design of the protocol, just use it to solve a
problem that I will understand because I use the product and I have
developed lots of stuff like it. It should be possible to show us, to
teach us, what your product does.
</p>
<p>
PS: It could take a few days to put a Hello World together. Because once
you do the first iteration, you may think of a more direct way to
illustrate the idea, and you should do it, iterate until it works, until
you can’t make it any simpler.
</p>
<p>
PPS: And if you don’t want to do it, that’s okay too. I just thought it
was worth the effort to explain what’s needed to foster a greater
understanding of what you’re doing and what the opportunities for
interop are.

no doctor would treat you for a serious illness until you got a court
order saying it was due to rape, incest or the life of the mother.
Judges with the power of life and death. In some states with the death
penalty judges have the power to sentence people to death, but not for
having a well-accepted medical procedure. But that’s the situation women
with a troubled pregnancy are in, if they live in the wrong state. From
the patient’s point of view, I have a slight inkling about what this is
like because twice in my life I’ve needed health care to save me from
imminent death. The health care system never hesitated to help. But what
if they had said “we can’t admit you until a judge rules that we can.”
In the new USA, abortion is like a pardon, something only the government
can grant. Forget about juries of our peers. It raises so many
questions. If a woman is about to miscarry are they even allowed to
admit her to the hospital, or does she have to wait until she is
actually dying? If you can check her in, what are the limits of the
treatment they can provide? Aspirin? Blood? Oxygen? Surgery? And btw,
medicine has advanced a <i>lot</i> since before Roe v Wade. Whatever
practices they had for avoiding abortion can’t apply now. This is the
kind of thing no society should change the way we changed it as an edict
handed down by judges who are subject to corruption. We are learning
about a serious flaw in our system of government.</p>

Pager Attacks and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, updated: 2024-09-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Israel’s brazen attacks on Hezbollah last week, in which hundreds of
pagers and two-way radios exploded and killed at least 37 people,
graphically illustrated a threat that cybersecurity experts have been
warning about for years: Our international supply chains for
computerized equipment leave us vulnerable. And we have no good means to
defend ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Though the deadly operations were stunning, none of the elements used to
carry them out were particularly new. The tactics employed by Israel,
which has neither confirmed nor denied any role, to hijack an
international supply chain and embed plastic explosives in Hezbollah
devices have been used for years. What’s new is that Israel put them
together in such a devastating and extravagantly public fashion,
bringing into stark relief what the future of great power competition
will look like—in peacetime, wartime and the ever expanding …

Melinda Varian, historian of that era of IBM’s groundbreaking
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)">SHARE</a> user
group, wrote in
<a href="https://www.leeandmelindavarian.com/Melinda/25paper.pdf"><i>VM
and the VM Community: Past, Present, and Future</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Dewayne Hendricks reported at SHARE XLII, in March, 1974, that he had
successfully implemented MVT-CP handshaking for page faulting, so that
when MVT running under VM took a page fault, CP would allow MVT to
dispatch another task while CP brought in the page. At the following
SHARE, Dewayne did a presentation on further modifications, including
support for SIOF and a memory-mapped job queue. With these changes, his
system would allow multi-tasking guests actually to multi-task when
running in a virtual machine. Significantly, his modifications were
available on the Waterloo Tape.<br /> <br /> Dewayne became the chairman
of the Operating Systems Committee of the SHARE VM Project. Under his
guidance, the Committee prepared several detailed requirements for
improvements to allow guest systems to perform better. At SHARE XLV, in
1975, the Committee presented IBM with a White Paper entitled Operating
Systems Under VM/370, which discussed the performance problems of guests
under VM and the solutions that customers had found for these problems.
Many of the solutions that Dewayne and others had found, such as PAGEX,
made their way into VM fairly quickly, apparently as the result of
customers’ persistence in documenting them. By SHARE 49, Dewayne was
able to state that, “It is now generally understood that either MFT or
MVT can run under VM/370 with relative batch throughput greater than 1.”
That is to say, they had both been made to run significantly faster
under VM than on the bare hardware. Dewayne and others did similar work
to improve the performance of DOS under VM.

<h3>
Amateur Radio
</h3>
Dewayne was a major figure in developing and sustaining the use of
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">amateur packet
radio</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He has been involved with radio since receiving his amateur radio
operator’s license as a teen. He currently holds official positions in
several national non-profit amateur radio organizations and is a
director of the Wireless Communications Alliance, an industry group
representing manufacturers in the unlicensed radio industry.
</blockquote>
In
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">particular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Back in 1986, he ported the popular KA9Q Internet Protocol package to
the Macintosh, allowing the Macintosh platform to be used in packet
radio networks. Today, thousands of amateur radio operators worldwide
use the NET/Mac system he developed to participate in the global packet
radio Internet. This system continues to be developed and deployed by
the amateur radio service.
</blockquote>
Dewayne was a member of the
<a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/who-we-are/">Amateur Radio Digital
Communications Grants Evaluation Team</a> from 2021 to his death. ARDC
grants around <a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/">$5M/year</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
ARDC makes grants to projects and organizations that are experimenting
with new ways to advance both amateur radio and digital communication
science. Experimentation by amateur radio operators has benefited
society in many ways, including the development of the mobile phone and
wireless internet technology. ARDC envisions a world where all such
technology is available through open source hardware and software, and
where anyone has the ability to innovate upon it. To see examples of the
types of grants we make, go to

<h3>
Tetherless Access
</h3>
One of the many ahead-of-their-time companies Dewayne started was
Tetherless Access. He co-founded it with Charlie Brown in 1990 to
develop wireless Metropolitan Access Networks. It went public in 1996 on
NASDAQ and folded two years later. The idea was to use the 900MHz
unlicensed spectrum to distribute Internet connectivity from a base
station via point-to-point links, in contrast to Metricom’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Ricochet</a>
service, started by Dewayne’s mentor Paul Baran, which four years later
used mesh network technology in the same spectrum.<br /> <br />

Dewayne was involved in a number of NSF funded experiments in using
wireless to
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">connect remote
communities</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior to forming Dandin Group, he was the General Manager of the
Wireless Business Unit for Com21, Inc. He joined Com21 following an
opportunity to participate as the Co-Principal Investigator in the
National Science Foundation’s Wireless Field Tests for Education
project. The project sucessfully connected remote educational
institutions to the Internet. The test sites ranged from rural primary
schools in Colorado, USA to a University in Ulaan Bataar, Mongolia.

Amara Angelica reported that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000307045638/http://www.techweek.com/articles/8-23-99/wireless.htm"><i>Tonga
first to go wireless for telecommunications</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“We’re replacing the entire existing telecom infrastructure with a
wireless IP [Internet protocol] network,” says Dewayne Hendricks, CEO of
Fremont-based Dandin Group and former general manager of Com21’s
wireless business unit. “Since the country is a monarchy, there was only
one guy to convince, Crown Prince Tupouto’a, and then we just went for
it.”<br /> <br /> Hendricks’ firm plans to replace Tonga Telecom’s aging
landline system—which still uses mechanical relays—with a broadband
wireless network for data, video and telephony (using voice over IP). It
will run at 30Mbps with user access at 2Mbps and 10Mbps by the end of
next year. “We can get all the spectrum we want,” Hendricks says.<br />
<br /> The prince’s objective, Hendricks says, is to convert the
country’s largely agricultural workforce, which has an astonishing 95
percent literacy rate, into knowledge workers, such as programmers. The
government launched the Royal School of Science for Distance Learning
last year, using Internet connections to allow students to take courses
at international universities. There are just fewer than 100,000 people
in Tonga scattered across 170 islands.<br /> <br /> “We’re going to an
Internet-style mesh network,” says Hendricks. MMDS, which some carriers
are using to deliver broadband services, won’t scale well for an IP
network, he says. Hendricks, a technical advisor to the FCC on
ultrawideband (UWB) technology, is considering UWB for the network.
</blockquote>
<a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">Tonga had</a> about 11,000
households and 6,500 phone customers, with an 8-year wait to get a
phone. The goals of the project were to deliver 30Mbit/s IP to each home
for a customer end budget of $450.<br /> <br />

Wired Article
</h3>
In the January 2002 edition of <i>Wired</i>, Brent Hurtig’s
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/"><i>Digital
Cowboy</i></a> focused on Dewayne’s work on the reservation:<br />
<blockquote>
At Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation in North Dakota, he’s installing
a wireless network. In its initial form, the system will meet FCC
requirements governing frequency, power, and transmission technology.
But not for long. Hendricks’ mission is to build the best system
possible - even if it’s illegal - and he intends to use every tool at
his disposal. Should the FCC crack down, the tribal leaders will hoist
the flag of Native American sovereignty, asserting that they can do
whatever they want with the sky above their reservation.
</blockquote>
Dewayne’s work on the reservation, in Tonga and elsewhere was an attempt
to demonstrate the problems with the obsolete US
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">spectrum allocation
policy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s no sensible reason why Americans shouldn’t have inexpensive,
ubiquitous, high-performance broadband access, Hendricks says. Using
technologies that are already available or in fast-track development,
everyone could enjoy reliable, fully symmetrical wireless at T1 speed or
better. No more digital divide. No more last-mile problem. No more
compromises. The only things standing in the way are the FCC, Congress,
and “other people who just don’t get it.”

<h3>
EE380 Talks
</h3>
Dewayne gave three talks to Stanford’s EE380 symposium. The first one
was apparently “in the ’90s on wireless MANs” of which I have so far
found no record.<br /> <br /> The second was on 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2000
entitled
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/000503.html"><i>Wiring
Tonga: From the Ground Up and the Sky Down</i></a>. The abstract
was:<br />
<blockquote>
One of the biggest barriers today standing in the way of deployment of
advanced wireless communications systems turns out not to be the
technology, but restrictions related to regulatory policies. This
presentation will discuss the nature of these barriers and how they have
affected the development of wireless data systems over the years.<br />
<br /> The speaker will also discuss on-going work in which he is
involved to use advanced wireless technology to deploy multiservice IP
systems as part of infrastructure-development projects in the Kingdom of
Tonga and with Native American groups in the US, and how such projects
are able to deal with the limitations imposed by conventional regulatory
barriers.
</blockquote>
The slides are <a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">here</a>.<br />
<br /> The third was on 5<sup>th</sup> March 2014 and entitled
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/140305.html"><i>Inventing
a New Internet: Learning from Icarus</i></a>. The abstract read:<br />
<blockquote>
From a future historical perspective, are we descendants of Icarus? Is
our Internet like Icarus’ wings? Are our protocols, ciphers and codes,
brilliant capabilities built on immature engineering, which like Icarus’
wax and feathers, are capable of taking us to great heights, but
systematically flawed? For a brief historical moment, humanity has flown
high like Icarus, on a vulnerable first generation Internet platform.
Which as been used for securing and using distributed ideas, arts, media
science, commerce, and machines. Promising brilliant futures with the
arrival of networked things, autonomous personalized services and
immersive media. But, now our first generation Internet , built on a
fragile global network of vulnerable codes and protocols, is falling
apart, like Icarus’ wings, through a triple shock from:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Massive dotcom data stalker economy built on mining of terabytes
personal data.
</li>
<li>
Ubiquitous criminal penetration of financial and identity networks, on
our devices, in the cloud.
</li>
<li>
Pervasive state intruders at all levels and every encrypted hardware and
software node.
</li>
</ul>
Humans eventually conquered the barriers to flight and learned to build
durable and resilient aircraft. Similarly, humans must learn to build a
more reliable, private and secure Internet for communications,
innovation and commerce. We will share our thoughts on how we might go
about the design of a more durable and resilient Internet:<br />
<ul>
<li>
How prepared is the Internet for future human benefit?
</li>
<li>
What are the attributes of a future more durable internet?
</li>
<li>
What are the existing assets that could be harnessed?
</li>
<li>
What needs to be developed?

dewayne-net
</h3>
For many years Dewayne with impeccable taste curated dewayne-net, an
e-mail list to which he sent links, most he found but some contributed
by his friends. A typical e-mail would have the title of the linked
post, a link, and enough of the content to encourage recipients to read
the whole thing. The last e-mails were two on 19<sup>th</sup> August, as
it happens both links that I had sent him earlier. I have been one of
the more frequent contributors, although only perhaps 20% of my
contributions passed the curatorial filter. Prof. Dave Farber’s
<a href="https://ip.topicbox.com/groups/ip">IP list</a> is a similar and
I believe even longer-standing list; he and Dewayne exchanged links
fairly often.<br /> <br /> As an example of the list in full flow, lets
take April 2022. That month he sent 66 e-mails, many about the COVID
pandemic and the war in Ukraine, obviously both top of mind at the time.
But they included topics including satellite tracking of commercial
aircraft, the Kessler syndrome, the problems of the US patent system,
cybercrime, microplastics, banned math textbooks in Florida, and Elon
Musk’s purchase of Twitter. I am already greatly missing this window
into Dewayne’s eclectic set of interests.<br /> <br />

increased that to the limit as well. I ran that machine, which was

in San Diego, I attended Scripps and lectured on cot death for three
months as a guest. Scripps at the time was involved with IBM in
developing a line-of-sight optical network, which worked brilliantly on
campus. It was confined to a couple of experimental computer labs, but
you had to keep your fingers off the mouse or keyboard, or your machine
would overload with web pages if browsing. I believe it never made it
into the world of computers for ordinary users, as the machines of the
day could not keep up.</span>

it could be made to work at a practicable user level.  But in the back
of my mind, I had a suspicion that these ideas would just hinder
investment and development of what was now a standard of motherboards

asked of it.</span>

I arrived in Canada, where I had a speaking engagement at Calgary
University – which also had a strong Tux club – and I spent some time
happily looking at a few other distros. Distrowatch had been founded
about 2001, which made it easy to keep up with Linux news, new versions
of Tux, and what system they were based on. Gentoo seemed to be

attracted me at times. But eventually, I always went back to Ubuntu – 
until I learned of <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/">Ubuntu MATE</a>.
The University had a pre-release copy of Ubuntu MATE 14.10, along with a
podcast from Alan Pope and Martin Wimpress, and before I could turn
around I had it on my Asus. It was simple, everything worked, and it
removed the horrors of GNOME 3.</span>

in 2015, my wife became very unwell after a shopping trip. Getting in
touch with some medical friends, they were concerned she’d had a heart
attack. This was near the mark: she had contracted a virus which had
destroyed a third of her heart muscle. It took her a few years to die,
and a miserable time it was for her and for us both. After the funeral,
I had rented out my house and bought a Toyota motorhome, and I began
traveling around the country. I ran my Asus through a solar panel hooked
up to an inverter, a system which worked well and kept the beast
going.</span>

I discovered an amazing thing: a configurable laptop based on a

I logged on to their website, and in a state of disbelief, browsed

looked at my battered old faithful, my many-times-rebuilt Asus, and
decided the time had come. I started building. Maximum RAM and video
RAM, latest nVidia card, two SSDs, their top-of-the-line WiFi and
Bluetooth chipsets, sound cards, etc. Then, I got it sent to New
Zealand, as I was due back the next day.</span>

next Metabox was described as a Windows 10 machine, but I knew that it
would run Tux beautifully – and so it did. A few tweaks around the ACPI
subsystem and it computed away merrily, with not a BSOD in sight. A
friend of mine who had popped in for a visit was so impressed with it
that he ordered one too, and that arrived about three months later. A
quick wipe of the hard drive (thank you, Gparted!), both these machines
are still running happily, with not a cloud on the horizon.</span>

new Metabox arrived about six weeks ago, and I decided – just out of
curiosity – to leave Windows 11 on it. A most stupid decision, but as my
wife was running Windows 11 and had already blown it up once, needing a
full reset (which, to my surprise, worked), I proceeded to charge it for
the recommended 24 hours, and next day, switched it on. “Hello” it said,
in big white letters, and then the nonsense began… a torrent of unwanted
software proceeded to fill up one of my 8TB NVMe drives, culminating
after many reboots with a Chatbot, an AI “assistant”, and something
called “Co-pilot”. </span>

I cried, “not in a million years!” – and hastily plugging in my Ventoy
stick, I rebooted it into Gparted, and partitioned my hard drive for
Ubuntu MATE.</span>

far, the beast seems most appreciative, and it hums along with just a

the “Bike Angels” System for Moving Bikeshares</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
I always like a good hack. And
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/citi-bike-scam-nyc.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">this
story</a> delivers. Basically, the New York City bikeshare program has a
system to reward people who move bicycles from full stations to empty
ones. By deliberately moving bikes to create artificial problems, and
exploiting exactly how the system calculates rewards, some people are
making a lot of money.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At 10 a.m. on a Tuesday last month, seven Bike Angels descended on the
docking station at Broadway and 53rd Street, across from the Ed Sullivan
Theater. Each rider used his own special blue key -­- a reward from Citi
Bike—­ to unlock a bike. He rode it one block east, to Seventh Avenue. He
docked, ran back to Broadway, unlocked another bike and made the trip
again…

<p>
BTW, to be clear, I have no interest in working on twitter-like systems.
</p>
<p>
It’s been like a prison to writers, we’re stuck with this huge divide,
with crap on both sides.
</p>
<p>
These things exist, they have a jumble of APIs and ways to integrate.
</p>
<p>
And we’ve been playing by the rules laid down by Twitter (ev, biz and
jack) for 18 freaking years. That’s enough.
</p>
<p>
This will never get sorted out until people realize it needs sorting
out.
</p>
<p>
Not expecting much more to happen there.

<p>Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting “both
sides,” how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens
specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course
individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he
<i>doesn’t</i> threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very
revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for
you all to get in sync with the actual American history that’s being
made.</p>

<p>To my programmer friends, how long would it have taken to answer
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/66f038e3-7218-8012-a294-05bb7afa9b97">this
question</a> using Google and StackExchange. There was a bug in this one
line of code, a call to <i>new Date ()</i> in JavaScript, that was
behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The
problem: I was specifying the day as 0 and month, correctly, but the day
had to be 1 in order for it to work and without thinking I had specified
it as 0.</p>

lower interest rates two and a half years after it began to raise them
to get inflation under control, President Joe Biden spoke to the
Economic Club of Washington, D.C., a nonprofit, nonpartisan forum where
leaders from around the world can speak to larger questions about the
global economy.</p>
