<h2 id="google-and-the-innovators-dilemma-in-2024">Google and The
Innovator’s Dilemma in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
It’s overwhelming how much ground Google has to cover to get AI into all
their products, but that’s what they think they have to do, and I more
or less agree. They feel they have to because their main product,
search, is undermined by ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>

published in 1997. It’s why Netscape was able to undermine Microsoft
when the web came out. Microsoft had a huge beast they had to move,
Windows and all its apps, and while they had a hardcore, scrappy and
rich culture, they couldn’t overcome the inertia that comes from being
dug in, with their cannons pointed at the already-defeated IBM, not the
upstarts that came from the VCs in Silicon Valley.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft and the rest of the PC industry had written off Unix, but
there it was, again – ugly as ever, but with networking that realllly
worked and was easy, and the users wanted networking even though
Microsoft wanted them to want Office.
</p>
<p>
Google did the same thing with AI. As did Apple, Amazon, Facebook,
Microsoft, etc. They had AI projects, and used AI in limited areas, as
did Microsoft with Unix in the early 90s. But they couldn’t bet
everyting on it like a startup can. Now they have to. But the they don’t
have the tools needed to fight the new war. <i>That’s</i> the dilemma.
</p>
<p>
This is the toughest corner any tech company has to turn, but there is
an approach that could work for Google. Their strength is distribution.
They have all the users. They can take a product that’s ready for the
world to market in a day. But they can’t develop it. You can’t snap your
fingers and have a good new UI for every one of their products, ready in
a year, although they will try as MS tried to adapt Office to the web.
They don’t have the right people or corporate culture to do that.
Instead you have to hope you can find a great bootstrapper outside to
work with, and use their strength as a distributor to help them. This is
what I recommended for Microsoft in the 1990s, and I think I was
vindicated, it would have imho worked a lot better than the path they
chose.
</p>
<p>
But now, their second time around this loop, Microsoft has learned! With
their OpenAI partnership they’ve done exactly what I recommended in the
90s. They still have to convert all the old software and their user
interfaces around the new capabilities, but at least they also own a
share of a bootstrap that’s booming.
</p>
<p>
PS: I am blessed to have lived long enough now to have been part of now
six different rearrangements like this. I love that we have now gotten
there again. There’s absolutely no doubt now, imho. The six
rearrangements – minis, PCs, GUIs, web, Napster, and now AI.
</p>
<p>
PPS: This is all my opinion, and from the polls I did
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/16.html">yesterday</a>, it’s
obvious that many of the people in earshot don’t agree or have seen the
light yet.

2024-05-16 IRC forever!

You know the joke, right? <a href="https://xkcd.com/1782/">In the far
future, somebody, somewhere, still wants to use IRC</a>.

<p>

</p>
<p>
I’ve been working on a bot that can connect to both Discord and IRC. It
connects to Discord because this is where I found people to game with.
Discord comes with audio chat. It catapulted my gaming to a whole new
level. So much so that I decided that I’d be a paying customer. Still, I
want to be prepared for the day when Discord goes down. When it
inevitably missteps and becomes untenable. I want to have systems ready
to go.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to have something read that does
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">chat</a> for us all.

Behind the curtains, I run an IRC server using
<a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngIRCd</a>. I was able to configure
it and I was able to federate with
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a>’s IRC server.
IRC has been federated for all these years and it’s so incredibly light
weight, very much unlike XMPP and Matrix and the other options I’ve
seen.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of web-based IRC clients that give it a Discord-like
user interface. I personally run two instances of
<a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>, one that’s free for
all and one with accounts. If you register for an account, you can
upload a small amount of files for easy image sharing and the like and
it also keeps logs for you (so you don’t have to learn how to use an IRC
“bouncer”).
</p>
<p>
Other options would be <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/">Kiwi IRC</a> or
<a href="https://www.irccloud.com/">IRC Cloud</a>, if you want a paid
service.
</p>
<p>
The bot I was talking about is called
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/norn.git">Norn</a>. Right now we
have an <code>#﻿open-table</code> or <code>#﻿next-games channel</code> on
the Discord servers where people announce their games. As players sign
up, the messages get edited. It’s not really events, it’s not reminders,
it’s not a calendar, but it’s simple and it works. You can search it.
But if you’re on IRC, it doesn’t work so well. So Norn does that.
</p>
<p>
On one of the Discord server, there’s a bot called Wettergoblin (the
weather goblin) that keeps track of in-game events. Every channel has
its own time-axis and you can get an export of all the events. This is
great for coordinating the many games in the same setting, each
happening in their own channel. I really wanted something like that but
instead of using in-game time, I wanted to use real time. This
simplified the requirements for me, so Norn does a bit of that. The
Wettergoblin also does in-game weather, keeps a Greyhawk calendar, shows
a timeline comparing where the various channels are compared to each
other and all of that, which Norn doesn’t do.
</p>
<p>
Norn also acts as a dice bot and as a knowledge repository.
</p>
<p>
Game dates, sign-ups, in-game events, knowledge base, all of that
happens per channel. It’s great!
</p>
<p>
If you look at the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%C3%BCrich/Norn">bilingual
help page</a> of the bot on a phone, prepare for a bit of confusion as
the German and the English bits are interleaved. On a bigger screen,
you’d get two columns…

<h2 id="fee-only-bitcoin">Fee-Only Bitcoin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
Mining a Bitcoin block needs to be costly to ensure that the gains from
an attack on the blockchain are less than the cost of mounting it.
Miners have two sources of income to defray their costs, the block
rewards and the fees for the transactions in the block.<br /> <br /> On
April 19<sup>th</sup> the block reward was halved from 6.25BTC to
3.125BTC. This process is repeated every 210,000 blocks (about every 4
years). It limits the issuance of BTC to 21M because around 2140 the
reward will be zero; a halving will make it less than a satoshi.<br />
<br /> Long before 2140 the block rewards will have shrunk to become
insignificant compared to the fees. Below the fold I look at the
significance of the change to a fee-only Bitcoin<br />

Users wishing to transact bid the fee for their transaction in an
auction. When demand for transactions is high, fees are high, at other
times lower. The graph shows that around the halving there was heavy
demand for transactions and the average fee per transaction rose to
$127. This is an average, it is likely that the distribution of fees is
highly skewed.<br /> <br />

The lower the fee, the less likely a miner will choose to include it in
the block they are trying to mine, especially at times of high demand
for transactions. Low fee transactions can wait in the mempool for a
long time. The <i>average</i> delay on 30<sup>th</sup> September 2023
was 25,810 minutes (nearly 18 days) while the <i>median</i> delay was 10
minutes. Clearly, there was a huge flood of very low-fee
transactions.<br /> <br />

<br />As I write the average fee per transaction is $3.21 while the
average cost (reward plus fee) is $65.72, so transactions are 95%
subsidized by inflating the currency. Over time, miners reap about 1.5%
of the transaction volume. The miners’ daily income is around $30M,
below average. This is about 2.5E-5 of BTC’s “market cap”.<br /> <br />

Lets assume, optimistically, that this below average daily fraction of
the “market cap” is sufficient to deter attacks and examine what might
happen in 2036 after 3 more halvings. The block reward will be 0.39BTC.
Lets work in 2024 dollars and assume that the BTC “price” exceeds
inflation by 3.5%, so in 12 years BTC will be around $98.2K.<br />
<br /> To maintain deterrence miners’ daily income will need to be about
$50M, Each day there will be about 144 blocks generating 56.16BTC or
about $5.5M, which is 11% of the required miners’ income. Instead of 5%
of the income, fees will need to cover 89% of it. The daily fees will
need to be $44.5M. Bitcoin’s blockchain averages around 500K
transactions/day, so the average transaction fee will need to be around
$90, or around 30 times the current fee.<br /> <br /> One might think
that, were BTC to proceed properly moonwards, this problem would go
away. Lets repeat the calculation assuming BTC = $1M in 12 years.
Miners’ daily income would need to be around $500M. The daily rewards
would be about $55M, so the fees would need to be $445M, the same 11%.
Thus the average fee would need to be around $900. The problem scales
with the “price”.<br /> <br /> It seems probable that withdrawal of the
95% subsidy on transactions will cause some problems. Indeed, there is
considerable economic research making this point, including:<br />
<ul>
<li>
In 2016 Arvind Narayanan’s group at Princeton published a related
instability in Carlsten <i>et al</i>’s
<a href="http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf"><i>On the
instability of bitcoin without the block reward</i></a>. Narayanan
summarized the paper in a blog post:<br />
<blockquote>
Our key insight is that with only transaction fees, the variance of the
miner reward is very high due to the randomness of the block arrival
time, and it becomes attractive to fork a “wealthy” block to “steal” the
rewards therein.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
More generally, the analysis of 2018’s
<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24717"><i>The Economic Limits Of
Bitcoin And The Blockchain</i></a> by Eric Budish essentially concludes
that, for safety, the value of transactions in a block must be less than
the sum of the mining reward and the fees it contains.
</li>
<li>
In 2019 Raphael Auer of the Bank for International Settlements published
<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work765.pdf"><i>Beyond the doomsday
economics of “proof-of-work” in cryptocurrencies</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The key takeaway of this paper concerns the interaction of these two
limitations: proof-of-work can only achieve payment security if mining
income is high, but the transaction market cannot generate an adequate
level of income. … the economic design of the transaction market fails
to generate high enough fees. A simple model suggests that ultimately,
it could take nearly a year, or 50,000 blocks, before a payment could be
considered “final”.”

<a class="account" href="https://chirp.enworld.org/@taichara" title="@taichara@chirp.enworld.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="taichara">@taichara</span></a> pointed me
to a blog post that Creative Commons (CC) wrote in 2023 about the court
cases against GitHub, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and the claim that
their use of copyrighted works to train the machines is copyright
infringement. CC does not agree.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As Creative Commons has argued elsewhere, and others agree, I believe
that this type of use should be protected by copyright’s fair use
doctrine. In this blog post I will discuss what fair use is, what
purpose it serves, and why I believe that using copyrighted works to
train generative AI models should be permitted under this law. –
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/02/17/fair-use-training-generative-ai/">Fair
Use: Training Generative AI</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I guess I don’t mind that blog post. For one, Fair Use is a very USA
thing and I don’t live there. Furthermore, the CC licenses don’t say
“this material is fine for AI training” – so whether this is fine or not
will be decided by the courts. I would only worry if CC turns out to be
working on a version 5 of their licenses with an explicit exception for
AI training. And even then, we can keep on using version 4 of the
license. There is no automatic upgrade option.
</p>
<p>
This is why I feel fine.
</p>
<p>
Imagine the Dude from The Big Lebowski saying, “Yeah, well, that’s just,
like, their opinion…”
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t look as if CC will be changing the license. The courts still
get to decide. If the courts decide in favour of free-for-all AI
training, then rich people win for the moment. But even then, we can
still nationalise their businesses, or prohibit AI training, or raise
prices on electricity and water. The fight isn’t over. Not by a long
shot.
</p>
<p>
Maybe this is a thing with lawyers. We trust people who share our values
and we’d trust somebody when they write something along the lines of “AI
training is terrible and AI use is dubious but what can you do, it’s in
the hand of the courts, we certainly don’t support it.” But lawyers
trust other lawyers who say “we’ll see what the courts say but our
understanding is that nobody should stop AI training because that’s the
trade-off copyright makes and we support people and corporations
exercising their rights.”
</p>
<p>
The apparent moral support on copyright grounds is revolting, but this
approach seems typical to me. They say: The point of the law is this or
that. We say: The result of these actions is bad for society and bad for
the climate. They are externalising all the costs. The artists and
authors who want to produce new works are losing their jobs. The people
double-checking the computers and their training are burning out. The
communities where these corporations build their computing centres
suffer from water scarcity because the water is used to cool the
computers. The countries where these corporations build their computing
centres need to build more power plants because so much electricity is
required to train their models. The move to renewable energies is
delayed. Phasing out nuclear power is delayed and more radioactive waste
ends up on our lands.

Or we can believe in nuclear fusion:

<blockquote>
<p>
AI models made up of billions of parameters require huge amounts of
energy to train. OpenAI’s old GPT-3 system reportedly consumed 936
megawatt hours … the average household consumes about 10.5 MWh per year.
That means training GPT-3 consumed as much energy as about 90 households
consume in a year. –

<p>
Sadly, nuclear fusion only seems to be working inside the sun:

<p>
And what for? The people who are looking for answers get served bullshit
slop that’s wrong and hurtful and racist and misogynist. We see this in
customer service degrading, in search engines degrading, in websites
degrading. The corporations don’t mind that they’re feeding us slop as
long as they are making money.
</p>
<p>
We are enabling this because these corporations are powerful and rich.
They buy our politicians with money and promises of jobs, they don’t pay
the taxes they ought to pay and then they don’t deliver on the jobs, and
the jobs they offer are menial and subservient when we’d prefer to be
creative and free. We thought we’d be writing and painting all day while
the machines serve us but we end up serving them while they do the
writing and painting, badly!
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to defend against these corporations because the knowledge
required to defeat them is not known to us all. We don’t read about it
in the media. Instead, they volunteer for all the posts, offer their
experts, pay for their own research, write their own glowing press
releases and commission promising reports. This is how regulatory
capture works.
</p>
<p>
So yes, we should nationalise them, regulate them, force them to pay for
the true cost of resources they use, outlaw their energy waste, force
them to label their output, shun them. We should kick them from our
company. Like a creeping disease their rot spreads, destroying the
technology we built, the search engines, databases, websites, turning it
all into AI slop. It is revolting.
</p>
<p>
And maybe copyright is not the right tool to stop corporations from
training their machines on our works. But in the big picture, they are
still wrong.
</p>
<p>

<p>
The folks who are calling such training “theft” might regret what they
seem to be implicitly asking for, i.e. much stricter copyright.
Copyright law won’t prevent Microsoft, Google, OpenAI or Adobe from

community from keeping up.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s true, I don’t want to ask for stricter copyright. But I still
oppose all the things that are wrong with the current AI bubble.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc" title="@mcc@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mcc">@mcc</span></a> recently wrote about a
similar thing: We use free software licenses in order to distribute our

train the machines of corporations that are responsible for all the
slop.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Like, heck, how am I <em>supposed</em> to rely on my code getting

<em>want</em> people to want their code widely mirrored and distributed.
That was the reason for the licenses. That was the social contract. But
if machine learning means the social contract is dead, why would people
want their code mirrored? –

</blockquote>
<p>
We’re using copyright to keep the software free. If AI regurgitating our
software from its impenetrable memories circumvents copyright it also
circumvents our licenses and therefore pulls the claws and teeth free
software has to fight for its freedom.
</p>
<p>
This is why opposing the current AI bubble is important. No matter how I
look at it, the big picture shows that this kind of AI is our enemy.
It’s just that copyright is the wrong weapon.
</p>
<p>
This is why we continue fighting all the negatives these corporations
bring to the table. And if it turns out that their business model
doesn’t work unless they bring all these negatives to the table, then I
guess that’s just that. We are under no obligation to support their
business model. In fact, it is our right and our duty to regulate the
world in order to improve it for all of us. We’ve been doing it for a
very long time.

Here’s to hoping for the next AI winter.

<blockquote>
<p>
In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of
reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The
field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment
and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest
years or even decades later. –

the wrong weapon:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Creative workers who hope that they can use copyright law to prevent AI
from changing the creative labor market are likely to be very
disappointed in court … Individual creative workers rarely have any
bargaining leverage over the corporations that license our copyrights. …
Rather than going to Congress alongside our bosses from the studios and
labels and publishers to demand more copyright, we could go to Congress
alongside every kind of worker, from fast-food cashiers to publishing
assistants to truck drivers to demand the right to sectoral bargaining.

<h2 id="dave-goes-microsoft">Dave Goes Microsoft</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Last Monday was my first day as an official employee of Microsoft where
I’ll be working on web components as part of the
<a href="https://fluent2.microsoft.design/">Fluent</a> design system
team. As longtime readers already know, I’ve had a long term
relationship with Microsoft – from
<a href="https://paravelinc.com/work/microsoft/">Paravel’s 2012
responsive redesign of the Microsoft homepage</a> to the five year
<a href="https://daverupert.com/tag/davegoeswindows">#davegoeswindows</a>
stunt –  it feels like a new chapter in the career story arc to finally
acquire one of the famous blue badges. I’m still new and have barely
setup my computer but so far my team of peers, the larger group, the
project itself, and the other folks across Microsoft I’ve connected with
are all great.
</p>
<p>
Going from a company with two coworkers to a company with 200K coworkers
is certainly an adjustment. It’s my first job in 18 years where I’m not
working for myself but by far the biggest eye-opener throughout this
process was doing tech interviews! I learned a lot about myself; like
how after decades of coding in a room by myself, performing in front of
someone else isn’t natural for me. Weirdly for me, a live demo in front
of thousands of people… no problem. A random generated coding challenge
in front of one person… palms sweaty, mom’s spaghetti levels of
difficult. I also learned that too much caffeine and the panic-flavored
adrenaline of interviewing is a lot of chemistry for my active brain to
process.
</p>
<p>
I eventually figured out how to interview and I had a lot of great
conversations with great people at great companies. That said, this
experience left me with lingering qualms about the tech interview
process. A lot of it comes down to the information asymmetry where the
seller (the hiring company) has more information than the buyer (the job
candidate) and it’s hard to get any feedback for self-improvement. Even
in my limited experience, it’s not uncommon to sink 15+ hours into a
take home coding test and interview loop only to receive a terse
rejection. Granted there’s promise of a six figure salary at the end of
the rainbow, these jobs don’t fall out of the sky so you need to put in
work, but I think that situation needs to be a bit more equitable to
candidates – a Newtonian dynamic of matching effort.
</p>
<p>
One question they ask you at interviews is “What are you looking for in
your next role?” and while that sparks thousands of ideas, I boiled my
needs and wants down to two core concepts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Be a part of a larger team of engineers</strong> - I’d like to
work on a larger team of developers. I want to be in a situation where I
can actively and passively learn from other engineers who are subject
matter experts in different subjects. As a life-long learner, I’d like
to take myself out of the “lone developer” paradigm and absorb as much
as I can.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Be tangential to the money machine</strong> - When you run your
own business there’s a tight coupling between <em>how much you work</em>
and <em>how much money you make</em> and you’re constantly aware of that
fact. After 18 years of running my own business and two particularly
intense years of startup burnout, I’d like to try something different
and play a more supportive operational role for a bit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think I found that in Microsoft. There’s a multitude of people I can
ping about niche technology choices. There’s even access to a library of
research papers. And already I can see how operating in a product
support role seems to provide more opportunity for strategy to the
broader needs of the organization as opposed to reactivity to the needs
<em>du jour</em> that happen in Productland.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure throughput will be a bit slower without direct access to the
publish to production button. I’m sure there’s topics I won’t be able to
talk about on this here blog (but I tend not to blog about specific
work-related activities here anyways so that won’t change). And I’m sure
I’ll have to put a disclaimer here and there that these ideas are my own
and not reflective of my employer. Henceforth and furthermore all bad
ideas are copyright of Dave Rupert LLC®.
</p>
<p>
It’s the end of an era for sure but also the beginning of a new one and
potentially the beginning of lots of new ones, who knows. Thanks to
Trent and Reagan. Thanks to everyone who provided emotional support on
this journey. Thanks to esteemed friends who provided referrals. Given
the current macroeconomic situation, I feel lucky to have landed
somewhere familiar with great opportunities and many Dave Rupert-shaped
problems.

<p>The thing that
<a href="https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/">Casey
Newton predicts</a> for Google and news has already happened for the
huge base of reference info and know-how for software development. We no
longer go to the sources, don’t need to, the ChatGPT version is an order
of magnitude better. What we do need is people to keep asking and
answering questions for each other, so the knowledge can be added into
the AI database. We’re going somewhere here. It’s worth going there,
imho, having experienced the before, and only starting to glimpse the
now and near-future. But it’s as big a step as the move to PCs, then

I’d like from ChatGPT or a plug-in. I’d like to create a notebook of
info I’d like it to have available for people who inquire about a
product I’m developing. As I’m working on the code, I develop features
that sometimes don’t make it into the docs. But when I’m working on the
feature, I take lots of notes in my work outline. I’d like to give that
outline to a LLM and let it figure out which product I’m talking about
by the context it appears in. Maybe all I have to do is publish the
notes when the product comes out, and eventually, like a search engine,
my favorite AI will crawl it. I wonder if it makes sense to somehow
pre-digest it. I wish I had a panel of experts about this stuff, but I

<p>
Microsoft is
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/microsoft-plans-to-lock-down-windows-dns-like-never-before-heres-how/">working
on</a> a promising-looking protocol to lock down DNS.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
ZTDNS aims to solve this decades-old problem by integrating the Windows
DNS engine with the Windows Filtering Platform—the core component of the
Windows Firewall—directly into client devices.
</p>
<p>
Jake Williams, VP of research and development at consultancy Hunter
Strategy, said the union of these previously disparate engines would
allow updates to be made to the Windows firewall on a per-domain name
basis. The result, he said, is a mechanism that allows organizations to,
in essence, tell clients “only use our DNS server, that uses TLS, and
will only resolve certain domains.” Microsoft calls this DNS server or
servers the “protective DNS server.”…

is not over-hyped</a>, imho. I’m discovering new significance for it
every day. An example. I had to go back to some very complex code I
wrote a week ago. I wanted to give it new flexibility, that would be
simple from the user’s point of view, and in order for it to work
technically it has to maintain that simplicity internally. It’s a tall
order to go back to something complex a week after writing it, and rip
it apart and put it back together and have it retain the simplicity it
had before. But I had an advantage this time that I had never had
before, a programming partner with a perfect memory. I had written the
original code with ChatGPT. So I went back and asked it to review my
plan, and then worked with it step by step as I had before. It had
perfect recall, right, of course where my recall is pretty sketchy. It
took two sessions to get it done, but it works now, and I’m confident
I’ve covered all the bases. How do you put that story in a press
release? If you want to understand a new technology, don’t talk to the
CEO of the tech company that made the product, their lives are
whirlwinds, they don’t have time or the capacity to understand how big
the idea is, they just know that it is big. If you want to understand
you have to use it and you have to talk with other users.</p>

anything for them. It might expose me to malware or having my interests
shared with businesses who will use that info for who-knows-what. Much
better would be to let me click a button to give them $0.50 to read the
freaking article that’s behind that idiotic dialog, and btw, the payment
would have to be anonymous or I’m clicking the Back button. I really did
want to know what happens if Trump is found guilty and sentenced to
prison. I still do. But I don’t think I’m going to turn off my ad
blocker. I’ll think about it. In the meantime if they had let me pay
them $0.50 to read the freaking article, I might have linkblogged it to
people who follow me via RSS or email, or on Bluesky or Mastodon, thus
giving them a chance to sell others on paying $0.50 to read the freaking
article. Not promising I’d do that, but if they really answer the
question, if I really learn something I certainly would pass it along.
Come on USA Today, get conscious. We’ll happily support you for giving
us info we wanted, just let us actually help you in a meaningful way,

<p>Friends, In a few weeks, Donald Trump may be a convicted criminal.
It’s hardly a sure thing, of course. All he needs for a mistrial is one
holdout juror. But the evidence so far seems overwhelming and damning.
So we have to face a daunting reality. For the first time in history, a
convicted criminal may be the nominee of one of our major parties and on
November’s presidential ballot.</p>

<p>
For years, SBCs that aren’t Raspberry Pis experimented with eMMC and M.2
storage interfaces. While the Raspberry Pi went from full-size SD card
in the first generation to microSD in every generation following
(Compute Modules excluded), other vendors like Radxa, Orange Pi, Banana
Pi, etc. have been all over the place.
</p>
<p>
Still, <em>most</em> of the time a fallback microSD card slot remains.
</p>
<p>
But microSD cards—even the fastest UHS-II/A2/V90/etc. ones that
advertise hundreds of MB/sec—are laggards when it comes to any kind of
SBC workflow.
</p>
<p>
The two main reasons they’re used are cost and size. They’re tiny, and
they don’t cost much, especially if you don’t shell out for
industrial-rated microSD cards.

<p>BTW, I’ve been to three
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote">Stevenotes</a>, the
first one, the rollout of the Mac in 1984, then the rollout of NeXT in
1988, and a random press event in 1997 announcing they were going with
Unix server products instead of the homegrown much easier to use Mac
server products. We could have had both of course, but Jobs never really
wanted developers imho, truth be told. We were inside in 1984 because
Mike Boich and Guy Kawasaki were doing the evangelism.</p>

they already had all of that stuff, they certainly had been at least
telegraphing it. Also there never will be another Steve Jobs, it’s too

In this picture he either looks dangerous or defeated, or both. I
wouldn’t want to have to play against him tonight.
</p>
<p>
Here’s my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly
did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a
double team, to free up one of the Knicks’ assassins. Or maybe he’ll be
more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or
three.

<p>
And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent

a crazy world, so crazy that RFK, Jr <i>could</i> be elected president
via a third-party. He’s a better speaker than either of the other
candidates. If he didn’t a speech impediment I’d say he was basically a
sure thing. I don’t know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up
nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good
PR training somewhere, it’s probably not just from the genes, he is a
freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised
him well. I’m voting for Biden of course. I’m not that crazy. But people
are tired of Biden, I understand why – and they want a president they
can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something
grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump.
Before it’s over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a
possible future president, where “future” is less than a year away.</p>

<p>👏 I appreciate the work you’ve done on this gRegor! I know I’m
unlikely to attend any in-person event soon, in part due to not
traveling and in part from worry over event logistics, so I haven’t
bothered to get into the details of what would make me feel safe to
attend. I worried that […]</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve recently been debugging some NVMe / PCIe bus errors on a Raspberry Pi, and I wanted a quick way to test NVMe devices without needing to create a filesystem and use a tool like &lt;code&gt;iozone&lt;/code&gt;. I don&#39;t care about benchmarks, I just want to quickly push the drive and read and write some data to it.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
<code>fio</code> is the tool for the job, and after a quick install
<code>sudo apt install -y fio</code>, I create a configuration file
named <code>nvme-read.fio</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[global]
name=nvme-seq-read
time_based
ramp_time=5
runtime=30
readwrite=read
bs=256k
ioengine=libaio
direct=1
numjobs=1
iodepth=32
group_reporting=1
[nvme0]
filename=/dev/nvme0n1
</code></pre>
<p>
Then run it with:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo fio nvme-read.fio
</code></pre>
<p>
Easy way to put some stress on the drive, and test your PCIe setup and
the drive itself.

feel like crap today, the Knicks were blown out by the Indiana team, the

this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. “It’s
been a great season, but we’re tired. We’re headed to the beach, we’ll
see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support.” I would nod my
head and say “Yeah that makes sense.” Whatever. I may spend today
sleeping it off. Next game is tomorrow night. Yes, they will play, for

<p>
Back in the 1960s, if you played a 2,600Hz tone into an AT&amp;T pay
phone, you could make calls without paying. A phone hacker named
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper">John Draper</a>
noticed that the
<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/capn-crunch-whistle">plastic
whistle</a> that came free in a box of Captain Crunch cereal worked to
make the right sound. That became his hacker name, and everyone who knew
the trick made free pay-phone calls.
</p>
<p>
There were all sorts of related hacks, such as faking the tones that
signaled coins dropping into a pay phone and faking tones used by repair
equipment. AT&amp;T could sometimes change the signaling tones, make
them more complicated, or try to keep them secret. But the general class
of exploit was impossible to fix because the problem was general: Data
and control used the same channel. That is, the commands that told the
phone switch what to do were sent along the same path as voices…

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Import
unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-made-switch-aperture-photos&quot;&gt;migrate my photo library from Apple&#39;s now-defunct Aperture to Photos&lt;/a&gt;, so I could take advantage of Apple&#39;s iCloud Photo Library (don&#39;t worry, I still have three full complete local backups, plus a separate cloud backup besides Apple&#39;s iCloud originals).&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models,
their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like
Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work
with the new camera models.
</p>
<p>
I don’t envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple’s official
successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits
as a semi-decent library organizer), they’ve <em>generally</em> done
well supporting new camera models. The compatibility list for
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105094">macOS Sonoma, iPadOS
17, and iOS 17</a> is a testament to that effort.

<h2 id="did-student-protesters-affect-bidens-decision">Did student
protesters affect Biden’s decision?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>Friends, This weekend, tens of thousands of students are graduating
from American colleges and universities. Some graduation ceremonies have
been cancelled or at least inconvenienced by student protests. Just so
there’s no confusion, let me state clearly that I’m deeply opposed to
Hamas. I was appalled by the atrocities it committed on October 7 that
left 1,200 Israelis dead and took 134 people as hostages, including
babies, children, women, and older people. And I firmly believe in
Israel’s existence and its right to protect itself.</p>

is like a worldwide encyclopedia that comes with a free librarian, 24
hours a day, who never gets tired and thinks all your questions are
super insightful. I suppose everyone projects their ideal best friend on
this thing. You just learned something about me. Heh. But the cool thing
is it’s not a yes-person, if they think you’re wrong they say so. Which
I <i>really</i> like. One more thing I’m really glad I got to be alive
when this stuff came online. I feel much smarter and better organized
and it’s harder for me to get lost in the weeds, as I do sometimes. I
guess what want next is a librarian who also is a great executive
assistant. Takes notes on what I’m doing and figures out what I need to
be reminded of and roughly when.</p>

I just put one idea on my blog for a day and leave it at that because I
think the idea is important enough on its own, and that any explanation
would dilute it. Yesterday’s one sentence
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was
based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their
executive editor in a recent
<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>,
who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not
reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion
leaders, to determine what they cover, that’s marketing, not journalism.
Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over
another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is
not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my
readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept
this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their
responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the
tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the
climate?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">
2024-05-12 What do about the climate?
</h1>
<p>
The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way
out of this uncertainty? What should or
<a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?
</p>
<p>
Before we even start, let me just say that I’m never interested in
debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It’s real, it’s
here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.
</p>
<p>
The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green,
on all levels of government. And by “green” I mean the most radical
green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends
on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a
one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have
no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something
about local politics, and so on.
</p>
<p>
On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we’re not
sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn’t help much against the
climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many
plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean?
How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The
oil spills? And here’s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop!
I need to stop because there’s no “thinking it through” when things are
so complex unless you’re a scientist working on it. I hope the
scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the
research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and
individuals know what to tackle first.
</p>
<p>
This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly
wrong. They don’t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used
to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid
of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting
involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric
vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency
vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also:
get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing
something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then
medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build
railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special
permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society
with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are
precious.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I
fear.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.
</p>

<p>
The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate
Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there’s an answer if anybody is
claiming that we don’t know what to do. But also: there’s your answer if
you’re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top
need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what
little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a
very small number of people that have actually read this report, let
alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.
</p>
<p>
This is why a public “chain of trust” needs to lead from interviews with
public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social
media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with
people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance,
hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders
trust in people.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of
choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or
for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we
need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a>
right.
</p>
<p>
(We don’t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we
cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to
go.)
