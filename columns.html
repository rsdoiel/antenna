<p>
I keep thinking about self-hosting and people dying, myself included. So
my first wish for the end of the year is a solar-powered machine that
takes all my websites and turns them into clay tablets to bury and
survive the coming darkness.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, however, I think the solution would have to involve a
kind decentralized archive sharing where I offer an archive (zip,
tarball) for download and whoever has it can share it peer-to-peer with
others. Is this how
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>
works? I think I don’t understand what words like “tracker” mean. Also,
where does the original torrent come from and where does it go? I know
there are sites where I can search for and download torrent files. But
what happens if Alice has a file she wants to share with others
including Bob, does she create a torrent and offers it on her website,
Bob finds it, downloads it, runs a torrent client and gets a copy. If
Alice and her website disappear, how does Charlie get a copy now? Bob
isn’t hosting Alice’s torrent file on his website. So are they all
dependent on a torrent hosting site?
</p>
<p>
I’m only half-aware of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">InterPlanetary
File-System</a> (IPFS) and when I read the Wikipedia page, there’s stuff
about hashes and content addressing, but how does that work from a user
perspective? Is there a directory? How does Charlie learn about Alice’s
site that’s no longer online and how does Charlie get a copy from Bob?
Can Bob make a list of files on offer and Charlie can get them all,
maybe from Bob and maybe from others?
</p>
<p>
In this case, preservation would mean: you need people interested in
keeping a copy; the copies need to survive; the copies must be listed;
the lists must be distributed widely; at least some people must make
copies of these lists.
</p>
<p>
So, for me and you and some other fedi randos, we could have a “fedi
website archive” list where our names are listed together with the
hashes pointing to the content, and some IPFS client would keep it in
sync.
</p>
<p>
The next question, though: how do we keep this list updated? What little
I know about the blockchains underlying these protocols is that they are
immutable so is there a way to say: “this is the updated list”? That
would require some sort of social control and trust, too. An association
of the living members of the “fedi website archive” list that manages
the yearly updates, perhaps?
</p>
<p>
And so how would the maintenance actually work, I wonder. I write a web
app. We chat. (I think the human element is important.) You have an
account based on an email address and upload an archive and give it a
name (the name of your website, a short description, its current URL).
Once a year, the living associates meet and discuss whether to dump some
of their members who have turned fascist or whatnot (sadly, always a
possibility). Then we use the data gathered by the website to generate a
new “directory” list with names, description, URL and hash (the URL may
no longer work) and all the members share or host (??) this new
directory and drop previous directories so that the old versions of our
sites can be forgotten. And the IPFS clients do the magic of actually
exchanging the archive bytes?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps all of this only requires BitTorrent and hosting the torrent
files on our own websites.
</p>
<p>
Would that work? Would you want to be part of this association? We could
create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_association">an
association according to Swiss law</a>. There are some famous
international orgs that use this format.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@edsu" title="@edsu@social.coop"><span
class="citation" data-cites="edsu">@edsu</span></a> wrote back, talking
about
<a href="https://inkdroid.org/2024/10/20/pincushion/">pincushion</a>.
And that’s what it is all about:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The basic idea is that users should be able to download and view their
data without losing the context they have added. We want a pincushion to
represent a user’s collections, pins, images, videos, audio, tags,
locations, comments … and we want users to be able to view this content
when Historypin is no longer online, or even when the user isn’t online.
Maybe the pincushion is discovered on an old thumbdrive in a shoebox
under the bed.
</p>
<p>
This means that the resources being served dynamically by the Historypin
application need to be serialized as files, and specifically as files
that can be viewed directly in a browser: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JPEG,
PNG, MP3, MP4, JSON. Once a users content can be represented as a set of
static files they can easily be distributed, copied, and opportunities
for replicating them using technologies like IPFS become much more
realistic.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is what I’m talking about! It’s all about exporting user data out
of a dynamic site into a form based on static files.
</p>
<p>
<a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> tries to do the same: all the pages you
write, all the files you upload, everything can be downloaded as a
static website. The dynamic wiki application on top of it is essentially
optional.
</p>
<p>
There are two things I still haven’t solved, though:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Bots crawling the web downloading the zip file again and again.
</li>
<li>
A distribution procedure and organisation that keeps it alive.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Perhaps BitTorrent is the better solution. There are a gazillion tools.
It’s been around for a while. It seems like a stable platform.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@edsu" title="@edsu@social.coop"><span
class="citation" data-cites="edsu">@edsu</span></a> also added:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You might want to check out how Magnet Links work, which let users share
links to their torrents and retrieve the metadata and data from peers
using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). IPFS uses a DHT as well.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is the way forward. People host to the latest torrent file
and host a copy of the data.
</p>
<p>
The org gets together once a year to celebrate, to welcome new members,
to honor those who have passed, the review complaints, produces a new
torrent file and we all agree to update our link.
</p>
<p>
All of this while keeping in mind the two forces pulling in opposite
directions: We want the right to curate, forget, delete, revise, but we
also want to archive in a decentralized fashion.
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that the only way to “solve” this currently is via a
social process. I suspect that the problem of reconciling these two
requirements is fundamentally not solvable on a technical level.
</p>
<p>
And we need to start practising now, while we’re alive.

First, solder on four minuscule capacitors (rating may be gleaned off
the CM5 IO Board schematics, I think?) on the PCIe lines heading to the
NVMe slot. These are <em>incredibly</em> small, so a good microscope and
decent SMD soldering skills are pretty necessary.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On December 4, a malicious version 8.3.41 of the popular AI library
<i>ultralytics</i> ­—which has almost 60 million downloads—was published
to the Python Package Index (PyPI) package repository. The package
contained downloader code that was downloading the <i>XMRig</i>
coinminer. The compromise of the project’s build environment was
achieved by exploiting a known and previously reported GitHub Actions
script injection.

<h2 id="mid-day-ramble">Mid-day ramble</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
There was a moment a couple of years ago when Mastodon was gaining
traction in a serious way when I thought that Automattic should do
something publicly to demonstrate support for it because I felt that
WordPress and Mastodon were two sides of the same important coin.
</p>
<p>
As you know, I’ve felt as a writer that we’ve been tragically limited by
the idea that Twitter popularized that there was glory in removing
features that writers could use. As if to say that writers were
over-using things like links, simple styling, titles, the ability to
edit, or to finish a thought. These were all very basic features of
writing on the web before 2006, as they should have been.
</p>
<p>
Somehow a mass psychosis took over and there was a belief that these
limits were good. I am shaking my head as I write this. It’s as
ridiculous an idea as the one that’s going around at the top levels of
our
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-discuss-ending-childhood-vaccination-programs-with-rfk-jr-2024-12-12/">future</a>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE4.9RTQ.LzniX-N7b4Jd&smid=bs-share">government</a>
that we should
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio">bring
polio back</a> to the children of America and the world.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, by supporting Mastodon, I hoped people would make the link
between WordPress, which has none of those limits, yet is very popular
for publishing on the web, and Mastodon, which I (it turns out
correctly) believed would navigate away from those limits given enough
time.
</p>
<p>
I think I sent an email or a text message to Matt, or wrote a note on
their Slack system, communicating with Matt is an iffy thing, not sure
if the idea got through. Then this morning, I woke in the middle of the
night, and realized that what I wished for was actually there. Without
any fanfare at all. I could write on WordPress and it would
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113644817289884129">appear
on Mastodon</a>. How is that not <i>exactly</i> what I asked for? And
theoretically at least (someone should test this) you can access my
WordPress writing on Threads, the system that Facebook launched to (as
it turns out) compete with Bluesky! (In addition to Twitter, which is no
longer called Twitter of course.) What a strange world it is.
</p>
<p>
And in the interim, the focus has gone off the social web, imho because
the limits are still very much in force at Bluesky, which still insists
a post can only have 300 freaking characters and no links, styles etc
blah blah blah and yadda yadda. <i>We’re still having this argument.
</i>Programmers vs writers. The world has lost its mind.
</p>
<p>
And in another thread there are idiots who propose trying to vilify and
presumably
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture">cancel</a> people
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/12/161258.html">who</a> drive
Teslas as if the car you use for transport is as trivial a possession as
a fur coat.
</p>
<p>
I’m having a great day, no sarcasm, all of a sudden I feel like we might
actually be winning, again.

I saw a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zephoria.bsky.social/post/3ld275e2kpk2u">pundit</a>
suggest people harass people who drive Teslas.
</p>
<p>
When I bought mine, it cost $70K, a large sum of money that I will not
throw away just so a pundit can make a point.
</p>
<p>
Here’s my rebuttal. I’d like to see you get on without buying Exxon
products. We all agree they suck, but evil companies have a way of
building dependence, that’s how they stay in business while openly doing
despicable things.
</p>
<p>
When I put down $70K for what is, btw, a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/07/142329.html">fantastic car</a>,
no one knew how evil Elon Musk was going to turn out to be, how little
he would care what you and I think.
</p>
<p>
And I don’t believe anyone can live a pure life and extract all evil
from it, and still participate in civilization.

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johnspurlock.com/post/3ld5fpnbp7s2c">what</a>
that means. But if they ever actually stop showing scripting.com, which
will always be plain old HTTP, I’ll probably ship an Electron product

<h2 id="answers-for-a-tester">Answers for a tester</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A valued tester of <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>
asked a series of questions, which I answered in some detail, and felt
it was a good idea to post the answers here on my blog.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Any kind of feedback you want to give is totally welcome. I’d prefer it
be in the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues">GitHub
issues section</a> so it might inspire other people to contribute.
</li>
<li>
Re image insertion, I’m not sure it could be simpler. The goal is to get
an image into the user’s document. If it succeeded at doing that then
I’m happy with the design. ;-)
</li>
<li>
The target audience is writers who use WordPress. The idea is to put all
the features writers need in one place, rather than scattered around the
WP interface. And to use modern UI techniques you’d see in social web
apps.
</li>
<li>
I’ve tried to answer the questions you raised in the only way I can. For
example I need to use a term for the arrows that move you through the
stories you’ve written. They aren’t all posts, but they are all drafts.
I can explain that in the docs, but I seriously doubt if anyone would
read them. There is a distinction and it’s important to make that
distinction. I also don’t think it’s crucial to get that one “right” –
not that I think there is a right answer to that one other than removing
the feature, which I like having there because it emphasizes that we’re
working with a set of documents that you can edit.
</li>
<li>
In all cases, you could raise any issue you have, I will think about
what you say, but accept my response, and trust that I’ve incorporated
your experience as data that might inspire a change in the design at
some point.
</li>
<li>
But do understand that a lot of thought has already gone into this, and
a quick review by a new user is no substitute for a product design.
</li>
<li>
I know the docs are non-existent. I am limited in the time I have and
the commitments I’ve made. The truth is that even dedicated users won’t
read them. I know that by the questions they ask. But I will write the
docs.
</li>
<li>
What I suggest is you try using the product for its intended purpose,
and assume that all feedback is welcome (it is) but once it has been
registered, you should move on to the next thing.
</li>
<li>
I’ve worked with testers many times going back a very long time. I’ve
even hired testers. I don’t take offense to critiques of the software.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
BTW, if after reading this, you think you could be this kind of tester
for <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, and you have
experience with WordPress, and a site on wordpress.com, and are excited
about the idea of a simple way to write and manage lots of documents in
a WordPress environment, please
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuk4REqAIkKs9vHf4ExMN_jtANenoDl0ciUxeLSFVmtehZ_Q/viewform">fill
out this form</a>, I’ll read it right away, and if it seems like a fit,
I’ll authorize your account.

<p>I have United Healthcare insurance. I got it as part of my Medicare
package when I turned 65. I’ve had good experience with them. I had
major surgery in 2002, cost hundreds of thousands, included a one-week
hospital stay and lots of followup treatments. I know the hospital did
all the work with them, I was shielded from any complications, but as
far as I know there were none. Never had a treatment questioned or
denied. I had another insurance provider for many years after that, but
when given a chance I went back to United. Just want to say, so far –
knock wood – I am a happy customer.</p>

<p>Just added to my todo list – add the option to use the
<a href="https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi">WordPress REST
interface</a> in place of the
<a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wpcom.js">WPCOM interface</a>,
this will give <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> the
ability to edit WordPress sites anywhere, not just on wordpress.com.
When I made the choice to go with WPCOM I didn’t have ChatGPT to look at
the other options, I was surprised to find that WordPress actually had a
good JavaScript API. It doesn’t look like the conversion will be too
bad. It’s obviously better to be able to work with all WordPress
sites.</p>

<h2 id="intermittent-fasting">Intermittent fasting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<aside>
<p>
⚠️ Content warning: Weight loss, feel free to skip if that is not a good
topic for you.
</p>
</aside>
<p>
A doctor told me to look into intermittent fasting. Not for weight loss,
but for ADHD. There’s some
<a href="https://www.addrc.org/the-role-of-brain-insulin-in-adhd-emerging-evidence/">new
data that suggests a link between ADHD and insulin in the brain</a>.
Based on that science, intermittent fasting or a ketogenic diet –which
can help improve insulin resistance– might help my brain. I’m a week
into it and am seeing some weight loss, but it’s hard to tell with the
ADHD without measuring my brainflorps per second. I might be more
focused, but hunger and “hangry” bring their own distractions.
</p>
<p>
I’m skeptical, to say the least. Intermittent fasting makes frequent
appearances in my YouTube shorts with balding Joe Rogan clones dressed
in all black selling workout supplements. It has a whiff of being a
cure-all. To counter that skepticism, I read a book called
<a href="https://amzn.to/4fRPUMt"><em>Life in the Fasting Lane</em></a>
co-authored by Dr Jason Fung, who was specifically recommended to me.
It’s a mix of doctorly advice and testimonials from advocates who have
had success with fasting. As scientific as the book tries to be, it
undoes its own credibility pitching intermittent fasting with all the
hallmarks of a fad elimination diet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lose weight in 30 days
</li>
<li>
Reduce cravings
</li>
<li>
Live longer
</li>
<li>
Reverse diseases
</li>
<li>
Helps you focus at work
</li>
<li>
Improves your sex life
</li>
<li>
Big pharma doesn’t want you to know about this one weird trick!
</li>
<li>
Used by ancient civilizations. Ugh. The appeal to history (ancient,
therefore good!) is a major pet peeve of mine.
</li>
<li>
And my least favorite: It doesn’t cure cancer, but it cures obesity,
which causes all different kinds of cancer… so we’re not gonna say it
cures cancer because that’s a douchebag thing to say, but it <em>doesn’t
not</em> cure cancer if you catch our drift (wink).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I do appreciate that the book calls out “Calories-In/Calories-Out” as a
myth that works 1% of the time. But it’s hard to shake the feeling that
eliminating meals or days worth of food isn’t a macro-version of
calories-in/calories-out, where you measure calories in weeks instead of
per meal. I suppose the key difference is the duration between meals
allows my body to enter ketosis (read: a starving state) which will
consume my excess fat stores instead of my morning breakfast tacos
adding to those fat stores.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I’m a good candidate for this fad diet. I can sustain
myself on a couple meals a day. I could skip lunch most days. Skipping
breakfast though is hard. Not putting creamer in my morning coffee is
hard. Not having a little after dinner snack with the kids is hard. Not
eating is not my favorite, but I’m going to trust the process for a bit
and hopefully it’ll help a weary brain like mine.

<h1 id="2024-12-09-burned">
2024-12-09 Burned
</h1>
<p>
This page is about me burning myself on a Raclette table-grill.
</p>
<p>
I’m no longer quite sure of the timeline. I think I got the burn on
2024-12-03 or 2024-12-04.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-05</strong>: Two days ago I got myself a second degree
burn about one inch in diameter from our Raclette oven. I hadn’t burned
myself in about forty years, I think and I feel like a kid again,
observing the body as it reacts. The healing powers are so weird.
</p>
<p>
Also I’m thankful for these self-healing capabilities we have! And
thankful for this accident to be a curiosity instead of an emergency. A
good reminder to be thankful for all the good days we have and I hope
you’re having a good day! Live long and prosper. Or, as I usually tell
me wife: healthy, happy, and in love. Be well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-07</strong>: The skin around the burn had reddened and
had swollen a bit. I went to the pharmacy and got a disinfectant cream
and wound pads. This was Saturday afternoon and no more doctors were
available. Since this wasn’t an emergency, there’s was rush.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-09</strong>: The minor burn resulted in some sort of
low-key infection, so now it’s antibiotic to swallow and antibiotics to
apply.
</p>
<p>
Some things I’m learning from this experience:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I knew about cold, running water and left my arm under that cold tap for
many long minutes. Maybe not long enough? I don’t know. It felt ready to
fall off. 😆
</li>
<li>
The burn might look like a typical abrasion but you have to keep it
super clean. Best cover it with those special wound covers that don’t
stick to the wound (nothing we would have had at home so off to the
pharmacy you go, immediately, unlike me).
</li>
<li>
It might look dry and clean like blisters you got from a long hike but
the bedsheets or long sleeves or whatever will pass on germs and since
there is a piece of your exterior protection missing, you’ll get an
infection. The skin around the wound is a bit red, the area a bit
swollen, a bit warmer. And that already concerns the doctors.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ed-is-the-standard">2024-12-09 ed is the standard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-12-09-ed-is-the-standard">
2024-12-09 ed is the standard
</h1>
<p>
<code>ed</code> is <a href="true-path">the standard editor</a>, they
say. I have strange fascination with it.
</p>
<p>
<code>ed</code> is a window in the past. This is a line-based editor,
not a screen-based editor. It can be used with a line-printer instead of
a screen. This also means that working with it is very different. I’ll
try to collect some interesting command sequences on this page.
</p>
<p>
I use <code>ed</code> to send mail from the command line. One way I do
this is by using <code>mail</code> on the server. It’s a line-oriented
mail client. You can use any editor with it, but the default feels very
close to <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
When I started reading newsgroups again, I used <code>tin</code> and
made it use <code>ed</code> as the editor.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, it’s growing on me. 😅
</p>
<p>
And I’m not alone! On fedi, I’m following
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@aartaka" title="@aartaka@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aartaka">@aartaka</span></a> who
occasionally posts things about <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
And so, in order to get better with it, I decided to write this page. I
expect to be adding to it.
</p>
<p>

Try <code>man ed</code> or <code>info ed</code> to learn more about the
commands available to you within <code>ed</code>.

motivated me to get into <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="create-a-new-file">
Create a new file
</h2>
<p>
Start <code>ed</code> without a file name. You’ll be editing “lines” in
a “buffer”.
</p>
<p>
The commands to use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>i</code> to insert a few lines
</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the insertion of lines
</li>
<li>
<code>w filename</code> writes the buffer to a file (and prints the
number of bytes written)
</li>
<li>
<code>q</code> quits the editor
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed
i
Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you.
.
w hello.txt
47
q
</code></pre>
<h2 id="edit-an-existing-file">
Edit an existing file
</h2>
<p>
When we provide ed with a filename, it is read into the buffer (and the
number of bytes read are printed). The current line is the last line of
the buffer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>a</code> appends new lines after the current line
</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the appending of lines
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed hello.txt 
47
.
This is a letter from me to you.
a

And that was it!
.
w
65
</code></pre>
<p>
Now, <code>ed</code> is line-oriented and so we can provide line numbers
and line ranges to our commands. If you omit a line number or the range,
these commands apply to the current line only. A range is two
comma-separated line numbers. If you omit numbers, defaults are “from
the first line” and “to the last line”. Thus, a single comma means “all
the lines”. <code>$</code> is always the last line. Relative addressing
with negative offsets like <code>-1</code> and positive offsets like
<code>+1</code> works as well.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>p</code> prints the lines
</li>
<li>
<code>n</code> numbers the lines
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are all equivalent:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>1,5p</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>1,$p</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>,p</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So now let’s number the lines and then append to the first paragraph.
Use <code>n</code> to find the right line number to append to, and use
<code>p</code> at the end to proofread.
</p>
<pre><code>,n

,p
Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you.
It's pretty short, I know. I didn't have enough time to make it longer.

And that was it!
</code></pre>
<p>
Notice how we could only append new lines after the third line. We
couldn’t append new words to the third line itself. What we can do is
join two lines, though. Unfortunately, that doesn’t add a space!
</p>
<p>
One option is to add a single line containing a space. The other option
is to use a substitution to add a space. That’s what we will use.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>s/from/to/</code> replaces regular expression <code>from</code>
with string <code>to</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>j</code> joins lines in the range
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowing that this concerns lines 3 and 4 there is no need to use
<code>n</code>.

<h2 id="processing-with-other-tools">
Processing with other tools
</h2>
<p>
There is no way to process the buffer with external tools, but there is
a way to do it with the current file.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>w</code> writes the file
</li>
<li>
<code>e</code> edits a filename, replacing the current buffer; or if the
argument starts with an exclamation mark, executes the command and
replaces the buffer with the output
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>w

<h2 id="to-insert-some-command-output">
To insert some command output
</h2>
<p>
I like to start my blog posts with a level one heading, a date, and some
text. Here’s how I would insert a date. Note the invisible space after
the <code>#</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>r</code> reads lines from a filename, inserting them into the
current buffer; or if the argument starts with an exclamation mark,
executes the command and inserts the lines from the output into the
buffer

</ul>

<h2 id="using-the-buffer-as-a-workspace">
Using the buffer as a workspace
</h2>
<p>
OK, I know this is weird. But in theory we can think of the buffer as a
huge one-dimensional workspace. We can insert lines from files and
process output here and there, and we can write line ranges to files.
</p>
<p>
Here we are writing a haiku, don’t like the last line, insert a new
third line and then write just the first three lines to the file. The
fourth line not saved but it is still available in the buffer.
</p>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed

</code></pre>
<p>
In this sense it’s unclear what the default filename of the buffer is.
It’s the one-dimensional desktop!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>f</code> prints the default filename, or sets it if a filename is
provided
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>f
haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-marks-and-line-arithmetic">
Using marks and line arithmetic
</h2>
<p>
Perhaps working with the buffer as a long, one-dimensional workspace
makes more sense if you drop markers as you work with files. Use
<code>k</code> followed by a lower case letter.
</p>
<p>
Here we insert a first haiku, mark the first line, insert a new haiku,
mark its beginning, and then we print the two, using the marks and some
line arithmetic.
</p>
<pre><code>r haiku.txt

<h2 id="hit-enter-too-soon">
Hit Enter too soon
</h2>
<p>
Something I do often enough: I hit the Enter key when I didn’t mean to.
Fix it by beginning the new line with a space. Finish the line, and join
the previous line with the current line:
</p>
<pre><code>i

.
-1,.j
p

version of Bingeworthy</a> running here. When I saw how the database
code worked, I had to redo it from scratch. It was probably my first SQL
project, and I barely knew what I was doing. It’s too bad, because
looking at it from that point of view I could see how SQL could have
been much simpler by making some of the optional features automatic. A
higher layer on top of SQL is possible, it seems to me. Having ChatGPT
review my ideas has been invaluable in this project. I’m going to use it
myself for a while, and see how I want to reorganize the user interface.
There were opportunities for factoring I didn’t take back then because I
was in a rush to do something else.</p>

open. Developers and users are free to use anyone’s ideas, or not use
them, even if they claim to be the Holy Church of Some Open Format. No
one can form an organization that owns the future of the open format
because then it wouldn’t be open.</p>

<p>
For a technology that seems startling in its modernity, AI sure has a
long history. Google Translate, OpenAI chatbots, and Meta AI image
generators are built on decades of advancements in linguistics, signal
processing, statistics, and other fields going back to the early days of
computing—and, often, on seed funding from the U.S. Department of
Defense. But today’s tools are hardly the intentional product of the
diverse generations of innovators that came before. We agree with
Morozov that the “refuseniks,” as he …

like an idiot I thought that’s what they wanted, instead it was an
ambush, people mostly wanting to ridicule me because they thought
anything that a person does can’t be any good, it has to come from a big
company like Mozilla or Google. I thought then and still do now, how do
they justify wasting their time on such a ridiculous thing. I kept on
doing what I was doing, but switched off their browser first chance I
got.” If they really want to get behind projects that make the open web
stronger, I’d be happy to help guide them, but only if they’ve sobered
up and take that mission statement seriously, instead of just as a
justification for holding on to their jobs a little bit longer.</p>

I’m running Ultraviolet Grasslands (UVG) using 2d6 rules. UVG itself
uses d20 rules and so I often have to translate back and forth and it is
not very satisfying, to be honest.

<p>
Weapons are either “normal” (2d6 damage) or “extreme violence” (3d6
damage). Some weapons might be practically instant death weapons, like
plasma guns, necrotic blasters desintegrators and the like. These might
do 4d6 and more damage.

Perhaps it would be best to extend the list of tags UVG uses. Then
weapons can have tags such as Cut, Stab, Crush, Slug, Energy, Necrotic,
Blast – and armour can confer protection or immunity against these tags.
Other tags are easy to add:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
2H prevents the use of a shield.
</li>
<li>
Vicious deals 3d6 instead of 2d6 damage.
</li>
<li>
Close means that it’s good for close combat, like in tunnels or inside
narrow corridors. Enemies with longer weapons get a free attack if you
need to close (outside of tunnels and corridors).
</li>
<li>
Range means that you can shoot stuff.
</li>
</ul>

Vicious weapons do 3d6 damage; blast weapons do 4d6 damage. Stationary
guns like plasma guns go on a different list but do 5d6 and more damage.
Scope creep!

And then armour! Using some more tags, too.

Hot means no problem in cold environments but endurance tests to act
otherwise

Cold means no problem but cannot be worn outside of combat in cold

Rare cannot be bought at a regular shop

porter to carry it)

A shield can be used to negate a single hit. (“Shields shall be
splintered.”)
</p>
<p>
I wonder how good spears and other stabbing weapons are, though. Cutting
weapons really must be the best weapons against unarmoured opponents!
Why were axes unpopular given the table above? There must be more to it.
</p>
<p>
Let’s test some assumptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the crossbow and halberd are armour piercing: yes, because breastplate,
scale shirt and cuirass all don’t protect against Crush
</li>
<li>
the dagger is good for unsuspecting enemies because it’s Close
</li>
<li>
the axe is is good for fighting in close quarters against armoured
opponents because it’s Close and Crush
</li>
<li>
there cloth armour that helps against the smaller calibres (pistols and
SMGs)
</li>
<li>
golem armour is immune against slug throwers
</li>
<li>
the advanced combat suites (spectral, porcelain) make you immune to
normal melee weapons
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Surprising result: Swords are pretty bad against armoured opponents.
Perhaps they are mostly a status symbol after all. A status symbol of a
ruling warrior class over unarmed peasants. They’re probably just easier
to carry than spears.

<h2 id="why-i-like-my-model-y">Why I like my Model Y</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Yesterday I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/06.html#a150415">wrote</a> that
I’d trade in my Model Y if an non-Tesla EV came along that equaled it. A
few people asked what I liked about the Model Y that I’m not finding in
alternatives. Here’s the list.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I love the handling of the Tesla. It’s a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_car">muscle car</a> like
the 2007 <a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/5-series/2007/">BMW 535i</a> I
used to drive, great acceleration, but handles like the 1993
<a href="https://www.cars.com/research/mazda-mx_5_miata-1993/">Miata</a>
another car I owned and loved. I’ve also owned really sloppy cars like a
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/subaru/forester-2022">Subaru
Forester</a> or a
<a href="https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-sienna-2004/">Toyota
Sienna</a> minivan, even a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Voyager#Full-size_van_(AB;_1974%E2%80%931983)">1974
Plymouth Voyager</a>, the largest American passenger car ever made. I’m
never going back to a car that doesn’t have the authority of a Model Y.
</li>
<li>
The Model Y has lots of headroom, which my long torso needs, so I don’t
bruise my head each time I get in the freaking car.
</li>
<li>
I have a Tesla charger at home, so whatever I buy has to be compatible
with or adaptable to it.
</li>
<li>
4WD is important because where I live it snows in winter, and I drive on
dirt roads a lot too.
</li>
<li>
It’s a computer. It’s going to be hard for a competitor to offer the
integration with a network that Tesla offers, they’re a computer company
as much as they’re a car company. Their connection to Starlink (assumed
to be coming) is going to be hard to compete with too.
</li>
<li>
Calling it <i>self-driving</i> should get them in trouble with the FTC,
there’s no way anyone should trust it to drive itself, and the car’s OS
enforces that view, so I guess they have lawyers at Tesla. That said, I
like having access to this technology. I’ve been an innovative software
developer for a long time, and I like using tech that pushes the leading
edge. The marketing (a Musk feature presumably) is what I don’t like.
</li>
<li>
Charging network. I occasionally take trips that are out of range of my
home charger, to Boston, or NYC sometimes leave me needing a charge on
the way home. I’d like to have the option of driving cross-country as
well. The Tesla charging network is a big plus. I honestly don’t know
how good the charging situation is for other brands. This would be
something for car magazines to rate, to have a way of measuring it, as
people who are put off by Musk’s politics (about 1/2 of American voters)
look for ways to drive something other than a Tesla.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So this turned into an ad for Tesla. Heh.
</p>
<p>
There are <i>reasons</i> we love it so much.
</p>
<p>
Just separate from Musk and all’s well.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been thinking Tesla drivers who love America should have some kind
of demonstration. We all park our cars around local Tesla dealers, let
the police tow our cars, only to be replaced by other Teslas. We’re all
computer nerds, we could probably even figure out the scheduling. We
probably have nearly as much money as they do. Just sayin.
</p>
<p>
Tired of companies that push us around politically and Tesla is one of
the worst. So far they’ve managed to convince us they aren’t Elon Musk,
but that’s a mirage, he is the company and the company is him. They are
completely one and the same.
