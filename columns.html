<p>The real story of RSS is that in a moment when the NYT had a spirit
of adventure, they backed RSS and as a result news adopted a technology
that was pioneered by bloggers, not the tech industry. If that
partnership had flourished and developed we might now have a good
alternative to the tech billionaires.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-10, updated: 2024-06-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research:

Hijacking: Exploiting Erroneous URL Links to Phantom Domains</a>‚Äú:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Web users often follow hyperlinks hastily, expecting
them to be correctly programmed. However, it is possible those links
contain typos or other mistakes. By discovering active but erroneous
hyperlinks, a malicious actor can spoof a website or service,
impersonating the expected content and phishing private information. In
‚Äútyposquatting,‚Äù misspellings of common domains are registered to
exploit errors when users mistype a web address. Yet, no prior research
has been dedicated to situations where the linking errors of web
publishers (i.e.¬†developers and content contributors) propagate to
users. We hypothesize that these ‚Äúhijackable hyperlinks‚Äù exist in large
quantities with the potential to generate substantial traffic. Analyzing
large-scale crawls of the web using high-performance computing, we show
the web currently contains active links to more than 572,000 dot-com
domains that have never been registered, what we term ‚Äòphantom domains.‚Äô
Registering 51 of these, we see 88% of phantom domains exceeding the
traffic of a control domain, with up to 10 times more visits. Our
analysis shows that these links exist due to 17 common publisher error
modes, with the phantom domains they point to free for anyone to
purchase and exploit for under 20, representing a low barrier to entry
for potential attackers‚Ä¶

<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>Yesterday the Washington Post published an article by Beth Reinhard
examining the philosophy and the power of Russell Vought, the hard-right
Christian nationalist who is drafting plans for a second Trump term.
Vought was the director of the Office of Management and Budget from July
2020 to January 2021 during the Trump administration. In January 2021 he
founded the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank, and he
was a key player in the construction of Project 2025, the plan to gut
the nonpartisan federal government and replace it with a dominant
president and a team of loyalists who will impose religious rule on the
United States.</p>

<h2 id="wikipedia-vs-chatgpt">Wikipedia vs ChatGPT</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I started replying to a
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post
by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character
limit, so I moved my act over here. </i>
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
It often only represents a story from one point of view.
</p>
<p>
So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.
</p>
<p>
Same with the story of RSS. I‚Äôm sure you know the story they tell, but
there‚Äôs a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got
together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and Motley Fool, and eventually
brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard
supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media
and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the
tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do
that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you‚Äôd get the idea that the
bigco‚Äôs heroically fought back against what exactly it‚Äôs not clear.
</p>
<p>
I can‚Äôt contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so
your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well
it‚Äôs not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it
on my blog (as I‚Äôm doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and
fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is.
(Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)
</p>
<p>
Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things
other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name
for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT
made a mistake like that people would be howling. I‚Äôm sure Wikipedia is
filled with junk like that. Why wouldn‚Äôt it be.
</p>
<p>
And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all
other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while
other sources don‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in
advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles.
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the
open web. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs better at finding stuff, and also
understanding my queries even though they‚Äôre not rigorously specified,
my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way
I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a
weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able
to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would
work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out
prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which
of course they are being.
</p>
<p>
Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that‚Äôs a big difference
between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very
impatient with them and move on.
</p>
<p>
Also, I‚Äôm not here to debate. I don‚Äôt like online debates. <span

have a Mac Mini that keeps running out of space on its internal drive.
It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me
find the big stuff. I don‚Äôt know when this app came to be, but it‚Äôs very
helpful. In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for
all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device
that‚Äôs ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems).
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on
the 16TB external drive, but I sure don‚Äôt know how to do it nor do I
want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript,
CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a
lot longer than this Mac‚Äôs has. I desperately want to move my act to
Linux and reclaim all the memory I‚Äôm using to store stuff about the Mac,
which isn‚Äôt really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a
Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that‚Äôs my revenge,
and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with
what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would
make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a>
money, so I hedged. I figured at least they‚Äôd make me rich while
completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My
inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen
Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running
and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as
usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>
