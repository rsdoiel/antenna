<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lean-software-development">Good
essay</a> on software bloat and the insecurities it causes.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes
unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge
<i>attack surface</i> full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to
improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic
fails, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile,
great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose
to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but
legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take
security more seriously…

Hero</h2>

<p>At a hillside cemetery near the central Texas town of Gatesville,
Sergeant Richard Rudd was finally laid to rest, nearly 80 years after he
was killed in action. Attendance at the burial last December was light,
as the late infantryman had few close relatives. The Army Honor Guard
presented Rudd’s grand-niece with a folded flag and spoke the words
repeated at countless military memorials: “On behalf of the president of
the United States, the United States Army, and a grateful nation, please
accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one’s
honorable and faithful service.”</p>

base their security on lattice problems.
</p>
<p>
I worry about standardizing on post-quantum algorithms too quickly. We
are still learning a lot about the security of these systems, and this
paper is an example of that learning.

<p>Friends, There’s so much hate and nastiness in public life these days
— by “public life,” I mean anyone who is known to the broad public,
including politicians, celebrities, athletes, actors, writers, painters,
and journalists — that it’s probably easy for you to come up with people
in public life you detest. (My list would include Donald Trump, Vladimir
Putin, Benjamin Netanyahu, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Kari
Lake, for example.)</p>

Gaza: Why aren’t we stopping the deaths?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>Friends, Late last night, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen gave a
remarkable speech on the Senate floor, condemning the government of
Benjamin Netanyahu for deliberately blocking aid to civilians in Gaza.
Van Hollen said: “Kids in Gaza are now dying from the deliberate
withholding of food. In addition to the horror of that news, one other
thing is true: That is a war crime. It is a textbook war crime. And that
makes those who orchestrate it war criminals. … Every one of them
[officials at humanitarian relief organizations] has stated that their
organizations have never experienced a humanitarian disaster as dire and
terrible as the world is witnessing in Gaza.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-13, updated: 2024-02-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The paperback version of
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/"><i>A Hacker’s
Mind</i></a> has just been published. It’s the same book, only a cheaper
format.
</p>
<p>
But—and this is the real reason I am posting this—Amazon has
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Mind-Powerful-Societys-Rules/dp/0393866661/">significantly
discounted</a> the hardcover to $15 to get rid of its stock. This is
much cheaper than I am selling it for, and cheaper even than the
paperback. So if you’ve been waiting for a price drop, this is your
chance.

153% to around $43K and, below the fold, I am still posting skeptically

The first clue that the future for miners is clouded comes in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-btc-price-outlook-clouded-by-falling-miner-reserves-before-halving"><i>Bitcoin
Outlook Clouded by Falling Miner Reserves Ahead of April’s
Halving</i></a> by Sidhartha Shukla and David Pan:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin miners are getting a jump on an anticipated decline in revenue
from the so-called halving in April, when the blockchain’s network
protocol will reduce rewards for verifying transactions by half.<br />
<br /> Miner reserves — unsold Bitcoin held in digital wallets
associated with the companies — have dropped by 8,400 tokens since the
start of 2024 to 1.8 million, a level last seen in June 2021, according
to data compiled by CryptoQuant. Analysts said the decrease indicates
miners are selling tokens.
</blockquote>
The somewhat misleading graph of the miners HODL-ings actually shows
only a 2% drop in the number of BTC from the peak in August 2022. But
the “value” of those HODL-ings has risen 75% from $44.8B to $78.5B. One
way of looking at it is that the mining industry started August 2022
with 1.865M BTC and, in the 18 months since mined 821,250 BTC for a
total of 2,686,250 but they now have only 1.825M BTC so they must have
sold 861,250, or about 5% more than they mined.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-btc-price-outlook-clouded-by-falling-miner-reserves-before-halving">Nevertheless</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Miners have begun to sell more of their coins to bolster balance sheets
and fund growth capex ahead of tougher times for margins when block
rewards are halved in April,” said Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset
research at VanEck. “After the halving, scale will matter even more.”
</blockquote>
Before the great EFT pump, it was generally believed that the frantic
efforts to pump BTC over $30K suggested that the mining industry’s
break-even point was around $30K. On 6<sup>th</sup> October BTC was $26K
and the hash rate was around 412M TH/s. Lets assume that the industry
was breaking even at BTC=$30K and a hash rate of 412MTH/s, so the
industry’s costs were covered by 45K BTC/month or $1.35B/month. Assuming
the increase in efficiency is roughly cancelled by less efficient
operators entering, the hash rate is now 527 TH/s and so costs are
around $1.73B. But income is around $1.94B/month so margins are around
12%.<br /> <br /> After the halvening, income is 22.5K BTC/month. At
BTC=$43K, this is $968K/month or 56% of current costs. To maintain a 12%
margin, costs need to be cut to $852K/month, or 49% of current costs.
Alternatively, if costs stay the same, the Bitcoin “price” needs to
increase to $86 in April.<br /> <br /> The industry isn’t going to halve
its costs in the next three months, and even massive printing of
unbacked Tether isn’t going to double the BTC “price”, so “tougher times
for margins” are certainly among the clouds overhead.<br /> <br />

I am not the only skeptic. Short-seller J Capital Research investigated
Hut 8, a large public miner, and on January 18<sup>th</sup> published
<a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf"><i>The
Coming HUT Pump and Dump</i></a>. As the chart shows, it was effective.
The report featured a list of 22 different red flags, focused mainly on
the recent merger between Hut 8 (HUT) and U.S. Bitcoin Corp. (USBTC) and
asking:<br />
<blockquote>
Why then did HUT pay $745 mln to acquire this company and its planned
payments?
</blockquote>
This is a good question, given
<a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One person highly familiar with USBTC told us, “without the merger,
[USBTC] would have done a structured bankruptcy.”
</blockquote>
It wasn’t as if Hut 8 didn’t have
<a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">problems
of its own</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Hut 8’s North Bay mining facility has been non-operational for an
extended period of time, and problems at its Drumheller facility “have
been causing miners to fail.”
</blockquote>
And the result of the merger is a
<a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">company
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
has an industry-low efficiency rate and, post halving, will produce
Bitcoin at a loss of close to $20,000 per Bitcoin at current spot
prices.
</blockquote>
In other words, the merged company can barely make money now and cannot
survive when the industry’s income is halved in less than 3 months. This
all looks like rats leaving the sinking ship with whatever they can
carry. An impression reinforced by David Pan in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-hut-ceo-exits-three-weeks-after-short-seller-allegations"><i>Bitcoin
Miner Hut 8 CEO Exits Three Weeks After Short-Seller Allegations
</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Hut 8 Corp., one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining
companies, named Asher Genoot to succeed Jaime Leverton as chief
executive officer, three weeks after a short-seller released a report
critical of its recent merger.<br /> <br /> The transition is effective
immediately. Genoot served as the chief operating officer and the
president of US Bitcoin Corp. Miami-based US Bitcoin, which has
large-scale mining facilities across the US including Texas, completed
its merger with then-Canadian miner Hut 8 in late 2023.<br /> <br /> The
leadership transition comes amid increasing competition among the
miners, a Bitcoin code update set to drastically reduce mining revenue
in two months as well as the Jan. 18 report from short-seller J Capital
Research alleging the merged company was a “pump and dump” waiting to
happen. Hut 8 has disputed the claim.
</blockquote>
Genoot has
<a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">allegedly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
abandoned several failed start-ups.
</blockquote>
His co-founder was USBTC’s CEO and is now HUT’s CSO/director
<a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">and</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
is a 30-year-old used-car salesman from Vancouver whose history is
littered with involvement in SEC-defined pump-and-dumps, sporting
share-price declines of 83%,
</blockquote>
The key inputs for profitable mining are low-cost power and
state-of-the-art chips to use it as effficently as possible. Clouds are
gathering over both of them.<br /> <br /> As regards access to cheap
electricity, utilities are increasingly reluctant to provide it. Take,
for example,
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/crypto-mining-company-loses-bid-to-force-bc-hydro-to-provide-power/ar-BB1hPaZE"><i>Crypto
mining company loses bid to force BC Hydro to provide power </i></a> by
Darryl Greer of The Canadian Press:<br />
<blockquote>
A cryptocurrency firm has lost a bid to force BC Hydro to provide the
vast amounts of power needed for its operations, upholding the
provincial government’s right to pause power connections for new crypto
miners. <br /> <br /> Conifex Timber Inc., a forestry firm that branched
out into cryptocurrency mining, had gone to the B.C. Supreme Court to
have the policy declared invalid.<br /> <br /> But Justice Michael
Tammen ruled Friday that the government’s move in December 2022 to pause
new connections for cryptocurrency mining for 18 months was “reasonable”
and not “unduly discriminatory.”<br /> <br /> BC Hydro CEO Christopher
O’Riley had told the court in an affidavit that the data centres
proposed by Conifex would have consumed 2.5 million megawatt-hours of
electricity each year.
</blockquote>
In the US, David Pan’s
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-01/bitcoin-miners-in-us-consume-up-to-2-3-of-nation-s-electricity"><i>US
Bitcoin Miners Use as Much Electricity as Everyone in Utah </i></a>
shows that regulators are starting to worry:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin miners in the US are consuming the same amount of electricity as
the entire state of Utah, among others, according to a new analysis by
the US Energy Information Administration. And that’s considered the low
end of the range of use.<br /> <br /> Electricity usage from mining
operations represents 0.6% to 2.3% of all the country’s demand in 2023,
according to the report released Thursday. It is the first time EIA has
shared an estimate. The mining activity has generated mounting concerns
from policymakers and electric grid planners about straining the grid
during periods of peak demand, energy costs and energy-related carbon
dioxide emissions.<br /> <br /> “This estimate of U.S. electricity
demand supporting cryptocurrency mining would equal annual demand
ranging from more than three million to more than six million homes,”
the report said.
</blockquote>
Globally, this increase in demand is part of a bigger picture that is
concerning, as Eamon Farhat reports in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-24/cryptocurrency-ai-electricity-demand-seen-doubling-in-three-years"><i>Electricity
Demand at Data Centers Seen Doubling in Three Years</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Global electricity demand from data centers, cryptocurrencies and
artificial intelligence could more than double over the next three
years, adding the equivalent of Germany’s entire power needs, the
International Energy Agency forecasts in its latest report.<br /> <br />
There are more than 8,000 data centers globally, with about 33% in the
US, 16% in Europe and close to 10% in China, with more planned. In
Ireland, where data centers are developing rapidly, the IEA expects the
sector to consume 32% of the country’s total electricity by 2026
compared to 17% in 2022. Ireland currently has 82 centers; 14 are under
construction and 40 more are approved.<br /> <br /> Overall global
electricity demand is expected to see a 3.4% increase until 2026, the
report found. The increase, however, will be more than covered by
renewables, such as wind, solar and hydro, and all-time high nuclear
power.
</blockquote>
The first step towards stricter regulation is information collection
which, as Kristoffer Tigue reports in
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/large-cryptocurrency-miners-in-us-now-have-to-report-energy-use-to-government/"><i>Large
cryptocurrency miners in US now have to report energy use to
government</i></a> has started:<br />
<blockquote>
The Biden administration is now requiring some cryptocurrency producers
to report their energy use following rising concerns that the growing
industry could pose a threat to the nation’s electricity grids and
exacerbate climate change.<br /> <br /> The Energy Information
Administration announced last week that it would start collecting energy
use data from more than 130 “identified commercial cryptocurrency
miners” operating in the US. The survey, which started this week, aims
to get a sense of how the industry’s energy demand is evolving and where
in the country cryptocurrency operations are growing fastest.<br />
<br /> “As cryptocurrency mining has increased in the United States,
concerns have grown about the energy-intensive nature of the business
and its effects on the US electric power industry,” the EIA said in a
new report, following the announcement. “Concerns expressed to EIA
include strains to the electricity grid during periods of peak demand,
the potential for higher electricity prices, as well as effects on
energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.”

data from YCharts, the total Bitcoin network hash rate fell from more
than 629 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Jan. 11 to roughly 415 EH/s on
Jan. 15 — a 34% drop. The analytics site reported the hash rate

It isn’t just that Texas has maybe a third of the industry, it is also
that the US industry is growing much faster than anywhere else. Figures
from Luxor Logistics show that in 2023 the US consumed
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">nearly
two-thirds of all new mining rigs</a>. The figures come from
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners"><i>Chinese
Bitcoin Miners Find a New Crypto Haven in Ethiopia</i></a> by David Pan
and Fasika Tadesse:<br />
<blockquote>
Ethiopia has emerged as a rare opportunity for all firms that mine the
original cryptocurrency, as climate change and power scarcity fuel a
backlash against the $16 billion-a-year industry (at Bitcoin’s current
price) elsewhere. But it holds special appeal for Chinese companies,
which once dominated Bitcoin mining but have struggled to compete with
local rivals in Texas, the current hub.<br />
</blockquote>
The haven isn’t without its own
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">clouds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is also a risky gamble, for the companies and Ethiopia alike. A
succession of developing countries like Kazakhstan and Iran initially
embraced Bitcoin mining, only to turn on the sector when its energy use
threatened to fuel domestic discontent. China’s reign as the epicenter
of Bitcoin mining came to an abrupt end in 2021, when the government
banned it. Dozens of companies were forced to leave.<br /> <br />
Ethiopian officials are wary of the controversy that accompanies Bitcoin
mining, according to industry executives who spoke on condition of
anonymity to avoid jeopardizing government relations. Even after new
generation capacity came online, almost half the population live without
access to electricity, making mining a delicate topic. At the same time,
it represents a potentially lucrative source of foreign-exchange
earnings.<br /> …<br /> The reliance on abundant power is also a major
vulnerability because it can put miners in competition for electricity
with factories and households, exposing them to political
backlash.<br /> <br /> When Kazakzstan imposed fresh curbs and taxes on
miners, “it basically killed the industry,” said Hashlabs co-founder
Alen Makhmetov. Two years after the clampdown, his 10-megawatt facility
there is still sitting idle.<br /> <br /> And in an era when rising
temperatures wreak havoc around the world, Bitcoin mining is
increasingly seen as a contributor to global warming that doesn’t serve
any productive purpose — even though miners have claimed they’re
increasingly tapping clean energy. A study by United Nations University
published in October estimated that two-thirds of the electricity used
for Bitcoin mining in 2020 and 2021 was generated using fossil fuels.
</blockquote>
Developing countries aren’t the only ones where miners face “domestic
discontent”.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html"><i>Anxiety,
Mood Swings and Sleepless Nights: Life Near a Bitcoin Mine</i></a> by
Gabriel J.X. Dance reports on an example in Arkansas:<br />
<blockquote>
The Arkansas Data Centers Act, popularly called the Right to Mine law,
offers Bitcoin miners legal protections from communities that may not
want them operating nearby. Passed just eight days after it was
introduced, the law was written in part by the Satoshi Action Fund, a
nonprofit advocacy group based in Mississippi whose co-founder worked in
the Trump administration rolling back Obama-era climate policies.
</blockquote>
The law
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html">ins’t
popular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A furious backlash has some lawmakers considering a statewide ban.
</blockquote>
The Satoshi Action Fund
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html">over-reached</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite efforts to build bipartisan support, the Satoshi fund has
succeeded predominantly in red states. But in Arkansas, where the state
legislature is dominated by Republicans, it is conservatives who have
led calls to repeal the law, including Senator Bryan King, a poultry
farmer whose district includes a property purchased by one of the
companies tied to the Chinese government. He said it was not fair that
the Bitcoin operators received special protections under the law, which
shields them from
“<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Home/FTPDocument?path=%2FACTS%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FACT851.pdf">discriminatory
industry specific regulations and taxes</a>,” including noise ordinances
and zoning restrictions.
</blockquote>
At least the Ethiopian mines don’t emit much CO2, they run on
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">hydropower</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The opening of the GERD project increased Ethiopia’s installed
generation capacity to 5.3 gigawatt, 92% of which comes from hydropower,
a renewable energy source.<br /> <br /> Once GERD is fully completed,
Ethiopia’s generation capacity will double, according to Ethiopian
Electric Power. It charges Bitcoin miners a fixed rate of 3.14 US cents
per kilowatt hour for electricity drawn from substations, Marketing and
Business Development Director Hiwot Eshetu said in an interview.<br />
<br /> While that’s similar to the average in Texas, rates in the Lone
Star State can swing wildly, Luxor’s Vera said, making profits there
less predictable. In Ethiopia, the price will fall once miners connect
directly to power plants, according to Hiwot.
</blockquote>
<p>But if the utility can make money selling power to the mines right by
the dam they have little incentive to build out the grid than could get
the power to the unserved half of the population.<br /> <br /> As
regards the longer-term issue of access to state-of-the-art chips, it is
important to note that the best mining chips are sold by Bitmain, a
Chinese company, but manufactured at TSMC in Taiwan. There are two major
risks here. The first is that the US appears determined to prevent China
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/tech/us-china-chip-export-curbs-intl-hnk/index.html">importing
leading-edge chips</a> and the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/02/asml-halts-hi-tech-chip-making-exports-to-china-reportedly-after-us-request">equipment
to make them</a>. China remains at least a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/china-close-to-shipping-5nm-chips-despite-western-curbs/">generation
and a half</a> behind TSMC and Samsung, and reportedly has poor yields
on its leading-edge process. These restrictions could well prevent
Chinese mining companies acquiring leading-edge rigs, and might cause
TSMC problems in fab-ing Bitmain products.<br /> <br /> Second, there is
the looming threat of a Chinese blockade or even invasion of Taiwan. Of
course, difficulties for Bitcoin miners are hardly the major impact if
these threats are made good. One might think that, even if supplies of
new mining chips were cut off, existing rigs would continue working. In
the short term they would, but there is a long history of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">rigs
being obsolete</a> after
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901">about 18

Blockchain Book</h2>

Molly White—of “<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/">Web3 is
Going Just Great</a>”
fame—<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/">reviews</a>
Chris Dixon’s blockchain solutions book:
<a href="https://readwriteown.com/"><i>Read Write Own</i></a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In fact, throughout the entire book, Dixon fails to identify a
<em>single</em> blockchain project that has successfully provided a
non-speculative service at any kind of scale. The closest he ever comes
is when he speaks of how “for decades, technologists have dreamed of
building a grassroots internet access provider”. He describes one
project that “got further than anyone else”: Helium. He’s right, as long
as you ignore the fact that Helium was providing LoRaWAN, not Internet,
that by the time he was writing his book Helium hotspots had long since
passed the phase where they might generate even enough tokens for their
operators to merely break even, and that the network was pulling in
somewhere around $1,150 in usage fees a month despite the company being
valued at $1.2 billion. Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the
public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have
been accused of hoarding the project’s token to enrich themselves. But
hey, a16z sunk millions into Helium (a fact Dixon never mentions), so
might as well try to drum up some new interest!…

<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>I noticed Donald Trump will spend more time in front of a judge this
week than in front of potential voters. It’s his new normal. Trump’s
schedule looks like a litigious hellscape. And his calendar for the
foreseeable future is more of the same. It’s all so antithetical to my
belief about what kind of person should lead our great nation.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Paolo Valdemarin’s blog</p>
<p>Having just started a company that primarily deals with large
language models I’m occasionally thinking about the responsibilities
that we have when we introduce a new AI agent in the digital space.
Besides preservation of the human species, a good rule that I think we
should give ourselves is “avoid bullshit”, and while this rule …

<h2 id="fast-car">’Fast Car‘</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>While watching the Grammys last Sunday, I was delighted by a duet
performed by Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs. They sang “Fast Car,” a hit
for Chapman in 1988. I was not the only one so moved. As I have
discovered, it was one of the most popular performances of the night. I
am an old-school country music fan, so I was not aware of Combs’ cover
of Chapman’s hit. It certainly is a reason to smile.</p>
