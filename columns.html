<p>I keep discovering uses for ChatGPT. I think you could use it very
effectively to learn a language, for example. I know how to say this in
English, could you explain to me, in English, how to say it in French. I
bet it’s very good at that. I am using it to learn to write SQL code
that takes advantage of all the arcane features they’ve added over the
years to handle cases that come up in real database work. It’s anything
but a new language, and efficiency is everything – so I think they
pretty much have all the cases covered. I remember how frustrating it
was to learn Algol when all I knew before that was Fortran and Basic. It
would have been great to have ChatGPT to coach me on it.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/06/03/tinaTheBearNurseFromBojackHorseman.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
was driving on a mountain road yesterday to pick up a pizza in a nearby
town. I drive it fairly regularly, and I have a car that handles well so
I drive at the speed limit or a little above.
</p>
<p>
Still, what often happens on this road is some asshole tailgates,
getting so close that if I hit the brakes suddenly they would have no
time to react, and would slam into the rear of my car. And you do
sometimes have to hit the brakes because animals appear on the road,
deer, turkeys are common. Sometimes even bears.
</p>
<p>
I’ve never hit an animal, but I have come close.
</p>
<p>
There’s no way to pass on this road.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been in the other driver’s place when a tourist is driving 30 in a
45 mph zone, and what do you do? Keep your distance and don’t freak out.
It’s perfectly legal to go 30 in a 45 mph zone.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I slow down, to send a signal to the other driver, and also to
mitigate damage if there is an accident. This asshole leans on their
horn. I slow down more.
</p>
<p>
And when I come to a stop sign I come to a full stop and pause, thinking
okay they’ll pass me now, and I’ll get a chance to see who this asshole
is. They stayed behind and leaned on the horn again.
</p>
<p>
When we come to the next stop sign, it’s the end of the road and you can
go left or right. I’m going right, they’re going left, and the road is
wide so the asshole pulls up to the left of me and I look over and see a
middle-aged woman, could be a teacher or a nurse. I was amazed. The last
kind of person I would expect to make such a scene.
</p>
<p>
If I had a chance I would have asked what the hell they were doing.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I don’t speed on these roads because I like driving them, I love
the mountains, and the fresh air, and I wasn’t in any kind of a hurry.
It’s not uncommon to get a tailgater but usually they take the hint when
I slow down and add a few car lengths between us.
</p>
<p>
One of the reasons I have a blog is so I have a place to write these
stories. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China
</h1>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-14</strong>. I’m somewhere in the Italian-speaking parts
of Switzerland with my wife. There is a lot of running, hiking, hugging,
kissing, eating and drinking involved. 🥰
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-15</strong>. Still on the trip but late at night I spent
more than an hour trying to figure out why my server had a load of
nearly 40. 💻
</p>
<p>
All I discovered is that load went down when I shut down Emacs Wiki. See
also <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2024-09-16">2024-09-16</a>
on Emacs Wiki.
</p>
<p>
Well, I needed to sleep and I‘ve got plans for the next few days so I
shut it down while I slept hoping that the misconfigured spider is fixed
or the inept programmer discovers their mistake. Just another day in the
Butlerian Jihad. Some misguided soul probably wanted to download it all
and wrote a broken web crawler and when that got blocked they bought
some nice scaling infrastructure from Amazon, Hetzner, OHV or Alibaba
Cloud or whatever they are called, allowing them to use a gazillion
different IP numbers that will eventually lead me to implement some sort
of cloud service provider block.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-09-15-emacs-china.png" alt="Load shoots up to nearly 40 around midnight. The graph is for an entire week so the peaks are not shown. It just goes up to 30 multiple times." />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-16</strong>. Switched Emacs Wiki back on after a few
hours of sleep and it did fine. But then it restarted again… at 18:00,
19:00, 21:00, 22:00… and so I switched Emacs Wiki off again. Time to ban
some networks!
</p>
<p>
Anybody interested in my banning of IP ranges and possibly interested in
me reverting any of these, take a look at
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> … from a network that isn’t
banned, I guess. 😏
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-17</strong>. This continues to keep me busy and angry
every evening. Too bad I don’t have a real fast
<a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> to firewall ban
pipeline. I’m using this script instead of carefully checking IP numbers
and networks. I’m also sick and tired of the same networks popping up
again and again.
</p>
<p>
I added over a hundred Chinese networks to the firewall rules and I’m
seriously considering blocking the whole country for a week. It seems
that most of the offenders are networks run by China Telecoms and China
Mobile.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-18</strong>. So far, so good. Load stays below two.
</p>
<h2 id="example">
Example
</h2>
<p>
Here’s example usage for <code>network-lookup</code>, filtering for
Emacs Wiki and a URL parameter used when requesting recent changes or a
RSS feed for a single page only. That would count as suspicious
misbehaving crawler behaviour in my book.
</p>
<pre><code>Made 16 DNS requests.
4 cache hits.

</code></pre>
<p>
As far as I am concerned, all deserve to be banned. Over-banning? Maybe.
What do you think?
</p>
<p>
For demonstration purposes, this is what I ran:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus.root grep '&quot;^www.emacswiki.org.*rcidonly&quot;' /var/log
/apache2/access.log \
| tail -n 20 \
| ssh sibirocobombus.root bin/admin/network-lookup \
| wl-copy
</code></pre>
<p>
So now I’m ready to ban them all:
</p>
<pre><code>wl-paste | grep ipset
</code></pre>

It seems they all exploded simultaneously, which means they were

Were they each tampered with physically, or did someone figure out how
to trigger a thermal runaway remotely? Supply chain attack? Malicious

It is generally quite difficult to upset the denizens of a
<a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/90955">wretched hive of scum and
villainy</a> by further besmirching their reputation, but recently the
Trump family has succeeded.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I explain how
they did it, and why the denizens of the wretched hive are not
happy.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Matt Levine
identified the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-10/the-fastest-options-are-the-most-fun">fundamental
mechanism</a> at play here:<br />
<blockquote>
But you don’t have to just take your counterparties as you find them;
you can work to encourage and develop bad ones. This is often a matter
of product development: If you build a product that does nothing for
sophisticated professionals but that is really good for noisy addicted
gamblers, you will attract exactly the right sort of counterparty. This
arguably explains much of crypto.
</blockquote>
The additional point he omitted is that, in order to “attract exactly
the right sort of counterparty” you have to advertise the product. This
will bring it to the attention of others seeking the same kind of
counterparty. They will seek to leverage your product design for their
own ends.<br /> <br /> Trump has perfected the art of attracting “the
right sort of counterparty”. From
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University">Trump
University</a> to the banks he stiffed in his
<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019">multiple
bankruptcies</a>, to the stockholders of Truth Social his counterparties
have always been the
“<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/09/poker-patsy/">sucker
at the poker table</a>”. Key to this success has always been moving on
to the next scam as the previous one implodes.<br /> <br /> By the side
of the road to <strike>Damascus</strike> the White House the former
crypto-skeptic President encountered a small crowd of large
cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase, Ripple, Andreessen
Horowitz and Jump Capital. They were waving
<a href="https://followthecrypto.org/">immense sums of money</a>. Trump
underwent an instant conversion to the cryptocurrency faith, announcing
he would make the US the
“<a href="https://coinaute.com/en/trump-harris-debate-the-ignored-cryptocurrencies/">Bitcoin
capital of the world</a>”.<br /> <br /> Apart from the general idea that
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FSVSL6NZnU">more is
better</a>”, why would these immense sums of money be attractive to this
alleged billionaire? Apart from the costs of running a Presidential
campaign, some of which ends up in his own pocket, there is the need to
pay his legions of lawyers, and the looming judgements that these
lawyers failed to avert, including $88.3M before interest to E. Jean
Carroll and $454M before interest in his New York fraud case.<br />

<blockquote>
Trump’s eldest sons are gearing up to launch a new cryptocurrency
venture called <a href="https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/">World
Liberty Financial</a>, which is already receiving a big social media
boost from their father. Government ethics watchdogs say the project
could create a conflict of interest if Trump returns to the White House
next year.<br /> <br /> Trump has vowed to enact an array of pro-crypto
policies in a bid to win votes — and campaign cash — from digital asset
enthusiasts in recent months. Now, he’s
<a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1829141447087648796">weaving
the overtures</a> into his pitch for his sons’ forthcoming
startup.<br /> <br /> While the details of Eric Trump and Donald Trump
Jr.’s crypto endeavor haven’t yet been announced, it could stand to
benefit from a second Trump administration’s approach to support the
industry.<br /> …<br />
<a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/president-trump-legacy-corruption-3700-conflicts-interest/">CREW
identified more than 3,700</a> conflicts of interest during Trump’s
first term.<br /> <br /> But critics said the crypto project differs
because it could align his family’s financial interest with policy
changes that he would be poised to enact.<br /> <br /> “The prior
conflicts and illegalities took advantage of preexisting loopholes,”
said Norman Eisen, an ethics lawyer who served in the Obama White House
and later helped build the first impeachment case against Trump. “Here,
Trump appears to be promising to create the loopholes while his family
is simultaneously designing a business venture to exploit them.”
</blockquote>
The headline on World Financial’s “coming soon” web page is “World
Liberty Financial - The Only Crypto DeFi Platform supported by Donald J.
Trump”. There are dozens of “DeFi Platforms”, but the unique selling
point of World Liberty is that it is “supported by Donald J. Trump”. So
the counterparties it is intended to attract are the gullible members of
the Trump cult, the ones who have allegedly made him a
billionaire.<br /> <br /> With this unique selling point the actual
product doesn’t need to be very good to compete with the market leader,
<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/decentralized-crypto-exchanges-market-share">Uniswap</a>,
for its chosen counterparties. As Molly White reported,
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-65/">it wasn’t</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
CoinDesk has gotten hold of a white paper for this supposed World
Liberty Financial, which they note appears to be a clone of Dough
Finance, a crypto lending platform that was hacked for around $2 million
just a month and a half ago. The hack was not a sophisticated one, and
instead exploited sloppiness on behalf of the development team.
</blockquote>
Of course, many people interested in gullible counterparties noticed all
the hype, and they didn’t have to wait to hack the actual product launch
to <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-65/">get in on the
action</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The project hasn’t even launched yet, and it’s off to a bumpy start.
First, Donald Trump Jr. had to issue a statement to try to stop people
from buying up all the fake tokens purporting to be associated with
their murky project. Then, Twitter accounts for Lara and Tiffany Trump
were both compromised and used to send tweets announcing a supposed
token launch. “This is a scam!!!” tweeted Eric, himself retweeting the
tweet from his wife’s account containing the scam token address.

The reason for this fiasco was that, as usual, the Trumps hired

influencers.
</blockquote>
The leader of the Dough Finance team was Chase Herro. When it came time
to move on, he obviously found in the Trumps the ignorant and greedy
counterparty he needed. Zeke Faux and Muyao Shen also piled on with
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-13/behind-the-trump-crypto-project-is-a-self-described-dirtbag-of-the-internet"><i>Behind
the Trump Crypto Project Is a Self-Described ‘Dirtbag of the
Internet’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Herro, a fast-talking 39-year-old who shows off his fancy cars and
private-jet rides on social media, is an unknown in the crypto world.
More than a dozen prominent digital-asset investors said in interviews
they had never heard of him. The only crypto project with which he was
publicly affiliated attracted only a few million dollars and suffered a
devastating hack. A token he promoted on influencer Logan Paul’s podcast
dropped 96% afterward. In one speech in 2018, he called himself “the
dirtbag of the internet” and said that regulators should “kick s—heads
like me out.”<br /> <br /> “You can literally sell s— in a can, wrapped
in piss, covered in human skin, for a billion dollars if the story’s
right, because people will buy it,” Herro said about crypto in a 2018
YouTube video recorded as he drove in a Rolls-Royce. “I’m not going to
question the right and wrong of all that.”

Jasper Goodman reported on the cryptosphere’s reaction to this
incompetent blatant grift in
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/06/trump-family-crypto-startup-00177566"><i>‘A
huge mistake’: Trump’s crypto allies cringe over family’s
startup</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“This is a huge mistake,” said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter who is a
founding partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Castle
Island Ventures. “It looks like Trump’s inner circle is just cashing in
on his recent embrace of crypto in a kind of naive way, and frankly it
looks like they’re burning a lot of the good will that’s been built with
the industry so far.”<br /> …<br /> “It’s a very typical playbook of
smaller operators or more amateur operations in the crypto space to try
to generate a lot of hype before revealing the details,” said Austin
Campbell, an adjunct professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business who
previously led the risk and portfolio management operation at the crypto
firm Paxos. “That makes them susceptible to all sorts of
nonsense.”<br /> …<br /> One crypto industry representative in
Washington, granted anonymity because of sensitivities around
criticizing Trump, described having “a laundry list of concerns.” A big
worry is that that it could reflect poorly on the industry as it pushes
for policy changes that would help legitimize the sector.<br /> <br />
“Maybe it doesn’t move the needle for most people, but if this thing is
hacked or regular folks lose money on it or it opens up the door for the
SEC to investigate the team, it only looks like it has downside risk,”
Carter said. “It looks to have very little upside risk.”
</blockquote>
<p>As with Trump University and Truth Social, the whole point is for
“regular folks” to lose money. But, if you’re a candidate positioning
yourself as pro-crypto in the hope of getting large checks from the
cryptosphere, making this obvious to everyone but the cult members is a
bad idea.<br /> <br /> PS: Wikipedia explains the title of this post

theorized why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack
Dorsey</a> is disappointed with Bluesky
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">on
Bluesky</a>. I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly
personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he’s a
human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and
I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or
bad. If my
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">theory</a>
is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it’s a valid point, Bluesky
was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The
more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with
being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did.
Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform
as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about,
basically global object storage with real financial backing, we’d be
much further along with the web as an operating system. We’re
paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don’t
understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It
can’t hurt to talk about what-if’s instead of barrelling down the same
ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00’s. I’ve been writing about
this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let’s start
talking about how we break out, because it’s not going to “just happen”
organically.</p>

Developers Targeted with Malware During Fake Job Interviews</h2>

Interesting social engineering attack: luring potential job applicants
with fake recruiting pitches, trying to
<a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/fake-recruiter-coding-tests-target-devs-with-malicious-python-packages">convince
them</a> to download malware. From a

article</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
These particular attacks from North Korean state-funded hacking team
Lazarus Group are new, but the overall malware campaign against the
Python development community has been running since at least August of
2023, when a number of popular open source Python tools were maliciously
duplicated with added malware. Now, though, there are also attacks
involving “coding tests” that only exist to get the end user to install
hidden malware on their system (cleverly hidden with Base64 encoding)
that allows remote execution once present. The capacity for exploitation
at that point is pretty much unlimited, due to the flexibility of Python
and how it interacts with the underlying OS…

It’s the same idea. There’s so much cynicism around tech, and I hate
that. We’ve rarely seen it as a human thing both by the people who make
the meals and the people who love great food. The world thinks of it as
billionaires and influencers and lying fascist politicians. But it

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads,
Twitter, WordPress and RSS.
</p>
<p>
Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">The RSS feed</a>
is doing a lot of the work.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Links from the RSS feed show up on my
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links page</a> and in the
<a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emails</a>.
</li>
<li>
The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through
micro.blog. I am able to
<a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">give</a> it the
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">URL</a> of the
linkblogging feed, and then click on
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png">Add
Threads</a> – and that’s it. When I post something to the feed it shows
up on Threads.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most
people don’t know it’s there. It’s sort of a Grand Central station for
moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you’re a
micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog</p>
<p>In the late ’70s, I worked for a while at the Psychical Research
Foundation, which occupied a couple of houses on Duke University
property and did scientific research into the possibility of life after
death. My time there was a lever that has lifted my life on Earth ever
since, including many deep and enduring […]</p>

<span class="label">Part 1</span> Automation is driving the next wave of
commoditization, threatening to replace skilled workers
</h4>
<pre><code>  &lt;p&gt;As we have said before, the software industry has a decades-long history of cost-cutting, commoditization, and a successful sales model of &quot;pile &#39;em high, sell &#39;em cheap.&quot; This has worrying consequences if your skill set is the next one to be commoditized. But there may be ways out of this narrowing commercial bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>

on Trump can be seen as a symptom of the hate-filled politics he and
Vance are peddling.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>I still have the SHARP Zaurus SL-C3200. A cute tiny clamshell PDA -
actually a tiny Linux laptop. I have got it when it was already obsolete
and used it little. It’s the most expensive model with the biggest RAM
(128 MB, I think), the bigges storage space (the 6GB HDD) and - of
course - the biggest power consumption.</p>

I’ve got to say, I’m lurking in various pregnancy/“new parent”
subreddits and it’s weird to me how often I see comments like “in our
parents’ generation breastfeeding was discouraged” or “dads didn’t
change nappies then” or whatever. I was born in the early 90s and my
mum/aunts absolutely felt the same enormous pressure to make
breastfeeding work as exists today… and the men did their fair share of
active baby care (including, but not limited to, changing nappies).
Yeah, some things were different, but the 90s aren’t THAT long ago.
These people are talking like they were the Dark Ages…

<p>I was recruited to speak at a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti">Ria Novosti</a>
conference in Moscow in June 2011, but decided not to go. This was back
when we thought naively that Russia was a democracy, and working with
Russian journalists, when American journalists wouldn’t, seemed like a
fair deal. Something about it didn’t smell right though, so I stayed
home.</p>

<p>I used to think of
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">Twitter
as a coral reef</a>, but its role as a world wide notification system is
fading, and we haven’t replaced it with anything. I wrote

has changed in the twitterverse, it’s grown new centers. For me,
Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot
less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for
ActivityPub but that’s more complicated than it may seem. As often is
the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a
strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn’t work,
when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users,
completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable
speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their
users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I
think it’s better if we, as users, remain diversified.</p>

<p>
You’ll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been
in every presidential election because then they’d have to fire half
their political reporters.
</p>
<p>
If you want a better idea of how it’s going, look at where the ad
dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning.
</p>
<p>
And make sure all your friends know that you’re voting and who you’re
voting for. I think that makes a difference.

<p>
I’m voting straight Democratic party line.

<p>If ChatGPT had a simple, non-AI scrapbook, like the old Mac OS had,
where you could just throw something over your shoulder so you can find
it later with a text search, that would make it a lot more useful for
retaining practices that work. It’s a shame to work something out, come
up with the answer that worked, and then to have to do it all over again
23 months later when you encounter the same problem.</p>
