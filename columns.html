took me a long time to figure out that when people respond to you on
twitter-like systems they aren’t actually speaking to <i>you,</i>
they’re talking over your shoulder to the masses they imagine are
reading what you posted. Three comments. 1. There are no masses. You can
see this by looking at the stats for each tweet, available on most
platforms. 2. Most users on the social web are trying to get attention
for themselves, the only reason they read the posts is to see if there’s
a place for them to attach their message. 3. A simple tweak to the
software would make it so that only the author of the post being
responded to could see the replies. Then they could RT a reply if they
thought everyone should see it. This would make the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> a lot more useful
imho.</p>

October on record</a>. November weather was much nicer, but lacked the

without so much as a sneeze from the gods of winter. My son’s team took

won their first competition gaining them a bid to nationals in the

<p>
Three major holidays have passed since the last update so I’m sure it’s
going to be too much to distill, but I’ve tried to blog through the
bigger vibes like
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/11/goodbye-moogs/">my cat passing
away</a>, <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/12/adhd/">my ADHD
diagnosis</a>, and
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/12/my-little-games-workshop/">releasing
some games</a>. So with those abstracted out, let’s reminisce on the
recent past…
</p>
<h2>
A trip to the mothership
</h2>
<p>
The biggest event was my trip to Microsoft in November. It’s been nearly
a decade since I’ve been to the Microsoft campus, but notably this is
the first time I’ve met my new coworkers in person! I’m happy to report
that my coworkers are all great people. Thankfully my small engineering
team as well as the larger design organization is high functioning when
it comes to hybrid/remote work, so I don’t feel left out of the
on-premise centralized loop that I’ve felt in previous Microsoft
engagements. My team made it easy to <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> (!!!) in
and feel welcome.
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/opinions.jpg" alt="A printout of my avatar with a speech bubble that says I'm here with opinions" height="600" width="600" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px">
<p>
An example, my sweet coworkers hung up a print out of my avatar in one
of the conference rooms with a little speech bubble that says “I‘m here
with OPINIONS” which I find endearing. The side bonus is that Teams the
app sees the avatar and thinks its a person and will zoom-in on it in
every meeting. My avatar is an ever-present participant in a lot of
meetings to the extent that five different people walked up to me said
“Oh, it’s the guy from the conference room!” which is probably the
biggest payoff to a long running gag that I’ve seen in my lifetime.
</p>
<p>
We spent most days strategizing in conference rooms but also did morale
building events. One highlight for me was our studio’s tour of the
Microsoft Inclusive Tech Lab where I got to talk with Dave Dame. I’ve
been a fan of his for awhile now, he has a way of communicating the need
to reject “other-ism” that sticks with you. He shared with us some of
the challenges he faces as a person with limited mobility and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFYCVWm4K4A">how AI is
impacting his life for the better</a>. One night a group of us remote
and local employees went out for dinner and ate grasshoppers. Another
highlight was sneaking into a demo day event where designers at Edge
were prototyping in the browser with web components. This grinch’s heart
grew three times that day.
</p>
<p>
Everyone apologized for the rain while I was there but I loved the soggy
weather coming from six months of Texas heat. I found it nothing but
charming. Redmond has grown up considerably in the decade since my last
visit, and the Microsoft campus is almost unrecognizable to me. Redmond
used to be a bunch of small one or two story buildings but now it’s all
enormous five story buildings. Redmond was wooing me pretty hard though
I won’t lie; next to my hotel was an outdoor mall that had an
<em>izakaya</em>, a games shop, a guitar center, and an upscale
Hobbytown with Gunpla! It felt like my own personal Disneyland generated
from my search history.
</p>
<p>
Spent a lot of time with work folks, but I caught up with a couple old
friends while I was there. One night I met up with Kyle who was the
other engineer at Luro who now works at Amazon. We were long overdue to
celebrate in person together and close a chapter on the two years of
intense sprinting we did together at Luro. Then I got to see Kelly and
Charles who I worked with through multi-year engagements on
microsoft.com, it’s great to know other people at such a big place like
Microsoft. And one night I snuck over to Fremont for a memorable night
of playing vintage and indie arcade and pinball games with Adam Argyle.
It’s good to have good friends from the internet.
</p>
<p>
All said, I think the main purpose of my trip – firm handshakes and
letting my coworkers know I’m a real person – was a success. Hopefully,
I’ll find myself in Redmond more often.
</p>
<h2>
Other major happenings
</h2>
<p>
A speed run of other notable events but in the interest of time we’ll
keep it brief:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In October I deleted my X account. I call it X because that’s it’s new
name and it’s a stupid name for a stupid website. I put 14 years into
that site and it’s surprising how easy deleting my account was. Over
time logging in felt icky and the “heartbeat of the internet” parts have
been co-opted by Russian bot farms. I don’t thrive on the self-created
chaos Elon brings and I don’t want to support whatever flavor of white
male supremacy is flourishing there. Bluer and calmer skies over on
Bluesky and (my favorite) Mastodon.
</li>
<li>
Halloween was a hit. My block does it pretty big and we’re lucky to have
hundreds of kids roaming on my street.
</li>
<li>
I only drive about 20 miles a week and I wanted those 20 miles to be
fun, so we bought a Jeep. It’s a whole vibe to be honest. You can even
make “Jeep” your entire personality if you want. I’m not there yet, but
having fun exploring the space.
</li>
<li>
Thanksgiving was low key and bought the Whole Foods pre-made dinner for
four. That made prep-day simple and no one got overwhelmed.
</li>
<li>
The last weekend in November
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/11/goodbye-moogs/">our elderly cat
Moogs passed away</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/12/adhd/">I got diagnosed with
ADHD</a> and started taking meds.
</li>
<li>
We stayed in town for Christmas and that was pretty wonderful.
Mrs. Claus did a great job getting presents for the kids.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Recapping three whole months isn’t fun, but spinning off some of the
major events into their own posts was pretty efficient so I should do
that more.
</p>
<h2>
The more quantifiable parts
</h2>
<h3>
🧠 <strong>Learning</strong>
</h3>
<p>
I’m sure this list is incomplete, but went down some rabbit trails
researching health issues like my ADHD but a couple non-health issues as
well.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
ADHD and the different medication options
</li>
<li>
Intermittent fasting and the effects of glucose spikes and insulin
resistance.
</li>
<li>
Tone.js - In my side projects I got to play with Tone.js a bit and I
love it.
</li>
<li>
Soviet Central Planning - I’m curious why soviet central planning
failed. This overlaps with to Stalinist communism, World War II, Russian
cosmonauts, and Kremlinology.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
🚀 Releases
</h3>
<p>
I got hellbent on releasing some projects this quarter and feel
accomplished even if they are small in scope.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://mundango.daverupert.com/">Mundango</a> - A game about
noticing life’s small things
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://pentablaster.daverupert.com/">Pentablaster</a> - An
instrument with no wrong notes
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://hardcodesoftskills.daverupert.com/">Hard Code &amp;
Soft Skills</a> - A workplaced themed RPG
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wrote about
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/12/my-little-games-workshop/">my
little games workshop</a> more in depth if you’re curious about the why
or my process. I’m also play testing a game with the ShopTalk Discord
and am slowly iterating towards a release.
</p>
<h3>
📖 <strong>Reading</strong>
</h3>
<p>
Read a lot more than I expected. After multiple recommendations I
finally started reading The Murderbot Diaries and holy cow, what a great
series. Each book is like a little 150-page snack that I get to enjoy.
It feels good to read (e-)paper books again too, not just audiobooks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Finished</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3nbn1hV">Humankind</a> - Finished this book for
the second and it’s as great as I remember. I probably need to buy a
physical copy that I can highlight up.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/40I8Rw8">It’s not you, it’s Capitalism</a> -
Marxist communism wrapped in a “You go girl!” blanket. Not for me but a
good critique of the capitalist system is in there.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3UKf5Ic">Lost in Austin</a> - The history of
Austin, as told by an Englishman, focusing on the rapid growth tech boom
town era from the early 2000s to present. It’s an ever present fear that
Austin is changing too much, but this book makes a good argument that
what made Austin cool can’t live in the new upscale downtown and high
rents.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3ChWZH5">All Systems Red</a>, The Murderbot
Diaries No.1 - A sassy and depressed robot built for murder finds a new
life after it hacks its governor module.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3CuuhTr">The Psychology of Money</a> - I
thought this was going to be a book about understanding money from a
psychological perspective; instead it was a book about how rich people
abuse the system and it made me mad.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B075DGHHQL.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg">Artificial
Condition</a>, The Murderbot Diaries No.2 - Another great sassy robot
read.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3VhtcFd">Play Nice</a> - The rise, fall, and
collapse of Activision/Blizzard. As someone who plays games by this
company, I found it cathartic.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/4gbKrjd">Thinking in Systems</a> - I went in
hoping for design system inspiration but got mad about the incoming
Trump administration because it’s a lot about incentives and guardrails,
which will soon flip upside down.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://koguchipress.com/products/koguchi-magazine-1-arcana-dawn">Koguchi
Magazine #1</a> - A sci-fi kickstarter comic I backed… not my favorite.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://koguchipress.com/products/koguchi-magazine-2-neo-future">Koguchi
Magazine #2</a> - Issue #2 of the sci-fi kickstarter comic I backed… was
a little bit better than the first.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/4fRPUMt">Life in the Fasting Lane</a> - A book
on the benefits of intermittent fasting… not my favorite
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/49B0bdt">Fair Play</a> - A subject I care
about, the inequality gap between men and women when factoring in all
the “glue work” and homemaking tasks that (typically) women absorb as
part of their duties… but the husband in this book is such a cringe
asshole it’s hard to think a card game is going to solve their problems
when what they need is marriage counseling. I don’t want to be in the
middle of that relationship so I didn’t finish the book.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3OWoCsA">Glucose Revolution</a> - Either this
book is the holy grail to fixing all health problems in America… or it’s
a book by someone who took a simple fact (glucose spikes aren’t great
for your body) and extrapolated that to be the cause of all health
problems ever. I think it’s the latter.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3VEyxXv">Rogue Protocol</a>, The Murderbot
Diaries No.3 - More sassy robot. Great.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>
📺 Media Diet
</h3>
<p>
Let’s take a look at what was on the ol’ boob tube.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Movies</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Join or Die (2024) - Documentary about Robert Putnam’s life work
analyzing civil decline. Warning: this will make you want to change your
life a bit.
</li>
<li>
PLAY! (2024) - A classic Japanese sports team story but this time with
kids from remote Shikoku forming a Rocket League eSports team. It’s not
rated well on Letterboxd, but I enjoyed it. Caught this one on a plane.
</li>
<li>
Jingle All the Way (1996) - Rewatched this Christmas classic… and it’s
super unhinged.
</li>
<li>
The Best Christmas Pagent Ever (2024) - A sweet Christmas story if
you’re into the whole “true meaning of Christmas” message.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>TV</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Interior Chinatown (Hulu) - An all-star cast headed up by Jimmy O. Yang
from Silicon Valley. Half procedural cop drama, half Truman show, it all
comes together in a way that produces a wonderful commentary on seeing
people and cultures that act like background characters behind the
scenes.
</li>
<li>
Very Important People S2 (Dropout) - Vic Michelas is as it again.
</li>
<li>
Make Some Noise S3 (Dropout) - This show is really stepping into its
own.
</li>
<li>
Ranma ½ (Netflix) - I wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered
it… and I’d say yeah. Not for kids tho.
</li>
<li>
Skeleton Crew (Disney+) - This is Goonies in Space and I’ll take it. I
haven’t been able to get into any of the extracurricular Star Wars shows
but this one hits with me because I think it knows what it needs to be…
a Star Wars story that can exist and play in that universe, but break
away from the classic Star Wars tropes.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Podcasts</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Adventure Zone Abnimals - I don’t know about this one, but is
growing on me.
</li>
<li>
Maintenance Phase - Re-listening to a lot of favorite episodes
</li>
<li>
If Books Could Kill - Such a fun look at popular culture through the
lens of books. The “shitty person says something shitty” formula is
getting tired but… nonetheless.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
🎙 <strong>Recording</strong>
</h3>
<p>
Recorded some great episodes of Shoptalk, chief among them was a live
action role play episode of ShopTalk.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/646/">Hard Code &amp; Soft Skills</a>
- Chris, Alex, Ben, and Miriam play an RPG game that I devised.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/642/">Chris Person on Forums, Reddit,
and Cooperative Reporting</a> - Forums rule.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/637/">Approachable Open Source with
Brian Muenzenmeyer</a> - Is open source without burnout possible?
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
🤖 Gunpla and modelling
</h3>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/beargguy.jpg" alt="A teddy bear mech with a bow on its back that looks cute in one photo but angry in the next" height="600" width="1200">
<p>
Cooled off on Gunpla but have got the bug to pick it back up as work
becomes less busy. Exhausted by the slower process of the master grade
format, I decided to go back to high grade models to get the passion
back.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
MG Red Frame Astray - stalled
</li>
<li>
Beargguy III - completed
</li>
<li>
AK-47 Rubber band gun - my brother got me this wooden model of an AK-47
rubber band gun and I’m about half way done and it’s been pretty fun.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
🌱 Digital Gardening (née Open Source)
</h3>
<p>
Renaming this category because technically work is open source a bit and
that’s confusing, so I thought I’d make it more about growing and
maintaining web objects.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tinkering on my website in subtle ways
</li>
<li>
Making little web components, per usual
</li>
<li>
Attended some Web Components Community Group meetings.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
👾 <strong>Video games</strong>
</h3>
<p>
Spent more time making games than playing games. My PC had a
catastrophic BIOS update failure and the verdict’s still out but I might
need to rebuild the whole thing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brawl Stars - this game is a treadmill I don’t need to be on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Got an <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-plus">Anbernic
RG35XX Plus</a> pocket emulator for Christmas, so hopefully my vintage
game plays list will grow.

<h2 id="using-claude-to-write-software">Using Claude to write
software</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I just had a fairly incredible experience using
<a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a>. Rather than write up the
work we did, I asked Claude to do it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dave started by sharing a text outline of computing platforms (Mac, iOS,
Windows, Unix and their variants) and asked if I could visualize it. I
began with a simple mindmap diagram using Mermaid. Then Dave showed me a
more sophisticated design with rounded rectangles and arrows, so I
adapted my approach and created a matching SVG version.
</li>
<li>
The most interesting moment came when Dave casually asked if I could
turn this into a Node.js package. This was an audacious request - moving
from a single visualization to a complete, reusable software package -
but it was exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy. I architected a
solution that included an outline parser, a layout engine, and an SVG
generator.
</li>
<li>
I particularly enjoyed designing the two-pass layout algorithm. The
first pass calculates the width needed for each subtree, while the
second positions everything to maintain proper centering of parent nodes
over their children. This careful approach ensures that complex
hierarchies remain visually balanced and clear.
</li>
<li>
When Dave expressed amazement at the result, I realized this interaction
exemplified something important: AI assistants aren’t just code
generators, but can be thoughtful collaborators in the software
development process. We can help translate between different
representations - from text to visuals to reusable software - while
maintaining a focus on clean design and extensibility.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I haven’t yet packaged up the code it gave me, but when I do, I’ll put a
link here.
</p>
<p>
BTW, here’s the
<a href="http://scripting.com/code/testing/treechart/index.html">app</a>
I wrote that generated the tree I asked Claude to render.

<p>BTW, as a longtime speaker of English <i>and</i> programmer, I think
the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a>
is re-dundant. The term comes from mathematics where you simplify a
statement without altering its truth. Factoring is a repetitive process.
You factor, and then factor some more if you can.</p>

<p>The problem with everyone who says you have to get off Twitter is
that we’re giving up the meeting place we had and spreading all the bits
into the wind. Are you going to leave the United States now that Trump
is going to be president again? Leaving Twitter is a lot like that. How
do you know Musk isn’t going to have to sell it? Might happen. How would
you feel then about having quit Twitter in a huff as if it would always
be the bastion of assholes. It’s a mistake. He isn’t making money with
it. The more you use it the more it costs him, btw. By leaving you might
actually be helping him survive. Nothing is so linear, first big point.
Second big point, no one cares about your gestures.</p>

<p>
The
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/miniature-camera-poker-cheating/">basic
strategy</a> is to place a device with a hidden camera in a position to
capture normally hidden card values, which are interpreted by an
accomplice off-site and fed back to the player via a hidden microphone.
Miniaturization is making these devices harder to detect. Presumably AI
will soon obviate the need for an accomplice.

<h2 id="my-little-games-workshop">My little games workshop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I always promised myself that if I was ever unemployed that I’d make a
video game. When life dealt me an unpaid work hiatus though, the last
thing I wanted to do was code in my spare
time<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. I
worried I would have to let that dream, that part of me, die on the
vine. But as interviews started going well the desire to try my hand at
making a game came back. And in true adult ADHD fashion I didn’t focus
on one game, but rather made a half-dozen different games in different
formats and three of those games have made it to the release stage.
Here’s an overview of those games and a little background on how I
manage to make them.
</p>
<h2>
Mundango, a bingo game about life’s small things
</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mundango-v1.png" alt="the bingo board ui for mundango" width="1200" height="719">
<p>
During my unpaid hiatus I found myself getting a lot of pleasure in the
small things; seeing a cool bird, staring at trees, or watching animals
be animal-like. To not lose sight of those moments and with a desire to
replace my social media addiction, I made
<a href="https://mundango.daverupert.com/">Mundango</a>, a bingo game
about noticing life’s small things.
</p>
<p>
The icon is a chill turtle because it invokes the feeling of going slow.
The font is a playful little handwritten sans. And there’s a
(Japan-inspired) minor pentatonic scale that plays as you check items
off. I hope you enjoy it but more importantly I hope it nudges you (and
myself) to stop doomscrolling on our phones so much and to start looking
outside the windows a bit more often.
</p>
<h2>
Hard Code &amp; Soft Skills, a workplace adventure
</h2>

In January, the unemployment got to my head and I got inspired to make a
role playing game called
<a href="https://hardcodesoftskills.daverupert.com/">Hard Code &amp;
Soft Skills</a>. It’s a
workplace-themed<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
clone of <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/">Lasers
&amp; Feelings</a>, a one-pager by John Harper. The original game is
loosely based on Star Trek, where you can use lasers or diplomacy to
solve your problems. I wanted to flip that a bit and have the game world
be a startup because tech needs to realize that soft skills are as
valuable as code, so that’s my big social commentary.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t labor intensive to clone the original game, but I put a lot of
time into building a little one-page website with a character generator.
It’s Astro and web components, if you’re curious. I also put a lot of
mental energy in planning out the
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/646/">first episode of Hard Code &amp;
Soft Skills on Shop Talk</a>. It went better than I could have imagined
and what a thrill to get it out the door.

Pentablaster, an instrument with no wrong notes
</h2>

<p>
The pentatonic scale sound effects in Mundango were a hit with some
folks, so I dug in and built a whole instrument that only plays
pentatonic scales and called it
<a href="https://pentablaster.daverupert.com/">Pentablaster</a>! It took
about a week and I’m pleased with how it turned out. It’s jammy and a
little unique. I extended it to allow you to change the key and to
choose which pentatonic scale you want to play.
</p>
<p>
There’s some features I’d like to add, but worry it’ll enter the “so
complicated I don’t want to work on it anymore” paradox. I’ll park it
for now, but I learned a lot about
<a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> in the process.

An unreleased solitaire game
</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/youdied.jpg" alt="a skull with the text you died beneath it and a button that says reset game" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
<p>
I went on a short bender learning about Solo RPGs (like
<a href="https://coisinhaverde.itch.io/ronin">Ronin</a>) and that
sparked an interest in trying my hand at making one. I challenged myself
to prototype the game on pen and paper first to prove the game
mechanics. After an evening of brainstorming, I devised a game system
based on a standard 52-card deck of playing cards as a prototype. I
play-tested it with my son and we both thought that I should make a
mobile app version. After some nights and weekends, I had a rough alpha
prototype.
</p>
<p>
I play-tested the game with friends in the ShopTalk Discord and I got
great, actionable feedback. They confirmed my suspicion that the RNG
(randomness) was too high, creating a lack of decision making agency and
thereby ruining the fun. I made some tweaks and the second round of
play-tests went much better. It’s feeling pretty good now, but I think
there’s one more ingredient needed to tie it all together before public
release.
</p>
<h2>
An unreleased Playdate game
</h2>
<p>
<video src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/newguy.mp4" muted autoplay loop playsinline alt="player walking around in office with npc boss in room, he exits and goes to a much larger room, black and white monochrome only">
</video>
</p>
<p>
Since acquiring a little yellow wind-up boi, it’s been a small dream to
write a game for <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a> and I picked
the idea that seemed like the easiest and most PlayDate’y and descoped
the hell out of it so that I’d have an achievable goal. It’s an
office-themed<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
RPG type game.
</p>
<p>
After playing with Playdate’s web-based game editor
<a href="https://play.date/pulp/">Pulp</a> and trying PulpScript, I felt
the chafing of limitations and wanted to get closer to the metal. I
watched every one of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPcfC98JogQ&amp;list=PLlMPQvEA0GZPOuKJyhSr3Ra0vrpCiBTnb">SquidGod’s
Development Tutorials</a> and decided to download the
<a href="https://play.date/dev/">Playdate SDK</a> and write the game in
Lua. This is my first time writing Lua and it’s been interesting because
everything in Lua is a table: Arrays are tables, Dictionaries are
tables, Objects are tables… tables all the way down. That takes some
“undoing” of prior programming best practices to feel comfortable but
after awhile you learn to embrace the chaos and for-loopedness.
</p>
<p>
To short cut some of the player controllers and level building I picked
<a href="https://github.com/unbelievableflavour/Cotton?tab=readme-ov-file">Cotton</a>,
a Lua-based framework for Playdate. Cotton uses the
<a href="https://ldtk.io/">LDtk map editor</a> for easier map making and
that was a feature I was looking forward to using. However, I
encountered a bug somewhere between the framework and LDtk. If I updated
the map, my player could no longer get to a different room. Insecurity
started to set in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is this bug because I don’t know Lua?
</li>
<li>
Is this bug because I don’t understand LDtk?
</li>
<li>
Or is this a bug somewhere in Cotton?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Feedback from the Playdate Dev Discord was “Last commit is 2 years ago,
project’s dead” and “Use [Framework X] instead”… 😮‍💨 Ugh. I thought only
JavaScript dorks did this but apparently Lua dorks do it too. I
understand they’re trying to be a version of helpful; but this is
terrible advice for someone who is learning. “You need to start over” or
in video game parlance “The Princess is in another castle” kills the
dopamine rush needed when learning something new.
</p>
<p>
But I didn’t give up. And after many shower thoughts, I mustered up the
energy to do some good ol’ fashioned debugging. The first step was
step-by-step isolation where I manually diff’d thousands of lines of
JSON line-by-line. That one step taught me there was a change in the
exported JSON somewhere between the version of LDtk that Cotton used
(v1.3) and the latest version of LDtk (v1.5.3). The primary key for
joining map tiles no longer exists in v1.5.3. Then I followed the
breadcrumb trail of how Cotton imports LDtk files and I fixed the bug by
creating a new table (because Lua) to act as a join table for the
neighboring map tiles.
</p>
<p>
I was able to finish my core game loop and I’m proud of that, but fixing
a framework level bug cut the wind out of my sails.
<a href="https://github.com/unbelievableflavour/Cotton/issues/36">I may
PR the bug fix</a>… but it’s more of a patch job than a holistic fix and
I’m unsure if the author of Cotton is even interested in supporting that
on their abandoned project.
</p>
<p>
Will this game ever come out? I hope so, but it’s emotionally hard to
pick up after fighting with it so much. If I buckled down, built some
assets, and wrote more NPC dialog I bet I could finish it in a couple
human weeks of work. Perhaps I could outsource the asset creation.
</p>
<h2>
How the sausage gets made
</h2>
<p>
I make my games after the kids and spouse go to bed or while the TV runs
mindlessly. In some ways I’m borrowing from my own mental health staying
up late tinkering with little apps that I’m going to give away for free.
But these ideas all occupy brain RAM, so it feels good to chip away at
ideas and get them out the door, to make room for more ideas, to chip
away at ideas, to get them out the door… it’s a vicious cycle, but I
think a net positive for my mental health.
</p>
<p>
To hedge against wasting my spare time, I get prototypes out for review
as soon as possible to gauge interest and invest accordingly. Shopping
prototypes curbs emotional over-investment in an idea. Time builds
attachment to bad ideas, making them seem good and grander in your head
than reality. If you build in secret too long, it ends in disappointment
when the public doesn’t understand your genius you spent all your time
on.
</p>
<p>
I default to web tech because it’s what I know best and staying in your
wheelhouse means you can move faster with less mystery roadblocks (like
the LDtk map issue above). But I’d like <em>NOT WORK</em> to not feel
like work and see value in that, so this may change going forward.
</p>
<p>
At times I create artificial limitations (e.g., limit myself to a single
asset pack) because if the scope is overly broad and infinite, that
guarantees failure. Having rules, even if arbitrary, allows for play.
</p>
<p>
The last tool in the toolbelt is scoping the hell out of my ideas. When
attention is your biggest limitation (e.g. ADHD) then keeping
checkpoints small and achievable are critical. Then once you have the
foundations established, do as much as time and ambition allow.
</p>
<h2>
Unsure of what’s next… or how to book all of your free time from now
until death with no promise of financial gain.
</h2>
<p>
I have dozens of ideas kicking around in my head at all times, so my
main issue is prioritization. Here’s the ideas that occupy a lot of
brain RAM:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Finishing <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/03/gamedev-journal-1/">my
son’s Zelda-like</a>
</li>
<li>
An ambitious battle royale that would take a hundred developers a
hundred years to finish
</li>
<li>
A platformer with a slime mechanic
</li>
<li>
A local multiplayer game that has a Mario Kart vibe, but isn’t a karting
game.
</li>
<li>
A Solid Snake stealth game but for escaping awkward social situations
</li>
<li>
A horror game parody
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01B4BqWxtKo">Tim McGraw’s
What-if? Trucks: Fates</a>
</li>
<li>
A space shooter / medical sim
</li>
<li>
A Contra-like with a dumb twist
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That’s a sampling of what’s going on up in the ol’ electric meatball.
Not to be too macabre, but I’m not sure I have the lifespan left to get
through even half of that short list. Hopefully there’s a banger billion
dollar idea in there that allows me to retire and work on all the
non-profitable dumb ideas.
</p>
<p>
While doing this for a living is far off and/or will never happen I am
at least pleased that I lived up to the promise to myself to make games
if I had spare time. I made games, smaller in scope than what I had
originally imagined, but I’m comfortable with that given the timelines.
No regrets there.
</p>
<p>
Risky as it may be, I may jump to a 3D engine because I’ve had a lot of
fun building in environments like Unity in the past. That balloons the
scope and raises the level of difficulty beyond my current expertise and
it has never worked in the past… but perhaps this time it’ll be
different! 😂

This essay is so good. You probably have seen it linked a few times on
social media. I certainly have. And yet, perhaps you have not. If you
have not, it’s a great read tying together our terrible computer
experiences, us being exploited by big tech, enshittification and rot
economy. The growth mindset that kills us all.

<blockquote>
<p>
Holding these people to a higher standard at scale is what brings about
change. Be the wrench in the machine. Be the person that explains to a
friend why Facebook sucks now, and who chose to make it suck. Be the
person to explain who Prabhakar Raghavan is and what his role was in
making Google Search worse. Be the person who tells people that Sam
Altman burns $5 billion a year on unsustainable software that destroys
the environment and is built upon the large-scale larceny of creative
works because he’s desperate for power. –

Now there is a mission statement for bloggers and people on social
media.

<p>
It also confirms my peculiar service offerings like Emacs Wiki or
Campaign Wiki. They are free for users. They are simpler and they don’t
change much. There are no ads and there is no “growth” to be had. In
fact, if more people set up similar sites that are similar in these
respects, it’ll be better for us. We’ll be more resilient, more adapted
to our local needs, it’ll be more like community tools for all of us
instead of slop for us and billions for them. This is where I want to
go.

am ready to start programming ChatGPT, the same way I have built my own
code writing and deploying software on Macintosh. I want to create rules
in some kind of macro language that it will never violate. I find it has
huge problems with memory, it says it’s remembering something, but has
forgotten it 24 hours later. This is like the

Whale</a> in the early days of Twitter. Cute, because the system is
doing something so new, futuristic and useful, but after a while it’s
not cute because we’re using the system for real work. The web is
programmable, our operating systems are, of course the AI-o-verse will
be programmable too. We are able to create entirely new development
environments, these platforms deserve a fresh new look at
<i>everything.</i> I’d also like to note that at the same time, the
platforms are breaking through in web user interfaces. Remarkable
progress. Far beyond what we were doing in the very stagnant Web 2.0
world. They’re still stuck on whether or not our writing can have
titles. So bizarre to exist in a world that is deliberately hobbled, and
another with infinite horizons. Anyway this is what I’m thinking about
just before hunkering down with my Knicks and popcorn, a Christmas
tradition for many many years. Ho ho ho.</p>

<p>I have a fairly large and old
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier">C application</a> that
was written to run on the Mac and Windows. I still use it today on a
relatively modern Macintosh. I wonder if it will soon be possible to
turn this project over to an AI like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity or
some other, to convert it to run on Linux, where it should be able to
run in perpetuity, or at least a lot longer than on the Macintosh. I
would be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to do this work.</p>

<p>Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. It was what I needed
to build <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, it defines
its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features
writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no
character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of.
Defining a new network where if you want to play you’ll need to start
thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can’t be on the
open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like
features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into
copying and pasting into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>, that’s how you know you’re in a silo. If you can use any
writing tool to post to a network, then it <i>is</i> on the web. Pretty
simple. Right now – <i>none</i> of the popular ones qualify. None.</p>

with a friend about the

possible for one company to control. All it will take is one popular
podcast client to get the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump#Priming_a_pump">pump

This is how it worked with podcasting. Steady mission broadcasting, keep
beating the drum, and if it’s the right idea and when it’s the right
time, eventually, it happens. It will be that way too for this layer of
the network, but at this time I don’t own a podcast client, and that’s
the most basic ingredient in this bootstrap, so we wait, and keep

<h2 id="css-wants-to-be-a-system">CSS wants to be a system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’ve realized something obvious again, this time about CSS; that CSS
wants to be a system. At the core of CSS is a series of cascading rules
and classes marrying and mingling in an elegant symphony of style
application. Dozens and dozens of declarative instructions for painting
pixels on the screen come together in under a millisecond. Sometimes it
creates magic, other times it creates memes.
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/cssisawesome.png" alt="CSS is aweso-me" height="436" width="600" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
<p>
At its core, CSS wants to be a system and – besides its quirky selector
power ranking algorithm – it doesn’t come with one out of the box. CSS
wants you to build a system with it. It wants styles to build up, not
flatten down. It even has
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer">layers</a>
as a feature! You can start small with a
<a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/">minimalist
reset</a> or satisfy your inner typenerd with a
<a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2433">typographic default</a> and
build up from there. You can make your own reset. You can establish your
own naming convention. You can decide to nest or not. You can use IDs.
You can use only-classes. You can even dip a toe into the Shadow DOM if
you crave the dark arts. Hell, I encourage you to use
<code>!important</code> just to feel something.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone wants to conduct that symphony and I understand that. A
nice thing about that CSS is that it’s sharable! Plenty of pre-built
systems exist to let you offload that skill. Through the magic of
copy-and-paste, you too can have high quality design! But don’t mistake
a shortcut as the only valid option. We as humans and technologists like
to compare objects and declare winners – to be kingmakers! – but it’s a
mistake to shop at only one store and only eat meatballs despite the
ubiquitous appeal of Scandinavian design.
</p>
<p>
CSS wants to be a system and it’s not an impossible task to make your
own. Will there be mistakes and bad assumptions? Yeah. Will there be a
<code>junk.css</code> file? Probably. Will you commit CSS crimes?
Indubitably. Is CSS just thousands of key-value pairs with random
collisions implemented in an uneven distribution among a handful of
different browsers? It sure is, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.
</p>
<p>
In all my years of programming I have never loved a language more than
CSS. There’s no other programming language that sparks my brain and
lights up my imagination like CSS. Even after thirty years, there’s a
rush of adrenaline when I see a complex design and I wonder “How am I
going to make that happen?” which leads me to “And how am I going to
make that happen on a phone and older browsers?” That’s the fun part of
the job. And it’s good to know that there are other people out there who
are great at CSS, people who can build up and tear down these systems
with ease, people I can siphon knowledge from and build up my own skills
when a new challenge arises.
</p>
<p>
So cheers to the CSS folks, the tinkerers. Your obsessive animations,
pixel pushing, and system building – both delicate and strong – are fun
to see and experience.

important, are not. End arguments about whether the Dems are this color

common interest and leave out everything else. Draw the biggest circle

<p>BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not
staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for
software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook
was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users
are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end
while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral
reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from.
Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in
the 60s,. You would have missed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all
that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the
2020s. That story is far from over.</p>

we need, now, is a system to compete with Twitter. A system as capable
as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted
not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can’t be
guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly.
Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and
quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what’s
needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than
Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.</p>

Godot on iPhone, I forgot to disable it from the TestFlight and it sort
of runs.

<p>
My opinion was that we should block it, but people love it. And in the
last 12 hours I can’t stop thinking of some easy wins to make it at
least passable.

<p>
But perhaps the right thing is still to prevent from running on iPhone
or be destroyed by unhappy users reviews
