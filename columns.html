id="if-only-desqviewx-had-been-launched-when-quarterdeck-starting-talking-about-it">If
only DESQview/X had been launched when Quarterdeck starting talking
about it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Liam on Linux</p>
A response to an
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44353673">HN
comment</a>…<br /><br />The PC press had rumours of Quarterdeck’s
successor to DESQview, Desqview/X, from around 1987-1988.
<p>
That is roughly when I entered the computer industry.<br /><br />Dv/X
was remarkable tech, and if it had shipped earlier could have changed
the course of the industry. Sadly, it came too late. Dv/X was rumoured
then, but the state of the art was OS/2 1.1, released late 1988 and the
first version of OS/2 with a GUI.
</p>
<p>
Dv/X was not released until
<a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/desqview/desqview-x-1x">about 5Y
later</a>… 1992. That’s the same year as Windows 3.1, but critically,
Windows 3.0 was in 1990, 2 years <i>earlier</i>.
</p>
<p>
Windows 3.0 was a result of the flop of OS/2 1.x.
</p>
<p>
OS/2 1.x was a new 16-bit multitasking networking kernel – but that
meant new drivers.
</p>
<p>
MS discarded the radical new OS, it discarded networking completely
(until later), and moved the multitasking into the GUI layer, allowing
Win3 to run on top of the single-tasking MS-DOS kernel. That meant
excellent compatibility: it ran on almost anything, can it could run
almost all DOS apps, <i>and multitask them</i>. And thanks to a
brilliant skunkworks project, mostly by one man, David Weise, assisted
by Murray Sargent, it combined 3 separate products (Windows 2,
Windows/286 and Windows/386) into a single product that ran on all 3
types of PC and took good advantage of all of them. I wrote about its
development here:
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3…</a>
</p>
<p>
It also did bring in some of the GUI design from OS/2 1.1, mainly from
1.2, and 1.3 – the Program Manager and File Manager UI, the proportional
fonts, the fake-3D controls, some of the Control Panel, and so on. It
kept the best user-facing parts and threw away the fancy invisible stuff
underneath which was problematic.
</p>
<p>
Result: smash hit, redefined the PC market, and when Dv/X arrived it was
doomed: too late, same as OS/2 2.0, which came out the same year as
Dv/X.
</p>
<p>
If Dv/X had come out in the late 1980s, before Windows 3, it could have
changed the way the PC industry went.
</p>
<p>
Dv/X combined the good bits of DOS, 386 memory management and
multitasking, Unix networking and Unix GUIs into an interesting value
proposition: network your DOS PCs with Unix boxes over Unix standards,
get remote access to powerful Unix apps, and if vendors wanted, it
enabled ports of Unix apps to this new multitasking networked DOS.
</p>
<p>
In the ’80s that could have been a contender. Soon afterwards it was
followed by Linux and the BSDs, which made that Unix stuff free and ran
on the same kit. That would have been a great combination – Dv/X PCs
talking to BSD or Linux servers, when those Unix boxes didn’t really
have useful GUIs yet.
</p>
<p>
Windows 3 offered a different deal: it combined the good bits of DOS,
OS/2 1.x’s GUI, and Windows 2.x into a whole that ran on anything and
could run old DOS apps and new GUI apps, side by side.
</p>
<p>Networking didn’t follow until Windows for Workgroups which followed
Windows 3.1. Only businesses wanted that, so MS postponed it. Good
move.<br /> <br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95984" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

It was a recently unimaginable

<blockquote>
<p>
The vast majority of the attack was delivered in the form of User
Datagram Protocol packets. Legitimate UDP-based transmissions are used
in especially time-sensitive communications, such as those for video
playback, gaming applications, and DNS lookups. It speeds up
communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is
transferred. Unlike the more common Transmission Control Protocol, UDP
doesn’t wait for a connection between two computers to be established
through a handshake and doesn’t check whether data is properly received
by the other party. Instead, it immediately sends data from one machine
to another…

Trump may not want regime change in Iran, but he definitely wants regime
change in California.
</p>
<p>
He’s going to war with Iran to hide his war with the United States.
</p>
<p>
We need a war-ready Democratic Party.

Governor or mayor is not a job for peaceniks.

<h2 id="wordcamp-canada-in-october">WordCamp Canada in October</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m keynoting the <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/">WordCamp
Canada</a> conference in October in Ottawa. It’s the first conference
I’ve attended since before the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
The timing is ideal, and the location is significant. As an American, I
don’t want to try to attract people from around the world to a meeting
in my country. Right now, I wouldn’t come here if I didn’t live here.
</p>
<p>
I’m also not happy with the tech industry of the US. I’d like a fresh
start, a return to our roots, with the assumption that the people
control their destiny and the role of developers is to give them to the
tools to try out new ideas.
</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> I’ve created a
product <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">for writers</a>, filling a
need that’s been there since the beginning of the web, using the
practices in writing tools we learned in the 80s. It doesn’t have the
artificial <a href="https://textcasting.org/">limits</a> imposed by
Twitter et al. I think they’re senseless. So we’re going to blow that
door wide open. No character limits. Simple styling. Links. Editable.
</p>
<p>
And it’s also a product for developers. There’s no lock-in anywhere in
this stack. So you can make a different style of editor. Or play with
new ways to view timelines.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to take discourse in a different direction too. A good design
for the social web shouldn’t require intense moderation. The reward for
spammers is practically nil. Also, it’ll be good for small groups in a
way that Twitter et al never have been.
</p>
<p>
So far I haven’t invented any new formats. We’re building on what works
now. WordPress is a remarkably deep product, so deep it could be used as
operating system. and that’s exactly how I’ve chosen to view it and it
works incredibly well. Some of what we’re building on is based on work I
did with Joseph Scott of Automattic in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22joseph%20scott%22">2009</a>,
believe it or not.
</p>
<p>
And as a bonus we get a great bridge into ActivityPub, from the great
work Automattic is doing in bridging WordPress to ActivityPub. Think
about it and you’ll see how connections in and out of WordPress can
facilitate a lot of interop, not just via RSS, but any format that comes
along that people want to use.
</p>
<p>
We’ll have a lot to talk about in October!
</p>

<h2 id="rss-on-a-timeline">RSS on a timeline</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
More on the vision for WordLand and RSS.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is the
editor of a
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22twitter-like%22">twitter-like</a>
system built around
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. It saves your
writing to WordPress, where it is published on a website and via RSS.
You don’t have to use WordLand or WordPress, because RSS is an open
format. <i>Any editor that generates RSS is part of the network.
</i>Designed to be simple.
</p>
<p>
All that’s missing is a timeline viewer, and that’s what I’m working on
now. It’s coming together pretty nicely, imho. Not an easy project,
though on the surface it looks like it should be. Also there’s nothing
proprietary about my timeline viewer. There could be a thousand of them.
Anyone who has written an RSS feed reader will have all the low-level
bits they need.
</p>
<p>
Hoping to have all the connections working by the end of the summer.
</p>
<p>
Once done, it will be the completion of the vision for RSS as the
foundation of the open social web, the place that all the open formats
agree on, so we can get on with interop and say goodbye to lock-in. It
can be done, I’m almost 100 percent sure of that now. Still have a
little ways to go. As they say – <i>still diggin!</i>
