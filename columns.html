<h2 id="nncp-setup-automation">2024-08-09 NNCP setup automation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-09-nncp-setup-automation">
2024-08-09 NNCP setup automation
</h1>
<p>
This is a continuation of <a href="2024-07-16-minimal-nncp-setup">the
minimal NNCP setup to get started</a>. Once we verified that everything
works as expected with manual invocations, the next step is automation.
There are two options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enable all the services. This makes sense if you expect a lot of
traffic.
</li>
<li>
Only call the executables every now and then. This makes sense if you
expect very little traffic.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to enable all the services, the <code>examples</code>
directory has service definitions for you. Running
<code>nncp-caller</code> only makes sense if there is at least one entry
in your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> that has a <code>cron</code> key.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-daemon.service
sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-toss.service
sudo systemctl start nncp-daemon.service 
sudo systemctl start nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl start nncp-toss.service 
sudo systemctl status nncp-daemon.service 
sudo systemctl status nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl status nncp-toss.service 
</code></pre>
<p>
I don’t expect a lot of NNCP traffic. This is why my setup on the laptop
and server uses the alternative.
</p>
<p>
In order to conserve resources, you could decide not to have these
services running all the time. I’m doing this for two reasons: I don’t
want to upgrade the virtual machine I’m renting. It’s a point of pride
to do much with very little. From the perspective of impeding collapse,
I also think that we should all get on board with
<a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.codeberg.page/articles/frugal-computing-developer/">frugal
computing</a>
(<a class="account" href="https://scholar.social/@wim_v12e" title="@wim_v12e@scholar.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="wim_v12e">@wim_v12e</span></a>).
</p>
<p>
Ready for some frugal computing? Here we go.
</p>
<p>
Run the daemon on the server. That is, if other sites know your internet
address and call you, then you need this. My laptop does not but my
server does. When somebody calls the server on port 5400, start the
<code>nncp-daemon</code> using <code>inetd</code> (from the
<code>openbsd-inet</code> or the <code>inetutils-inetd</code> packages
on Debian).
</p>
<p>
In your <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> file:
</p>
<pre><code>5400 stream  tcp nowait  nncp    /usr/bin/nncp-daemon    nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>
<p>
Run <code>nncp-call</code> every hour or every day from cron for the
systems you want to call. Those systems don’t need a <code>cron</code>
key in the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file.
</p>
<p>
This is my laptop calling my server every hour, via
<code>/etc/cron.hourly/nncp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-call ]; then
        su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-call sibirocobombus -noprogress&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
This is on the laptop, for my neighbours <code>erebor</code> and
<code>quux</code> in <code>/etc/cron.daily/nncp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-call ]; then
    for neighbour in erebor quux; do
        su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-call erebor -noprogress&quot;
    done
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
This is for the server, tossing stuff once per hour, via
<code>/etc/cron.hourly/nncp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-toss ]; then
    su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-toss&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
Adding <code>autotoss: true</code> only helps for the system calling
others. On the server, tossing needs to happen on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can do some clean-up by copying
<code>/usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/cron-daily-nncp</code> to
<code>/etc/cron.daily/nncp-cleanup</code>.
</p>
<p>
I’m using the following, both on the laptop and the server:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-rm ]; then
    for TYPE in part seen hdr area; do
            su nncp -s /bin/bash -c &quot;nncp-rm -quiet -all -older 7d -$TYPE&quot;
    done
    su nncp -s /bin/bash -c &quot;nncp-rm -quiet -tmp -older 7d&quot;
fi
</code></pre>

Site Removal Services Largely Ineffective</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, updated: 2024-08-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Consumer Reports has a
<a href="https://innovation.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Data-Defense_-Evaluating-People-Search-Site-Removal-Services-.pdf">new
study</a> of people-search site removal services, concluding that they
don’t really work:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As a whole, people-search removal services are largely ineffective.
Private information about each participant on the people-search sites
decreased after using the people-search removal services. And, not
surprisingly, the removal services did save time compared with manually
opting out. But, without exception, information about each participant
still appeared on some of the 13 people-search sites at the one-week,
one-month, and four-month intervals. We initially found 332 instances of
information about the 28 participants who would later be signed up for
removal services (that does not include the four participants who were
opted out manually). Of those 332 instances, only 117, or 35%, were
removed within…

<h2 id="more-curl-help">more curl help</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog</p>
<p>With the ever-growing number of command line options for curl, the
problem of how to provide documentation and help users understand how
options work and should be used is a challenge that is worth revisiting
regularly. To keep iterating on. I personally often use the curl manpage
to lookup descriptions for options. Often not only …

<h2 id="man-pages">2024-08-08 Man pages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-08-man-pages">
2024-08-08 Man pages
</h1>
<p>
Here’s a great thing on the command line. You want to use the command
<strong>foo</strong> and don’t know how, so you run <strong>man
foo</strong> and read the manual page. Sometimes there will be more info
in different “sections”. Commands are in section 1, which is why
documentation would sometimes refer to the command “foo” as
<strong>foo(1)</strong> because <strong>foo(5)</strong> might document
the file format or the config file that goes along with the command.
</p>
<p>
If that’s news to you, run <strong>man man</strong>. And if you find the
structure bewildering, read the manual on how to write manual pages:
<strong>man man-pages</strong> (section 7).
</p>
<p>
I’ve embraced man pages because when I write Perl code, I can put
documentation into the script such that when the script is installed, it
automatically works as its own man page – this works for
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-jupiter">jupiter</a>,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-BookmarkFeed">bookmark-feed</a> –
it also works for bigger projects, like
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-Phoebe">phoebe</a> where each
extension is also a Perl module and therefore also gets its own man
page.
</p>
<p>
For programming languages where the documentation is more focused on
documenting the code, things are different. Of course, there’s
<code>pydoc</code> for Python code and <code>go doc</code> for Go code,
but it’s not great. The list of variables and functions are maybe
suitable for libraries, but not for applications.
</p>
<p>
Since I don’t enjoy writing man pages directly (<code>man</code> is
actually a macro package for the <code>nroff</code> language, see
<strong>man nroff</strong>, obviously) I write my documentation in the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ddevault/scdoc">scdoc</a> format.
<a class="account" href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault" title="@drewdevault@fosstodon.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="drewdevault">@drewdevault</span></a> wrote
it <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/05/13/scdoc.html">in 2018</a>.
It looks a bit like Markdown and friends and I like it. I even put a
little sequence of <code>sed</code> expressions into a Makefile to turn
scdoc into Markdown so that I could publish the man pages on this site,
see <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ man pages</a>.
</p>
<p>
When documentation for a project is a website, I wonder how they serve
people offline or with bad connections. Perhaps they want to write the
documentation in texinfo? I haven’t done that in a long time but I
really enjoy reading a well-written manual like that. And you can get a
PDF for free but I’m not sure anybody really wants that. Even a README
is bad because in those rare cases where the program gets added to a
distro, how will end-users find the README? Man pages are the answer.
</p>
<p>
README files and offline copies of the HTML documentation have multiple
problems.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Which directory is it, exactly? <code>/usr/doc</code> does not exist on
my system. <code>/usr/share</code> lists lots of package names but these
are not the docs. <code>/usr/share/doc</code> is the one! But the
problems continue. Which is the file that you want to read when you’re
faced with <code>BUGS changelog.Debian.gz changelog.gz copyright README
README.Debian README.frames RELEASE-NOTES.txt WhatsNew.gz</code> – it’s
README, I guess, but I am always confused. Sometimes you’re looking at
binary and it’s also not obvious what the package name would be.
<code>find</code> is in <code>/usr/share/doc/findutils</code>, for
example.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Compared to this, man pages are so much better.
</p>
<p>
And some package managers like <code>go</code>, <code>pip</code>
(Python), <code>cabal</code> (Haskell) and <code>cargo</code> (Rust)
don’t install any of these files, I think.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that many developers consider using a website like
<a href="https://about.readthedocs.com/">Read the Docs</a> to be good
enough. Bad luck for people who are offline or who have bad reception,
in hotel rooms with bad wifi, in planes? My sister lives in the Rhine
valley, on the German side, close to Switzerland, in a tiny village of a
bit more than 100 people. They have no glass fibre. They have bad
reception, both from Switzerland and from Germany. It’s terrible! But
even for me: I have wifi in the apartment and glass windows that act
that block the signal. I have no reception on the balcony unless I use
my phone as a hotspot.
</p>
<p>
Local documentation that is easy to find is so much better.
</p>
<p>
And man pages are powerful. <em>All</em> of Perl is documented in many
pages. All the modules. All the switches. All the language features. I
learned to program in Perl from man pages back when my browser was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a>. (I
am a bit astonished to find that I still knew that acronym! But I didn’t
know that it stands for National Center for Supercomputing
Applications.) Anyway, what I wanted to say is that man pages can be
used to document large and complex things. From the command line, they
are readily accessible. With the right man reader, they can act as a
hypertext, linking to other pages. They don’t have to be terse and
cryptic, either. Man pages can be tutorials, introductions, FAQs, and
more. And if you write man pages using a suitable format, you can still
generate HTML pages with links.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not writing man pages, if your community doesn’t have the
habit of writing man pages, start small. Get <code>scdoc</code> and
write a little something. Skim <strong>man man-pages</strong> and learn
about the conventions, then write some text files. Then use <code>scdoc
&lt; text-file &gt; man-page</code> to create the file and install them
into <code>~/.local/share/man</code>, following the conventions. A page
from section 1 (commands) has the extension “.1” and goes into
<code>~/.local/share/man/man1</code> whereas a page from section 5 (file
formats and config files) has the extension “.5” and goes into
<code>~/.local/share/man/man5</code>.

<strong>2024-08-09</strong>. At one point I was interested in
<a href="2018-03-05_Troff">using troff as an alternative to LaTeX</a>,
so not to write documentation but to create PDFs, and I kept eyeing the
<a href="http://www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-01.html">mom macros</a>. But
before I could give them a try I discovered how to
<a href="2020-07-24_Writing_Markdown,_generating_PDF">create PDFs using
Markdown to HTML to PDF</a> via weasyprint and that has been my workflow
ever since. For a zine I’m contributing to, however, I’m using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/">groff</a> and the
<a href="https://www.troff.org/using-ms.pdf">ms macros</a> because
that’s what’s in the Makefile…
</p>
<p>
The reason I write this all up is that flexibeast wrote in, saying that
man pages can be written using the semantics-oriented
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc macros</a> instead of the
presentation-oriented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.7">man
macros</a> – and they had written an
<a href="https://github.com/flexibeast/guides/blob/master/mdoc-quickstart.md">mdoc
quickstart guide</a>. Nice!
</p>
<p>
I really have to take a look at
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc</a> as a groff
alternative.

<p>
The
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/">$5
Raspberry Pi Pico 2</a> was announced today, with a new chip, the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/">RP2350</a>. This
silicon improves on almost every aspect of the RP2040:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
3 PIOs instead of 2
</li>
<li>
150 MHz instead of 133 MHz base clock
</li>
<li>
Faster Arm Cortex M33 cores <em>and</em> RISC-V Hazard3 cores
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’ve had access to pre-release hardware and good news: even though the
new chip is faster and has more features, it actually uses <em>less</em>
power than RP2040, meaning if you run one of these things off a battery,
it’ll last longer.
</p>
<p>
I’ll talk more about power later, but first, here’s the specs.

You have only to scan Molly White’s
<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/"><i>Web3 is Going Just
Great</i></a> to realize that
<a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/90955">you will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy</a> than the cryptosphere. Everywhere
you look you find lies, grift, fraud, and theft. Below the fold I
discuss the latest example, in which a coal company marketing itself as
“zero-carbon Bitcoin mining” is just the start.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The legal way to make money from
the wretched hives of scum and villainy in the markets is selling short.
Recently, a startup called <a href="https://hntrbrk.com">Hunterbrook</a>
has developed an innovative business model for doing so. Matt Levine
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-02/a-hedge-fund-that-s-also-a-newspaper">explains</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Hunterbrook hit upon a differentiated media business model:<br />
<ol>
<li>
They would start a newsroom (Hunterbrook Media) to publish general news
and investigative journalism.
</li>
<li>
There’s no paywall and no advertising.
</li>
<li>
But before each investigative piece is published, the newsroom would
send it to Hunterbrook’s affiliated hedge fund (Hunterbrook Capital),
which could trade on the news.
</li>
<li>
The hedge fund’s trading profits can — they hope! — pay the journalists’
salaries.
</li>
</ol>
One way to think of this business model is that Hunterbrook is
essentially an activist short-selling hedge fund, like Hindenburg
Research: It investigates companies, finds problems, shorts the
companies, and then noisily publishes its investigation to draw
attention to the problems. But whereas Hindenburg is straightforwardly a
short-selling firm, Hunterbrook’s news site is at least theoretically
independent of its hedge fund, and if it publishes enough good general
news then perhaps it can become more widely read and trusted — and have
more stock-price impact — than a pure hedge fund.

Hunterbrook reveals that Terawulf’s claim to run on renewable power
<a href="https://hntrbrk.com/terawulf/">is false</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
TeraWulf Inc. (NASDAQ: $WULF) brands itself as a “zero-carbon Bitcoin
miner” — and claims its commitment to renewable energy will help it land
AI data center contracts. But the New York Power Authority, which
supplies 45% of the facility’s energy, told Hunterbrook Media: “None of
the power that NYPA provides the firm can be claimed as renewable
power.”
</li>
<li>
The rest of TeraWulf’s power is sourced from the New York grid, which is
less than half zero-carbon, according to the New York Independent System
Operator, the organization responsible for managing the state’s
wholesale electric marketplace.
</li>
<li>
The only way TeraWulf can legally substantiate its zero-carbon claims is
by purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs), according to New York and
federal regulators, but a TeraWulf spokesperson confirmed that the
company has not done so. “Without the REC, there is no legal claim to
the renewable attributes of electricity,” a spokesperson for the New
York State Energy Research and Development Authority confirmed in an
email to Hunterbrook.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
But lying about renewables is just the tip of the iceberg. Hunterbrook
reports that they <a href="https://hntrbrk.com/terawulf/">lied to get
permits</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The team behind TeraWulf promised New York State that it was “not
targeting bitcoin or any other cyber currency” in a 2019 application for
its facilities seen by Hunterbrook, despite seizing on the idea of
bitcoin mining as a strategy as early as 2018.
</blockquote>
Hunterbrook is skeptical about Terawulf’s commitment to zero-carbon
mining <a href="https://hntrbrk.com/terawulf/">because</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The company’s management team, including CEO Paul Prager, trace their
roots to Beowulf Energy LLC, an operator of fossil fuel plants that
previously revived a struggling coal plant to mine bitcoin. The same
TeraWulf executives who claim TeraWulf’s mining is zero-carbon likely
continue to manage this coal plant.
</blockquote>
Prager apparently has a <a href="https://hntrbrk.com/terawulf/">lavish
lifestyle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prager has been known to split his time between a “five-bedroom Fifth
Avenue co-op” in Manhattan and a sprawling 250-acre estate on Maryland’s
Eastern Shore, according to a 2021 profile in Washingtonian. This
estate, called Maiden Point Farm, is described as “more like a small
village with 20 structures,” including a “main house, English-style
gardens, a pool, a tennis pavilion, a squash court,” and even a private
gas station for his car collection, which includes multiple Ferraris.
</blockquote>
How is this <a href="https://hntrbrk.com/terawulf/">funded?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Hunterbrook’s analysis of the company’s SEC filings shows TeraWulf’s
operations are deeply entwined with a constellation of entities under
Prager’s control, making it difficult to discern where TeraWulf ends and
Prager’s other interests begin. <br /> <br /> Beowulf Electricity &amp;
Data, a company owned and controlled by Prager, provides TeraWulf with
“infrastructure, construction, operations and maintenance and
administrative services necessary to build out and operate certain
Bitcoin mining centers” — functions that TeraWulf claims are “readily
available from independent entities.” <br /> <br /> In 2023, TeraWulf
paid $20.3 million to Beowulf for these services, representing 38% of
TeraWulf’s combined operating and administrative expenses. It also
accounted for more than half of the company’s $29.4 million operating
loss for the year. The trend continued into 2024, with TeraWulf
recognizing $3.5 million in related party expenses in the first quarter
alone, amounting to 21% of its operating and administrative expenses for
the quarter.

Prager apears to have another way to
<a href="https://hntrbrk.com/terawulf/">fund his lifestyle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In recent years, Prager has received a significant quantity of TeraWulf
shares — through both the related party transactions and financial
activities. And in an open letter published early in 2023, he shared
that he hadn’t “sold a share” as “evidence of my conviction.” But since
mid-2023, Prager has significantly reduced his claimed ownership of the
company through a series of stock disposals.<br /> <br /> His reported
ownership has dwindled, with his holdings falling to around 10 million
shares compared to more than 30 million shares in 2023.
</blockquote>
Executives of Bitcoin miners have a history of looting their companies.
Two years ago Paul Butler wrote in
<a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/"><i>The
problem with bitcoin miners</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s one group of people for whom bitcoin mining is an extremely
lucrative business: executives. Last year, one MARA executive
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001507605/000149315222011630/formdef14a.htm">earned
over $220 million</a> in cash and stock-based compensation, in a year
when the company’s total revenue was $150 million. RIOT’s top five
executives collectively took home a more modest
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997322000531/riot_10ka-123121.htm#item11">$90
million</a> in a year with a net loss.
</blockquote>
How was this
<a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/">possible?</a>::<br />
<blockquote>
This, I think, points to the crux of the problem. Investors have been
happy to provide capital to these companies, looking for anything in the
public markets that provides some exposure to bitcoin, without paying
much attention to what the companies are doing.<br /> <br /> I don’t
think it ends well.
</blockquote>
It certianly looks like everyone except Hunterbrook wasn’t “paying much
attention to what the companies are doing”.<br /> <br /> Like many
miners in the wake of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/one-heck-of-halvening.html"><i>One
Heck Of A Halvening</i></a>, Terawulf is trying to
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai">pivot to AI</a>. Hunterbrook notes
<a href="https://hntrbrk.com/terawulf/">that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
TeraWulf has not resisted the hype, with the management team
<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/cantor-fitzgerald-lifts-terawulf-stock-price-target-highlights-robust-demand-93CH-3497574">suggesting</a>
it could land a similar deal. CFO Fleury specified in an
<a href="https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/wulf/earnings-calls/q1-2024">earnings
call</a> earlier this year that, by leasing out all of the 300 available
megawatts at Lake Mariner, the company could bring in $300 million to
$450 million in hosting revenues a year. TeraWulf’s revenue last year
was $69 million.
</blockquote>
But this won’t happen <a href="https://hntrbrk.com/terawulf/">any time
soon</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
TeraWulf doesn’t yet have AI-ready facilities, unlike competitors who
made the switch to HPC data center hosting years ago. But TeraWulf
announced it is on track to build a 2 MW experimental AI data center by
the third quarter of this year and plans to build another 20 MW data
center with a target completion date of the end of 2024.

~$359.26/month. Not much to say beyond that –no grand epiphanies– except
that I think it’s too expensive. Sitting in an office by myself costs me
$16.33/day (or $2/hour). This budget doesn’t include breakfast, dinner,
exercise, healthcare, transit, internet, electricity, or office
supplies… all necessities that enable the work. This is just the daily
cost of caloric fuel to keep my body going during the nine-to-five. My
family has three other humans in it too, so this seems collossaly
expensive.
</p>
<p>
If I wanted to save money (I sort of do), here’s what I’d could try to
optimize from top to bottom:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I could make my own pre-made meals for about ~$2/meal. I’ve had success
with this but it requires a lot of weekend logistics to execute
properly. This would be the most significant cost reduction, costing
only $44/month and saving $176/month.
</li>
<li>
I could buy whey protein in bulk. A 5 lb bag of Muscle Milk (nearest
approximate flavor) is $72/bag and contains 68 servings for a reduced
costs of $1.05/serving. However, one serving only has 25g of protein, so
if I’d need to double the scoops. The total cost would then be
$2.11/serving or $46.42/month. Buying bulk powder makes fiscal sense,
but $30/month to not have to deal with drinking clumpy protein shakes
and washing crusted stinky shakers seems almost worth it.
</li>
<li>
I considered eggs as an alternate source of protein instead. A single
egg has ~6g of protein and costs about 50¢. The cost could potentially
come down but the bigger issue is to get the same 42g of protein I’d
need to eat 7 eggs. I don’t know if you’ve eaten eggs before but <u>7
eggs is a lot of eggs</u>. Imagine woofing down 7 sweaty hard-boiled
orbs a couple times a day, yikes.
</li>
<li>
I could brew my own agave-sweetened tea. I’ve done this once, but the
crisp flavor profile wasn’t the same so I wouldn’t call it a success.
Needs more experimentation.
</li>
<li>
Thanks to Costco selling our favorite local coffee roaster in bulk, we
have caffeine ritual costs dialed down about as low as they can go. Feel
comfortable there.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lowering my lunch costs stands out as the best candidate for
improvement. But
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/10/snap-kitchen/">as I noted
before</a>, adding even a small pile of extra duties risks toppling the
wagon and I’m back to eating emergency $14 Spicy Chicken Sando Combos to
quench my hunger. I wonder where my daily costs fit on a graph of
national statistics. Is this average? Is this Bidenomic inflation? Am I
making myself poor with my avocado toast? Someone who understands
finances help me budget! Ack!

<p>The Democratic presidential ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris
and Minnesota governor Tim Walz continues to gain momentum, with people
flocking to their events and pouring money into the Democrats’ campaign:
in the first 24 hours after Walz joined the ticket, the party raised $36
million from more than 450,000 donors, more than a third of them giving
for the first time.</p>

<p>
I have great respect for Hillary Clinton and supported her over Sanders
in 2016. I also supported Biden because we needed to win in 2020.
</p>
<p>
But we could have had a campaign team like the one we saw yesterday and
today, with some very impressive presenters who’ve yet to take the
stage, we could have had it in 2016. We didn’t have to go through the
tragedy of Trump.
</p>
<p>
The Democrats are stage managing perfectly now. I never really thought
we’d see this day, but here it is.

<h1 id="2024-08-06-pocket-reform">
2024-08-06 Pocket Reform
</h1>
<p>
I got my <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform">MNT
Pocket Reform</a> miniature laptop! I’m hoping that this will be my new
travel laptop as the Purism laptop I got
<a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">back in 2017</a> has a
<a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">broken hinge</a>. The
two halves are attached to each other using two super strong hinges. The
hinges are so strong, in fact, that one of them ripped its screws out of
the plastic. So now the screen is held up by just one super strong hinge
and don’t really want to open or close it all that often for fear of
breaking it.
</p>
<p>
Here are my initial impressions of the new MNT Pocket Reform.
</p>
<p>
It is small, but chunky. It’s definitely not flat. It also isn’t heavy,
so I’m happy. The small keyboard and the small trackball work.
</p>
<p>
I was unable to power it on for the longest time. I had two problems.
</p>
<p>
First, there’s a small standby power switch on the left hand side that
you need to turn on. The manual suggests “using a pointed object such as
a SIM card ejector.” Which I managed to find. And then what do you do?
You use the SIM card ejector like you always do: stab it into the small
hole. So I did that for a bit, wondering at the empty spaces I was a
able to reach. What was I supposed to press? It was only when I started
to really look into the small hole that I realized: there was actually
something to be moved left and right within it!
</p>
<p>
Second, the manual says that to turn it on, “hold <em>Hyper</em> +
<em>Enter</em> for more than 2 seconds.” I pressed those two keys and
the OLED display lit up. There was the menu! There it said “Power On”. I
picked it. Nothing happened. Then the OLED display showed a tiny “T” in
the upper left corner. I did this again and again, exploring the small
menu. The laptop wouldn’t power on no matter how often I selected the
menu. That’s because I didn’t press <em>Hyper</em> + <em>Enter</em> for
<em>more than 2 seconds</em>! Press those keys until the keyboard lights
up with the pink backlights.
</p>
<p>
I setup my root passwords, created my user account, ran <code>sudo apt
update</code> and <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> and looked around at
things. After a few minutes I noticed that there is no indication of the
batteries charging. That made me nervous for a while as I kept seeing
that “1%” charge in the top right corner. It’s probably charging, I
thought. Then the laptop turned off. Oh! I guess it wasn’t charging
after all. What did I miss? Now that it is powered off, I see that the
load percentage starts climbing again.
</p>
<p>
This is what it says right now:
</p>
<pre><code>🔋 3.6                8%
🔋 3.7               Off
                  -1.07A
                  7.57V
</code></pre>
<p>
Why is the second battery off? The manual doesn’t explain what On/Off on
the second line means. It’s an indication of whether the computer is on
or off! For the longest time I thought that the first battery had some
charge and the second battery was “off”. Once I rebooted, it changed to
“On”.
</p>
<p>
In any case, it seems that my problem is that when the laptop powers on
without being connected to a charger, it won’t charge if you do connect
it. Perhaps a new system image would fix it? I’m not sure. I downloaded
an image, unzipped it, wrote it to a microSD card, and maybe booted from
it, but nothing seemed to have changed. I had to provide a root password
and a first username and another password… and that’s it. Was I supposed
to run a command? I don’t know. Did the <code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt
upgrade</code> fix the problem? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when the laptop suddenly lost power (see above) I waited for it
to recharge for a bit and rebooted. It looked like this had corrupted
the disk, somehow. There are plenty of recovery messages and percentages
ending with an error because something cannot be written to the
read-only file system.
</p>
<p>
The output ends with the following, in an extremely tiny font:
</p>
<pre><code>...
mount: mounting /dev/mmcblk2p2 on /root failed: Structure needs cleaning
Failed to mount /dev/mmcblk2p2 as root file system
</code></pre>
<p>
And now I am dropped in the <code>initramfs</code>. I try figure what
I’m supposed to do. I search for some keywords online but don’t
understand what I’m seeing. Finally, I try to leave with
<code>exit</code>, Ctrl+D and whatever else I can think off. I reboot.
This time there are fewer messages about the filesystem and then I’m
back at the login prompt. It fixed itself.
</p>
<p>
Phew!
</p>
<p>
I’m back.
</p>
<p>
My take-away is this: usability and user interface issues both large and
small remain a challenge in computers.

</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-07</strong>. Before the login prompt is shown, there is
a long and helpful introduction that flashes by. At the login prompt,
you can specify a different command to run instead of starting the
window manager. I did that, specifying <code>/usr/bin/fish</code> (I
have installed <code>fish</code> and prefer it over the default shell,
<code>bash</code>). This allows you to read the message. I guess it’s
the <code>/etc/reform-help</code> message.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, I learned about all the commands starting with
<code>reform-</code>. Nice! In the manual these tools are mentioned on
page 50.
</p>
<p>
When I run <code>sudo reform-check</code>, it tells me that “eMMC does
not contain the latest uboot” and that I can run
<code>reform-flash-uboot emmc</code> to fix it. Do I dare? The following
two messages are shown and they are not identical. That’s a bit strange.
</p>
<pre><code>W: /boot/flash.bin is not the latest uboot
W: You can update it to the latest version by running as root:
reform-flash-uboot
W: eMMC does not contain latest uboot
W: You can update it to the latest version by running as root:
reform-flash-uboot emmc
</code></pre>
<p>
I guess I’ll run the first command and then <code>reform-check</code>
again.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime I saw that I don’t have the
<code>pocket-reform-handbook</code> installed but that I do have the
<code>reform-handbook</code>. Heh. (The MNT Reform is the bigger
laptop.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when I run <code>reform-flash-uboot</code> without arguments, I
get an error.
</p>
<pre><code>/usr/sbin/reform-flash-uboot: 59: MMC_BOOT: parameter not set
</code></pre>
<p>
I cannot decide whether this is a typo or not. It looks like one?
</p>
<pre><code>alex@subterraneobombus ~&gt; sudo nl /usr/sbin/reform-flash-uboot|grep MMC_BOOT
    27  if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = false ]; then
    49      if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = true ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SD_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    53      elif [ &quot;$MMC_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    60      if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = true ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SD_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    71      elif [ &quot;$MMC_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
alex@subterraneobombus ~&gt; grep MMC_BOOT &quot;/usr/share/reform-tools/machines/MNT Pocket Reform with
 i.MX8MP Module.conf&quot;
EMMC_BOOT=true
</code></pre>
<p>
Do I really want to do this? Luckily, I mentioned this issue on IRC, and
<a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@josch" title="@josch@floss.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="josch">@josch</span></a> pointed me to this
post by
<a class="account" href="https://macaw.social/@andypiper" title="@andypiper@macaw.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="andypiper">@andypiper</span></a>:
<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/updating-uboot/2348">Updating
uboot?</a>. This is the important bit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Do <em>not</em> flash u-boot to emmc on the pocket reform. There is a
bug in the u-boot offset which will make your pocket unbootable if you
fix the other bug in reform-flash-uboot. – josch on IRC
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oof! Disaster narrowly avoided. And now I understand what Andy Piper
means when he writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I also managed to temporarily brick the machine by corrupting the uboot
in flash, and needed to rig it up with Dupont wires on headers and
access the machine from another via USB to get back to where I wanted to
be. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Andy’s post had a screenshot showing the fediverse client
<a href="https://tuba.geopjr.dev/">Tuba</a> which is available on Debian
testing. Nice! I’ll give it a try.
</p>
<p>
Tuba requires a “login” keyring so I had to install
<code>seahorse</code> also known as “Passwords and Keys”.
</p>
<p>
Back to small things to watch out for. When I run <code>apt
update</code> it ends with a notice saying: “Missing Signed-By in the
sources.list(5) entry for
<code>https://mnt.re/reform-debian-repo</code>”

Ignore the NY Times. It’s relaxing. You don’t have to do something about
it, in fact it says the opposite. Do nothing. It works on all social

<h2 id="roadmap-for-the-campaign">Roadmap for the campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A roadmap for the campaign is coming into view.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Harris has her knee on Trump’s neck, and she won’t let up.
</li>
<li>
There won’t be time for anyone to get tired of her.
</li>
<li>
Their rallies are going to be the best in a very long time. They’re
executing perfectly.
</li>
<li>
Trump is a comedian, a cross between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles">Don Rickles</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers">Joan Rivers</a> with
a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kinison">Sam
Kinison</a>. He had a good schtick for a long run if you find fascist
slapstick entertaining, as millions of Americans do or did.
</li>
<li>
Last night Maddow tried to get us excited about how the Repubs have
planted people on voting boards in swing states with the purpose of
stopping the counts, and thus preventing a vote in the Electoral
College. But they’re doing it too late. The administrators will feel the
tide turning too.
</li>
<li>
This campaign will take place in the popular culture of 2024, which
thankfully is not centered on cable news or the NYT. But Mark Zuckerberg
and Elon Musk are in control. In my
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">2017
piece</a> I thought Zuck would run for president, given his new style
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/06/zucksNewStyle.png">makeover</a>
I wouldn’t discount that, but these two will certainly have influence
over how the election goes. Both Facebook and Twitter have algorithms
that are opaque and controlled by them. Same deal as with the owners of
cable media.
</li>
<li>
Trump stoked resentment with voters for being left behind, even if
individually they were doing fine. But that was eight years ago and a
lot has happened. Harris saying basically “there you go again” is an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN7gDRjTNf4&t=46s">echo of
Reagan</a>, btw. It worked for Reagan, you just have to get the
<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/derision">derision</a> right.
And Harris can do that, she laughs and we laugh. Trump loses his mind.
</li>
<li>
The Harris candidacy happened almost as if it was staged. The campaign
hit the ground running, it feels like there was a lot of advance work.
Or they picked bloggers who were up and running, gave them the keys and
said go. Either approach is fine, breaking through where previous Demo
campaigns didn’t have the nerve. Whatever it is, there’s a sign of
competence and urgency in the Democrats that is grounded in the
challenge not in some almost religious sense that she’s The One, which
was understandable with Obama, but won’t do now. We have no illusions
about what’s ahead. I think for that Biden must have been a great
teacher.
</li>
<li>
Now we’re grounded. We’ve seen the outline of our future. Our eyes were
fully opened on Jan 6. A few weeks ago the lead Republican thinker
behind Project 2025
<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4757210-heritage-blowback-bloodless-revolution/">said</a>,
like an idiot, in an interview, it was up to liberals to avoid a
bloodbath, as they took over. You don’t hear that anymore. Those people
must now be thinking more seriously about jail for what they’re doing.
And the Supreme Court will go to jail too if they try to support what
Maddow was talking about. We must not let them overthrow the government.
And that’s why Maddow’s concern is okay but overstated, imho.
</li>
<li>
I had my doubts whether Biden would stop the
<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dissolution">dissolution</a>
of the Supreme Court, and I don’t know if Harris will, but given how
purposefully the campaign in running, I suspect (hope, pray) she will.
Our job is to give her the support she needs to feel that we’ve got her
back.
</li>
</ul>

a report into last summer’s intrusion by a Chinese hacking group into
Microsoft’s cloud environment, where it compromised the U.S. Department
of Commerce, State Department, congressional offices, and several
associated companies. But the board’s report—well-researched and
containing some good and actionable recommendations—shows how it suffers
from its lack of subpoena power and its political unwillingness to

<p>On Monday August 7, 2000 at 14:49 UTC, we announced the release of
the first libcurl version ever. Exactly twenty-four years ago today. We
called it version 7.1. The simple reason we did a point one release as
the first one was that we had shipped a whole range of 7.0 beta versions
before that …

<p>When reporting massacres, imho we should cite the number of people
who were shot. It measures of how much violence there was, and how
excessive the gun tech used. Many who were injured but not killed have
their lives ruined. Their suffering can go for decades.</p>

2024-08-05 Free speech advocacy on the fediverse

<p>
It all started with
<a class="account" href="https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer" title="@jwildeboer@social.wildeboer.net"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jwildeboer">@jwildeboer</span></a>
<a href="https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer/112893255029322563">arguing</a>
that the original poster (OP) of a message should be in control of
what’s considered to be a reply to the their post. Apparently, this
would be within the realm of how ActivityPub works, but it’s not how
Mastodon works. From my point of view, I’d love the ability to unlink
replies from my post so that people clicking through to my post don’t
end up seeing those replies. I’d be protecting my readers from spam,
trolls and detractors. Jan also argued that as a positive side-effect,
servers getting the original post that starts a thread would immediately
get the whole tree of replies. Finally, Jan also argued that replies
should not be able to reduce the audience scope of the audience because
it was used for bullying. People replying with a “followers only”
audience can effectively pile-on the original poster with their friends
and followers without anybody else being able to see this – you have to
be a follower of the bully in order to see it.
</p>
<p>
There was a longer thread by
<a class="account" href="https://eattherich.club/@deflarerOfClouds" title="@deflarerOfClouds@eattherich.club"><span
class="citation"
data-cites="deflarerOfClouds">@deflarerOfClouds</span></a> arguing that
“silencing critics is an anti-speech injustice &amp; if their replies
are detached that obviously censors their ideas.” I disagree.
</p>
<p>
In situations like these I like to explain the situation without using
the word censorship as we’ll get bogged down in a word definition game
that I find fundamentally boring. I want to make sure that speech I
disagree with does not benefit from my reach; I want no part in
distributing it. If somebody wants to argue that this is censorship and
therefore bad, I’m bored. I’d like to hear an explanation that hows how
this attachment is something I should support. Note that I’m not
interested in the question of whether people can or cannot say their
words; all I care about is them not distributing their words along with
mine.
</p>
<p>
In this sense, running a blog without comments is perfect. There’s not
even the illusion of censorship. If people want to counter, let them put
it up on their blogs. I’m not in a debate club. Instead, I feel like an
essayist or a book author. Other people should feel free to write their
own books and their essays – and their own blog posts, possibly linking
to mine – but me having to endure the inane and the boring, and
inflicting it on my readers, is disrespectful to my readership. It’s
abuse of my distribution channel.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, I expect newspapers and academic journals to exercise their
editorial powers to filter and select the replies and comments and
letters to the editors worth their readers’ time. It is what I expect
because life is short and the number of boring comments are endless. A
world without curation is not my goal.
</p>
<p>
On my blog, people can find ways to contact me. And maybe I’ll post
their replies or additions. But really, adversarial comments can be
hosted elsewhere and I feel no compulsion to link them all. This sort of
third party comment aggregation is exactly what Hacker News, Reddit or
Lemmy do. It makes no sense to demand that blogs do the same. It makes
no sense to demand all social media to do the same. Tools can be
different and interaction models can be different.
</p>
<p>
To come back to the fediverse: I would prefer Mastodon (and the software
I use, GoToSocial) to change their defaults because I think the original
poster having control over comments provides exactly the kind of
curation I like. In this social media model, I’m following people so I
implicitly trust their curation. Calling this curation censorship or
suppression is an exaggeration.
</p>
<p>
I write on the web. I don’t plan to prevent other people from reading my
words and writing posts quoting my words. What I do want is the option
of having no part in their distribution. I’m not interested in
technology that allows people to use my blog or my posts to reach my
readership with their adversarial replies. In other words, I’m fine with
people writing replies on their blog posts and linking to mine. I don’t
need to link back. On social media, I’m willing to go a step further and
allow people to write public replies linked to my posts. I’d very much
like the option of detaching adversarial replies from my posts.
</p>
<p>
The important part about this is the realization that none of this is
“natural” – everything is engineered and the people writing the software
make decisions about how the people on these platforms interact and it’s
important to think about the choices being made and the consequences
these choices have. Replies being attached to original posts in the
fediverse is a feature somebody developed and it is not at all clear to
me that denying this features amounts to suppression or censorship.
</p>
<p>
The belief that denying technological features amounts to suppression
and censorship is a leap I am not willing to make.

But performance is only one aspect that interests me. This is the first

2024-08-04 Walliser Roggenbrot
</h1>
<p>
Wir waren zu Besuch bei Freunden in Oberösterreich und ich habe ein
„Walliser“ Roggenbrot mitgebracht.
</p>
<p>
Man nehme:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Salz
</li>
<li>
Dinkelmehl (ein Drittel oder ein Viertel vom Mehl); Weizenmehl geht auch
</li>
<li>
Roggenvollkornschrotmehl (doppelt oder drei Mal so viel wie Dinkel- oder
Weizenmehl)
</li>
<li>
Sauerteig Starter
</li>
<li>
Nüsse; z.B. Walnüsse
</li>
<li>
Trockfrüchte; z.B. Pflaumen, Aprikosen, Feigen, je nach Wunsch
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hier mit Paranüssen, Datteln, Pflaumen und Feigen:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-1.jpg" alt="Salz, Dinkelmehr, Roggenvollkornschrotmehl, Paranüsse, Datteln, gedörrte Pflaumen und gedörrte Feigen" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-2.jpg" alt="Nüsse nicht klein brechen, Früchte grob schneiden" />
</p>
<p>
Sauerteigstarter und ca. 150g Dinkelmehl:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-3.jpg" alt="Mehl" />
</p>
<p>
Etwa zwei bis drei Mal mehr Roggenvollkornschrotmehl, das wären also
300–450g, hier aufgefüllt mit etwas über 300g Roggenvollkornschrotmehl
auf ca. 500g:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-4.jpg" alt="Noch mehr Mehl" />
</p>
<p>
Eine Hand voll Salz, oder einen Suppenlöffel, oder etwa 10g:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-5.jpg" alt="Salz" />
</p>
<p>
Mit etwas mehr als zwei Drittel Wasser mischen. Bei 500g Mehl wären das
333ml Wasser gewesen. Hier habe ich fast 400ml zugegeben und auf 900g
aufgefüllt. Wie man nachher noch sehen wird, war das ein wenig zu viel
Wasser.
</p>
<p>

Umrühren – langes kneten finde ich unnötig. Kommt aber vielleicht auf
das Mehl an.
</p>
<p>

Über Nacht zudecken und gären lassen.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-8.jpg" alt="Geschirrtuch bedeckt die Schüssel" />
</p>
<p>
Weil es genug Dinkelmehl in der Mischung gab, ist aufgegangen.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-9.jpg" alt="Der Teig in der Schüssel ist aufgegangen" />
</p>
<p>
Weil es so viel Teig ist, werde ich zwei kleinere Brote machen und habe
den Teig deswegen halbiert. Nun gilt es, den Teig in viel Mehl zu
wenden, so dass er nirgends mehr anklebt. Weil ich etwas zu viel Wasser
verwendet habe, war das schwieriger als sonst.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-10.jpg" alt="Zwei Schüsseln mit Teigklumpen in Mehl gewendet" />

</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-11.jpg" alt="Geschirrtuch bedeckt nun zwei Schüsseln" />
</p>
<p>
Diesmal warte ich nicht lange. nach einer halben Stunde oder Stunde hat
es schon wieder Risse und Blasen in der Mehlschicht, weil die Hefe aktiv
ist.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-12.jpg" alt="Bemehlte Teigklumpen mit Rissen und Blasen" />
</p>
<p>
Weil der Teig nicht sehr fest ist, lege ich ihn lieber in eine Schüssel
oder eine Kuchenform statt auf das Backblech. Traditionelles Roggenbrot
ist allerdings eher flach, deswegen nehme ich keine Kuchenform. Etwas
flach ist OK.
</p>
<p>
Unten im Boden hat es einen Wasserbehälter mit einem halben Liter Wasser
drinnen. Das kann man auch in eine dritte Schüssel geben, damit es im
Ofen schön feucht bleibt.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-13.jpg" alt="Zwei Teigklumpen in zwei Schüsseln im Ofen" />
</p>
<p>
50 Minuten backen bei 180°C und das Brot ist fertig.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-14.jpg" alt="Zwei Laib Brot mit schöner Kruste" />
</p>
<p>
Wer ein Kuchengitter hat, kann das Brot darauf trocknen lassen.
Alternativ in ein Geschirrtuch einwickeln oder kopfüber legen, damit es
auch von unten etwas antrocknen kann.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-15.jpg" alt="Brot auf einem Gitter" />
</p>
<p>
Üblicherweise wird das Brot relativ dünn geschnitten und mit allem
möglichen belegt. Fleisch, Käse, oder nur mit etwas Butter… und einem
Glas Wein.

<h2 id="exkurs-sauerteig">
Exkurs Sauerteig
</h2>
<p>
Online gibt es tausend Anleitungen hierfür. Hier meine Kurzfassung.
</p>
<p>
Variante 1 dauert ein paar Tage:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Etwas Mehl und gleich viel Wasser mischen, bis es einen zähen, feuchten
Teig gibt. Diesen mit einem Papier verschlossen im Kühlschrank
aufbewahren. Jeden Tag die Hälfte davon verwenden, für Pfannkuchen oder
sonst etwas. Dann wieder mit Mehl und Wasser auffüllen und mischen, bis
man wieder gleich viel im Glas hat. Anfangs hat es nur wenig Hefe darin.
Nach sieben Tagen sieht man durch das Glas, wie es jeden Morgen Blasen
im Teig hat. Der Sauerteig lebt!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Variante 2 ist um einiges schneller:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Etwas Mehl, Hefe und gleich viel Wasser mischen, bis es einen zähen,
feuchten Teig gibt. Diesen mit einem Papier verschlossen im Kühlschrank
aufbewahren. Schon nach einer Stunde sieht man Blasen im Teig. Der
Sauerteig lebt! Nun verwendet man die Hälfte davon für das erste Brot.
Dann gilt es, das Glas wieder mit Mehl und Wasser aufzufüllen und zu
mischen, bis man wieder gleich viel im Glas hat. Anfangs hat es nur
wenig Milchsäurebakterien darin, aber das wird im Laufe der nächsten
Tage besser.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Das funktioniert, weil es in der Luft Hefe und Milchsäurebakterien hat,
welche die Mischung besiedeln. Da wir immer die Hälfte entfernen, sorgt
die Auslese dafür, dass nur bleibt, wer sich wirklich schnell ausbreiten
kann. Und das sind die Hefe und die Milchsäurebakterien. Diese halten
sich gegenseitig mit ihren Produkten im Schach: Die Hefe produziert
Alkohol und die Bakterien die Milchsäure, was den Teig bei andere
Lebewesen unbeliebt macht. Unser Glück!
</p>
<p>
Theoretisch kann man den Sauerteig auch ausserhalb des Kühlschrankes
aufbewahren. Früher hatten wir ja auch keine Kühlschränke und trotzdem
gab es Brot. Da wir aber nicht jeden Tag ein Brot backen und deswegen
auch nicht die ganze Zeit Sauerteig verbrauchen, gibt das anderen
Lebewesen die Gelegenheit, unser Glas zu besiedeln. Im Kühlschrank wird
das etwas ausgebremst.
</p>
<h2 id="tipps-zum-glas">
Tipps zum Glas
</h2>
<p>
Ich schliesse das Glas nicht mit einem luftdichten Deckel, weil der
Sauerstoff ebenfalls unerwünschte Lebewesen fern hält.
</p>
<p>
Wenn ich in die Ferien gehe, mach ich eine besonders trockene Mischung,
weil ich mir vorstelle, dass die Hefe und die Milchsäurebakterien dann
in ein Dauerstadium übergehen und die Zeit ohne neue Nahrung besser
überstehen. Weniger Wasser sorgt dafür, dass in dieser Zeit weniger
unerwünschte Lebewesen das Glas besiedeln.
</p>
<p>
Alle ein bis zwei Wochen wechsel ich das Glas. Der halbe Sauerteig kommt
in das neue Glas, das alte Glas wird beim Brot backen mit dem
verwendeten Wasser ausgespült. Ich will so wenig Sauerteig wie möglich
wegspülen.
</p>
<p>
In den letzten vier Jahren hatte ich zwei Mal den Fall, dass ich den
weissen Flaum von Schimmel am Glasrand gesehen habe. Hier waren Hefe und
Milchsäurebakterien nicht stark genug, um sich zu wehren. Also habe ich
alles weggeworfen und eine neue Sauerteigkultur angefangen.
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykotoxin#Wirkung">Mit Schimmel
ist nicht zu spassen!</a> Der weisse Flaum sind die Fruchtkörper. Der
giftige Pilzkörper selber ist nicht sichtbar und breitet sich im
Sauerteig aus. Deswegen darf man nicht nur das weisse Zeug entfernen.
<em>Alles muss weg.</em>

<p>
We’re depending on big companies that are nuzzling up with Trump, at
best hedging their bets, to let us use their networks to organize
ourselves politically. That’s never worked for us, in fact it’s worked
against us. Trump’s election in 2016, for example, could he have done it
without Twitter letting him go direct to organize?
</p>
<p>
The Harris organization is doing great, they have to take on the
journalists, where previous Democrats had no answer, they’ve done it in
a clever way, by using their channels to talk about the things
journalism should be talking about. People listen to their competition,
and that’s what this is.
</p>
<p>
It’s not hard to do this, a few of us, who are good listeners and
writers, to build lists of sources and provide them for people to access
away from the nonstop (often entertaining) bullshit of the social web of
2024.
</p>
<p>
I’ve asked for ideas for podcasts that would go into a list of shows
people who are voting Democratic would find interesting or useful. Not
for spreading religion, but based on facts, not the unhinged lunacy and
revenge of Trump. Our news now is too polluted by that. He shouldn’t be
able to lie about Harris’s race, and have that be an issue carried by
journalism, for example. That should not be possible but it happens.

The cute and adorable Wordle Kitty, Democratic VP candidate, got tired
of waiting for the Republican, so she took a few of the reporters with
her back to the presidential suite at the Plaza Hotel on 5th Ave and had
a drunken night of debauchery with the reporters and totally trashed the
place. The next morning the story appeared in The NY Times. Headline
read “Adorable kitten trashes suite.”
