<h2 id="what-to-do-if-your-lawn-mower-wont-start">What To Do If Your
Lawn Mower Won’t Start</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-20, from: Family Handyman Blog</p>
<p>
Lawn maintenance can be a bit of drudgery. Add in a lawn mower that
won’t start, and it’s a downright drag. But if you’re in that situation,
temper your frustration for a second because it might be something as
simple as bad gas or a clogged carburetor or filter.
</p>
<p>
If it is a straightforward problem, here are the steps to diagnose it.
And in the future, follow these lawn mower

and

<h2>
When Should You Call a Pro?
</h2>
<p>
Anytime you don’t feel comfortable with your safety, or after you’ve
gone through these steps and it’s still not working, it might be time to
call a pro. “It’s important to understand that lawn mowers are heavy
pieces of machinery with sharp blades, and you should never push
yourself beyond your skill set and ability or you could end up getting
hurt,” says Angie Hicks, co-founder of

<p>
Like many things in your home, doorknobs eventually break and need to be
replaced. This can happen in a few ways, but the most common is failure
of the spring inside the latch mechanism. When this spring breaks, the
latch can no longer engage with the strike plate and keep the door
closed. If one of your doors has this issue and you’re wondering how to
change a doorknob, read this step-by-step guide and learn the whole
process.

these, there’s a good chance you can solve the problem yourself.

Remove a Popcorn Ceiling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Family Handyman Blog</p>
<p>
Popcorn ceilings were all the rage back in the ’60s and ’70s. Applying
texture to drywall and plaster ceilings was a quick and easy way to hide
imperfections with no painting required afterwards. However, its rough
texture attracts dust and cobwebs and makes patching cracks and holes a
headache.
</p>
<p>
Removing popcorn texture from a ceiling is a messy chore but worth the
effort if the substrate underneath is in sound shape. Here are some tips
to take some of the pain out of scraping the popcorn texture off your
ceiling.
