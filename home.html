Remove a Popcorn Ceiling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Family Handyman Blog</p>
<p>
Popcorn ceilings were all the rage back in the ’60s and ’70s. Applying
texture to drywall and plaster ceilings was a quick and easy way to hide
imperfections with no painting required afterwards. However, its rough
texture attracts dust and cobwebs and makes patching cracks and holes a
headache.
</p>
<p>
Removing popcorn texture from a ceiling is a messy chore but worth the
effort if the substrate underneath is in sound shape. Here are some tips
to take some of the pain out of scraping the popcorn texture off your
ceiling.
