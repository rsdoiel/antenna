<p>
Few things are as daunting to landowners as the idea of building on land
that doesn’t perc. As a reminder, perc tests measure how well your soil
drains water. And since well-draining soil is crucial for septic
systems, failing one may mean your land isn’t suitable for a
conventional system.

There isn’t anything more infuriating than someone telling you what you
can do with your own property. Homesteaders, tiny home owners,
off-gridders, and anyone leading an independent lifestyle need the
freedom to use their land as they see fit. My own years of maintaining
my homestead have shown me the necessity of owning unrestricted land for
full autonomy in how I live.
