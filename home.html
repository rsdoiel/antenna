<h2 id="how-to-tighten-a-chainsaw-chain">How To Tighten a Chainsaw
Chain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Family Handyman Blog</p>
<p>
Proper chain tension is key to optimal chainsaw cutting and safety.
While it may seem intimidating at first, tightening the chain on a
chainsaw is actually quite simple once you know the steps. I used to
avoid using my chainsaw because I didn’t feel confident tightening the
chain. But after receiving some helpful advice from a neighbor, it
quickly became just another maintenance task I could easily tackle.
</p>
<p>

AVIRAL GUPTA/FAMILY HANDYMAN

<p>
In this guide, we’ll provide you with a comprehensive, step-by-step
process for tightening a chainsaw chain, with expert tips from Bob Cain
from Bob’s Small Engine Repair and Jason Smith from Westfield Equipment
Service.
</p>
<h2>
How Tight Should a Chainsaw Chain Be?
</h2>
<p>
A chainsaw chain should be tight but not too tight. When properly
tightened, the chain should pull away from the guide about 3/16-inch. It
should also move freely across the bar without falling off. “As you
tighten it, stop and pull the chain. It shouldn’t come down very far off
the bar,” Cain says.
</p>
<h2>
Safety Precautions
</h2>
<p>
To avoid burns, wait until the chainsaw has cooled before attempting to
tighten the chain. Always engage the brake and wear gloves when
tightening and check for proper tightness before using the saw.
</p>
<h2>
When to Call a Pro
</h2>
<p>
Smith recommends taking your chainsaw to a professional “anytime it’s
not cutting as it should.” He says this includes if the saw is cutting
sideways, smokes more than usual or produces more saw dust than wood
chips. “It may be time to swap the chain, and it’s best to bring it to a
pro,” he adds. If you’re unsure of how to tighten a chainsaw chain and
do not feel confident in your ability, bring it to a pro for tightening.
