<h2 id="how-to-clean-vinyl-plank-flooring">How To Clean Vinyl Plank
Flooring</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Family Handyman Blog</p>
<p>
In my previous life, before returning to journalism, I owned a bustling
specialist dog shop. We
<a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-install-luxury-vinyl-flooring/" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed
luxury vinyl plank flooring</a> because it’s durable, stands up well to
enthusiastic claws, and is easy to clean when there are those inevitable
puppy potty puddles. When I sold the business after ten years, the
flooring was still going strong. Learning how to properly clean vinyl
plank flooring contributed to the surface’s longevity.

flooring sparkling without risking discoloration or scratches.
