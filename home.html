Use Trap Crops as Decoys to Control Insect Pests</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: The Gardener’s Path</p>
<p>
Trap crops are plants that are more attractive to pest insects than your
crops are, luring the bad bugs away from your vegetables, fruits, and
flowers, and preventing damage. Once on these decoys, the pests are easy
to find and kill, meaning less insecticides are needed. Read more about
trap cropping in this guide.
