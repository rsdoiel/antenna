What to Do About Them</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Family Handyman Blog</p>
<p>
Your roof covers the largest asset you own, so it pays to know the signs
of trouble. Fortunately, many of the danger signals are easy to see-you
can sometimes even spot them from the ground. A small leak can go
undetected for years, causing huge damage before you notice anything.
It’s a good idea to inspect your roof regularly. Many contractors offer
free inspections. But even if you have to pay, it’s better than finding
leaks after the damage is done. Here are a few of the most common and
easy to recognize signs of roof problems.
