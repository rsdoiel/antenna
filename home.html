<h2 id="ways-to-successfully-cut-plexiglass">Ways to Successfully Cut
Plexiglass</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: Family Handyman Blog</p>
<p>
While plexiglass is a popular material for DIY projects, it can be
tricky to cut without chipping or cracking. Valued for its strength and
transparency, plexiglass is also highly brittle and prone to fracturing
under stress. With its unique properties, you’ll need certain tools and
techniques for a clean, crisp cut.
</p>
<p>
I used to dread cutting plexiglass. No matter how carefully I worked, it
always ended up cracking or with a jagged edge. After switching from
hand tools to power tools and trying different methods, I got much
better results.
</p>
<p>
In this article, we’ll explore different cutting methods, from scoring
and snapping plexiglass with hand tools to using power saws with
specialty blades. Whether you’re finishing a picture frame project or
building a greenhouse, you too can cut plexiglass safely and accurately
with this comprehensive how-to guide.

Drill and Lisa Shulka from Hope and Feathers Framing.
