...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
As heights rise in the East following the departure of a substantial
synoptic-scale trough, two strong shortwave troughs will progress
through the midlatitude westerlies upstream, and influence thunder
potential across the western/central CONUS:

1.  A leading perturbation -- now apparent over the eastern Great
Basin and southern ID -- should extend from southeastern WY across
east-central CO to eastern NM by 00Z.  By the end of the period, the
trough should reach central portions of SD/NE/KS and northwestern
OK, while deepening.  A closed 500-mb low may develop on the trough,
either then or within a few hours into day 2, over south-central/
southeastern NE.  Strong, foregoing low-level warm advection and
moisture transport will persist through the period, atop a
relatively stable near-surface layer.  Increasing thunderstorm
coverage is expected after about 06Z from the middle/upper TX Coast
to the lower Missouri Valley, as increasingly moist parcels above
that stable layer reach LFC.  This will occur in concordance with
steepening low/middle-level lapse rates and decreasing MUCINH,
mainly related to the warm advection (but also late DCVA over
northwestern parts of the outlook area).  Small hail may fall from
the strongest cells; however, forecast soundings indicate effective
shear, buoyancy and inflow-layer moisture content should be too
small for a severe threat.

2.  The trailing shortwave trough -- initially evident in moisture-
channel imagery over the North Pacific around 40N150W -- will move
rapidly eastward and amplify, with preceding large-scale ascent
reaching the CA/OR coastline after 06Z on either side of a low-level
cold front.  While lapse rates in the frontal band should be modest,
and buoyancy meager, areas of MUCAPE around 50-200 J/kg, rooted near
700 mb -- may extend deeply enough into suitable icing layers to
support isolated lightning.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0108 AM CST Thu Dec 12 2024

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to emerge across the southern
High Plains on Friday afternoon as a progressive upper wave
traverses the southern Rockies. Recent water-vapor imagery depicts
an upper wave off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. This feature
is expected to reach central NM by around peak heating on Friday. In
response to the arrival of the wave, an antecedent lee cyclone
across east/southeast CO will intensify with an attendant low-level
wind response. Recent ensemble guidance shows a strong signal for
sustained 20 mph winds across eastern NM into parts of the
northwestern TX Panhandle. The typically drier/windier deterministic
solutions hint that sustained winds up to 25 mph (gusting to 35-40
mph) are possible, and this appears reasonable given the favorable
timing of peak heating with the passage of a 40-50 knot 700 mb jet.
The downslope flow regime should promote RH reductions well into the
low teens, and possible into the single digits for some locations.
As such, widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions
appear likely. The primary modulating factor is fuel status, which
appears unfavorable for fire spread based on recent ERC/fuel
guidance. However, finer 1-hour grasses may see sufficient drying to
support a fire concern for some areas.

## SPC Dec 8, 2024 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0400 AM CST Sun Dec 08 2024

Valid 111200Z - 161200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance is in good agreement that a deep upper trough
will be over much of the central and eastern CONUS early
D4/Wednesday morning. At the same time, a surface low is forecast to
be over eastern PA, with an attendant cold front extending
southwestward from this low across the central Carolinas,
southeastern GA, and northern FL.

A shortwave trough is forecast to move within the larger upper
troughing, moving from the TN Valley/Southeast through the
Mid-Atlantic on D4/Wednesday. This evolution will help induce a more
negative tilt to the parent troughing while encouraging an eastward
shift and deamplification as well. The cold front will also quickly
shift eastward off the East Coast. A fairly narrow warm sector may
precede this front, but poor lapse rates will limit instability.
This low buoyancy will counter the strong shear expected, resulting
in mostly weak updrafts and tempering any severe potential.

Stable conditions are expected across the CONUS on D5/Thursday as
high pressure shifts from the northern Plains into the OH Valley.
Some modest moisture return may potentially begin across TX on
D6/Friday ahead of a low-amplitude, southern-stream shortwave trough
expected to move across the southern Plains late D6/Friday and early
D7/Saturday. Guidance varies on the strength and speed of this wave,
limiting predictability, but some thunderstorms are possible across
central/east TX and LA late D6/Friday and early D7/Saturday as this
wave interacts with the return moisture.
