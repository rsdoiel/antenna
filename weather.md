Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Valid 231200Z - 281200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Isolated showers and thunderstorms may occur over parts of the
western to central Gulf coast vicinity on Day 4/Sun in association
with a weakening upper shortwave trough moving across the region.

After a lull in precipitation potential around Days 5-6/Mon-Tue,
thunderstorm potential may increase late in the forecast period. An
upper ridge over the western U.S. will shift east across the Plains
on Day 7/Wed before a deepening trough ejects across the Rockies to
the MS Valley on Day 8/Thu. During this time, lee low development
over the southern Plains will result in strengthening southerly
low-level flow over the western Gulf. Increasing moisture return
ahead of the eastward developing low and attendant cold front will
likely result in thunderstorm development from the ArkLaTex to the
Mid-South vicinity on Day 8/Thu. While some severe potential could
become favorable in this pattern, uncertainty regarding northward
extent of moisture return, and timing of key features at this longer
time range, precludes severe probabilities at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain low on D2 - Friday. An
upper-level trough will eject out of the southwest into the central
Plains, bringing a return to lighter winds across Arizona and New
Mexico. Across the Plains, southerly winds will increase with
warming temperatures as the arctic air mass begins to shift out.
Overall, lighter winds across the southwest and continued cool and
wet conditions across the high Plains will aid in keeping fire
weather concerns low where conditions are the driest.

Mesoscale Discussion 0116
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0601 PM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Arkansas...Southeastern
Missouri...Western Tennessee...Western Kentucky...Southern Illinois

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 190001Z - 190300Z

SUMMARY...Snowfall rates will gradually increase across portions of
western Kentucky and western Tennessee through the evening. Rates
will decrease through time, though some moderate to heavy snowfall
rates up to 1"/hr will be possible in heavier bands.

DISCUSSION...Radar analysis shows the gradual shift of snowfall into
portions of western Kentucky and Tennessee this evening. Moderate to
heavy snowfall is ongoing across southeastern Missouri into southern
Illinois, where a persistent heavy band extends, driven by 700-850
mb frontogenesis and isentropic ascent. This enhancement will
gradually shift eastward through time, with potential for a few
heavier bands with occasional 1"/hr rates. HREF ensemble guidance
shows a down trend in rates overall through the evening, with a
transition to mostly light snow for portions of western Tennessee.
Confidence is highest in potential for better rates across
northwestern Kentucky into southern Illinois.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0647 PM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Valid 190100Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN SOUTHEAST TX
AND SOUTH LA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms remain possible this evening across
parts of southeast Texas, shifting across south Louisiana tonight.
Hail should be the primary hazard, but a brief tornado and localized
severe gusts may occur along the immediate Louisiana Coast.

...Southeast TX and south LA...
Overall forecast scenario appears to be evolving as anticipated.
Elevated convection over southeast TX/southwest LA will have the
best chance at producing marginally severe hail along the eastern
periphery of steeper mid-level lapse rates, sampled upstream by the
00Z FWD sounding. An increasingly predominant cluster convective
mode is anticipated with time tonight, limiting the hail threat amid
weaker lapse rates with eastern extent across LA. Guidance continues
a slightly southward trend to placement of the warm front overnight
near the LA coast as weak surface cyclogenesis occurs in the
northwest Gulf. With ongoing convection curtailing northward
displacement of the stable surface air mass inland, these trends
suggest the wind/tornado threats should remain spatially confined
along the immediate coast near the MS River Delta.

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected on Thursday.

...Discussion...
In the wake of a cold front exiting the Florida Peninsula, strong
surface high pressure (1040+ mb) and an Arctic air mass will settle
over much of the CONUS on Thursday. Prevalent cold and stable
conditions are expected to considerably limit thunderstorm
potential.

0341 PM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Valid 182000Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF
SOUTHEAST TEXAS INTO SOUTHERN LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms remain possible this evening across
parts of southeast Texas, shifting across southern Louisiana
tonight. Hail should be the primary hazard, but a brief tornado and
occasional severe gusts may occur along the immediate Louisiana
Coast.

...20Z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track. Low-level warm-air and
moisture advection are already underway across coastal portions of
TX and LA, as indicated by 19Z mesoanalysis. Current thinking is
that the low-level warm-air/moisture advection will continue to
increase and boost elevated CAPE to 1000 J/kg along the coast with
the approach of a mid-level impulse currently situated over NM.
Elevated thunderstorms should develop later this evening. Mainly
hail is expected given elongated hodographs. However, if any
supercellular structure can materialize along the southeast LA coast
and become rooted in the boundary layer tonight, a damaging gust or
tornado cannot be ruled out.

..Squitieri.. 02/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1029 AM CST Tue Feb 18 2025/

...Southeast Texas into Southern Louisiana...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a shortwave trough moving
into northern AZ from the Great Basin.  This upper feature will move
east-southeast during the period reaching northern LA/southern AR by
daybreak Wednesday.  Surface analysis this morning delineates an
arctic cold front from the Concho Valley northeastward into north
TX.  This boundary will continue to surge south-southeastward to the
TX coast tonight.  A modifying airmass over the northwest Gulf Basin
will aid in destabilization this afternoon/evening over southeast
TX.  Thunderstorms should eventually form by this evening across
parts of southeast TX as large-scale ascent increases.  Forecast
soundings continue to indicate this thunderstorm activity will
likely remain elevated with around 1000 J/kg MUCAPE.  This activity
will spread eastward across portions of southern LA late this
evening and overnight while posing mainly an isolated hail threat. 
The surface-based thunderstorm probabilities are greatest near the
south-central and southeast LA coast.  However, low-level lapse
rates in a deep/saturated environment will be modest, likely
limiting tornado potential.  Nonetheless, if a couple of storms can
become near-surface based in the coastal parishes, a risk for severe
gusts may accompany the stronger storms.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Valid 201200Z - 261200Z

Fire weather concerns will remain limited across the country for the
extended period. An arctic air mass over central portions of the
country and widespread recent rainfall across the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic will continue to limit fuel status for most locations
east of the Rockies. Long-range ensembles shows limited potential
for widespread precipitation across southern AZ/NM and into the
southern High Plains, which may result in some drying/curing of fine
fuels through the end of the work week. Periods of localized
elevated conditions appear possible as a weak upper disturbance
passes over the region later this week, but, weak signals for 20+
mph winds coincident with dry conditions in both deterministic and
ensemble solutions suggests limited potential for critical fire
weather conditions.

Mesoscale Discussion 0113
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern OK into northwest AR and
extreme southwest MO

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 181348Z - 181645Z

SUMMARY...Light to locally moderate freezing rain and/or sleet is
possible this morning. Increasing snow rates are possible by late
morning across northeast Oklahoma and vicinity.

DISCUSSION...Light precipitation is gradually increasing this
morning across parts of central/eastern OK, in response to warm
advection near/above 850 mb atop a southward-advancing arctic
airmass. The 12Z OUN sounding depicts saturation primarily below a
notable temperature inversion around 700 mb. In the short term,
given the relatively shallow saturated layer and lack of deeper
ascent above this layer, a period of freezing drizzle/light freezing
rain will be possible, with relatively efficient ice accretion in
areas where near-surface temperatures fall through the 20s F. 

With time, deeper/stronger ascent will result in locally heavier
precipitation rates later this morning. This may be accompanied by
an transition to sleet and snow (especially with northward extent),
due to continued near-surface cold advection and wet-bulb cooling of
the initially dry layer near 700 mb. Snow rates may begin to
increase by late morning across northeast OK and vicinity, with
locally heavy snow possible this afternoon.

Areas affected...Northern Florida...Southeast Georgia...Eastern
Southern Carolina...Far Southern North Carolina

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13...

Valid 161348Z - 161545Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13
continues.

SUMMARY...A threat for damaging wind gusts will continue this
morning from parts of northern Florida northeastward into southeast
Georgia and the Carolinas.

DISCUSSION...The latest mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
to severe storms from the eastern Florida Panhandle northeastward
into the central Carolinas. Ahead of the line, surface dewpoints in
the 60s F are contributing to weak instability. The RAP has MUCAPE
less than 500 J/kg in most areas across the Atlantic coastal plains.
In spite of this, frontal forcing is strong near the line, which
will likely help the line to maintain strength over the next few
hours. With the strong low to mid-level flow in place, evident on
regional WSR-88D VWPs, the line is expected to continue to produce
isolated damaging gusts, especially along the parts that are more
organized. The wind-damage threat will likely persist into the mid
to late morning as the line moves through the Atlantic coastal
areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 0109
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern New York...Northern New England

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 161328Z - 161930Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snow will likely develop across parts of northern
New York and northern New England this morning. Further south into
parts of east-central New York and central New England, a mix of
snow, sleet and freezing rain will be possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level trough will quickly move through the
southern and central Appalachians this morning. A surface low will
deepen and move northeastward into the Northeast. Ahead of the
system, a band of strong warm-advection was located from New York
eastward into the southern New England, where widespread
precipitation is ongoing. The freezing line is currently located
from southern New York eastward into southern New England. A zone
(about 100 miles wide) of freezing rain and sleet is located to the
north of the freezing line. This freezing rain and sleet will spread
northward over the next few hours. A changeover to rain will occur
as the freezing line moves northward. In addition, areas that are
experiencing snow may changeover to freezing rain. Freezing rain
rates could exceed 0.05 inches per hour.

Further north into northern New England, surface temperatures are in
the teens and single digits. The cold air in the low to mid-levels
will make snow the primary precipitation type. As strong warm
advection and isentropic lift increase across the region, the
development of heavy snow will likely occur in many areas. Snowfall
rates could exceed 1 inch per hour.
