Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0722 AM CDT Thu Oct 10 2024

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today and tonight.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
With Milton having moved east and off the FL Atlantic Coast,
thunderstorms are not expected over FL through the rest of the
period. Otherwise, isolated convection that may produce occasional
lighting appears possible across parts of the southern Plains and
southeast AZ/southern NM. The activity over the southern Plains will
largely be tied to modest low-level warm advection and weak ascent
associated with a shortwave trough moving southward from NE/KS.
Instability is forecast to remain weak, and severe thunderstorms are
not expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1159 PM CDT Wed Oct 09 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will prevail east of the Rockies while a mid-level
trough will impinge on the West Coast tomorrow (Friday). Though some
surface troughing may develop across the Southern Plains, high
pressure will dominate across most of the CONUS, encouraging dry
conditions, but with light or variable winds, limiting widespread
significant wildfire-spread concerns. The best chance for localized
wildfire-spread conditions to develop would be the Great Basin by
afternoon peak heating, where RH will be below 15 percent on a
widespread basis. Still, doubts of a stronger surface wind field
developing, combined with only modestly receptive fuels, suggest
that fire weather highlights are not currently needed.

Mesoscale Discussion 2136
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0919 AM CDT Wed Oct 09 2024

Areas affected...Portions of South Florida

Concerning...Tornado Watch 690...

Valid 091419Z - 091545Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 690 continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for tornadoes will continue late this morning
into the afternoon. The threat will gradually expand northward as
heating destabilizes the boundary layer. Wind fields will also
increasingly support tornadoes with time.

DISCUSSION...Low-level rotation has been increasing in two supercell
storms south of Lake Okeechobee. One storm produced a tornado in
Collier County just before moving into Hendry County. More recently,
the storm in central Broward County produced a tornado as well.
Storms earlier this morning generally began to weaken near Lake
Okeechobee, but temperatures have been increasing with surface
heating. That being said, the tornado threat will likely begin to
extend farther north over the next few hours. Additional updrafts in
eastern Collier County have also been slowly deepening over the last
hour. This activity could intensify and similarly be capable of
producing a tornado. Potential for tornadoes, including a strong
tornado, should continue to increase as stronger low-level flow
across the peninsula expands as Milton moves eastward and its wind
field concurrently expands.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1202 PM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will be possible across parts of
southern New England and the Florida Peninsula on Monday, but severe
thunderstorms are not expected.

...Synopsis...

An upper trough will deepen over the Great Lakes and spread east
over the Northeast on Monday. Meanwhile, a surface cold front will
shift east/southeast across much of the eastern and southeastern
U.S. through early Tuesday. Isolated thunderstorms may be ongoing
across parts of southern New England Monday morning ahead of the
cold front. This activity should move offshore by midday/early
afternoon and pose little risk for severe thunderstorms. The front
will become stalled over north FL, with a moist (60s to low 70s F
dewpoints) airmass across much of the Peninsula. Daytime heating
will allow for modest destabilization, supporting isolated to
scattered thunderstorm activity, particularly south of the Lake
Okeechobee vicinity. Weak instability and poor lapse rates will
preclude severe thunderstorm potential. 

Meanwhile, Milton is forecast by the National Hurricane Center to
become a hurricane today (Sunday). The tropical system will
strengthen on Monday as it tracks across the south-central Gulf of
Mexico. However, Milton should remain far enough west of the Florida
Keys/southwest FL that tropical cyclone related tornado activity is
not expected through early Tuesday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...17z Update...
The previous outlook remains valid with minor modifications. Dry and
windy conditions are likely across parts of the Midwest and Great
Lakes behind a strong cold front. The Elevated area was expanded
slightly north across parts of Lower MI, where dry and breezy
conditions appear more likely to overlap with receptive fuels for a
few hours this afternoon. Otherwise, the Elevated area remains
largely unchanged, see the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 10/06/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024/

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level trough positioned over the Great Lakes region
will shift east throughout the day, while a broad zone of enhanced
mid-level flow overspreads much of the northern Great Plains. At the
surface, a cold front will continue to progress southeastward,
draped across parts of the Ohio Valley early in the day and reaching
parts of the Mid-Atlantic by the end of the period. Consequently,
gusty post-frontal northwesterly winds will manifest throughout the
afternoon/evening across a broad area of the upper Midwest.
Sustained winds of 15 mph with RH values into the 20-30 percent
range will be common across this region amid fuels that appear at
least marginally receptive to large-fire spread. Therefore, the area
delineating elevated fire-weather conditions has been maintained for
the region, with a minor expansion made into parts of northern Ohio
and southeastern portions of the LP of Michigan.

Valid 061630Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN OHIO...WESTERN NEW YORK/PENNSYLVANIA...AND NORTHERN WEST
VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast later this
afternoon into the evening from parts of eastern Ohio into western
New York/Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and western Maryland. 
Damaging winds and large hail are the primary severe hazards.

...Upper Ohio Valley into the Lower Great Lakes and Central
Appalachians...
Midday water-vapor imagery shows a potent mid- to upper-level trough
over Ontario and the Great Lakes.  A speed max initially over
northern WI/western U.P. of MI will quickly move east-southeast into
the Lower Great Lakes through early evening.  Strong, attendant
forcing for ascent associated with this disturbance will overspread
southwest Ontario into eastern OH by the mid-late afternoon. 
Coincidentally, a cold front over the Great Lakes will sweep
eastward.  A narrow plume of moisture will protrude northeastward
through the Upper OH Valley with surface dewpoints generally in the
mid to upper 50s.  Mid-level cooling associated with the trough will
act to steepen 700-500 mb lapse rates to around 7 deg C/km by
mid-late afternoon immediately ahead of the cold front.  Forecast
soundings show generally 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid afternoon
and weakened convective inhibition.  The nose of the cyclonically
curved upper jet will nose into the region and contribute to
effective shear 35-50 kt.

The latest model guidance suggests convective initiation occurring
over the northeast OH vicinity between 20-22z.  This initial
development will likely be supercellular given the strong deep-layer
shear, with an associated threat for severe hail given favorable
lapse rates aloft. A brief tornado or two may also occur. But, a
transition to a convective band featuring a mix of cells and linear
segments is anticipated given the linear forcing of the cold front.
As this occurs, the threat for scattered damaging winds should
quickly increase as convection moves east-southeastward from eastern
OH across western NY/PA and into WV/western MD. Given the fairly
narrow warm sector, this activity should weaken by mid evening with
the loss of daytime heating, and as it encounters a much less
unstable airmass in the central Appalachians.
