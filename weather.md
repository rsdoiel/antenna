Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1015 AM CST Thu Feb 29 2024

Valid 291630Z - 011200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today.

...Northwest States...
Scattered thunderstorms are possible this afternoon and tonight in
vicinity of the Pacific Northwest coast, and along a cold front
moving across ID.  Activity is expected to be low-topped and weak.

...ArkLaTex Region...
A southern-stream shortwave trough over NM will continue tracking
eastward, enhancing low-level warm advection across areas from TX/OK
eastward into the lower MS valley.  Forecast soundings suggest weak
but sufficient CAPE for isolated thunderstorms across the region
through tonight.  Some small hail is possible over east TX and
southern LA late tonight, but no severe storms are currently
anticipated.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0658 AM CST Thu Feb 29 2024

Valid 291300Z - 011200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today.

...Synopsis...
A negatively tilted upper trough -- extending from James Bay to
southern New England this morning -- will continue to pivot
northeastward across New England through the day, and into the
Canadian Maritimes overnight.  Meanwhile, a second upper short-wave
trough, embedded within cyclonic flow around a Gulf of Alaska
cyclone, will shift inland/across the Pacific Northwest.  In between
the two troughs, weak ridging will prevail, though a smaller-scale
southern-stream trough will continue undercutting the
northern-stream ridge, crossing the south-central U.S. through the
period.

At the surface, high pressure will prevail over the eastern half of
the country in the wake of the prior cold-frontal passage. 
Meanwhile, a cold front will advance southeastward across the
Northwest in conjunction with the aforementioned upper troughing. 
Other features of note will be a lee trough over the high Plains,
and a warm front over the north-central states that will gradually
lift northward across the international border.

Thunderstorms will be possible along the West Coast today and
tonight, primarily in orographically favored areas of the Coast
Ranges of the Pacific Northwest, and secondarily across portions of
Idaho in the vicinity of the advancing cold front.  Weak instability
is anticipated, with shallow/low-topped convection the result.

Meanwhile, elevated thunderstorms based above 850mb are ongoing
across portions of western Texas and the Transpecos region, ahead of
the southern-stream vort max described earlier.  Showers and
embedded thunderstorms will spread eastward across the southern
Plains in advance of this feature, reaching as far east as
Mississippi/Louisiana late in the period.  While small hail will be
possible overnight from East Texas eastward, as more substantial
elevated CAPE evolves, severe risk appears likely to remain minimal
at best.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-02-29, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy2.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day2fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 AM CST Thu Feb 29 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
A weak upper low over the southern Plains will continue eastward
Friday with strong flow aloft trailing behind it over the southern
Rockies/High Plains. At the same time a second Pacific trough will
begin to move onshore with strong southwest flow. In the wake of the
upper low, surface winds across the West should begin to slowly
increase in response to the stronger flow aloft. Periods of dry and
breezy conditions are possible Friday across eastern NM and the TX
Panhandle.

...Eastern NM and the TX Panhandle...
As the upper low over the southern Plains departs, flow aloft will
gradually turn westerly ahead of the advancing Pacific system. Winds
aloft are forecast to gradually strengthen through the day, with
40-50 kt of flow over the southern Rockies likely by the afternoon.
Aided by a deepening lee trough, 15-20 mph of westerly downslope
flow is expected over parts of eastern NM into the western TX
Panhandle. Despite some recent light precipitation, this area has
remained largely devoid of meaningful rain/snow in the past several
weeks. Warm temperatures and downslope drying should continue to
support a very dry air mass with minimum RH values of 15-20% and
poor overnight recoveries. Rapid fuel drying has occurred in the
last few days with unusually warm temperatures and a recent uptick
in fire activity. Widespread elevated to locally critical
fire-weather conditions appear possible Friday afternoon cross parts
of eastern NM and West TX. Localized fire-weather concerns may also
increase farther north across parts of eastern CO, though confidence
in sustained dry and windy conditions here is lower.

Mesoscale Discussion 0176
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0856 AM CST Wed Feb 28 2024

Areas affected...TN Valley to southern Appalachians

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 281456Z - 281700Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Southern portion of a low-topped squall line should
continue eastward across parts of the Tennessee Valley through at
least midday. Strong to localized severe wind gusts capable of
sporadic damage should be the primary threat.

DISCUSSION...The southern portion of a long, but thin, low-topped
(echo tops to around 30k ft) squall line extends as far south as
northeast MS. Large-scale ascent, outside of low-level convergence
attendant to the southeast-moving cold front, will be gradually
weakening across the region into the afternoon. However, a few cloud
breaks noted ahead of the line should yield modest boundary-layer
destabilization. In conjunction with the northeast extent of low 60s
surface dew points, the relatively more favorable thermodynamic
environment should compensate for the diminishing ascent and will
probably sustain the low-topped convective line eastward through at
least midday. This scenario is generally supported by 12Z CAM
guidance. With veered surface and low-level flow, increasing to
40-45 kts at 1 km AGL, the primary threat should be strong to
locally severe surface gusts, peaking in the 50-65 mph range. A
53-kt gust was measured at KMSL at 1437Z.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1032 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE
INTO NORTH-CENTRAL OKLAHOMA...

Modest modifications have been made to the Elevated/Critical areas
based on morning observations and the latest guidance. Ongoing fire
activity in the Texas Panhandle will be exposed to increasing winds
through the day. Furthermore, a wind shift to strong northerly winds
will occur this evening in the southern Plains. See the previous
discussion for additional details.

..Wendt.. 02/27/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024/

...Synopsis...
Split mid-level flow will gradually consolidate as a Pacific trough
merges with an increasingly strong subtropical jet stream over the
central CONUS. Very strong westerly flow is expected over the Plains
and Midwest, supporting dry and windy conditions. Widespread
elevated to critical fire-weather conditions are excepted.

...Southern Plains...
As the upper trough begins to move over the Plains, strong low-level
flow is expected to develop by mid morning. Westerly winds of 20-25
mph, with gusts of 30-35 mph, are possible across parts of western
and central OK and the TX Panhandle. Despite dry downsloping and the
unusually warm temperatures, increasing mid and high-level cloud
cover may limit diurnal RH minimums to near 20-25%. Still,
widespread elevated to near/briefly critical fire-weather conditions
appear likely given the increasingly strong wind gusts. Significant
fire activity over the preceding days also suggests fuels are more
receptive than some guidance indicated. Thus, greater confidence
exists for critical conditions across parts of western and central
OK and the eastern TX Panhandle where the strongest winds are
expected to overlap more receptive fuels, despite marginal humidity.

To the east, a pronounced low-level thermal ridge behind a surface
trough will support afternoon RH values below 30% with southwest
winds of 20-25 mph across the eastern Plains into western MO. While
RH values are not overly dry, the strong winds and unusually warm
temperatures should allow for widespread elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions.

Fire-weather concerns will begin to diminish later in the evening as
a cold front rapidly moves south. Strong gusts may persist behind
the front along with a rapid wind shift to north/northwesterly.
Cooler temperatures and higher RH behind the front should quickly
limit sustained fire-weather concerns through the overnight hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0161
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1012 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024

Areas affected...Eastern CO to northern NE

Concerning...Snow Squall 

Valid 271612Z - 271915Z

SUMMARY...A short-duration moderate to heavy snow band that is
effectively producing sporadic snow squall conditions should spread
east-southeast into early afternoon across parts of eastern Colorado
and northern Nebraska.

DISCUSSION...700-mb frontogenetical forcing for ascent has supported
a narrow band of moderate to heavy snow across a portion of the
Denver Metro Area northeastward into north-central NE, per surface
observations and road cameras. The northeast extent of this band is
well removed from the surface cold front that is marching
south-southeast from IA to north KS and east-central CO. Strong,
post-frontal gradient winds are combining with the narrow snow band
to produce snow squall-like conditions with substantial reduction in
visibility despite the mesoanalysis snow squall parameter holding
less than 0.1. The stronger 700-mb frontogenesis is largely expected
to shift east in NE and gradually weaken while shifting southeast in
eastern CO. This may yield breaks in the ongoing thin band, a
scenario supported by recent RRFS guidance.

Mesoscale Discussion 0160
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0845 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024

Areas affected...Northwest to north-central MN and southeast ND

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 271445Z - 271845Z

SUMMARY...A band of persistent heavy snow with 1-2 inch/hour rates
will shift northeast across northwest and north-central Minnesota
into northwest Ontario. Near-blizzard to blizzard conditions should
continue in its wake where light to moderate snow occurs, mainly
across the Red River Valley.

DISCUSSION...Based on observed snow reports and imagery, a band of
heavy snow is ongoing from the Fargo-Moorhead vicinity northeastward
across northwest MN. This heavy snow band aligns well with 700-mb
frontogenesis and is expected to shift northeast across
north-central MN into northwest Ontario through midday. Meanwhile,
strong to severe gradient winds (gust to 51 kts measured at KFAR)
near and to the backside of this heavy snow band has yielded several
obs with visibility of a half-mile or less. The bulk of the tighter
surface pressure gradient and low-level flow should generally shift
east into the afternoon, suggesting the more persistent
near-blizzard to blizzard conditions should be favored over the Red
River Valley and parts of northwest MN.

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast the rest of tonight.

Northwesterly flow is deepening across the Carolinas this evening as
the primary corridor of low-level convergence focuses offshore in
response to the progressive short-wave trough. While a few showers
will linger across Coastal Carolinas this evening, the prospect for
lightning is lessening with this activity given the weakening
low-level lapse rates/buoyancy (nocturnal cooling) and downstream
convergence.
