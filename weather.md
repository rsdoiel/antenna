Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MAINLY
SOUTHEAST AND EAST TEXAS INTO WESTERN AND NORTHERN LOUISIANA AND
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of all hazards are possible
this afternoon and evening from the southern Plains eastward into
the Ark-La-Tex and lower Mississippi Valley.

...Southern Plains/Ark-La-Tex and Lower Mississippi Valley...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a relatively compact but
potent mid-level shortwave trough over west/northwest TX, and this
feature will move east to the Ark-La-Tex by late evening before
reaching western TN/northern MS by early Friday morning.  In the low
levels, a weak surface low will consolidate over northeast TX by
late afternoon/early evening before moving into northern AR late
overnight.  A warm frontal zone will advance northward across much
of east TX and western LA with lower 60s dewpoints near the I-20
corridor and mid 60s over the coastal plain (locally mid-upper 60s
in upper coast of TX).  Considerable cloud cover will likely limit
the overall magnitude of destabilization today.

In relative agreement with previous forecast thinking, convective
development should begin mid-late morning over north TX and
subsequently southward along the I-35 corridor.  Weak capping will
erode such as scattered to numerous storms will likely develop
during afternoon near the low/frontal zone and in the warm sector
near and west of the Sabine River.  Forecast soundings show enlarged
hodographs with sufficient buoyancy for rotating storms capable of
all hazards, primarily this afternoon into the early evening.  The
aforementioned expanding thunderstorm coverage and linear evolution
will lessen the hail risk towards evening.  Concurrently, this
should favor more of a scattered damaging wind/isolated risk for a
tornado into the evening, gradually lowering into the overnight as
buoyancy lessens.

## SPC Dec 26, 2024 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0410 AM CST Thu Dec 26 2024

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
At least some severe-weather risk is expected on Sunday/Day 4 across
the Southeast States as an upper trough shifts east-northeastward
from the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys toward the Appalachians. Very strong
deep-layer winds will overspread the region, but guidance
variability exists regarding the availability and
north-northeastward extent of minimal buoyancy, especially with
GFS/ECMWF-related guidance depicting the possibility of considerable
scattered convection ongoing Sunday morning. Regional areas
including northern Florida into southern/eastern Georgia and parts
of the Carolinas will continue to be reevaluated in subsequent
outlooks as far as Sunday's severe potential, but at least
some/low-end severe risk seems probable even with these instability
uncertainties.

Thereafter, severe-weather potential early next week is currently
expected to remain low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1054 PM CST Wed Dec 25 2024

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad/strong west-northwesterly midlevel flow across the
central/southern Rockies will maintain lee troughing along the
adjacent High Plains. As a result, breezy downslope flow with modest
RH reductions will develop across the southern High Plains during
the afternoon. However, marginal RH and fuels should limit
fire-weather concerns.
