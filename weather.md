Valid 191300Z - 201200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
The upper-tropospheric pattern is evolving back to an eastern mean
trough and western ridge for a few days, as a series of shortwave
troughs dig southeastward from the northern/central Plains and
upstream parts of western/central Canada.  Low-level cold frontal
passage related to the eastern troughing will render the airmass
east of the Rockies too dry and/or stable for thunderstorms over
land for the rest of this period.  Meanwhile, ridging aloft and lack
of greater moisture/instability will preclude thunder in the West.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CST Wed Dec 18 2024

Valid 201200Z - 261200Z

Upper-level ridging over the West will continue to shift eastward
and eventually lose amplitude as it moves into the Plains this
weekend. Shortwave troughs are expected to move through the
northern/central Plains late this weekend into early next week. By
the middle of next week, guidance shows agreement that a shortwave
trough will move into the Southwest and eject into the southern
Plains around Wednesday/Thursday. The overall fire weather concern
during the period is likely to be low on account of cooler
temperatures and/or light winds. Some locally elevated conditions
could occur in the central High Plains with the passage of the
shortwave troughs. The feature to watch will be the forecast trough
moving into the southern Plains. Areas of eastern New Mexico and
western Texas have received little rainfall recently. Some increase
in fire weather concern is possible those areas depending on the
timing of the trough.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 PM CST Wed Dec 18 2024

Valid 182000Z - 191200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are unlikely through the rest of the period.
Scattered thunderstorms will continue across portions of the
Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic.

...20z...
The severe risk has diminished across middle and eastern Tennessee
as of 20z, prompting the removal of the remaining Marginal risk
area. Thunderstorm activity will continue across the Southeast and
into the Mid-Atlantic along the front this afternoon. See previous
discussion for more information.

..Thornton/Gleason.. 12/18/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1028 AM CST Wed Dec 18 2024/

...Middle/Eastern Tennessee and Vicinity...
A line of convection along/near a cold front will continue to
progress steadily eastward across parts of eastern KY,
middle/eastern TN and northern AL. This activity is generally
outpacing greater low-level moisture to its south, and related
instability. Isolated strong to damaging winds still appear possible
for a couple more hours while the line can maintain its intensity,
even though boundary-layer instability and lapse rates aloft remain
rather weak. But, expectations are for the line to weaken quickly by
early/mid afternoon as it encounters the higher terrain of the
Appalachians and an even less favorable thermodynamic environment.

...Remainder of Southeast into the Southern Mid-Atlantic...
Continued low-level warm/moist advection will occur today ahead of
an eastward-moving upper trough and related surface cold front.
While a conditionally somewhat favorable environment to support
organized severe convection should exist across parts of the
Southeast into the Carolinas ahead of the front, limited low-level
convergence and poor lapse rates/instability should tend to hinder
thunderstorm development for most areas. Convection does appear more
probable across parts of central/south FL this afternoon and
evening, but weak shear should limit severe potential.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 PM CST Wed Dec 18 2024

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast. With a potent shortwave trough
move southeastward into the central Plains, a deepening surface low
will promote winds of 20-30 mph over parts of western/central
Nebraska. Winds will support a locally elevated fire weather threat,
but marginal temperatures/RH should limit greater concerns.

..Wendt.. 12/18/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Wed Dec 18 2024/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging over the western US is forecast to move eastward
Thursday as the overall upper-air pattern becomes more amplified. At
the surface, high pressure over the Great Basin will move into the
Rockies. Aside from some residual offshore flow over parts of
southern CA, widespread fire-weather concerns are not expected.

...Southern CA...
Offshore winds are expected to gradually diminish overnight
D1/Wednesday and into early D2/Thursday, as high pressure over the
Great Basin shifts eastward. While winds should generally weaken,
some lingering, locally elevated fire-weather conditions may
continue in the typical Santa Ana mountains/foothills through the
afternoon. Limited in spatial coverage and duration, fire-weather
concerns are not expected to be widespread.

## SPC Dec 18, 2024 1930 UTC Day 3 Severe Thunderstorm Outlook

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day3otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day3otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 3 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1257 PM CST Wed Dec 18 2024

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected across the Lower 48 on Friday.

...Synopsis...
A large-scale mid/upper-level trough will persist across much of the
central/eastern CONUS on Friday, as a significant embedded shortwave
moves from the Ohio Valley vicinity towards the Carolinas and
eventually offshore. A reinforcing cold front attendant to the
shortwave trough will move southward across the Gulf of Mexico and
Florida Peninsula. Dry/stable conditions and the influence of an
expansive post-frontal surface ridge should limit destabilization
and thunderstorm potential east of the Rockies.

Across the West, a mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to
move across the Pacific Northwest early in the day and weaken with
time. In its wake, a stronger trough over the eastern Pacific will
begin to approach the OR/northern CA coast late Friday night.
Convection with sporadic lightning flashes may accompany this
stronger shortwave trough and approach near-coastal areas early
Saturday morning, but thunderstorm potential is currently expected
to remain largely offshore through the end of the period.
