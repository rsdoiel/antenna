Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1202 PM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will be possible across parts of
southern New England and the Florida Peninsula on Monday, but severe
thunderstorms are not expected.

...Synopsis...

An upper trough will deepen over the Great Lakes and spread east
over the Northeast on Monday. Meanwhile, a surface cold front will
shift east/southeast across much of the eastern and southeastern
U.S. through early Tuesday. Isolated thunderstorms may be ongoing
across parts of southern New England Monday morning ahead of the
cold front. This activity should move offshore by midday/early
afternoon and pose little risk for severe thunderstorms. The front
will become stalled over north FL, with a moist (60s to low 70s F
dewpoints) airmass across much of the Peninsula. Daytime heating
will allow for modest destabilization, supporting isolated to
scattered thunderstorm activity, particularly south of the Lake
Okeechobee vicinity. Weak instability and poor lapse rates will
preclude severe thunderstorm potential. 

Meanwhile, Milton is forecast by the National Hurricane Center to
become a hurricane today (Sunday). The tropical system will
strengthen on Monday as it tracks across the south-central Gulf of
Mexico. However, Milton should remain far enough west of the Florida
Keys/southwest FL that tropical cyclone related tornado activity is
not expected through early Tuesday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...17z Update...
The previous outlook remains valid with minor modifications. Dry and
windy conditions are likely across parts of the Midwest and Great
Lakes behind a strong cold front. The Elevated area was expanded
slightly north across parts of Lower MI, where dry and breezy
conditions appear more likely to overlap with receptive fuels for a
few hours this afternoon. Otherwise, the Elevated area remains
largely unchanged, see the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 10/06/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024/

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level trough positioned over the Great Lakes region
will shift east throughout the day, while a broad zone of enhanced
mid-level flow overspreads much of the northern Great Plains. At the
surface, a cold front will continue to progress southeastward,
draped across parts of the Ohio Valley early in the day and reaching
parts of the Mid-Atlantic by the end of the period. Consequently,
gusty post-frontal northwesterly winds will manifest throughout the
afternoon/evening across a broad area of the upper Midwest.
Sustained winds of 15 mph with RH values into the 20-30 percent
range will be common across this region amid fuels that appear at
least marginally receptive to large-fire spread. Therefore, the area
delineating elevated fire-weather conditions has been maintained for
the region, with a minor expansion made into parts of northern Ohio
and southeastern portions of the LP of Michigan.

Valid 061630Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN OHIO...WESTERN NEW YORK/PENNSYLVANIA...AND NORTHERN WEST
VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast later this
afternoon into the evening from parts of eastern Ohio into western
New York/Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and western Maryland. 
Damaging winds and large hail are the primary severe hazards.

...Upper Ohio Valley into the Lower Great Lakes and Central
Appalachians...
Midday water-vapor imagery shows a potent mid- to upper-level trough
over Ontario and the Great Lakes.  A speed max initially over
northern WI/western U.P. of MI will quickly move east-southeast into
the Lower Great Lakes through early evening.  Strong, attendant
forcing for ascent associated with this disturbance will overspread
southwest Ontario into eastern OH by the mid-late afternoon. 
Coincidentally, a cold front over the Great Lakes will sweep
eastward.  A narrow plume of moisture will protrude northeastward
through the Upper OH Valley with surface dewpoints generally in the
mid to upper 50s.  Mid-level cooling associated with the trough will
act to steepen 700-500 mb lapse rates to around 7 deg C/km by
mid-late afternoon immediately ahead of the cold front.  Forecast
soundings show generally 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid afternoon
and weakened convective inhibition.  The nose of the cyclonically
curved upper jet will nose into the region and contribute to
effective shear 35-50 kt.

The latest model guidance suggests convective initiation occurring
over the northeast OH vicinity between 20-22z.  This initial
development will likely be supercellular given the strong deep-layer
shear, with an associated threat for severe hail given favorable
lapse rates aloft. A brief tornado or two may also occur. But, a
transition to a convective band featuring a mix of cells and linear
segments is anticipated given the linear forcing of the cold front.
As this occurs, the threat for scattered damaging winds should
quickly increase as convection moves east-southeastward from eastern
OH across western NY/PA and into WV/western MD. Given the fairly
narrow warm sector, this activity should weaken by mid evening with
the loss of daytime heating, and as it encounters a much less
unstable airmass in the central Appalachians.

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHERN WISCONSIN AND THE UPPER PENINSULA OF MICHIGAN...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms may produce large hail and isolated
gusty/damaging winds across parts of northern Wisconsin and Michigan
this evening and overnight.

...Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes...
A pronounced upper trough over the northern High Plains and Canadian
Prairie provinces this morning will move quickly eastward today,
reaching Ontario and the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes by Sunday
morning. At the surface, a strong low over Saskatchewan/Manitoba
will develop eastward into northwest Ontario through the period in
tandem with the upper trough. A trailing cold front will sweep
quickly eastward today over the Upper Midwest. Low-level moisture
return ahead of this cold front will remain fairly modest with
northward extent, with surface dewpoints generally reaching into the
50s. Rapid northeastward advection of an EML is also anticipated
this afternoon across the northern/central Plains into the Upper
Midwest. An associated cap will likely hinder thunderstorm
development until this evening, when stronger ascent and mid-level
height falls preceding the upper trough begin to overspread northern
WI/MI.

As convective initiation occurs this evening along/near the cold
front in northern WI and the U.P. of MI, thunderstorms will probably
tend to remain slightly elevated. Even so, adequate MUCAPE and
strong shear in the cloud-bearing layer will support robust updrafts
and thunderstorm organization. Initially more discrete convection
may pose a threat for large hail given the presence of steepened
mid-level lapse rates and ample deep-layer shear. A more linear mode
should quickly develop as this activity races east-northeastward
across northern WI/MI tonight. Although there may be some tendency
for the boundary layer to stabilize this evening with the loss of
daytime heating, an isolated threat for strong to damaging winds may
still exist given the expected strength of the low/mid-level flow
accompanying the upper trough. Based on latest guidance trends, have
expanded the Marginal Risk for wind eastward to include more of
northern MI with this update. There is still a fair amount of
uncertainty regarding thunderstorm coverage and intensity this
evening across northern WI and the U.P. of MI, and no changes have
been made to the Slight Risk across these areas.

Mississippi Valley tomorrow (Saturday). Strong southerly flow will
precede the surface lee trough, with a strong northwesterly surface
wind shift noted behind a cold front that is poised to sweep across
the northern Plains tomorrow afternoon. Widespread Elevated
highlights have been introduced where sustained surface winds should
exceed 15 mph amid 15-25 percent RH and very dry fuels. Critical
highlights are in place along the Colorado/Wyoming border into
portions of the Central Plains, where 25+ mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds and 15 percent RH is expected
immediately behind the cold front.

## Tropical Depression Eleven-E Forecast Discussion Number 8

date: 2024-10-03, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

909 
WTPZ41 KNHC 031435
TCDEP1
 
Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
900 AM CST Thu Oct 03 2024

The depression continues to produce a large, but poorly organized, 
area of convection, with the low-level center most likely in the 
northern portion of the convective mass.  Satellite intensity
estimates from SAB and TAFB remain 30 kt, and this is the initial 
intensity for this advisory.

The center position has a larger than normal amount of uncertainty, 
and the initial motion is also a bit uncertain at 045/5.  The track 
forecast guidance suggests a generally northward motion should occur 
during the next 24-36 h, and the new track forecast follows this in 
bringing the center to the coast of Mexico in 12-24 hours and inland 
over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec after that.  It is possible that 
some adjustments to the forecast may occur if data that better shows 
the center position becomes available.

While the environment does not favor significant strengthening 
before landfall, any intensification at all would bring the system 
to tropical storm strength, and the new intensity forecast continues 
to show this occurring. After landfall, the system should quickly 
weaken, with the remnants eventually becoming absorbed into the 
large area of disturbed weather that is forming over the western 
Gulf of Mexico.  While the forecast shows the system lasting through 
36 h, it could dissipate at any time as it crosses the mountains of 
Mexico.

Regardless of whether intensification occurs, the primary threat 
remains heavy rainfall that will continue over portions of southern 
Mexico for the next day or two.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm before it
reaches the coast of southern Mexico. A Tropical Storm Warning
remains in effect for portions of the southern coast of Mexico.
 
2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico this week. Flooding and mudslides, 
especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, especially 
across portions of the Mexican states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, 
Tabasco and coastal Guerrero.

## Tropical Depression Eleven-E Forecast Discussion Number 4

<pre>
ZCZC MIATCDEP1 ALL
TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM
 
Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
900 AM CST Wed Oct 02 2024
 
First light visible imagery and a GMI microwave overpass during the 
night show that the center of Tropical Depression Eleven-E is again 
a little to the southwest of the previous track.  While the system 
is part of a large area of convection, the convection is generally 
poorly organized, and there has been little change in the various 
satellite intensity estimates since the last advisory.  Based on 
this, the initial intensity remains 30 kt.

The track forecast is of low confidence. Satellite imagery and model 
analyses indicate that the depression is currently absorbing or 
merging with the vorticity of the EP97 disturbance, and this has 
resulted in the system center moving slowly southwestward during the 
past 6-12 h.  The models have diverse solutions for the subsequent 
track, with the GFS and Canadian taking the cyclone northward into 
eastern Mexico, while the UKMET forecasts a west-northwestward 
motion offshore parallel to the coast and the ECMWF forecasting the 
system to dissipate over water.  The new forecast track is a 
compromise between the the GFS and UKMET forecast and shows the 
center making landfall between 36-48 h in the current Tropical Storm 
Warning area.  This forecast has some significant changes in 
direction and speed from the previous forecast, and additional 
adjustments may be necessary later today and tonight.

Regardless of exactly where the cyclone tracks, it is expected to 
be in an environment of moderate to strong easterly shear through 
at least 48 h.  This should limit the intensification, and the 
forecast peak intensity of 40 kt remains at the upper edge of the 
intensity guidance.  The main impact from this system is expected 
to be heavy rainfall, which could lead to flooding and mudslides 
over portions of southern Mexico and western Guatemala.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm before it
reaches the coast of southern or southeastern Mexico.  A Tropical
Storm Warning remains in effect for portions of the southern coast
of Mexico.
 
2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, 
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican 
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco and coastal Guerrero.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Discussion...
Scattered thunderstorms persist this evening within the moist air
mass over the FL Peninsula, where wind fields aloft are light. Storm
coverage should gradually decrease as the air mass is overturned and
boundary layer cools. 

Elsewhere, isolated lightning flashes cannot be ruled out in
association with the upper trough moving across eastern Ontario and
affecting the lower Great Lakes. Lapse rates and instability remain
weak in this region.

Easterly winds aloft will also carry isolated thunderstorms over far
southern AZ westward along the Mexican border this evening, where
they may persist in association with Gulf of CA moisture. Any
marginally severe threat thus appears most likely across the
international border.

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
300 PM CST Tue Oct 01 2024

The small area of low pressure we have been monitoring for the past 
couple of days has become well-defined on satellite imagery this 
afternoon and was confirmed with recent scatterometer data.  There 
has been enough organized deep convection today to consider this a 
tropical depression, as suggested by the Data-T estimate from 
TAFB, and the initial wind speed is set to 30 kt in accordance with 
the max believable scatterometer values.

The initial motion is an uncertain 360/4 kt.  The depression has 
been moving northward on the eastern end of the monsoon trough, and 
this general track is anticipated through landfall with little 
change seen in the steering flow for the next day or two.  However, 
the model guidance is all over the place, owing to differences in 
the initial depth of the tropical depression and strength of the 
circulation associated with the monsoon trough and Invest 97E.  The 
ECMWF model seems to have the best representation of the initial 
vortex, and the track forecast heavily leans on that model 
solution, especially given its recent successes with cyclones in 
that area.  However, there is considerable spread in the guidance, 
and the tropical storm warning is larger than typical based on that 
uncertainty.

Northeasterly shear is expected to continue to affect the 
depression through landfall, though very warm SSTs and a moist 
mid-level environment should promote some strengthening.  These 
conditions would seem to favor intensification through landfall, 
and the first forecast shows a mid-range tropical storm, above most 
of the model guidance.  At this point, extreme rainfall and flash 
flooding seem to be the biggest threats from this system.

 
KEY MESSAGES:

1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm later 
tonight or on Wednesday.   A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect 
for a portion of the coastline of southern Mexico, where tropical 
storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday.

2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, 
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican 
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

Fire weather concerns are expected to persist into the weekend
across the north/northwestern CONUS with critical fire weather
conditions possible. Latest forecast guidance continues to show the
gradual building of an anomalously strong upper ridge over the
southern/southwestern CONUS through early next week. This will
maintain hot/dry conditions across much of the central and western
CONUS that should continue to promote drying fuels. Additionally,
this will maintain the strongest mid-level flow largely along the
U.S./Canadian border. Fire weather concerns will be possible across
the northern two-thirds of the country as shortwave troughs embedded
within the mean flow (and their associated surface lows/cold fronts)
propagate east along the international border. The most prominent of
these will likely impact the Pacific Northwest into the northern
Plains D4/Friday into D5/Saturday. 

...D3/Friday - Northern Great Basin and southern WY...
Afternoon water-vapor imagery depicts an upper disturbance along and
south of the Aleutian Islands. Long-range guidance continues to show
reasonably good agreement that this feature will undergo some
amplification as it approaches the Pacific Northwest by Friday
afternoon. The combination of surface pressure falls ahead of the
upper wave and increasing westerly flow over the southern Cascades
and northern Sierra Nevada will promote dry and windy conditions
across northern NV into adjacent areas of CA, OR, and ID. 
Similarly, strengthening westerly winds across the northern Rockies
will induce a dry/windy downslope regime through the WY basin.
Ensemble guidance continues to show some spread regarding the exact
timing of the upper wave, which will influence the overlap of the
strongest mid-level winds with peak heating and precludes higher
risk probabilities at this time. 

...D5/Saturday - Southern WY into the central/northern Plains...
A dry cold front is forecast to push southeast from the northern
High Plains into the central Plains through D5/Saturday in tandem
with the passage of the upper-level trough. A regime similar to
yesterday (Monday) appears likely with dry conditions and only
modest temperature reductions behind the front accompanied by very
strong (20-30 mph) winds. With no appreciable rainfall forecast for
the Plains through the weekend, fuels should remain receptive and
will support the fire weather concern. Confidence in reaching
critical-criteria RH reductions is highest across southern WY into
adjacent parts of NE/CO, but the coverage of sub-20% RH across much
of the Plains is somewhat uncertain at this range. Regardless, the
overall synoptic pattern appears favorable for at least a
wind-driven fire weather concern.

## SPC Oct 1, 2024 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 AM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 041200Z - 091200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Recent model guidance has come into better agreement with regard to
the upper-level pattern this weekend into early next week. As zonal
flow begins to break down this Friday, an upper-level trough will
dig southeastward and strengthen. Though conditional and uncertain,
some severe threat could develop in association with this trough.
After this trough exits the East Coast, ridging aloft and at the
surface is expected to develop in its wake.

On Saturday, a cold front will move through the Upper Midwest. Some
moisture return is possible on the western flank of the surface
ridge, but the quality of this moisture is highly uncertain. Wind
fields would support organized storms in parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley, but predictability remains quite low.

For Sunday, the upper-level trough will continue southeastward with
some intensification expected, especially towards Monday morning. A
similar setup to Saturday will occur in parts of the upper Ohio
Valley region. The strongest shear will likely be post-frontal, but
some stronger storms could develop along the front during the
afternoon. Moisture return ahead of the boundary remains a question
and will be the key to severe potential.

A strong mid-level jet will dig into the Mid-Atlantic Monday
morning. Given the misaligned timing of the trough with diurnal
heating, it is not clear that sufficient buoyancy will be present
for an organized severe threat.
