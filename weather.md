Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0659 AM CST Mon Nov 18 2024

Valid 181300Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND FROM PORTIONS OF EAST TEXAS INTO LOUISIANA
AND FAR SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms may continue to produce occasional strong to severe
gusts and perhaps a couple brief tornadoes across parts of north
Texas into central Oklahoma this morning. A threat for a few
tornadoes and damaging winds will also exist this afternoon and
evening from parts of east Texas into Louisiana and vicinity.

...Synopsis...
A negatively tilted shortwave trough over the southern High Plains
this morning will eject northeastward across the central Plains and
mid MO Valley through this evening. Attendant 80-100 kt mid-level
jet will likewise overspread OK/KS into western MO by late
afternoon, while a strong (50-60+ kt) southerly low-level jet aids
in northward moisture transport across parts of the southern/central
Plains and lower/mid MS Valley. At the surface, a deep low over
western OK will develop northeastward through the day in tandem with
the ejecting shortwave trough, eventually reaching the Upper Midwest
late tonight. A related cold front will sweep quickly eastward
across the southern/central Plains and into the mid MS Valley
through the period, before decelerating over the lower MS Valley
late tonight into early Tuesday morning.

...Southern Plains...
With low-level winds remaining very strong per area VWPs (up to
50-60 kt at 1 km AGL), an ongoing QLCS across central/southern OK
into north-central TX may continue to pose a risk for occasional
strong to severe winds in the short term this morning as it moves
east-northeastward. Ample low-level shear will also support a
continued threat for embedded circulations and a couple brief QLCS
tornadoes this morning. This line is expected to outpace better
low-level moisture return and already weak instability in the next
couple of hours (see very weak surface-based instability in 12Z
soundings from OUN/FWD). Accordingly, nearly all guidance shows
gradual weakening of the line over the next several hours as it
moves into eastern OK and northeast TX. Still, at least an isolated
threat for strong to damaging winds and perhaps a tornado could
persist, even as the thermodynamic environment becomes increasingly
marginal with eastward extent.

...East Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley...
The southern portion of the squall line along/ahead of the cold
front should tend to remain weak through early afternoon, before
potentially restrengthening by mid/late afternoon into the early
evening. This should occur as the line/cold front encounters a more
buoyant airmass across parts of east TX into LA and southern AR,
where MLCAPE may reach up to 500-1000 J/kg with daytime heating,
even though mid-level lapse rates will remain poor. This region will
remain displaced well south of better forcing associated with the
ejecting shortwave trough. Even so, strengthening mid-level
southwesterly flow through the day will support 40-50 kt of
deep-layer shear and some threat for supercells ahead of the front.
Sufficient southerly low-level winds will also support adequate 0-1
km shear and a threat for a few tornadoes. Most high-resolution
guidance shows either the line restrengthening and/or supercells
developing ahead of it by late afternoon. Have therefore included a
Slight Risk from parts of east TX into LA and vicinity to account
for this potential.

...Central Plains/Ozarks into the Mid Missouri Valley...
Later today, a secondary area of thunderstorms may form closer to
the surface low and behind the initial QLCS from north-central OK
into central/eastern KS and eventually the mid MO Valley. This
convection may develop in a modestly steep mid-level lapse rate
environment amid more unidirectional southwesterly deep-layer flow
near the exit region of the mid-level jet. Even though instability
will remain weak, a couple of strong to severe thunderstorms may
pose an isolated risk for gusty winds, a tornado, and perhaps
marginally severe hail. Based on latest guidance trends, have
expanded the Marginal Risk northward some to include parts of the
mid MO Valley.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CST Sun Nov 17 2024

Valid 191200Z - 251200Z

Fire weather concerns will remain limited through much of the
extended period with the exception of the southern CA coast on
D3/Tuesday. The upper low currently over northern Mexico is forecast
to eject into the Plains and the Midwest over the next 48 hours.
Widespread rain chances will accompany this features as it shifts
northeast. Additionally, an upper trough off the coast of the
Pacific Northwest will continue to support widespread rain/snow
chances along parts of the West Coast and Pacific Northwest through
early next week. As a result, fuels will likely remain unreceptive
to fire spread for most locations, though some drying is anticipated
from the lower CO River Valley into the central High Plains where
ensemble guidance shows relatively low probabilities for wetting
precipitation. 

...D3/Tue - Southern California Coast...
Long-range ensemble guidance continues to trend towards a weaker
surface high across the northern Great Basin during the late D2/Mon
to early D4/Wed time frame. Consequently, most solutions now show
low probability of reaching and/or maintaining a strong offshore
pressure gradient along the southern CA coast (only a 30% chance of
seeing an LAX-DAG pressure gradient of -5 mb or less). As a result,
confidence in widespread critical fire weather conditions continues
to wane. Latest trends suggest that the offshore pressure gradient
will likely be maximized between 12-18 UTC D3/Tuesday. Elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions appear possible during this
period, but may extend into early D4/Wednesday. However, confidence
in prolonged elevated and/or critical conditions extending into
D4/Wednesday is sufficiently low to warrant removal of the 40% risk
area. 

...D3/Tue - Central High Plains...
The surface low associated with the ejecting upper trough (currently
over northern Mexico) is forecast to reach the upper MS River Valley
as it begins to occlude on D3/Tuesday. Westerly low-level winds are
expected to intensify across the central Plains in response to the
tightening pressure gradient with widespread 15-25 mph winds likely.
Downslope trajectories off the northern Rockies may support some
degree of drying across the western Dakotas into western NE, though
an influx of cooler continental air should modulate RH reductions.
However, limited rainfall is expected across this region through
mid-week, which may allow for some drying of finer fuels. The
potential for fire weather concerns appears too limited at this time
given current fuel conditions and the overall RH forecast, but
trends will be monitored for a wind-driven fire concern.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 PM CST Sun Nov 17 2024

Valid 172000Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHWEST
TEXAS INTO FAR SOUTHWEST OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected to develop across parts
of west/northwest Texas into southwest Oklahoma this evening and
continuing through daybreak on Monday, posing a risk for severe
gusts and a few tornadoes.

...20Z Update...

...Southern Plains...
General forecast outlined in the previous discussion remain valid,
with the cyclone currently entering northwest Mexico expected to
continue eastward across northern Mexico before then ejecting more
northeastward across the southern High Plains late tonight/early
tomorrow morning. A strong mid-level jet will accompany this system,
with 90-100 kt of 500-mb flow spreading across west TX and into
southwest OK by early tomorrow. An intense low-level jet will
develop ahead of this wave, with 60+ kt at 850-mb likely stretching
from the TX Hill Country through central OK by 12Z Monday. 

Modest low-level moisture is still anticipated ahead of this system.
Current surface analysis places the mid 60s dewpoints along and
southeast of a line from PVJ in south-central OK to north of DRT in
the Edwards Plateau. This area of greater low-level moisture will
continue to advect northwestward throughout the day and evening,
ahead of the approaching wave and associated surface low. Surface
analysis also reveals a stationary boundary from END in
north-central OK southwestward to just west of INK in the TX Trans
Pecos. This boundary will likely provide the favored corridor for
surface low progress late this evening and overnight. 

A strongly forced band of thunderstorm is still anticipated,
beginning around 04-06Z in the Permian Basin vicinity, with this
band then expected to rapidly move northeastward just ahead of the
surface low, reaching central OK by 12Z. Intense low-level kinematic
fields will precede this line, with strong flow associated with the
mid-level jet as well. Resulting fast storm motion and downward
momentum transfer supports the potential for severe gusts, despite
the relatively modest thermodynamic environment. Highest probability
for severe gusts is over northwest TX and far southwest OK from 09Z
to 12Z Monday. A tornado risk will accompany this line as well, with
the highest tornado probability in the same location and time as the
greatest severe-wind threat.

..Mosier.. 11/17/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1030 AM CST Sun Nov 17 2024/

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a potent mid-level low/trough
over northwest Mexico with a downstream ridge centered over the
eastern Gulf of Mexico.  A mid-level vorticity maximum near the
middle part of the Gulf of California will pivot east into Chihuahua
by mid evening while the larger-scale trough becomes negatively
tilted and moves northeastward into the southern High Plains.  In
the low levels, cyclogenesis over northern Mexico will gradually
evolve today before the surface low deepens tonight reaching the
northwest TX/western OK vicinity at the end of the period. 
Seasonably moist air via southeasterly flow from the western Gulf
will advect into west TX before a Pacific front sweeps eastward
across the Chihuahuan Desert and portions of the southern High
Plains tonight.  An attendant warm frontal zone will advance
northward from north TX into OK late.  

...Southern Great Plains...
The 12 UTC Fort Worth, TX observed sounding showed an adequately
moist/deep moist layer featuring a mean mixing ratio of 12.6 g/kg. 
The richer low-level moisture, featuring dewpoints in the mid-upper
60s as of late morning, is currently near the I-35 corridor from the
Metroplex and areas south/southeast.  Moisture advection will
contribute to gradual destabilization through this evening across
parts of west TX northeastward into southwest OK despite
considerable cloud cover through the day.  As an intense 100-kt
500-mb speed max moves from Chihuahua into west TX overnight,
large-scale ascent will favor the development of scattered
thunderstorms initially developing near the Permian Basin vicinity
and becoming more widespread as very strong low-level warm advection
attendant to an intensifying LLJ develops tonight.  Model guidance
indicates 250-1000 J/kg MLCAPE across the destabilizing warm sector.
A forced band of storms will likely evolve tonight across west TX
and rapidly move northeast in the area southeast of the surface low
track.  As the squall line matures, the propensity for severe gusts
will probably increase despite relatively poor lapse given the
intense flow expected to develop.  It remains uncertain if cellular
development will occur either ahead of the line or be loosely
maintained in parts of the larger band of storms.  Nonetheless,
elongated and enlarged hodographs will favor a risk for scattered
severe gusts and possibly a tornado risk, especially as the squall
line encounters greater moisture from west-central TX northeastward
into southwest OK late.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 PM CST Sun Nov 17 2024

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms associated with isolated severe gusts and perhaps a
tornado will be possible across parts of the central Gulf states on
Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify while traversing the Plains states
and Upper MS Valley region on Tuesday, reinforcing surface high
pressure and associated cooler temperatures behind a cold front
poised to sweep across the OH/TN Valleys into the Southeast. As the
primary surface low over the upper MS Valley ejects into Ontario
through the day, surface lee troughing should occur along the
central Gulf Coast, supporting continued onshore moisture advection.
Given a modest, trailing low-level jet aiding in the moisture
advection, enough shear and instability along the Gulf Coast may
encourage strong to isolated severe thunderstorm development.

...Portions of the central Gulf Coast Region...
Surface lee troughing will encourage mid to upper 60s F surface
dewpoints to advect onshore amid adequate surface heating during the
day, contributing to over 500 J/kg MLCAPE by afternoon. As storms
intensify within a warm-air advection regime, veering/strengthening
of the vertical wind profile will support modestly curved hodographs
ahead of the storms. Transient supercells may develop from some of
the stronger updrafts, with damaging gusts and perhaps a tornado
possible.
