Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0732 AM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible over parts of the
northern Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley later today into
tonight.

...Synopsis...
Large-scale upper ridging will remain anchored over the MS Valley
and Southeast today. A positively tilted upper trough will persist
over the Northwest and northern Rockies, with enhanced southwesterly
mid-level flow continuing though the period over the northern
Plains. At the surface, a weak low is forecast to gradually develop
eastward across western/central SD by this evening, with a lee
trough extending southward from this low across the central High
Plains. A convectively reinforced boundary extending northeastward
from the surface low into northern MN may act as a focus for robust
thunderstorm development later today.

...Northern Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley...
Extensive convective overturning has occurred overnight across the
northern Plains into parts of MN, with scattered to numerous
thunderstorms generally remaining sub-severe while tracking
east-northeastward along/north of the surface front. This activity
has been aided by a southerly low-level jet across the Plains, which
is forecast to gradually weaken though midday. While isolated hail
or strong to severe gusts may occur with ongoing thunderstorms, the
net effect of this convection may be to displace the surface
boundary farther south than most guidance indicates. In the wake of
this early day convection and associated weak mid-level shortwave
trough, heights are forecast to remain neutral or even rise slightly
through the day across much of ND/SD into MN. This weak/nebulous
large-scale forcing casts considerable uncertainty regarding
convective development with eastward extent across the Dakotas into
MN this afternoon and evening.

Even so, it does appear probable that thunderstorms will once again
form along/near the Bighorns in northern WY/southern MT, as a weak
embedded mid-level perturbation and related jet overspread the
northern High Plains. This region will generally be post-frontal,
but steep mid-level lapse rates combined with diurnal heating of the
modestly moist low-level airmass should still aid in the development
of at least weak instability by the time convection initiates this
afternoon. Strong deep-layer shear should support supercells
initially, with associated threat for large to perhaps isolated very
large hail. Some potential should exist for this convection to grow
upscale this evening across parts of the Dakotas and pose a greater
threat for severe/damaging winds overnight. But, uncertainty remains
high regarding the placement of this possible cluster, and whether
it will remain surface-based or elevated.

Farther east into the upper MS Valley, it appears less likely that
robust convection will develop before this evening due to the
stabilizing influence of the ongoing morning activity. If
thunderstorms can develop later, most short-term guidance continues
to suggest that sufficient airmass recovery will occur to support
severe convection with mainly a hail/wind threat. Sufficient
low-level shear should also be present near the front to support
some risk for a tornado. This activity would probably remain tied
close the surface boundary, with less potential for a
forward-propagating MCS into central/southern MN. Accordingly, have
trimmed the southern extent of the Slight Risk in MN. Finally, a MCV
related to extensive convection in KS yesterday is forecast to
develop northeastward across IA this afternoon/evening. Sufficient
instability and shear should be present with this feature to support
an isolated threat for severe thunderstorms, assuming convection can
develop and persist.

...Central High Plains...
Scattered to numerous high-based thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon along/near the surface lee trough extending southward
across the central High Plains. While low/mid-level flow and
deep-layer shear are all expected to remain weak today across this
region due to closer proximity to the upper ridge, low-level lapse
rates should become steepened through the afternoon and early
evening with ample daytime heating. Given the deeply mixed boundary
layer forecast, any of this high-based convection could produce
occasional strong to severe wind gusts. Have therefore expanded the
Marginal Risk southward a bit into eastern CO and western KS to
account for this potential.

...Southeast...
A weak cold front will shift southward today across parts of GA/SC.
A rather moist low-level airmass will be in place ahead of the
front, with daytime heating encouraging the development of moderate
to locally strong instability through the afternoon. Scattered
thunderstorms that develop along/ahead of the front, and along
various sea breeze circulations, may be capable of producing
occasional damaging winds, even though shear will remain weak.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 AM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Valid 251200Z - 301200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance suggests that strongest destabilization
(including large potential instability) by next weekend into early
next week will become focused once again from the lee of the
northern U.S. Rockies across and northeast of the middle and lower
Missouri Valley into Upper Midwest.  This is forecast to be
supported by seasonably high boundary-layer moisture content, 
beneath a plume of steepening mid-level lapse rates near the
southwestern periphery of an increasingly northwesterly regime,
between building mid-level ridging along/east of the Rockies and
another significant low digging southeast of the central Canadian
Arctic latitudes through Hudson Bay.  

By next Sunday into Monday, it appears possible that this
environment could become supportive of the evolution of one or two
organizing, east-southeastward propagating convective systems. 
However, the forcing for any such development remains unclear, and
probably will be tied to sub-synoptic perturbations with very low
predictability at this extended range.

Valid 212000Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail, severe gusts,
and perhaps a tornado or two will be possible late this afternoon
into tonight across parts of the northern Plains.

...20Z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments
were made with this update. In the northern Plains, the Slight risk
was expanded eastward in portions of ND, driven by 15-percent wind
probabilities. The latest model guidance is in relatively good
agreement, depicting an eastward-moving cluster of storms through
the early morning hours -- aided by a strengthening low-level jet
and convectively augmented midlevel impulse. 

Farther south, the Marginal risk was expanded slightly southward
across central KS. Here, continued diurnal heating/destabilization
amid rich boundary-layer moisture and steep lapse rates will favor
severe wind gusts with any storm clusters that evolve through this
evening.

..Weinman.. 07/21/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1132 AM CDT Mon Jul 21 2025/

...Northern Plains into the Upper Midwest...
Water-vapor imagery shows a mid-level trough progressing eastward
across the Pacific Northwest towards the northern Rockies.  A lead
mid-level vorticity max rotating through the base of the trough is
forecast to pivot east-northeastward from north-central ID into MT
by the early evening.  In the low levels, a stationary frontal zone
extends from near the NE/SD border west-northwestward to near the
ID/WY/MT border with an easterly component to the low-level flow
being maintained across eastern into central portions of MT.

A moisture plume protrudes northwestward along and north of this
boundary with a reservoir of 70s F dewpoints over NE to lower 60s in
southeast MT (850-mb dewpoints around 16 deg C per objective
analysis).  A notable capping inversion will likely inhibit storm
development until mid afternoon and the initial storm activity will
likely focus near higher terrain and over southern MT.  Steep
mid-level lapse rates and 30-45 kt southwesterly 500-mb flow will
support supercells with large to very large hail accompanying these
storms from near the Black Hills into southern MT.  A tornado risk
may develop where locally backed flow in the presence of smaller
temperature-dewpoint spreads could evolve near the boundary. 
Upscale growth into one or more clusters or an MCS seems plausible
this evening into the overnight as storms move/develop east into the
Dakotas.  

...Central Plains...
No change was made to the previous forecast for the Central Plains
region.  Much of the central Plains will remain capped today, as the
upper ridge and warm temperatures aloft exert their influence. A
surface trough is expected to extend southward across the central
High Plains this afternoon, and a remnant MCV related to earlier
convection should move eastward along/near the NE/KS border. Both of
these features may aid in at least isolated thunderstorm development
this afternoon, in the presence of moderate to strong instability
amid modest deep-layer shear. Isolated severe hail and wind gusts
may occur with any of the more robust cores that can develop and be
maintained in an otherwise weak forcing regime. 

...Tennessee Valley into the Southeast...
Midday visible-satellite imagery shows an agitated cumulus field
from southern GA northwestward into the southern Appalachians and
Cumberland Plateau.  12 UTC raobs from Jacksonville, Atlanta, and
Charleston showed PW in excess of 2 inches, signifying a very moist,
deep troposphere.  Surface temperatures will continue to warm into
the 90s F, thereby steepening 0-2 km lapse rates.  As storms
develop, some of the stronger water-loaded downdrafts may yield a
threat for localized 50-65 mph gusts and pockets of wind damage. 
This activity will likely diminish by the evening.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO UPPER GREAT LAKES REGION...

...SUMMARY...
A few organizing clusters of storms posing a risk for severe wind
and perhaps some hail are possible across parts of the Upper Midwest
into adjacent Great Lakes region Wednesday through Wednesday night.

...Discussion...
An upper ridge will exist over the eastern CONUS, with a belt of
moderate winds aloft from the upper MS Valley and Great Lakes. A
surface trough will extend roughly from Lake Superior southwestward
into NE, with rich moisture to the south and east.

Storms are likely to be ongoing over the upper Great Lakes region
early on Wednesday, supported by southwest winds at 850 mb within a
theta-e plume. Some of this early activity could product strong wind
gusts.

Behind this activity, destabilization will occur near the surface
trough, and new development is likely during the late afternoon from
MN into SD and NE. With only subtle features aloft, this activity
will likely develop into clusters of storms with east/southeastward
propagation and attendant outflow/severe gust threat.

Otherwise, isolated severe cells with hail will be possible over the
High Plains over southeast MT, eastern WY and CO, as moisture backs
westward into the steeper lapse rate environment. Longer hodographs
over MT/WY could support a supercell or two, and this area will be
monitored for higher probabilities in later outlooks.

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough in the Northwest will become more diffuse on
Tuesday. Mid-level winds will slacken across the Great Basin. A weak
surface trough/boundary will remain in northern Nevada.

...Southern/central Nevada...
While surface winds will generally be weaker than previous days, the
surface pressure gradient near the boundary will support 15-20 mph
in portions of southern/central Nevada. RH of 15-20% appears
possible during the afternoon. Area fuels remain dry enough to
support elevated fire weather conditions.

Mesoscale Discussion 1738
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota across western Nebraska
and toward northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201941Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this afternoon
from south-central SD across west-central NE and toward northwest
KS. A few cells may produce large hail, with locally damaging gusts.
A tornado is possible over southern SD into far northern NE after
23Z. A portion of the area may require a watch.

DISCUSSION...Surface map shows low pressure extending from southwest
SD across western NE and into the CO/KS border area, with strong
heating. This trough will continue to deepen, and sufficient
convergence within the uncapped air mass should allow for widely
scattered storms to develop late this afternoon.

Of particular note is the warm front area which currently curls
northwestward out of northern NE and into south-central SD. Here,
heating is occurring on the cool side of the boundary, where
dewpoints remain above 70 F and low-level shear is enhanced. Any
supercell that develops here, most likely after 23Z, could be
tornadic at times, and produce very large hail as it proceeds
southeastward, aided by a modest evening low-level jet.

Farther south into the deeper/heated air mass, higher based storms
are expected, and overall shear is weaker as well. However, steep
lapse rates will favor locally severe gusts, and even some hail in
the early and robust formation stages.

Areas affected...southern Indiana and Ohio...northern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201835Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few strong storms producing locally damaging gusts
cannot be ruled out later this afternoon from southern Indiana
across southern Ohio and northeast Kentucky.

DISCUSSION...An MCV continues to move rapidly eastward across
northern IN, well north of a stalled front draped across southern
IL/IN and southwest OH. Meanwhile, a very moist air mass remains
near this boundary, with heating occurring upstream across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys.

While the entire warm sector is unstable, areas near the front exist
beneath slightly stronger deep-layer mean winds, on the southern
periphery of the larger scale trough (and MCV) influence.

Visible imagery show increasing CU fields from southern IN into
northern and eastern KY, and scattered storms are likely within this
zone. Locally strong downbursts will be possible, but any more
substantial wind threat would be conditional on a large cluster of
storms producing outflow, and tracking east/southeast near the
boundary. At this time, it appears a watch will not be necessary.

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 410 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify and pose primarily a threat for strong to
severe gusts (55-65 mph).  Isolated large hail may accompany the
stronger cells.  This activity will likely reach the coast by the
mid evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles east northeast
of Boston MA to 25 miles south southwest of Pittsfield MA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN/CENTRAL MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing severe wind gusts and
large hail are expected across parts of the northern Great Plains.
Damaging thunderstorm wind gusts are also possible across parts of
the Ohio Valley and the Southeast.

...Northern Plains...
Downstream of a slow-moving midlevel trough over the Northwest, a
related southwesterly jet streak will emerge over the northern
Rockies into the adjacent High Plains during the day. Related
forcing for ascent will aid in widely scattered thunderstorm
development within a deeply mixed air mass over western/central MT.
As storms track eastward into an increasingly moist and unstable air
mass over central/eastern MT, around 50 kt of effective shear will
promote supercells and small organized clusters. Any longer-lived
storms will be capable of producing severe wind gusts and large
hail. 

...Ohio Valley and the Southeast...
Modestly enhanced west-northwesterly flow will be in place from the
OH/TN Valleys to the Southeast. Here, diurnal heating amid deep
tropospheric moisture will contribute to an environment favorable
for locally damaging thunderstorm wind gusts through the afternoon.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A few isolated thunderstorms will be possible across west-central
Nevada. Overall, PWs around 0.75" and generally slow storm motions
around 5-10 kts should promote wetting rainfall. However, strikes
outside of the core may promote new starts, given critically dry
fuels. Overall, this risk looks to remain too isolated for inclusion
of a dry thunderstorm area.

No changes are needed to the previous D1 Fire Weather Outlook
Elevated area. See previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 07/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will begin to sag into northern California and
the northern Great Basin today. A surface trough will develop from
the Northwest into the central Great Basin.

Elevated to locally critical conditions are possible from northern
Nevada into the Snake River Plain and western Wyoming. RH will be
lowest in Nevada where 10-20% is expected. Farther north and east,
15-20% will be more common. Surface wind speeds will generally range
from 15-20 mph in most locations. With some terrain enhancement in
the Snake River Plain, there is some potential for briefly stronger
winds. This location has a greater probability for sustained
critical conditions, though ensemble guidance continues to suggest
it will remain quite localized.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...OHIO VALLEY...AND PARTS OF THE
NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear most likely this afternoon into this
evening across parts of the Northeast, portions of the northern and
central Plains, and perhaps the Ohio Valley.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Northeast today with
increasing mid-level flow ahead of an approaching jet streak. A
low-amplitude ridge will build somewhat across the Upper Midwest.
Farther west, mid-level flow will strengthen across the northern
Rockies into the northern Plains as a trough amplifies on the
Pacific Northwest coast. 

...Northeast...
Weak to moderate instability is forecast to develop across the
Northeast through mid afternoon as the airmass continues to
destabilize.  Midday surface analysis indicates temperatures are
warming into the 80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to lower 70s. 
As the cold front advances east into this uncapped airmass,
scattered thunderstorms should develop. Shear of 30 to 35 knots and
relatively long/straight hodographs will support the potential for
supercells. Weak mid-level lapse rates will be the primary limiting
factor for large hail, but the overall favorable shear with strong
venting aloft and potential supercells may support some isolated
large hail. 

Damaging wind gusts will be the primary threat, both from initial
cells and also from any clusters which develop. Any stronger
clusters with bowing segments could support a better organized
damaging wind swath. The greatest wind damage threat will likely
exist from western Massachusetts to far southern Maine. 

...Southeast MT into the Dakotas and Central Plains...
Lee troughing is forecast to extend southward from eastern MT into
the central High Plains near and south of the westerlies confined to
the northern tier of states.  Elevated weak thunderstorm activity
along the ND/SD border may continue but considerable uncertainty
exists whether these storms will intensify and pose a severe risk
this afternoon.  Meanwhile, farther west, moist low levels arc from
southeast MT southeastward through west-central SD and south into
NE/northwest KS.  Strong heating will contribute to a moderate to
very unstable airmass from the central Plains states into eastern
MT.  Easterly low-level flow beneath 30-40 kt 500 mb flow in
southeast MT will support organized storms, including supercell
potential.  Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to develop and
spread east into the Dakotas.  Other isolated to widely scattered
storms are possible from SD southward into NE/CO/KS border vicinity
late this afternoon into the evening.  

Large to very large hail will be possible with any supercells that
develop within this general region.  However, the severe wind threat
may increase by this evening and become the main threat as storms
congeal into one or more clusters or MCS.

...Ohio Valley...
Visible-satellite/radar composite shows an elongated area of
showers/thunderstorms from northern MO east into western OH in
conjunction with an MCV moving east from IL into IN.  Additional
storm development along the composite front/trailing outflow
boundary is expected, but timing of this storm activity remains
unclear.  Nonetheless, differential heating along the baroclinic
zone will yield 2000 to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE amidst moderate effective
shear (25-35 kt).  A few clusters are forecast to eventually evolve
later this afternoon into the evening with the stronger storms
capable primarily of a wind-damage threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1735
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far east-central IL into central IN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201235Z - 201430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A small complex of thunderstorms may pose a gradually
increasing threat for damaging winds over the next few hours. Watch
issuance is possible later this morning if this activity can
intensify.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts of
central IL, aided by modest west-southwesterly low-level warm
advection and a low-amplitude mid-level perturbation. This
convection should continue to track generally east-southeastward
this morning across parts of central IN along an instability
gradient evident in latest mesoanalysis. While low/mid-level flow is
not overly strong, recent VWPs from KILX/KIND do show some
strengthening with height through mid levels. Resultant 25-30 kt of
effective bulk shear should continue to support some updraft
organization, with a recent supercell structure noted with a
thunderstorm near the IL/IN border. If a small bowing cluster can
become established as some recent high-resolution guidance suggests,
then a greater threat for scattered severe/damaging winds may be
realized across parts of central IN later this morning as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes with filtered daytime heating.
While not immediately likely, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may
eventually be needed if the ongoing activity can intensify.
