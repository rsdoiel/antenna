Mesoscale Discussion 1113
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 042055Z - 042300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and locally severe gusts will be
possible if storms can mature over the Trans-Pecos region this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...The latest visible satellite imagery shows deepening
boundary-layer cumulus where a stationary front is intersecting the
higher terrain in the TX Trans-Pecos region this afternoon. Isolated
convective initiation is also underway along the TX/MX border. While
weak large-scale ascent and antecedent inhibition cast uncertainty
on storm longevity (especially away from the higher terrain
features), a long/straight hodograph (around 40-50 kt of effective
shear) and moderate-strong buoyancy will conditionally support a
discrete/semi-discrete supercell or two capable of producing large
hail and locally severe gusts. Given the conditional and potentially
localized nature of the threat, a watch is not expected.

Areas affected...Parts of southeast Missouri into southern/central

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041843Z - 042115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms are possible through the
afternoon. The primary concern is locally damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorms are evolving
northeastward across southeastern MO -- within a zone of
differential heating along/ahead of the cold front. Despite poor
midlevel lapse rates, heating within cloud breaks amid upper
60s/lower 70s dewpoints is yielding sufficient (albeit weak)
surface-based instability. While deep-layer shear is modest across
the region (20-30 kt of effective shear), small, clockwise-curved
hodographs could still support localized convective organization
into clusters and transient supercell structures. The primary
concern is locally damaging wind gusts, especially with any
localized clustering, though a brief/weak tornado cannot be entirely
ruled out with any mini supercells that can evolve. Given the
expected localized nature of the severe threat, a watch is not
expected.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Valid 061200Z - 121200Z

During the extended range, the upper-level flow pattern will undergo
a change over the CONUS.  The upper-level pattern is forecast to be
characterized initially on Friday (Day 3) by broad cyclonic flow,
and then transition to a trough in the eastern CONUS and ridge in
the West by Sunday (Day 5), as a strong shortwave trough dives
southeastward out of Canada into the Northern Plains and Great Lakes
Region.  As a result, there will be a warming and drying trend over
much of the West with an increasing probability of widespread
critical RH values as far north as eastern Washington.  The
concurrent probability of surface wind speeds exceeding 20 mph,
however, is expected to be low given the forecast of weak lower- and
mid-tropospheric flow.  A series of weak shortwave troughs are
forecast to move under the ridge in the West beginning on Monday
(Day 6), which may increase the threat of dry thunderstorms across
the area, but predictability is too low to warrant highlights at
this time.

Valid 042000Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN NEW
MEXICO INTO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon into the
evening across portions of the southern High Plains. Large hail and
severe wind gusts are the primary concerns. Locally damaging winds
may accompany convection that develops from the southern Great Lakes
into eastern Texas.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast largely remains on track with only minor
adjustments needed, which were mainly adjusting risk probabilities
behind the cold front across eastern TX and ahead of developing
convection across parts of the Midwest. For additional details
regarding short-term trends across New Mexico, east Texas, and parts
of the mid-MS River Valley, see MCD #1110, #1111, and #1112
respectively.

..Moore.. 06/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025/

...Southern Rockies into the Southern High Plains...
Morning water-vapor imagery depicts a southern-stream midlevel
shortwave trough moving eastward across AZ, which is accompanied by
a 40-kt speed maximum in its base. Modest large-scale ascent
preceding this feature will promote scattered thunderstorm
development from the Southwest into the southern Rockies this
afternoon (within the steepening low-level lapse rate plume), which
will eventually spread eastward into the southern High Plains this
evening. A modest uptick in storm intensity/organization is possible
as storms move into east-central NM and eventually the TX Panhandle,
given an elongated/straight hodograph (40-50 kt of effective shear)
and steepening deep-layer lapse rates amid recycled boundary-layer
moisture. A few organized clusters and supercell structures will be
capable of producing large hail and locally severe wind gusts. 

Farther south over the TX Trans-Pecos, lingering inhibition and
weaker large-scale ascent cast uncertainty on storm
development/coverage, though isolated large hail and severe gusts
will be possible with any storms that can evolve over the higher
terrain this afternoon -- aided by moderate surface-based
instability and around 50 kt of effective shear. 

...Southern Great Lakes southward through the OH Valley and Ozarks
into East Texas...
A quasi-stationary cold front is draped from Lake Huron
southwestward across the Ozarks into East TX. From roughly the
Ozarks northeastward to eastern Lower MI, VWP data indicates a belt
of 40-55-kt midlevel southwesterly flow, which will gradually shift
northeastward into this evening. While 12Z regional soundings
sampled poor midlevel lapse rates through this corridor,
differential heating amid lower/middle 60s dewpoints ahead of the
front and related convection will contribute to a weakly unstable
air mass. This, combined with 40-50 kt of effective shear, will
support loosely organized clusters (and perhaps transient/embedded
supercell structures) capable of locally damaging wind gusts this
afternoon. While a more-focused corridor of wind-damage potential is
possible over southeast Lower MI into northeast IN, a lack of
large-scale ascent, weak instability/lapse rates, and front-parallel
deep-layer flow/shear limits confidence in this scenario --
precluding an upgrade to 15-percent wind probabilities at this time.

Farther south into East TX, diurnal heating of fully modified Gulf
moisture (middle 70s dewpoints) will result in stronger buoyancy,
though deep-layer shear will be weaker here. As a result, locally
severe gusts will be possible with predominantly outflow-dominant
convection this afternoon.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected from the southern High
Plains to the Tennessee and Lower Ohio Valleys on Friday into Friday
night.

...Synopsis...
Mostly zonal flow will be present east of the Rockies on Friday with
a belt of moderate mid-level flow extending from eastern
Colorado/New Mexico to the southern Appalachians. Moderate to strong
instability is expected across much of this zone which will result
in broad corridor with favorable conditions for severe
thunderstorms.

...Ozarks to the southern Appalachians...
A large MCS will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the period in
the Oklahoma region. This MCS should weaken through the morning with
a remnant MCV likely to advance east through the day. Moderate to
strong destabilization is forecast ahead of this MCV with scattered
storm development expected within a zone of relatively weak (~25
knots) deep-layer shear. This will mostly support multicell storms
capable of damaging wind gusts. Closer to the MCV, where enhanced
mid-level flow will likely be present, more organized storms are
possible with a locally greater severe weather threat.

...Southern Plains/High Plains...
The D3 period bears uncanny resemblance to the D2 period with
outflow across the southern High Plains and expectation for an
additional MCS developing from the central High Plains and tracking
east on Friday night.

An MCS will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the period across
Oklahoma. Outflow from this MCS will likely move south/west into
northwest Texas and into the Texas Panhandle. Significant
destabilization/recovery is forecast along and south of this outflow
boundary Friday afternoon/evening. Storms will likely develop along
the dryline with a greatest coverage near the outflow boundary
interaction. Moderate deep-layer shear will support supercells
capable of 2+ inch hail. A few tornadoes are also possible near this
outflow boundary, where low-level shear will be maximized.

Thunderstorms are also forecast to develop across southeast Colorado
into the Oklahoma Panhandle Friday afternoon/evening. Moderate to
strong instability will likely be present across Oklahoma into the
overnight period. This should sustain storms as they move east. Most
guidance shows a strengthening low-level jet and increasing
isentropic ascent through the evening which should further favor a
MCS to develop and move across portions of Oklahoma during the late
evening/overnight period with a threat for severe wind gusts.

No changes are needed to the ongoing fire weather forecast for
tomorrow.  See the previous discussion below for more details.

..Jirak.. 06/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025/

...Synopsis...
A similar upper-level pattern to Wednesday is expected on Thursday.
Broad cyclonic flow will persist across the West, Plains, and Upper
Midwest. Some amplification of a ridge within the south-central U.S.
is forecast. The southern Great Basin boundary will lift northward
bringing precipitation to more of the central Great Basin.

With a belt of stronger mid-level winds remaining in the Southwest,
another day of dry and breezy conditions are probable in southeast
Arizona into parts of central New Mexico. With another day of drying
on Wednesday, it is possible that fire weather concerns will be
slightly increased on Thursday. Still, winds will be on the marginal
side (mostly around 15 mph). The current expectation is that only
locally elevated conditions will occur.

As thunderstorms shift northward from Wednesday, some activity will
shift into areas that have not had fuel indices reduced by multiple
convective days. However, scattered storms are expected with aided
lift from the boundary and storm motions are not expected to be
fast. This all suggests a primarily wet storm mode and limited
lightning ignition risk.

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS INTO SOUTHERN KANSAS AND THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF
OKLAHOMA....

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are anticipated, mainly from late
afternoon Thursday into Thursday night from the southern High Plains
across southern Kansas and Oklahoma. A few tornadoes, large to
isolated very large hail, and severe gusts are possible.

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted broad trough will be present at the beginning of
the period Thursday with an axis extending from the Southwest to the
northern Plains. Through the day, the overall pattern will become
more zonal with moderate mid-level flow across the central/southern
Plains where confluent mid-level flow will be present. Weak lee
troughing is expected across the central Plains which will lead to
northward moisture recovery across the southern/central Plains and
some sharpening of a frontal zone across the region. 

...Southern/Central High Plains into Kansas/Oklahoma...
A cluster of storms will likely be present across West Texas and the
Texas Panhandle within a region of moderate isentropic ascent. This
cluster should weaken by late morning/early afternoon. However, some
12Z guidance (HRRR) has this cluster persisting long enough for
surface based inhibition to erode and eventual strengthening/new
development by early to mid-afternoon. The more likely scenario will
be a decaying MCS with remnant outflow extending into West Texas/the
southern Texas Panhandle. This region, where the dryline intersects
remnant outflow, will likely be a focus for supercell development
Thursday afternoon. Large to potentially very large hail will be
possible given the steep lapse rates and very strong shear. In
addition, enhanced shear along this boundary could lead to a locally
greater tornado threat. Higher probabilities could be necessary in
later outlooks, but uncertainty in the evolution of early day
convection and its impact on the afternoon storms limit confidence
in where this higher probability corridor may be present and the
nature of destabilization within this zone. 

Temperatures will warm into the mid 90s across the Trans Pecos on
Thursday with dewpoints in the 60s east of the dryline. This will
support strong instability and scattered storm development across
the higher terrain during the afternoon. Moderate shear should
result in storm organization including a few supercells with a
primary hazard of large hail. 

Weak to moderate instability is forecast across eastern Colorado and
into southeast Wyoming on Thursday afternoon. Scattered storms are
forecast along the dryline during the afternoon. Limited instability
is a likely primary limiting factor to a greater severe weather
threat. Where instability is greater, south of a tightening frontal
zone across southern Kansas greater storm intensity is likely. If
surface-based instability can develop during the afternoon/evening,
surface-based supercells will be possible within this frontal zone
with a threat for large hail (some very large) and a few tornadoes.
Even if diurnal destabilization does not support strong supercell
development, supercell development is likely during the late evening
as the low-level jet strengthens and isentropic ascent increases
across the TX/OK Panhandle. 

During this period of strengthening isentropic ascent, expect
upscale growth into a MCS which is forecast to track east across
southern Kansas/northern Oklahoma during the overnight period. A
corridor of severe wind potential will likely exist along the path
of this MCS Thursday night/early Friday morning. 

...Ozarks to the Northeast...
A weak cold front will aid in isolated to scattered afternoon
thunderstorms across a broad swath of the central to northeastern
states. Large buoyancy will likely be confined to the Mid-South,
with weak to moderate MLCAPE extending northeastward. This front
will remain on the periphery of modest mid-level southwesterlies.
Multicell clusters are expected to dominate in this setup with
sporadic damaging winds as the primary hazard. Slightly greater
effective bulk shear in the Mid-South and Northeast should also
offer a threat for isolated severe hail.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1129 AM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Valid 041630Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN NEW
MEXICO INTO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon into the
evening across portions of the southern High Plains. Large hail and
severe wind gusts are the primary concerns. Locally damaging winds
may accompany convection that develops from the southern Great Lakes
into eastern Texas.

...Southern Rockies into the Southern High Plains...
Morning water-vapor imagery depicts a southern-stream midlevel
shortwave trough moving eastward across AZ, which is accompanied by
a 40-kt speed maximum in its base. Modest large-scale ascent
preceding this feature will promote scattered thunderstorm
development from the Southwest into the southern Rockies this
afternoon (within the steepening low-level lapse rate plume), which
will eventually spread eastward into the southern High Plains this
evening. A modest uptick in storm intensity/organization is possible
as storms move into east-central NM and eventually the TX Panhandle,
given an elongated/straight hodograph (40-50 kt of effective shear)
and steepening deep-layer lapse rates amid recycled boundary-layer
moisture. A few organized clusters and supercell structures will be
capable of producing large hail and locally severe wind gusts. 

Farther south over the TX Trans-Pecos, lingering inhibition and
weaker large-scale ascent cast uncertainty on storm
development/coverage, though isolated large hail and severe gusts
will be possible with any storms that can evolve over the higher
terrain this afternoon -- aided by moderate surface-based
instability and around 50 kt of effective shear. 

...Southern Great Lakes southward through the OH Valley and Ozarks
into East Texas...
A quasi-stationary cold front is draped from Lake Huron
southwestward across the Ozarks into East TX. From roughly the
Ozarks northeastward to eastern Lower MI, VWP data indicates a belt
of 40-55-kt midlevel southwesterly flow, which will gradually shift
northeastward into this evening. While 12Z regional soundings
sampled poor midlevel lapse rates through this corridor,
differential heating amid lower/middle 60s dewpoints ahead of the
front and related convection will contribute to a weakly unstable
air mass. This, combined with 40-50 kt of effective shear, will
support loosely organized clusters (and perhaps transient/embedded
supercell structures) capable of locally damaging wind gusts this
afternoon. While a more-focused corridor of wind-damage potential is
possible over southeast Lower MI into northeast IN, a lack of
large-scale ascent, weak instability/lapse rates, and front-parallel
deep-layer flow/shear limits confidence in this scenario --
precluding an upgrade to 15-percent wind probabilities at this time.

Farther south into East TX, diurnal heating of fully modified Gulf
moisture (middle 70s dewpoints) will result in stronger buoyancy,
though deep-layer shear will be weaker here. As a result, locally
severe gusts will be possible with predominantly outflow-dominant
convection this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0741 AM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN NEW
MEXICO INTO THE TX PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible later this afternoon into
the evening across portions of the southern High Plains. Hail and
wind are the primary concerns. Locally damaging winds may accompany
convection that develops from the lower Great Lakes into eastern
Texas.

...Synopsis...
Upper troughing that currently extends across much of the western
and central CONUS is forecast to remain in place throughout the day.
Western periphery of expansive subtropical ridging will remain over
the East Coast as well. Despite little change in the large-scale
upper pattern, multiple shortwave troughs progressing within these
larger features will contribute to convectively active day, with
thunderstorms anticipated from the southern Great Basin and
Southwest into the High Plains as well as from Lower MI into
east/southeast TX. Numerous thunderstorms are anticipated from the
northern Rockies into the northern Plains, and the Southeast and
Florida as well.

...Southern Rockies into the southern High Plains...
The showers and isolated thunderstorm ongoing across the region are
expected to continue northeastward while weakening over the next
several hours. Much of this region is currently under a cool and dry
post-frontal regime, but southerly flow should return this
afternoon, contributing to quick airmass modification ahead of a
shortwave trough moving across the Southwest states. Showers and
thunderstorms are anticipated ahead of this shortwave from the Four
Corners eastward into the southern High Plains. The strongest storms
are expected during the late afternoon/early evening across
east-central NM, where the leading edge of the better low-level
moisture return interacts with storms moving off the higher terrain
of central NM ahead of the approaching shortwave trough. 

Enhanced mid-level flow will extend through this region as well,
resulting in environmental conditions supportive of supercells.
Large hail is favored initially, but high cloud bases and strong
outflow will likely result in a transition to a more linear/bowing
mode tonight. Despite nocturnal cooling and resultant low-level
stabilization, some strong gusts are still possible as these storms
continue into the western TX Panhandle this evening and tonight. A
low-probability tornado threat exists as these storms move towards
the TX Panhandle, where better low-level moisture and stronger
southeasterly winds are possible. However, the anticipated linear
storm mode and stabilizing nocturnal cooling should keep the tornado
threat low.

...Lower MI southward through the OH Valley and Ozarks into East
TX...
A weakening cold front currently extends from northern Lower MI into
central TX. Much of this front is expected to make modest
eastward/southeastward progress throughout the day, before becoming
increasingly stationary tonight. A moist airmass precedes this
front, and afternoon dewpoints from the mid 60s to low 70s will
support moderate buoyancy and scattered to numerous thunderstorms.
Moderate 0-6 km (i.e. 30-35 kt) shear suggests a few robust storms
could evolve that would pose at least some risk for gusty winds.
Greatest risk for damaging winds will be during the afternoon when
buoyancy is maximized.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 AM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Another active day characterized by an ongoing MCS and remnant
downstream MCVs is anticipated on D4/Saturday, with a broad belt of
mainly damaging wind potential evident. Seasonably strong mid-level
westerlies are expected to remain coincident with rich low-level
moisture. Ample buoyancy should diurnally develop south of
pre-existing outflows. This multi-day pattern finally breaks down
into D5/Sunday with amplification of a large-scale trough from the
southern Prairie Provinces into the Upper Midwest. Mesoscale-focused
severe potential may linger into at least D5/Sunday over the
southern High Plains to the TX/OK Red River Valley and from the
central Gulf to south Atlantic Coasts.

Otherwise, low-probability severe potential could begin in a portion
of the northern Great Plains on D4/Saturday, in association with the
amplifying trough. This should subsequently shift eastward and
likely broaden across the Great Lakes into the Northeast through
early next week. Overall instability appears modest until a
potential increase later when stronger flow fields overlap richer
low-level moisture. Daily severe probabilities appear to be sub-15
percent at this range, with a relative maximum in the
D6-7/Monday-Tuesday timeframe over the Northeast. Current timing of
this trough exiting New England by around D8/Wednesday suggests a
relative minimum across the CONUS then.

Mesoscale Discussion 1094
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...North-central Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 359...

Valid 032044Z - 032145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 359 continues.

SUMMARY...The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts,
large hail, and a tornado or two will exist in north-central
Missouri in WW 359.

DISCUSSION...A mature QLCS recently impacted the Kansas City metro
and vicinity and is continuing eastward through WW 359. A
consolidated bow echo is present at the northern extent of the line
(currently approaching Linn County), with a more outflow-dominated
signature present with southward extent. Both areas should continue
to pose a threat for severe wind gusts over the next couple of
hours. Periods of stronger low-level rotation were observed
recently, and some re-intensification is possible given locally
stronger low-level shear. Some semi-discrete cells have also formed
in a convergent zone ahead of the QLCS, which will pose a locally
greater threat for large hail in the short term.

Mesoscale Discussion 1093
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern IL and northwest IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032039Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe potential will increase over the next couple of
hours. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 359 may be needed
late this afternoon across parts of eastern IA into northwest IL.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery has slowly occurred across eastern IA
into northwest IL in the wake of morning convection. Temperatures
have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, and dewpoints from 66-72
F are contributing to increasing MLCAPE. With time, vertical shear
is expected to remain favorable for organized convection as the QLCS
across northern MO track east/northeast with time and additional
convection develops along a cold front oriented across eastern IA.
Damaging gusts will be the main hazard with this activity. However,
the VWP at KDVN shows some enlargement of the low-level hodograph,
due in part to a 30-40 kt 850 mb southwesterly low-level jet over
the region, which is also supporting 0-1 km SRH around 100-150
m2/s2. As such, a tornado or two also could occur in addition to
strong gusts. A downstream watch may be needed in the next couple
hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1092

0313 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...central OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360...

Valid 032013Z - 032215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360
continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential may be increasing across central OK.

DISCUSSION...Strong cells have developed just west of the I-35
corridor in central OK. These cells show rotation aloft and the VWP
from KTLX shows an increasing low-level hodograph with 0-1 SRH near
150 m2/s2. Backed surface winds are also noted in surface
observations, along with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F.
This is contributing to strong instability and further storm
organization and intensification is possible over the next couple of
hours as these storms track northeast across central OK and the
greater OKC Metro area, and a brief tornado or two could occur with
these developing supercells. Additionally, as storms across
southwest OK move into this environment, some tornado and damaging
risk will be possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 359
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM CDT Tue Jun 3 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Far Eastern Kansas
  West-Central into Northeastern Missouri

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...An organizing band of storms will likely move northeast
across the Watch along and north of modified outflow.  Moist low
levels and moderately strong low-level shear across the Watch will
support a risk for a couple of tornadoes.  A threat for damaging
gusts will probably accompany the stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 55 statute miles
east and west of a line from 20 miles east northeast of Kirksville
MO to 45 miles south southeast of Olathe KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

..Karstens.. 06/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will persist across the northern tier states
today. A cutoff low off the southern California coast will move into
the lower Colorado Valley by Wednesday morning. High surface
pressure will remain in the Northwest/northern Rockies while a
surface boundary will stall within parts of the central/southern
Great Basin.

Overall fire weather concerns across the CONUS will be minimal
today. Some dry and breezy conditions are possible from northern
California into the northern/central Great Basin. Winds will
generally be too light to warrant highlights. Some stronger winds
are possible in eastern Utah/western Colorado, but recent
precipitation has had some impact on fuels. Locally elevated fire
weather may occur where winds are locally stronger, however.
Thunderstorms will occur in the Southwest, but PW values will be
high and precipitation has occurred over last few days, decreasing
fuel receptiveness.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 353
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
155 PM CDT Mon Jun 2 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Oklahoma Panhandle
  Texas Panhandle and South Plains

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 155 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are forecast to
develop and evolve into a couple of thunderstorm clusters this
afternoon and spread northeastward through the early evening. 
Severe gusts (60-85 mph) will be the primary hazard with the
stronger storms and their associated convective outflow.  Large hail
may also accompany the stronger thunderstorm cores.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 20 miles north of Guymon
OK to 50 miles south southeast of Lubbock TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1078
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...the Texas Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353...

Valid 022048Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next 1 to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed outflow boundary has developed and is
emanating from storms across the western Texas Panhandle. This
outflow has mostly outrun the storms thus far. However, it is
quickly moving toward more favorable instability across the central
and eastern Panhandle. In fact, a boundary is apparent on the AMA
0.5 degree base reflectivity east of the radar which likely
represents the edge of the low 70s dewpoints across the eastern
Panhandle. 

As these boundaries collide, expect strong updrafts which should
strengthen the cold pool and severe wind gusts within the line. The
greatest threat for isolated 80-90 mph wind gusts this
afternoon/evening likely exists from this boundary collision
northeastward. This region has the most favorable diurnal timing and
the expectation for storm intensification as this line moves towards
the greater instability.

Mesoscale Discussion 1077
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado northeastward through
southwestern MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022047Z - 022245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon and
evening along a cold front across much of central Nebraska and
adjacent areas. Severe wind gusts and large hail will be the main
threats.

DISCUSSION...A Cu field is developing this afternoon across central
Nebraska to the south of a slowly sagging cold front. Very large
instability is present with temperatures rising into the upper 80s
and low 90s F across the region. Continued boundary-layer mixing
should erode any remaining inhibition, supporting convection
initiating in the next couple of hours. A number of factors should
contribute to quickly amalgamating storms, including widespread
initiation, largely line-parallel (and relatively modest) bulk shear
vectors, and ML LCLs between 1500-2000 m AGL. Large hail will be
possible with the strongest cores, particularly early in individual
storms' lifecycles, with a transition to a more widespread wind
threat likely during the evening. A tornado or two cannot be ruled
out amidst possibly complex storm interactions and/or stronger
updrafts interacting with locally enhanced surface vertical
vorticity near the front. A watch is possible this afternoon to
address these threats.

0321 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Portions of West Texas and the Trans Pecos into
southeast New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022021Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are possible
this afternoon and into this evening.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across the Trans
Pecos and into West Texas with 1500 to 2000 J/kg MLCAPE. Some
convection has formed along the higher terrain from southeast New
Mexico to the Davis Mountains in Texas. A belt of slightly stronger
mid-level flow will overspread this region through the late
afternoon and into the evening, with RAP forecast soundings
indicating 35 to 40 knots of effective shear where southerly or
southeasterly flow remains by 23Z to 00Z. Therefore, a few
supercells are possible with a threat for large hail and severe wind
gusts. 

Large-scale forcing is mostly moving away from the region, so storm
coverage will likely remain isolated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1075
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado and western Kansas into far
southwest Nebraska.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 021947Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected this afternoon with a primary
threat of severe wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...A gradient of instability exists across the central
High Plains with dewpoints in the 40s near the Front Range and in
the upper 60s across southwest Kansas. SPC mesoanalysis shows a
weakly unstable, but uncapped environment across southeast Colorado
where cold air associated with the upper low has started to move
east of the terrain. As heating continues and temperatures continue
to cool aloft, expect an uncapped environment across much of eastern
Colorado and western Kansas. In addition, ascent will increase as
the trough advances east. 

Therefore, expect a gradual increase in convective coverage across
northeast New Mexico and eastern Colorado this afternoon.
Eventually, these storms should become more intense as they move
toward greater instability. Some large hail is possible initially,
however, severe wind gusts will be preferred. Very steep lapse rates
will support the potential for some significant severe wind gusts of
80-90 mph this evening (in western Kansas), particularly where any
bowing line segments can develop. 

A watch will likely be needed later this afternoon for the threat
from these storms, and storms which will likely move into southwest
Kansas from watch 353.

Mesoscale Discussion 1074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into
western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 021914Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon, posing
a threat primarily for severe wind gusts and large hail.

DISCUSSION...Congested Cu are present in visible satellite imagery
across southeastern Wyoming, especially along the higher terrain in
advance of a slowly-southward-sagging cold front. A surface low is
developing in northeastern Colorado, promoting backing southeasterly
low-level flow and some moisture advection into the area. Limited
upper-level cloudiness has supported temperatures rising into the
mid-/upper-70s across the area, likely yielding minimal convective
inhibition in the short term.

As the cold front continues to move southward and a mid-level wave
impinges on the region, scattered thunderstorm development appears
likely in the next couple hours. 12z HREF guidance depicts multiple
stronger updrafts developing off the Laramie Mountains and moving
east into a well-mixed and unstable airmass. Amidst modest bulk
shear values (~30-35 kts) and relatively straight shear profiles,
some splitting supercells and mixed-mode storms are possible. The
primary threats should be large hail and local severe wind gusts
with the stronger cores, especially as they mature in the Nebraska
Panhandle.

Additional thunderstorms are expected in western Nebraska and points
eastward as storms erupt along the cold front later this
afternoon/evening. Trends will continue to be monitored in that
region for possible MCD/watch issuance there.

    mph likely
  Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A few thunderstorm clusters are forecast to move into the
Watch area this afternoon and persist into the evening.  Strong
buoyancy and large surface temperature and dewpoint spreads will
favor efficient thunderstorm downdrafts capable of severe gusts. 
Large hail may accompany the stronger thunderstorm cores this
afternoon into the early evening before thunderstorm outflow becomes
more prevalent.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles west northwest
of Mccook NE to 45 miles west of Liberal KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 353...WW 354...WW 355...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
22035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1064

0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central into southeast Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352...

Valid 012037Z - 012200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk of large hail and severe wind gusts continues
across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352.

DISCUSSION...A couple semi-discrete supercells continue to track
southeastward along the stationary boundary from central into
southeast TX -- along the east/southeastern periphery of around 2500
J/kg MLCAPE. While these storms are generally becoming removed from
this stronger instability, they will still pose a risk of isolated
large hail and locally severe gusts in the near term. To their
northwest, fresh updrafts are evolving along the stationary boundary
near Waco TX. Given that these evolving storms will track
southeastward through the strongest instability amid 40 kt of
effective shear, gradual intensification into semi-discrete
supercells is also possible -- posing a risk of large to very large
hail and severe wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central North Carolina and far
northern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011913Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue
developing/advancing eastward across western/central NC and far
northern SC through the afternoon. The strongest storms will be
capable of producing locally damaging wind gusts and marginally
severe hail. The severe threat is expected to remain too isolated
for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Along the southern periphery of a large-scale trough
over the Northeast, VWP data and earlier 12Z soundings sampled a
belt of 40-50 kt midlevel westerly flow across NC. Here,
differential heating along a weak E/W-oriented surface boundary is
supporting isolated to widely scattered showers, which should
continue to deepening into thunderstorms -- given sufficient (albeit
weak) surface-based instability. The moderate/strong westerly flow
aloft is yielding elongated/mostly straight hodographs (around 40 kt
of effective shear), which could promote localized convective
organization into small clusters capable of locally damaging wind
gusts and perhaps marginally severe hail. Current thinking is that
the overall severe threat will remain too isolated for a watch,
though convective trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1062
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...central Colorado and north-central New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011853Z - 012130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to develop through the
afternoon. Instability will support at least some potential for hail
and gusty thunderstorm outflows. However, the lack of stronger
deep-layer shear should limit the overall severe threat to being
more transient in nature. A watch is not likely.

DISCUSSION...Terrain-driven low-level convergence has resulted in
the development of convection across the higher terrain of central
Colorado and north-central New Mexico. To the east of the higher
terrain, surface dewpoints in the 50s coupled with diurnal heating
has resulted in a corridor of MUCAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg, with
the higher values tied to higher surface moisture. Despite
sufficient instability for storm maintenance, deep-layer shear is
weak, with effective-layer shear generally less than 20 knots should
limit the ability for updraft organization. The result should be
updrafts initially tied to the terrain, where low-level convergence
will force ascent. Isolated hail and perhaps a strong wind gust or
two may be possible with these terrain-driven storms.

With time, aggregate cold pools may move off the terrain and into
the high-elevation plains adjacent to the mountains allowing for
additional thunderstorm development. Here, continued heating will
allow most-unstable CAPE to continue to increase until convective
cloud debris overspreads the area reducing insolation. However,
MUCAPE around 2000-2500 J/kg will remain possible. Forecast
soundings indicated that some increase in effective-layer shear, but
still generally below 30 knots. This may allow for some
conglomeration of updrafts and at least transient multi-cell
clusters capable of producing large hail and a strong wind gust or
two.

Given the anticipated isolated/transient nature of any organized
severe threat (should it develop) a watch is not anticipated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.
