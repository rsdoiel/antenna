Areas affected...Far Northern CA...Southern/Eastern OR

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 102050Z - 102315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated hail and/or damaging gusts are possible from far
northern CA into southern and eastern OR this afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite imagery shows increasing coverage of
deep cumulus across the higher terrain of far northeast CA and
south-central OR, with several instances of convective initiation.
Some additional increase in storm coverage is anticipated as
southwesterly flow and large-scale ascent gradually strengthen.
Isolated hail could occur with this early-stage cellular convection.
A deeply mixed airmass exists downstream, and the general
expectation is for damaging gusts as the storms become more outflow
dominant as they move off the terrain over the next few hours.

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 11

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation shows Barbara quickly
spinning down.  Deep convection associated with the cyclone has
diminished considerably during the past few hours and has revealed
an exposed surface circulation well to the northeast of a 
mid-level center.  The initial intensity is once again lowered, to 
35 kt, and is based on a blend of the various subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates.

Based on current convective trends and the global models, Barbara 
should become a remnant low later tonight while it continues moving 
over cooler waters and into a harsh atmospheric environment. 
 
Barbara has been moving to the right of track within the peripheral
steering flow of the low- to mid-level high anchored over central
Mexico.  Consequently, the initial motion is estimated to be
northward or 010/7 kt.  Barbara should continue this general motion
through dissipation on Wednesday.  The official track forecast
is adjusted to the right of the previous advisory and lies close to 
the ECMWF and TVCE consensus models.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 10

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM PDT Tue Jun 10 2025
 
Although Cosme's low-level center is obscured by high-level cirrus, 
it does appear to be displaced a bit to the northeast of the 
remaining deep convection.  Satellite intensity estimates have 
continued to decrease, with objective numbers ranging between 35-45 
kt, and subjective Dvorak CI numbers between 45-55 kt.  The advisory 
intensity is set at 45 kt based on a blend of these numbers.  An 
earlier ASCAT pass showed winds just over 40 kt in the southwestern 
quadrant, but the southeastern quadrant, where there could be 
stronger winds, was not sampled.

ASCAT and recent visible imagery suggest Cosme's center is a little 
west of where it was placed this morning.  Still, the storm has 
turned north-northwestward with an initial motion of 330/3 kt.  
Cosme is expected to turn northward and then northeastward and 
speed up a bit through Wednesday, before turning back to the 
north-northwest on Thursday.  This track will take Cosme over 
progressively cooler waters and into a drier, more stable 
environment.  Combined with moderate-to-strong northeasterly shear, 
these conditions should cause quick weakening, and GFS- and 
ECWMF-based simulated satellite images suggest that Cosme will lose 
its deep convection overnight.  As a result, the NHC official 
forecast shows Cosme becoming a remnant low within 24 hours, with 
dissipation now expected by 60 hours.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was 
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 108.1 West.  Barbara is 
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and Barbara is 
expected to become a remnant low tonight and dissipate on
Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as the southernmost
portions of Baja California Sur through today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Valid 102000Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHEAST NM AND FAR WEST INTO CENTRAL TX...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected to develop this afternoon and evening
across parts of far southeast New Mexico, far West Texas and the Rio
Grande Valley. Marginally severe storms will be possible from parts
of the southern Plains eastward into the lower Mississippi Valley,
along parts of the Atlantic Coastal states, in northern
California/southern Oregon and in parts of the northern Rockies.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast largely remains on track with only minor
adjustments needed to account for recent convective trends. The
greatest severe threat remains focused across southwest Texas where
a few supercells continue to mature. Recent MRMS MESH estimates
suggest hail between 1.5 to 2.5 inches may be ongoing with a couple
of these cells, and the environment should remain supportive of
significant hail through early evening prior to upscale growth into
one or more propagating clusters. Additional attempts at initiation
are noted in satellite imagery along the upper Rio Grande Valley,
which should support increasing storm coverage and foster the
anticipated upscale growth. See the previous discussion below for
additional forecast details.

..Moore.. 06/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025/

...Central/East/Southeast TX...
Recent satellite/radar imagery shows a decaying MCS across central
TX. The airmass downstream across east/southeast TX is very moist,
with dewpoints in the 70s, which will support strong buoyancy amid
continued daytime, with MLCAPE likely over 2500 J/kg. However,
vertical shear is weak and the general expectation is for the
strength of the MCS to remain modest, with only limited re
intensification anticipated. Any reintensification appears most
likely along the northern portion of the MCS, where interaction with
a warm-front-like boundary demarcating more tropical air is likely.
This may lead to some forward propagation and an increased potential
for a few locally stronger gusts.

...Southeast NM/Far West into Central TX This Afternoon/Evening... 
Easterly/southeasterly winds are expected to result in notable
low-level moisture advection into the region throughout the day.
This increased low-level moisture beneath steep mid-level lapse
rates will support moderate to strong airmass destabilization amid
daytime heating this afternoon. Low-level convergence and orographic
ascent coupled with strengthening large-scale lift ahead of an
approaching shortwave trough will foster severe thunderstorm
development this afternoon across southeast NM and far west TX.
Large to very large hail (3"+ in diameter) is the primary risk with
the more cellular, early stage development. Upscale growth is then
expected, with the resulting convective line progressing
southeastward into the Edwards Plateau/central TX vicinity. The hail
threat will persist, but strong wind gusts will become the primary
risk once the linear mode dominates.

...Central Portions of the Southeast into Mid-Atlantic...
Recent surface analysis places a weak trough from northern MS
eastward through northern GA then northeastward across the Carolina
Piedmont to a low over the Chesapeake Bay vicinity. This boundary
will provide the impetus for scattered thunderstorm development as
it gradually shifts southeastward as a more cold-front-like feature
later this afternoon and evening. The downstream airmass will be
moderately to strongly buoyant, but shear will be weak, leading to a
predominantly disorganized multicellular mode. A few strong
downbursts are possible as storms collapse and/or briefly surge as
bowing line segments.  

...Eastern FL Peninsula...
Full daytime heating and dewpoints in the 70s will yield strong
instability later this afternoon along the northeast and
east-central FL peninsula, supporting scattered thunderstorm
development. Weak but sufficient deep-layer shear and steep
low-level lapse rates could result in locally damaging wind gusts in
the strongest cells.

...New England...
Recent surface analysis places a cold front from eastern Lake Erie
southwestward through far western NY and PA, well to the west of the
warm conveyor showers and thunderstorms currently ongoing across
much of New England. Modest destabilization is anticipated ahead of
the cold front, with scattered thunderstorm development anticipated
along this boundary as it moves eastward this afternoon. Buoyancy
will be modest, but strong mid-level flow and resulting strong shear
should still support organized storm structures this
afternoon/evening. Some isolated hail and/or damaging gusts are
possible within the strongest updrafts.

...Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies...
Upper ridging will continue to dampen across the region while
mid-level southwesterly/westerly flow aloft gradually strengthens
ahead of an approaching low-amplitude shortwave trough. Orographic
effects coupled with increasing mid-level moisture and modest
large-scale ascent will support thunderstorms over the higher
terrain, with some of these storms tracking eastward/northeastward
into lower elevation areas. Greater lower elevation destabilization
is anticipated the southern/southeast OR vicinity and the lee of
northern Rockies in western/central MT. Damaging gusts are possible
later this afternoon/evening as high-based storms moved into these
regions. Some isolated hail may occur as well.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE UPPER
MIDWEST AND NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS AS WELL AS TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered strong to severe storms are expected Thursday
across parts of the central to northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Isolated strong to severe storms may also occur over parts of Texas.

...North/central High Plains to Upper Midwest...
Scattered storms are expected to ongoing Thursday morning from the
eastern Dakotas into Minnesota and Wisconsin, in areas along/north
of a warm front. Limited severe potential is expected with the
storms. Into peak heating, stronger/deeper convective development is
expected near a weak surface wave/cold front extending from eastern
South Dakota and southern Minnesota west-southeastward across
Nebraska, and in vicinity of the north/south-oriented dryline/lee
trough across the central High Plains. Strong heating and moderate
instability will support scattered severe storms capable of wind and
hail. Vertical shear is not forecast to be very strong, but will
support slow-moving cells or convective clusters.

...Southern Plains...
While specific predictability is limited into the Day 3 time frame,
largely owing to prior day convection and outflows, moderate to
strong instability will again support scattered storms regionally.
This should especially be the case across much of central and
eastern Texas, with locally strong outflows and periodic pulse hail
possible during the heat of the day within a modest vertical shear
environment.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Northwest...
Scattered thunderstorms are likely to be ongoing from late
D1/Tuesday into D2/Wednesday over parts of the southern Cascades and
northern Great Basin. Lightning may interact with areas of modestly
receptive fuels as these storms shift eastward through the day.
However, these storms are likely of the wetter variety given high
PWAT values near 1 inch and the potential for wetting rainfall.
Still, some modest ignition potential likely exists across
southern/southeastern OR, northern NV and southwestern ID. See the
previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 06/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025/

...Synopsis...
Mainly zonal flow will overspread the northern CONUS, with multiple
embedded impulses expected to progress within this zonal flow
tomorrow (Wednesday). As the impulse responsible for providing upper
support for Day 1 fire weather concerns approaches the Plains, a
deeper trough will impinge on the West Coast. As such, dry downslope
will occur over a broader area encompassing the lee of the Cascades.
15-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds will coincide with 15-20
percent RH for several areas on a widespread basis. Given the
presence of dry fuels, Elevated highlights are warranted.

Widespread 15-25 mph sustained westerly winds, along with 15-20
percent RH, should overspread much of the Great Basin for several
hours on Wednesday. Elevated highlights have been added to northern
Nevada into northern Utah, where fuels appear most receptive to
wildfire spread.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 406
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
145 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  Far West int West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 145 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours as the airmass continues to destabilize. Steep
mid-level lapse rates and moderate deep-layer shear will support
supercells, with large to very large hail as the primary hazard.
Over time, upscale growth into a convective line is possible, with
this line then progressing southeastward into more of west Texas.
Damaging gusts are the primary risk once this linear transition
occurs.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 110
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles northeast of
Carlsbad NM to 70 miles southwest of Dryden TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

...Mosier

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1246 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS TEXAS
INTO LOUISIANA...THE UPPER MIDWEST/CORN BELT...AND NORTHERN
ROCKIES/HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible Wednesday over parts of
the Northern Rockies and northern High Plains, the Upper
Midwest/Corn Belt, as well as Texas to western Louisiana.

...Central to southern Texas...
Ahead of a weak mid-level trough, moderate instability should
develop over much of central into eastern/southern Texas with a
moist surface air mass beneath seasonably cool mid-level
temperatures. However, specifics are complicated by the potential of
lingering early-day convection and outflows. Some guidance would
suggest that convection/MCV-related enhancement to the flow field
may occur and linger much of the day, a scenario in which a Slight
Risk could be warranted into the Day 1 time frame pending corridors
of more certain destabilization across central/east Texas. This flow
enhancement could influence the potential for supercells and
possibly a tornado risk within a moist environment. Scattered
storms, including some clusters, can otherwise be expected with hail
and wind possible.

...Upper Midwest/Corn Belt...
A west/east-oriented stationary front will exist across this region,
with strong heating aiding moderate to locally strong
destabilization along and south of the boundary. The glancing
influence of a shortwave trough may contribute to storm development
as the boundary layer otherwise destabilizes Wednesday afternoon.
Effective shear of 30-35 kt should generally exist near the front,
potentially allowing for a few supercells and more prevalent
multicells. Scattered storms producing hail/damaging wind appear
most probable during the late afternoon and evening, progressing
eastward out of Iowa toward the Illinois/Wisconsin border vicinity.
A relatively narrow/confined Slight Risk could ultimately be
warranted in the Day 1 time frame.

...Northern Rockies to Northern High Plains...
Storms are expected to develop relatively early in the day from
eastern Oregon across Idaho as a shortwave trough moves over the
region. Scattered storms will develop and spread quickly eastward
into parts of Wyoming and Montana, with areas of strong outflow
expected. Scattered severe gusts may occur. Overall deep-layer shear
appears most favorable from southern Idaho into western Wyoming,
resulting in a few cells capable of hail as well as strong wind
gusts. Additional severe storm development is expected by Wednesday
late afternoon/early evening into the northern High Plains including
near/east of the Big Horns.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...Southwest...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are likely over parts of the
Southwest in AZ/NM this afternoon with a subtle upper trough beneath
the ridge. PWATS of 0.75-1 inches, slow storm speeds and scattered
storm coverage will encourage a wetter storm mode despite a
relatively dry sub-cloud layer. Still, lighting and occasional drier
storms, with low-end dry thunder potential, will remain possible
along the periphery across southwestern NM and eastern AZ where
fuels are slightly drier.

...Elsewhere...
Otherwise, locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible in
the lee of the Sierra, but area fuels have been tempered by recent
light precipitation. No other changes were made, the prior forecast
remains valid with no changes.

..Lyons.. 06/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject into the Atlantic as upper ridging
overspreads the Plains and a second trough impinges on the Pacific
Northwest today. Upper support associated with the West Coast trough
will encourage dry downslope flow to the immediate lee of the
Cascades. 15-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds amid 15-20
percent RH by afternoon peak heating, atop dry fuels, warrants the
continuation of Elevated highlights.

The passage of the mid-level trough will also encourage thunderstorm
development across southern Oregon. A mix of wet and dry
thunderstorms are possible, though the lack of very dry fuels
precludes isolated dry thunderstorm highlights this outlook.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Valid 101630Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHEAST NM AND FAR WEST INTO CENTRAL TX...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected to develop this afternoon and evening
across parts of far southeast New Mexico, far West Texas and the Rio
Grande Valley. Marginally severe storms will be possible from parts
of the southern Plains eastward into the lower Mississippi Valley,
along parts of the Atlantic Coastal states, in northern
California/southern Oregon and in parts of the northern Rockies.

...Central/East/Southeast TX...
Recent satellite/radar imagery shows a decaying MCS across central
TX. The airmass downstream across east/southeast TX is very moist,
with dewpoints in the 70s, which will support strong buoyancy amid
continued daytime, with MLCAPE likely over 2500 J/kg. However,
vertical shear is weak and the general expectation is for the
strength of the MCS to remain modest, with only limited re
intensification anticipated. Any reintensification appears most
likely along the northern portion of the MCS, where interaction with
a warm-front-like boundary demarcating more tropical air is likely.
This may lead to some forward propagation and an increased potential
for a few locally stronger gusts.

...Southeast NM/Far West into Central TX This Afternoon/Evening... 
Easterly/southeasterly winds are expected to result in notable
low-level moisture advection into the region throughout the day.
This increased low-level moisture beneath steep mid-level lapse
rates will support moderate to strong airmass destabilization amid
daytime heating this afternoon. Low-level convergence and orographic
ascent coupled with strengthening large-scale lift ahead of an
approaching shortwave trough will foster severe thunderstorm
development this afternoon across southeast NM and far west TX.
Large to very large hail (3"+ in diameter) is the primary risk with
the more cellular, early stage development. Upscale growth is then
expected, with the resulting convective line progressing
southeastward into the Edwards Plateau/central TX vicinity. The hail
threat will persist, but strong wind gusts will become the primary
risk once the linear mode dominates.

...Central Portions of the Southeast into Mid-Atlantic...
Recent surface analysis places a weak trough from northern MS
eastward through northern GA then northeastward across the Carolina
Piedmont to a low over the Chesapeake Bay vicinity. This boundary
will provide the impetus for scattered thunderstorm development as
it gradually shifts southeastward as a more cold-front-like feature
later this afternoon and evening. The downstream airmass will be
moderately to strongly buoyant, but shear will be weak, leading to a
predominantly disorganized multicellular mode. A few strong
downbursts are possible as storms collapse and/or briefly surge as
bowing line segments.  

...Eastern FL Peninsula...
Full daytime heating and dewpoints in the 70s will yield strong
instability later this afternoon along the northeast and
east-central FL peninsula, supporting scattered thunderstorm
development. Weak but sufficient deep-layer shear and steep
low-level lapse rates could result in locally damaging wind gusts in
the strongest cells.

...New England...
Recent surface analysis places a cold front from eastern Lake Erie
southwestward through far western NY and PA, well to the west of the
warm conveyor showers and thunderstorms currently ongoing across
much of New England. Modest destabilization is anticipated ahead of
the cold front, with scattered thunderstorm development anticipated
along this boundary as it moves eastward this afternoon. Buoyancy
will be modest, but strong mid-level flow and resulting strong shear
should still support organized storm structures this
afternoon/evening. Some isolated hail and/or damaging gusts are
possible within the strongest updrafts.

...Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies...
Upper ridging will continue to dampen across the region while
mid-level southwesterly/westerly flow aloft gradually strengthens
ahead of an approaching low-amplitude shortwave trough. Orographic
effects coupled with increasing mid-level moisture and modest
large-scale ascent will support thunderstorms over the higher
terrain, with some of these storms tracking eastward/northeastward
into lower elevation areas. Greater lower elevation destabilization
is anticipated the southern/southeast OR vicinity and the lee of
northern Rockies in western/central MT. Damaging gusts are possible
later this afternoon/evening as high-based storms moved into these
regions. Some isolated hail may occur as well.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0717 AM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHEAST NM AND SOUTHWEST TX...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected to develop this afternoon and evening
across parts of far southeast New Mexico, far West Texas and the Rio
Grande Valley. Marginally severe storms will be possible from parts
of the southern Plains eastward into the lower Mississippi Valley,
along parts of the Atlantic Coastal states, in northern
California/southern Oregon and in parts of the northern Rockies.

...Central/East TX This Morning...
Morning satellite/radar loops show a large linear MCS tracking
slowly eastward across west-central TX.  This line of storms has
been primarily non-severe for the past few hours, but with gusty
winds along the leading edge.  Overnight CAM solutions suggest the
MCS will continue to slowly weaken this morning, but a residual MCV
may continue to track eastward this afternoon into east TX and
central LA.  Ample low level moisture and CAPE will support
re-development of a few strong storms.  The current forecast
scenario is for this activity to be weakly organized this afternoon.
 However, if re-intensification of this MCS can occur, a SLGT risk
area may be needed in east TX/central LA in later outlook updates.

...Southeast NM/Southwest TX This Afternoon/Evening...
The outflow boundary associated with the aforementioned MCS is
sagging southward across southwest TX.  Southeasterly low-level
winds behind the outflow boundary, coupled with afternoon heating,
is expected to draw ample low-level moisture westward by late
afternoon.  This will result in scattered intense thunderstorms over
the Davis mountains and vicinity.  Storms will build southeastward
through the evening with a risk of very large hail and damaging wind
gusts.

...Coastal GA/SC...
Another remnant MCS is tracking across southern GA.  A few hours of
daytime heating ahead of this activity could lead to intensification
by late morning, with a risk of strong wind gusts.

...Eastern FL Peninsula...
Full daytime heating and dewpoints in the 70s will yield strong
instability later this afternoon along the northeast and
east-central FL peninsula - leading to scattered thunderstorm
development.  Weak but sufficient deep-layer shear and steep
low-level lapse rates could result in locally damaging wind gusts in
the strongest cells.

...NY/New England...
A surface cold front will sweep eastward across NY today. 
Thunderstorms are expected to form along the front by mid-afternoon
over eastern Quebec and develop southward into central NY.  A moist
and unstable air mass is expected to be in place over the
Hudson/Champlain Valleys, aiding a few strong storms capable of
gusty winds and hail.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 AM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Valid 131200Z - 181200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Models are in good agreement with the overall pattern through about
Sunday/D6, depicting upper ridging over the northern Plains and
rising heights across the Northeast and general troughiness over the
Northwest. During that same period, the disturbance over the
southern Plains is forecast to lift toward the mid MS Valley with
weakening trend.

The greatest risk of severe storms will generally stretch from the
northern Rockies into the northern Plains, as weak but backed
low-level winds maintain a moist plume out of the central Plains and
into MT and the Dakotas. 

On Friday/D4, scattered strong storms may occur over central MT,
beneath modest southwest winds aloft and with around 1000 J/kg
MUCAPE. Instability will build further in the Saturday/D5 to
Sunday/D6 time frame, with greater storm coverage expected. However,
winds aloft will be marginal. Still, developing west to northwest
flow aloft could eventually result in an MCS pattern with attendant
wind potential. Predictability is low at this time, but the northern
and central Plains region will be monitored over the next several
days for potential categorical risk outlines.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 8

date: 2025-06-10, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>812 
WTPZ43 KNHC 100850
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

The convective appearance of Cosme has changed little since the 
previous advisory.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 54-59 kt.  The initial 
intensity is held at 60 kt for this advisory, based on a blend of 
the intensity estimates.

Cosme continues to move very slowly toward the northwest, with 
motion estimated at 300/4 kt. A slow motion, perhaps more toward 
the north, should continue for at least the next 12 h since the 
overall steering currents are weak, due to Barbara's current 
position in relation to Cosme.  However, as Barbara weakens, Cosme 
will accelerate north-northeastward in response to ridging located 
to the northwest of the cyclone. Very little change has been made 
to the NHC track forecast, and the latest forecast is near the 
various consensus models.

Cosme is forecast to remain in favorable enough conditions for the 
next 24 h such that the cyclone might be able to maintain its 
intensity or only weaken very slowly.  However, after that time, as 
Cosme gains latitude, it will encounter cooler water and drier air. 
Cosme is forecast to lose its convection and become post-tropical on 
Wednesday, in agreement with the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery products.  The post-tropical low is then forecast to 
gradually weaken and dissipate by 72 h.  The NHC intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous one, and is near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 9

TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

Barbara has lost a significant portion of its convection over the 
past 12 hours or so.  The latest current intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB are still in the 55-65 kt range, but the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 45-55 kt 
range.  Based on the degraded convective appearance on geostationary 
satellite imagery and the latest intensity estimates, the initial 
intensity is set to 50 kt.

Barbara has been moving toward the northwest a little slower than 
before, or 310/7 kt.  Barbara is forecast to continue moving 
generally toward the northwest as it is steered by weak ridging to 
its north and Tropical Storm Cosme, located to its southwest.  Only 
very minor adjustments have been made to the previous NHC track 
forecast, which lies near the various consensus models.

The storm already has crossed the 26C isotherm and will continue 
moving over progressively colder water over the next day.  The cold 
water will cause Barbara to continue weakening.  The NHC intensity 
forecast shows a slightly faster rate of weakening than the previous 
official forecast, and is near the latest intensity model consensus. 
 The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite products both show the 
cyclone losing its convection entirely by about 24 hours, with 
dissipation in 36 hours.  The NHC forecast follows the scenario 
depicted by those models.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 108.1 West. Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Barbara is 
expected to dissipate by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as the southernmost
portions of Baja California through today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

0351 PM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Areas affected...eastern Ohio...western Pennsylvania...far West
Virginia...far southwestern New York

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 401...

Valid 092051Z - 092145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 401
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe threat continues within WW401.

DISCUSSION...Several broken segments of multi-cell clusters continue
across WW401. A few instances of wind damage have been reported
across northern PA and southern OH. A few cells have initiated out
head of the main clusters but have struggle to maintain intensity.
Ahead of the line, temperatures continue to warm, with MLCAPE around
500 J/kg slowly advecting northward across New York state. As
forcing for ascent continues to increase with the approaching wave,
thunderstorm coverage will continue to increase. Damaging wind and
severe hail continue to be a possibility with stronger cells.

  1000 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase across the
region this afternoon and evening, with multiple rounds of storms
possible. Bowing line segments capable of damaging gusts are the
primary risk, but isolated hail may occur as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles east northeast
of Jamestown NY to 35 miles south southeast of Parkersburg WV. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline

## Hurricane Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 7

<pre>394 
WTPZ42 KNHC 092032
TCDEP2
 
Hurricane Barbara Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Since the last advisory Barbara has become a little less organized. 
Latest GOES satellite imagery depicts the system starting to ingest 
some drier air which has caused fragmented banding. However, a 
central dense overcast has remained over the tiny inner core. The 
satellite intensity estimates have decreased slightly from the 
previous advisory ranging from 50 to 65 kt. Using these estimates, 
the intensity is held at 65 kt, although this may be generous.

A mid-level ridge located over Mexico should continue to steer the 
system northwestward over the next couple of days. As Barbara begins 
to weaken into a shallow vortex and slow down, it will be steered by 
the low-level wind flow. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to 
the previous one, and close to the simple and corrected consensus.
 
Barbara likely has peaked as a short-lived hurricane. The 
environmental conditions will becoming increasingly hostile along 
the forecast track with the storm crossing into cooler SSTs and into 
a drier, more stable air mass. This will cause the system to 
steadily weaken, lose convective organization, and become post 
tropical by 36 h. The latest NHC forecast shows the system opening 
into a trough by 60 h and dissipating.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Barbara was
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 106.8 West. Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue for the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. A weakening trend should begin tonight, and the system is 
forecast to become a remnant low by Wednesday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely along coastal areas of southwestern
Mexico tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 6

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Cosme continues to intensify and is nearing hurricane strength.
Visible satellite images show that the convective bands have
consolidated near the center, and there is some evidence of a
partial inner core. A blend of the latest objective and subjective
satellite intensity estimates support increasing the initial
intensity to 60 kt. A partial ASCAT pass indicates that the
wind field of Cosme is quite compact, and the initial wind radii
have been updated based on that data.
 
Some additional strengthening is possible in the short term, and
Cosme could become a hurricane tonight while it remains in 
generally conducive environmental conditions. However, the 
combination of decreasing SSTs and intrusions of dry/stable air
should end the strengthening trend by early Tuesday and then cause a
quick weakening. Simulated satellite images from the GFS and ECMWF
models show deep convection vanishing by Wednesday, and based on
that guidance, the transition to a remnant low has been moved up to
48 hours. Dissipation is likely to occur in 3 to 4 days.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at 8 kt, and this general motion
should continue through tonight. After that time, a turn to the
north or north-northeast is expected as Cosme moves toward a
weakness left behind by Hurricane Barbara to its northeast.  The
NHC track forecast is in fair agreement with the consensus aids.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cosme was
located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 113.9 West. Cosme is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue through tonight. A turn
toward the north with a decease in forward speed is expected by
early Tuesday, followed by a faster north-northeast motion late
Tuesday through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast, and
Cosme could become a hurricane tonight. Rapid weakening is expected 
late Tuesday and Wednesday. Cosme will likely become a 
post-tropical low in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-06-09, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPZ42 KNHC 090846
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Barbara has become a bit better organized over the past 6 hours 
with a large central dense overcast and an increasing area of 
cloud tops in the -75C to -85C range.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 46-68 kt.  
Based on the improved banding and cold cloud tops, as well as the 
persistence of this organization, the initial intensity is 
increased to 60 kt for this advisory.

There is some uncertainty in the initial position since there have 
been no recent available microwave passes, but the best motion 
estimate is west-northwestward, or 295 degrees at 10 kt.  The 
global models show a strong 500 mb ridge to the north of Barbara, 
which should help maintain Barbara on a general path toward the 
west-northwest for the next few days.  The GFS model continues 
to be the fastest and farthest left model.  The GFS appears to 
have a more realistic solution compared to the ECMWF, and was 
stronger at the initialization time.  The new NHC forecast is 
slightly faster and a bit to the left of the previous official 
forecast and is in fairly good agreement with an average of the 
simple and corrected consensus models.

Barbara only has about 12 more hours to strengthen before it starts 
moving into cooler waters.  This should be enough time for Barbara 
to strengthen to a hurricane.  The cooler water should cause 
weakening to begin tonight or on Tuesday.  The dynamical hurricane 
models and global models all show Barbara weakening below tropical 
storm strength by 48 hours, and the cyclone is likely to lose its 
convection and become a remnant low around that time.  The new NHC 
forecast shows a faster weakening and quicker dissipation than the 
previous official forecast since the dynamical guidance is now in 
good agreement on this scenario.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 4

WTPZ43 KNHC 090846
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Cosme has continued to gradually 
improve since the previous advisory, with sustained deep convection 
holding over the low-level center. A timely 09/0524Z ASCAT pass 
helped with the initial intensity and 34 kt wind radii estimates, 
with several wind barbs showing 40 to 45 knot winds. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 
knots and T2.5/35 knots respectively. Meanwhile, the objective 
Dvorak satellite estimates range from 40 to 50 knots. The initial 
intensity has been adjusted up to 45 knots with this advisory 
package, in line with the most recent ASCAT pass.

Cosme is moving toward west-northwest at 8 kt. This general motion 
is expected to continue during the next 24 hours to the south of a 
mid-level ridge, with a gradual slowing in forward speed. Tonight 
and Tuesday Barbara is forecast to erode the mid-level ridge to the 
north of Cosme, resulting in a further slowing in motion and a shift 
to the north. An increase in forward speed and a motion to the 
north-northeast is expected Tuesday night, with Cosme forecast to 
become a post-tropical remnant low on Wednesday. The latest track 
forecast is very close to that of the previous advisory and is 
generally a blend of the consensus guidance.

Environmental conditions continue to look conducive for 
strengthening of Cosme during the next 24 hours or so. Vertical wind 
shear will lighten up some while the system passes over 27/28C water 
with abundant deep layer moisture. The intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous advisory, bringing Cosme close to hurricane strength 
late today or tonight. Beyond 24 hours, vertical wind shear is 
forecast to increase and mid-level moisture is forecast to decrease, 
which should lead to a gradual weakening of Cosme. A more rapid 
weakening is then expected by Wednesday as the system moves over 
much cooler water, with Cosme expected to dissipate by 96 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1205
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Colorado and New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082050Z - 082245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development has been ongoing across the
Front Range in Colorado and across northeastern New Mexico. The air
mass across Colorado remains under the influence of MLCIN, with
temperatures cooling with northern extend behind the surface cold
front. Moisture is also somewhat limited, with dew points in the
upper 40s to 50s. A few instances of severe hail will be possible.

Across eastern New Mexico near the dryline, a gradient of more
appreciable MLCAPE 500-1500 j/kg is in place along with deep layer
shear around 30-45 kts. Temperatures are in the mid 70s to 80s amid
dew points in the 50s to upper 60s. This may support some instances
of severe wind and hail, with at least one supercell noted on radar.
Trends will be monitored for watch potential, but it appears
unlikely at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1204
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northern/central VA and MD

Concerning...Tornado Watch 392...

Valid 082031Z - 082200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 392 continues.

SUMMARY...A risk for tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will persist
into early evening across northern/central Virginia, and portions of
Maryland.

DISCUSSION...Isolated storms are ongoing closer to a surface
boundary across eastern VA, and further west across the higher
terrain of central VA. These storms will continue to shift east
across a moderately unstable airmass and within 30-40 kt effective
shear. A surface boundary extending from northern VA southeast into
southeast VA will continue to support a corridor of enhanced
low-level shear supporting storm rotation. A couple tornadoes and
damaging gusts will remain possible over the next few hours.

0330 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082030Z - 082230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat may increase through the
afternoon/early evening.

DISCUSSION...Supercells have developed across the Davis Mountains in
far western Texas this afternoon. The environment in this region is
characterized by MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg, steep lapse rates, and
deep layer shear around 40-45 kts. This will support potential for
supercells to produce some instances of large to very large hail and
severe winds. MLCIN does increase with eastward extent, which may
limit coverage/duration of this threat. This area will be monitored
for watch potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwestern and north-central
Texas...southwestern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 082017Z - 082215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail/tornado threat to increase through the
afternoon before a more significant wind threat emerges.

DISCUSSION...Supercell thunderstorms are ongoing across portions of
the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles as of this hour, with at least one
tornado reported in Cimarron/Dallam counties. Additional development
is ongoing west of Amarillo. It is likely some mix of supercell
clusters will advance south and eastward through time, with
potential for additional development to occur ahead of the dryline
in New Mexico.

Low-level shear improves with southward extent into Lubbock where
surface winds are backed southeasterly improving low-level curvature
of hodographs and streamwise vorticity. It is likely that as storms
develop and move southward, the tornado threat will increase through
time even with the shifting storm mode.

A sharp gradient of extreme MLCAPE exists along the Red River near
the Texas/Oklahoma border into north-central Texas amid steep low to
mid-level lapse rates. As upscale growth increases, the potential
will rapidly increase for destructive winds (80-100 mph). A Tornado
or PDS Severe Watch is likely needed to cover this potential.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest Oklahoma
  Western North Texas and Low Rolling Plains

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 400 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

...THIS IS A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION...

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and scattered significant gusts to 105
    mph likely
  Widespread large hail likely with isolated very large hail
    events to 5 inches in diameter possible
  A few tornadoes likely

SUMMARY...Increasing intense severe storm development is expected
through late afternoon into evening. This will include initial
supercells capable of very large hail with a tornado risk, but a
prominent potential for widespread damaging winds should evolve this
evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles north and south of a line from 10 miles northwest of
Lubbock TX to 40 miles southeast of Chickasha OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update

the eastern semi-circle looks to have slightly disrupted the 
convective organization. Subjective and objective intensity 
estimates range from 45-55 kt this cycle. Using a blend of satellite 
estimates and the latest imagery the intensity is held at 50 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Barbara is currently within a favorable environment with warm SSTs 
and low vertical wind shear. Strengthening is forecast over the next 
day or so, and Barbara is forecast to become a hurricane overnight. 
After 24 h, the system will be moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures below 26C and into a drier mid-level environment. These 
factors will cause the storm to weaken and eventually struggle to 
produce convection. Latest model IR simulated satellite imagery 
shows the system losing convection by 72 h.  This suggests that 
it will become a a post-tropical remnant low by that time and 
likely dissipate  by day 5 although that could occur sooner than 
currently forecast.
 
Barbara is moving west-northwestward at 295/10, steered by 
a mid-level ridge over Mexico, and this motion should continue over 
the next couple of days. The NHC forecast was nudged slightly 
rightward and lies just left of the the simple and corrected 
consensus aids.  Given the forecast track and wind radii, 
tropical-storm-force winds are not expected to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. By Tuesday, the track forecast becomes 
more complicated given the potential interaction between Barbara and 
Cosme. The GFS and ECMWF are on opposite ends of the guidance 
envelope.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 2

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection has been increasing near the center and in curved
bands on the western side of the circulation during the past
several hours. An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago showed peak
winds in the 35-40 kt range, and based on that data, the depression
has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Cosme with the initial
intensity set at 40 kt.
 
Cosme will likely continue to strengthen for the next day or two as
it remains in an environment of low to moderate wind shear, abundant
moisture, and over warm SSTs. The NHC intensity forecast shows a
peak of 60 kt at 24 and 36 hours, and it wouldn't be surprising if
Cosme becomes a hurricane during that time frame. By mid-week,
however, the storm is expected to move over progressively cooler
waters and into a drier airmass, which should cause the system to
begin weakening. Cosme is now forecast to become a remnant low in 3
days and dissipate in 4 days.

The storm is moving northwestward at 7 kt, and that general motion 
is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  After that 
time, the interaction with Barbara will likely result in an initial 
slow down and then turn to the northeast. There is a fair amount of 
spread in the guidance due to the complexity of this interaction.  
The NHC track forecast has been adjusted a little to the right of 
the previous one to account for the initial motion/position and to 
be in better agreement with the latest consensus aids.

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 1

<pre>010 
WTPZ42 KNHC 080840
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized in 
association with an area of low pressure located offshore of 
southwestern Mexico. A small, persistent area of deep convection has 
been observed in satellite images tonight, and recent scatterometer 
data confirm this has led to the formation of a well-defined, closed 
low-level circulation. Therefore, the NHC is starting advisories on 
Tropical Storm Barbara with an initial intensity of 40 kt based on 
the earlier scatterometer winds.

Barbara is currently within a moist and relatively low shear 
environment over warm waters. So, strengthening is expected during 
the next day or so, and this could occur quickly given recent 
satellite trends and the small size of the storm. The official NHC 
forecast shows Barbara becoming a hurricane in 24 h, which is 
supported by HAFS-A/B and the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA). The 
window for strengthening is brief, as Barbara is forecast to move 
over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment by 48 h. 
This should disrupt the convective structure of the storm and result 
in weakening. By day 5, the remnant low of Barbara is forecast to 
either dissipate or become absorbed by the circulation of EP91.

Barbara is moving west-northwestward (295/10 kt) on the south side 
of a mid-level ridge, and this motion should continue over the next 
couple of days. For this time period, the NHC forecast generally 
lies near or between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Given 
the forecast track and wind radii, tropical-storm-force winds 
are not expected to affect the southwestern coast of Mexico. By 
Tuesday, the track forecast becomes more complicated given the 
potential for binary interaction between Barbara and another 
disturbance (EP91) with a high chance of formation. Because of this, 
the long-range track forecast could be subject to larger future 
adjustments depending on the evolution of EP91.
