Mesoscale Discussion 2084
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0342 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Areas affected...The eastern Texas Panhandle into northwest Oklahoma
and southern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 182042Z - 182245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is expected by late
afternoon/early evening across the eastern Texas Panhandle and into
adjacent portions of northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas.
Thunderstorm coverage should remain sufficiently isolated to
preclude watch issuance, but instances of severe hail/wind will be
possible.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery shows deepening cumulus along a
weakly confluent surface trough across the TX Panhandle into
southern KS. The southerly flow regime across the region has helped
offset the influence of diurnal mixing with dewpoints remaining the
low to mid 60s. Concurrently, temperatures are warming into the low
to mid 90s, which is eroding inhibition and supporting MLCAPE
upwards of around 1000 J/kg. Any further improvements to the
thermodynamic environment will be modest through late afternoon,
namely in the form of steepening low-level lapse rates as
temperatures peak in the mid to upper 90s. However, nearly zonal
30-35 knot flow aloft is supporting somewhat elongated mid-level
hodographs with similar effective bulk shear values. This kinematic
environment should support organized convection, including the
potential for a supercell or two with an attendant risk for large
hail (most likely up to 1.0-1.75 inches in diameter) and severe
winds. Based on the aforementioned satellite trends, at least a
couple of storms appear probable, but the fairly weak forcing for
ascent along the surface trough and stronger inhibition downstream
into OK and KS suggests that storm coverage and duration may be
limited. Consequently, watch issuance is unlikely.

Mesoscale Discussion 2083
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Areas affected...parts of eastern South Dakota...adjacent
northeastern Nebraska and southwestern Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181953Z - 182230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of one or two strong storms appears
possible late this afternoon.  Sustained storm development may
include the evolution of supercell structures posing a risk for
severe hail, and perhaps some potential for a tornado by early
evening.  Due to the isolated nature, it is not certain that a
severe weather watch is needed, but trends are being monitored.

DISCUSSION...Although stronger mid-level height falls appear to be
shifting to the north, a destabilizing warm sector boundary layer
across the eastern South Dakota vicinity will remain beneath weakly
difluent cyclonic mid-level flow into early evening.  With
mixed-layer CAPE now on the order of 1500 J/kg, beneath 30-50 kt
southwesterly mid/upper flow, the environment appears at least
conditionally supportive of supercells, and low-level hodographs may
enlarge with clockwise curvature as southerly flow around 850 mb is
forecast to strengthen some (to around 30+ kt) through 22-00Z.

Although low-level forcing for sustained convective development
remains unclear, weak warm advection to the east of the dryline may
be supporting ongoing attempts at deepening convection east of Huron
into the Watertown vicinity.  And objective analysis has indicated a
persistent localized area of enhanced convergence along a confluence
zone near/west of Yankton.

Model output, including the convection allowing guidance, suggest
that probabilities for thunderstorm development are generally low
into early evening.  However, the initiation of one or two storms
appears possible.  If this is sustained, this may include the
evolution of supercell structures posing a risk for severe hail, and
perhaps some potential for a tornado.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Valid 182000Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHEAST NEBRASKA INTO FAR NORTHWEST IOWA...EASTERN SOUTH
DAKOTA...AND WESTERN MINNESOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing severe wind gusts and large hail
are possible today across parts of the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota
into the mid Missouri Valley. A marginal severe threat will also
extend southward into parts of the central and southern Plains.

...20Z Update...
No changes were made to the ongoing forecast. For mesoscale details
concerning eastern South Dakota and vicinity, see MCD 2083.
Additional details can be found in the previous discussion below.

..Wendt.. 09/18/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1118 AM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024/

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest to the Southern High Plains...
A closed upper low centered over eastern MT will continue
northeastward during the period, reaching southeast SK by early
Thursday morning. Upper-level ridging extending northward from the
northwest Gulf Coast into the upper MS Valley will slowly shift
eastward to the Upper Great Lakes. A belt of enhanced southwesterly
mid-level flow will extend from southern CA through the central High
Plains, while also wrapping cyclonically through the eastern Dakotas
and into southern Canada. At the surface, a trough/front extends
southward from central ND into SD and western NE, before continuing
southwestward over the central/southern High Plains. This boundary
may serve as a focus for renewed thunderstorm development later
today.

A band of elevated convection has generally moved northward from
northeast ND and northwest MN into southern MB. In the wake of this
activity, cloud cover remains prevalent across much of the warm
sector across the northern Plains/Upper Midwest. Still, filtered
daytime heating of an adequately moist boundary layer should aid in
the development of around 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE by late
afternoon. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms may form along/east
of the surface trough/front within a favorable zone of 30-40 kt of
effective bulk shear. But, better large-scale forcing associated
with the upper low over the northern High Plains will tend to remain
displaced north and west (in southern Canada). Accordingly, 12Z
high-resolution guidance continues to vary regarding storm coverage
across the Slight Risk (isolated versus scattered) given the weaker
forcing aloft. Even with this continued uncertainty, various NAM/RAP
forecast soundings still suggest a somewhat conditional risk for
organized storms (mix of multicells and supercells). Severe
hail/wind may accompany the stronger storms from late afternoon
through early evening, before this activity eventually weakens.

Further south into the central/southern Plains, low-levels are
forecast to be somewhat drier near the surface trough, with surface
dewpoints expected to mostly range in the upper 50s to low 60s by
late afternoon with pronounced boundary-layer mixing. Warmer
mid-level temperatures and limited large-scale ascent across these
regions should temper the overall intensity of any updrafts that can
form and be sustained, and resultant intensity/coverage of this
convection. Still, some guidance shows locally greater thunderstorm
coverage and resulting isolated severe wind threat from the eastern
TX Panhandle into far northwest OK and southern KS during the late
afternoon/early evening, where low-level lapse rates should be
maximized with robust daytime heating.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...20z Update...
No changes were made to the prior outlook. Gusty post-frontal winds
are possible across parts of the Dakotas, through the Cascade Gaps
and parts of northern CA. However, much of the fuels over these
areas should remain poorly receptive to fire spread following recent
precipitation. See the prior discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 09/18/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024/

...Synopsis...
In the wake of a midlevel low moving northeastward from the northern
Plains into Canada, an expansive surface high will develop across
much of the West. At the same time, a deep midlevel low and strong
deep-layer southwesterly flow will overspread southern CA and the
Lower CO River Valley. Overall, this pattern will limit the overlap
of strong surface winds and warm/dry boundary-layer conditions atop
dry fuels.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Friday.

...Synopsis...
Separate northern-stream and southern-stream mid/upper-level
shortwave troughs are forecast to move across parts of the West on
Friday, with the northern shortwave reaching the northern Great
Plains and Canadian Prairies by Saturday morning. Meanwhile, a stout
midlevel anticyclone (with the warmest 500 mb temperatures near or
slightly above 0C) will remain anchored over Texas. A weakening
mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to move across parts of
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. At the surface, a weakening cold
front will extend somewhere from the south-central Great Plains into
parts of the Midwest/Great Lakes by late afternoon. This front may
tend to stall with time, and potentially move northward as warm
front across the central Plains later Friday night into Saturday
morning. 

A general lack of overlap between favorable moisture/instability and
stronger ascent/deep-layer flow is currently expected to limit
organized severe potential on Friday. Isolated diurnal storm
development will be possible near the weakening front from the
Plains into parts of the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. Elevated storm
development will also be possible Friday night into Saturday morning
across parts of the central Plains, within a warm-advection regime.
It remains uncertain if elevated buoyancy will become sufficient for
any hail potential with the stronger storms within this regime.
High-based convection that may be capable of localized strong gusts
will be possible across parts of the Southwest and southern Rockies,
in association with the southern-stream shortwave trough.

1230 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from mid-afternoon to
mid-evening on Thursday across central/eastern Minnesota, Iowa, and
western Wisconsin. A few tornadoes, isolated very large hail, and
damaging winds may occur.

...Upper Midwest...
A seasonably strong stacked cyclone initially near the ND/SK/MB
border region is forecast to move northeastward through the period.
An attendant cold front will move eastward through the day across
parts of the upper Midwest and central Plains. Diurnal heating of a
rather moist airmass along/east of the front will support a
relatively narrow zone of moderate to large MLCAPE (1500-3000 J/kg)
by peak heating. Moderate midlevel flow will support sufficient
effective shear for storm organization, with shear vectors generally
aligned perpendicular to the front. This will support supercell
potential from central/eastern MN into western WI and parts of IA,
though the timing of initial development and western extent of the
primary severe threat remain somewhat uncertain.

Favorable instability and an initially discrete storm mode will
support large to very large hail as storms mature, along with some
potential for isolated damaging wind. Low-level hodographs will also
be sufficiently curved/enlarged to support a tornado threat. A
tendency toward clustering and perhaps some modest upscale growth is
possible later in the storm evolution, with a severe threat likely
persisting into the early/mid evening. The threat should begin to
wane by late evening into Thursday night, as instability weakens
with time and eastward extent. 

...Eastern KS/northern OK into southeast NE/western MO... 
A conditionally favorable storm environment is also expected to
develop from southeast NE into eastern KS/western MO and northern
OK, along/ahead of the approaching front. While storm coverage will
generally be less compared to areas farther north (due to weaker
large-scale ascent), isolated supercells and/or stronger clusters
will be possible from late afternoon into the evening. Increasingly
warm midlevel temperatures will tend to limit updraft intensity with
southward extent, but an isolated severe threat could extend as far
south as northern OK.

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...17z Update...
Morning observations show widespread precipitation greater than 0.1
inches, with pockets as high as 1-1.25 inches, has fallen over much
of western SD and western NE in the last 72 hours. While some drier
pockets remain, fuel guidance shows a notable decrease in dryness as
a result. Meteorological conditions may still support some localized
fire-weather concerns with strong southwesterly winds expected
behind the surface low this afternoon. However, the strongest winds
are likely to remain farther northwest where the heaviest
precipitation has fallen. Gusty winds and humidity below 20% may
support some drying today, but fuel recovery is expected to be
modest such that no areas will be introduced. See the prior
discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 09/18/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024/

...Synopsis...
A deep low-pressure system will move slowly east-northeastward over
the northern High Plains through the period. On the backside of this
system, a tight pressure gradient, and boundary-layer mixing into a
belt of strong flow aloft, will yield strong post-frontal surface
winds and 15-20 percent RH from eastern WY into the central Dakotas.
While this would ordinarily support fire-weather concerns,
precipitation over the past 24 hours should limit fuel receptiveness
and the overall fire-weather threat.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0733 AM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Valid 181300Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MID MISSOURI VALLEY NORTHWARD INTO EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA AND
WESTERN MINNESOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of severe wind gusts and isolated large hail
are possible today across parts of the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota
southward in the mid Missouri Valley. A marginal severe threat will
also be possible in parts of the central and southern Plains.

...Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley/Mid Missouri Valley...
Water-vapor imagery depicts a mid-level low over southeast MT this
morning and this feature will continue northeastward during the
period and reach southeastern SK by early Thursday morning.  A
mid-level ridge extending northward from the northwest Gulf Coast
into the upper MS Valley will slowly shift eastward into the Upper
Great Lakes.  A ribbon of stronger southwesterly mid-level flow will
extend from southern CA through the central High Plains and wrapping
cyclonically through the eastern Dakotas and into southern Canada.  

In the low levels, a surface trough will be the primary feature of
interest with a plume of 60s deg F dewpoints extending northward to
the east of the boundary from the southern Great Plains into the
Upper Midwest.  In wake of early day dissipating shower/thunderstorm
activity (e.g., eastern Dakotas, southern KS), heating of an
adequately moist boundary layer will result in moderate
destabilization by mid afternoon (1500-2500 J/kg SBCAPE).  Isolated
to scattered thunderstorms are forecast within a zone of 25-40 kt
0-6 km shear.  Some model guidance varies on storm coverage across
the Slight Risk (isolated vs. scattered) but forecast sounding
profiles indicate a risk for organized storms mainly in the form of
organized multicells and supercells.  Hail/wind may accompany the
stronger storms during the late afternoon through the early evening
before this activity begins to weaken.  

Further south into the southern and central Plains, low-levels are
forecast to be drier near the surface trough, with dewpoints
expected to be mostly in the upper 50s and lower 60s F.  Warmer
mid-level temperatures and limited large-scale ascent than farther
north will likely contribute to tempering the overall intensity of
the updrafts and resultant severe intensity/coverage.  Models
suggest perhaps locally higher storm coverage and resulting
severe-wind threat from the TX Panhandle north-northeast into far
southern KS during the late afternoon/early evening.

## Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 13

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Ileana has been devoid of deep convection since yesterday afternoon, 
as the system has been within a strong wind shear and very dry 
environment. Given the lack of convection, the system is being 
designated as a post-tropical remnant low.  An ASCAT-C pass from 
late last night depicted winds near 30 kt over the Gulf of 
California near northern Sinaloa.  Given this, will hold the 
intensity at 30 kt for this advisory, although that may be generous.
 
The system has been meandering over the Gulf of California with a 
motion of 310/3 kt.  The remnant low will increase forward speed 
later today as it continues northwestward.  The remnant low will 
continue to weaken throughout the day, and is forecast to dissipate 
on Monday. 

This is the last advisory on this system. For additional 
information on the remnant low please see High Seas Forecasts issued 
by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
