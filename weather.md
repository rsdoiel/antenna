Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH TONIGHT
FROM THE LOWER MS VALLEY TO OK...THEN NORTHWARD ACROSS EASTERN
KS...IA AND MN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong-severe storms with wind damage and large hail will
be possible this afternoon/evening from the middle Missouri Valley
to the upper Mississippi Valley.  An ongoing storm cluster near the
Arklatex could persist through the day with some damaging-wind
threat, and storms will be capable of producing isolated very large
hail and severe outflow winds of 60-80 mph this evening into tonight
across Oklahoma.

...Southern Plains to lower MS Valley through tonight...
Another in a series of overnight MCSs is moving southeastward near
the Arklatex, though the bowing system appears to have weakened
prior to sunrise.  The MCS is moving into an area overturned
yesterday across LA/AR, with the primary moisture/buoyancy feed into
the MCS from the south-southwest from the unstable warm sector in
TX.  There will still be some potential for eventual intensification
of the storms as the low levels warm and moisten during the day, and
the stronger embedded storms could produce damaging winds.

Outflow from the morning storms will reinforce a composite outflow
boundary, though the outflow is already somewhat diffuse with
west/northwestward extent.  It appears that the outflow air mass
will modify through the day across OK during the day.  There will be
the potential for isolated thunderstorm development later this
afternoon along the west edge of the richer moisture (near the
western OK/TX border) where MLCAPE could exceed 5000 J/kg with only
small convective inhibition.  However, forcing for ascent will be
rather nebulous and storm initiation/coverage are both in question. 
If storms form, there will be just enough vertical shear for
supercells capable of producing isolated very large hail, and
perhaps an isolated tornado. Confidence is greater in renewed
thunderstorm development across KS this afternoon and into OK late
this evening into early tonight, as a weak surface cold front and
associated midlevel trough will move southeastward and impinge on
the very moist/unstable warm sector.  Very large buoyancy and nearly
dry adiabatic lapse rates across OK will support large/tall storms
capable of producing isolated very large hail initially, and an
increase in the threat for damaging winds (60-80 mph) as storms grow
upscale into another MCS tonight.

...Mid MO to upper MS Valleys this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel shortwave trough and associated cold front will move
eastward from NE/Dakotas to eastern KS/IA and WI by the end of the
period.  The richest low-level moisture will remain farther south,
but surface heating in pre-frontal cloud breaks and boundary-layer
dewpoints in the 60s will contribute to MLCAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg. 
Vertical shear will be relatively weak in the warm sector which will
primarily support multicell clusters and line segments capable of
producing occasional wind damage and marginally severe hail.

...MO/IL today...
A midlevel low over west central MO this morning will move
northeastward toward central/northern IL by this evening.  Lingering
clouds will tend to slow surface heating, though cloud breaks could
allow modest destabilization and support a few strong thunderstorm
clusters capable of producing isolated strong/damaging outflow gusts
and marginally severe hail.

## SPC Severe Thunderstorm Watch 384

date: 2024-06-03, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0384.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0384_radar.gif" border="1" alt="WW 0384 Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="525" height="459" align="center" /></a><pre>

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 384
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
500 AM CDT Mon Jun 3 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  South central Kansas
  Northern and central Oklahoma

* Effective this Monday morning from 500 AM until NOON CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A well-developed MCS with embedded bowing segments will
continue east-southeastward through the morning from southwest
Kansas into south central Kansas and northern/central Oklahoma. 
Damaging winds of 65-80 mph will be the main threat, while the
stronger embedded storms could produce isolated large hail of 1-1.5
inches in diameter.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles south of
Medicine Lodge KS to 30 miles southeast of Ponca City OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 383...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
31035.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-06-03, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy1.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day1fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1017 AM CDT Mon Jun 03 2024

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on latest surface observations and trends in high-res
guidance. Confidence remains reasonably high in the emergence of
elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon across portions of
AZ into southern NM and far west TX between the 20-01 UTC period.
South-central NM into the Trans Pecos region of far west TX should
see the longest duration of 15+ mph winds with 5-15% RH where deeper
boundary-layer mixing should favor frequent gusts between 20-25 mph.
See the previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 06/03/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Jun 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad and weak zonal flow will continue over parts of the Southwest
and southern US as a subtle shortwave moves eastward into the
Plains. Gusty winds are possible over parts of NM and west TX where
receptive fuels and hot/dry temperatures are also expected.

...New Mexico and far West TX...
Despite being weaker than the past several days, westerly mid-level
flow should remain strong enough to bolster surface winds to around
10-15 MPH over parts of central/eastern NM and far West TX this
afternoon behind a dryline. With RH values in the low teens and
temperatures of 90+ F, the dry and breezy air mass will likely
support a few hours of elevated fire-weather potential within
receptive fuels. The most likely corridor for more sustained and
stronger winds will be closer to the dryline/surface trough across
far west TX.

A few hours of locally elevated fire-weather conditions may also
extend farther west in to central AZ. While winds are expected to be
more sporadic, dry surface conditions along the Mogollon Rim have
allowed for continued drying of fuels. As such, at least a few hours
of 15-20 mph wind gusts and RH below 15% may support some elevated
fire-weather risk.
