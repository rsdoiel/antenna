Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CST Sun Feb 02 2025

Valid 021300Z - 031200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United States
through tonight.

...Synopsis...
A series of mid-level shortwave troughs will traverse the northern
tier of states within a low-amplitude, progressive flow pattern.  A
surface ridge will extend across the East into the central Gulf
states with a lee trough over the High Plains.  Stable conditions
will prevail across the Lower 48 states such that thunderstorms are
not forecast.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2025-02-02, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 AM CST Sun Feb 02 2025

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Predominately zonal mid-level flow will persist over much of the
CONUS D2/Monday. Low-amplitude ridging within the zonal flow should
slowly build over the central Plains supporting relatively quiescent
weather. While occasional gusty surface winds are expected near a
lee trough across the High Plains, overall fire-weather conditions
appear limited.

...Southern Plains...
Occasional dry and breezy conditions will continue across the
southern Plains through Day2/Monday. A lee low and cold front over
west TX could support occasional gusts to 15 mph. Dry conditions
should also persist, though stronger southerly flow should increase
humidity gradually. Additional drying of fuels is likely with little
to no precipitation expected. This could support localized
fire-weather potential across the southern High Plains, but
widespread concerns are not expected.

## SPC Feb 1, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Sat Feb 01 2025

Valid 041200Z - 091200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models continue to depict generally zonal flow across 
the U.S. through the medium-range period.  By the start of the
period, a prominent baroclinic zone at the leading edge of an Arctic
airmass is progged to have become established in a roughly
west-to-east manner from the Mid-Atlantic region west-southwestward
into the southern Plains.  Weak/subtle perturbations forecast to
move across the U.S. within the background/fast westerly flow regime
are expected to modulate the north-south position of this boundary,
but with its average location remaining roughly unchanged through
day 6 -- after which evolving model differences cast more
substantial uncertainty into the forecast.

At this time, it appears that mainly elevated convection -- and
perhaps a limited potential for hail -- may evolve primarily north
of the front, in the late day 4 to early day 6 time frame, from the
central U.S. eastward into the Tennessee Valley/Mid South region. 
However, at this time, risk appears to limited/low to highlight with
a 15% probability area.

Mesoscale Discussion 0056
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0633 AM CST Tue Jan 28 2025

Areas affected...the Upper Michigan vicinity

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 281233Z - 281700Z

SUMMARY...A period of heavy snow, at rates on the order of 1-2+
inches per hour, appears possible in a corridor overspreading the
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity by midday.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a low-amplitude short wave perturbation,
accompanying an intense (110+ kt at 500 mb) jet streak digging
east-southeast of the Canadian Prairies, lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection is overspreading the Upper Midwest into Great Lakes
region.  Associated forcing for ascent is becoming focused across
the southwestern flank of an arctic air mass now entrenched across
much of the Great Lakes region, particularly near a zone of strong
lower/mid-tropospheric frontogenesis, which is forecast to shift
from northwestern Ontario across the western Lake Superior and
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity through 17-18z.

Forecast soundings across this region indicate that the sub-freezing
thermodynamic profiles are in the process of saturating, ahead of an
ongoing band of moderate to heavy snow, which appears likely to be
maintained through at least early afternoon.  Temperatures appear
within a few degrees of -15C through an initially deep layer from
lower-levels into the 700-600 mb layer, where conditions will be
most conducive to large dendritic ice crystal growth.  Coinciding
with maximizing lift associated with the frontogenetic forcing, it
appears that this may support a 2-3 hour period of heavy snow rates
on the order of 1-2 inches per hour.  Forecast soundings also
indicate that a layer a steepening mid-level lapse rates may be
accompanied by the development of weak CAPE and embedded convective
development with heavier snow rates possible.
