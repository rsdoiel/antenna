Valid 042000Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL ROCKIES INTO THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS AND UPPER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms capable of gusty winds and
hail may occur this afternoon and evening across parts of the
central Rockies into the northern/central Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley.

...20Z Update...
The forecast remains on track, and no appreciable changes were made
to the outlook with this update. Isolated thunderstorms are
developing/spreading eastward across the central Rockies this
afternoon -- ahead of a positively tilted midlevel trough moving
across the region. The strongest storms will be capable of producing
marginally severe hail and isolated severe gusts. For additional
details, see MCD #2047. Across the central Plains into the Upper MS
Valley, severe-thunderstorm potential is more uncertain along/behind
the cold front this evening into the overnight hours. However, given
the potential for isolated instances of severe hail and locally
strong/damaging gusts, the Marginal Risk has been maintained across
this area.

Farther east, clusters of thunderstorms are tracking westward across
the central Gulf Coast, in an environment characterized by 2+ inch
PW and pockets of diurnal heating/boundary-layer destabilization.
Given some banded convection here -- aided by enhanced low-level
easterlies -- a couple water-loaded downbursts will be possible.
Overall, the severe threat still appears too localized/marginal for
5-percent severe wind probabilities.

...Central Rockies into the central High Plains...
Recent satellite imagery reveals a broad shortwave trough currently
moving through southern ID and northern NV/UT. This shortwave trough
and accompanying cold mid-level temperatures are forecast to
continue eastward throughout the day, progressing across WY and
northern CO. Modest buoyancy, fostered mainly by cooling mid-level
temperatures, is anticipated across WY and adjacent parts of
northern CO as the shortwave trough progresses through. Thunderstorm
development is expected as the large-scale ascent attendant to the
shortwave trough interacts with this buoyancy during the afternoon.
Moderate mid-level westerlies will accompany this shortwave trough
as well, with the resulting increase in vertical shear supporting
the potential for a few more organized/persistent storms. Initially
more cellular development across the higher terrain could pose a
risk for isolated hail, particularly across south-central WY and
north-central CO where the best overlap between the stronger shear
and cold mid-level temperatures is expected. Damaging wind gusts are
possible as well, particularly as the storms reach the lower
elevations of central High Plains where a deeply mixed boundary
layer will be in place.

...Central Plains into the Upper MS Valley...
Recent surface analysis places a low over southeast ND, with weak
troughing extending southwestward from this low in east-central CO.
The primary cold front is west of this surface trough, extending
from the low over southeast ND into more of northwest SD and
adjacent northeast WY. The surface low is forecast to progress
east-southeastward throughout the day, reaching south-central MN by
late tonight. The attendant cold front is expected to push southward
during the same period, progressing through much of NE by early
Thursday morning.

Warm mid-level temperatures should preclude thunderstorm development
along the surface trough during the afternoon and evening. A few
isolated storms are possible during the evening behind the front as
the shortwave trough ejects out into the central Plains. Additional
thunderstorm development is expected overnight/early Thursday
morning across the Upper MS Valley, with some isolated hail possible
within the strongest storms.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0109 AM CDT Wed Sep 04 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain limited through Thursday across
the country. A strong upper trough is forecast to push southward out
of the Canadian Prairies into the northern U.S. through the day
Thursday. As this occurs, a cool continental air mass will push
southward into the Plains, reinforcing a surface trough/cold front
as it pushes further south into the Midwest and southern Plains.
While breezy conditions are possible behind the front, the cooler
temperatures and cloud cover will limit RH reductions. An
upper-level ridge will remain over the western CONUS, promoting
mostly clear skies and dry conditions (RH values in the teens to
20s), but relatively weak surface winds.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0231 PM CDT Wed Sep 04 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe-thunderstorm potential appears relatively low for Friday,
though a few strong storms will be possible from near Lake Erie into
parts of the Ohio Valley.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to amplify as it digs
southeastward across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions on
Friday. A mid/upper-level cyclone is forecast to develop with time,
as a strong embedded shortwave moves southeastward into the base of
the trough by Friday evening. A leading cold front is forecast to
slow down and weaken across parts of the Ohio Valley, as a
reinforcing front moves through parts of the Great Lakes and
Midwest.

...Lake Erie/Ohio Vicinity...
Thunderstorms are expected to develop along a cold front Friday
afternoon as it moves through the Ohio Valley. Weak lapse rates and
a lack of richer low-level moisture will result in only modest
instability, but strong forcing ahead of the approaching trough
should permit for some stronger storms to develop Friday afternoon.
A well-mixed, inverted-v type thermodynamic profile will support
some gusty winds. However, the lack of stronger lower tropospheric
flow or greater instability will likely preclude a more widespread
damaging wind threat. Nonetheless, if greater instability appears
possible, severe probabilities may eventually be warranted.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO....

...SUMMARY...
A few strong to severe storms are possible across portions of
northeast New Mexico Thursday afternoon/evening.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to amplify and move southeastward
across the Canadian Prairies into the upper Midwest/Great Lakes on
Thursday. To the southwest of this amplifying trough, a weakening
shortwave is forecast to move southeastward across the
central/southern Rockies into the southern High Plains. At the
surface, a cold front is forecast to extend southwestward from the
Great Lakes into parts of the Midwest and central/southern Plains
during the afternoon. 

...Southern Rockies and High Plains...
A concentrated area of thunderstorms are forecast across northeast
New Mexico on Thursday as a sharp mid-level shortwave trough
advances southeast across the central/southern Rockies and interacts
with a pocket of instability in the post-frontal airmass across
northeast New Mexico. Some increasing mid-level flow associated with
this trough will overspread the region and provide 20 to 25 knots of
deep layer shear. This may be sufficient for some storm organization
and the potential for severe-wind gusts. Some small hail is also
possible, but relatively modest instability/shear may limit the
potential for large hail. 

...Parts of the Upper Midwest...
Thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the period
along the frontal zone in northwest Wisconsin. Expect this activity
to wane by mid-morning as the low-level jet weakens. Strong height
falls will overspread the cold front by mid to late afternoon which
should support additional thunderstorm development along the cold
front during the afternoon/early evening. Forecast soundings show
limited moisture/instability (less than 1000 J/kg MLCAPE) and modest
effective shear (25-30 kts). This could support a few strong to
severe storms, but overall, expect the severe-weather threat to
remain limited/isolated.

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns appear limited for today across the country.
Breezy conditions will persist across the central Plains ahead of a
migratory surface trough. Low-level moisture has begun to advect
northward based on early-morning surface observations, and this
trend should continue through the day and modulate afternoon RH
minimums over the Plains. Areas of elevated fire weather conditions
are possible across central to southern UT as a cold front pushes
across the region, but confidence in prolonged/widespread elevated
conditions is limited and should occur over fuels that are only
modestly receptive. Dry conditions will persist across the Great
Basin and West Coast, but a building ridge over the western CONUS
will promote weak surface winds and limited fire concerns.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL ROCKIES INTO THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS AND UPPER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms capable of gusty winds and
hail may occur this afternoon and evening across parts of the
central Rockies into the northern/central Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley.

...Central Rockies into the Northern/Central Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley...
A weak shortwave trough over the northern Rockies and adjacent Great
Basin this morning will become absorbed later today into an
amplifying upper trough over the Canadian Prairie provinces and
northern Plains. At the surface, a cold front related to the upper
trough will continue southward over the northern Plains, and
southeastward across the Upper MS Valley through the period. Modest
low-level moisture is forecast to be in place ahead of this boundary
across the northern Plains and upper MS Valley, with more limited
moisture expected farther west across the central Rockies and
adjacent High Plains. Relatively cool mid-level temperatures
associated with the weak shortwave trough and the presence of steep
mid-level lapse rates should aid in the development of weak
instability across parts of WY, northern CO, and vicinity this
afternoon. Sufficient deep-layer shear (generally 25-35 kt) should
support some updraft organization with convection that initially
forms over the higher terrain before subsequently spreading
eastward. Isolated instances of marginally severe hail and
strong/gusty winds may occur with the more cellular development.
But, some increase in strong to severe wind potential may be
realized as thunderstorms move into an area of steeper low-level
lapse rates across the central High Plains by late this afternoon
and early evening, especially if any small clusters can form.

The severe potential along much of the length of the front in the
northern Plains and upper MS Valley appears rather conditional.
While large-scale ascent associated with the approaching upper
trough should gradually overspread the warm sector by late
afternoon/early evening, most guidance continues to suggest that a
cap and substantial MLCIN will hinder robust convection from
developing through much of the day. Even so, sufficient instability
and shear should be in place along/ahead of the front to support an
isolated hail/wind threat if thunderstorms can form and be sustained
through the evening and early overnight period. The post-frontal
regime across much of MT into ND and western SD appears unlikely to
support severe convection. Accordingly, the Marginal Risk has been
trimmed southward to account for recent guidance and observational
trends.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), the broad mean center of elongating 
Tropical Storm Hone and an extratropical low was located near 
latitude 25.3 North, longitude 178.3 West. Hone is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general motion with 
a decrease in forward speed is expected today as Hone merges with 
the extratropical low. A turn toward the north and an increase in 
forward speed is expected to resume on Monday. On the forecast 
track, Hone, or the extratropical low associated with Hone, will be 
passing near or just west of Kure Atoll near the International Date 
Line late Monday or Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
Monday and Monday night.
 
RAINFALL: Storm total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is possible over
Midway and Kure Atolls.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM HST.

Mesoscale Discussion 2041
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 PM CDT Sun Sep 01 2024

Areas affected...parts of western and northern New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011754Z - 011930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A broken line of storms may produce occasional gusty wind
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Inhibition has been mostly eroded across western and
northern New York as temperatures have warmed to the upper 70s to
low 80s with mid 60s dewpoints. Expect scattered thunderstorms to
develop along a cold front once it moves east of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. Storms may be not be that deep given the relatively shallow
thermodynamic profile shown by the RAP forecast soundings. However,
relatively strong flow through the column and a well-mixed boundary
layer may support efficient transport of gusty winds to the surface
within these storms. Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible
through the afternoon with this threat waning near sunset.

## Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 41

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  41
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Sep 01 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Hone has become very ragged overnight, 
with the low-level circulation center becoming very difficult to 
locate with much confidence. An 1130z Oceansat-3 pass indicated 
that the low level center of Hone has shifted west-westward since 
the previous and appears to be merging with the mid-level low just 
east of the International Date Line. The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates from PHFO, SAB, and JTWC, all came in 
at 2.5 (35 kt), while the objective intensity estimates were 
similar. As a result, the initial intensity has been held at a 
perhaps generous 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is quite uncertain due to the low-level of Hone 
being in the process of merging with the mid-level low to the 
west, and is set at 300/12 kt. This general motion is expected 
to  continue today and tonight along with a decrease in forward 
speed as Hone merges with a mid-level low to the west.  Hone should 
begin moving northward with an increase in forward speed Monday and 
Monday night as it moves into a weakness in building mid-level 
ridges to the northwest and east of the system. A shift back toward 
the northwest is then expected late Tuesday through Thursday as a 
low and mid-level ridge builds to the north of Hone. The latest 
track forecast was adjusted to better align with the latest model 
guidance and generally follows the TVCE consensus.
 
Hone will be in a relatively favorable environment during the next
couple days, with warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical
wind shear. The interaction with a mid-level low, ragged LLCC and
entrainment of dry mid-level air should act to minimize the
potential for intensification however. Beyond 48 hours mid-level
moisture drops off considerably and the latest simulated satellite
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF suggest a loss of deep convection by
72 hours. As a result, the intensity forecast holds Hone as a 35 
kt Tropical Storm during the next couple days, with the cyclone 
expected to become a post-tropical remnant low by 72 hours, and 
dissipation occurring by 120 hours. The intensity forecast closely 
follows the latest intensity consensus guidance.
