URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 241
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
625 AM EDT Tue May 14 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

Mesoscale Discussion 0781
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0930 AM CDT Tue May 14 2024

Areas affected...Portions of the northern/central FL Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 141430Z - 141630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms should approach the Tampa metro
and vicinity around 15-16Z (11 AM - Noon EDT), while posing a threat
for mainly damaging winds. New watch issuance is possible to address
this potential.

DISCUSSION...A loosely organized cluster of convection is ongoing
this morning over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Recent forward motion
of this activity suggests it should approach the FL Gulf Coast by
15-16Z. The 12Z sounding from TBW shows relatively cool mid-level
temperatures for FL (-10 C at 500 mb), along with steepened lapse
rates associated with an EML above 700 mb. But, there is still a
residual cap noted between 800-700 mb, which may tend to limit
updraft intensity over land in the short term. Recent surface
observations and visible satellite imagery also show strong
thunderstorms have developed along trailing outflow from earlier
convection across the north-central FL Peninsula. As robust daytime
heating of a very moist low-level airmass continues along/south of
this boundary, lingering MLCIN should gradually erode. Around
2000-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE will conditionally support intense
updrafts, with sufficiently strong mid-level westerly flow and
related deep-layer shear also fostering organized convection.

Thunderstorm evolution through the afternoon remains somewhat
unclear, as recent IR satellite trends show warming cloud tops with
the eastern Gulf convection. There is still some chance that strong
to severe thunderstorms consolidate along the outflow boundary over
the next couple of hours, and continue spreading eastward across the
central FL Peninsula this afternoon. If this scenario materializes,
then scattered damaging winds around 50-70 mph would likely be the
main threat as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen. A brief
tornado or two may also occur, although low-level flow has had a
tendency to veer to southwesterly this morning per latest VWPs from
KTBW, which has reduced 0-1 km SRH. Marginally severe hail also
appears possible with the more robust updrafts. It remains unclear
whether a new watch will be needed, but observational trends will be
closely monitored.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Tue May 14 2024

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHEAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of central and
northern Florida and southeast Georgia, with damaging gusts and a
tornado or two possible. Severe storms may also occur across
portions of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys into the Carolina
Piedmont, as well as the central Rockies/High Plains and parts of
west Texas.

...Northern/central Florida and southern Georgia...
A well-organized quasi-linear MCS will continue across far southeast
Georgia toward southern South Carolina this morning, with at least a
localized severe risk possible. Additional development may occur
along the southwestward-trailing outflow that should modify during
the day, while other storms ongoing over the Gulf of Mexico may also
reach the central Florida Peninsula. With moderate destabilization
(2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE) and steep lapse rates (reference 12z
observed soundings) along/south of the effective boundary, modest
low-level hodograph curvature and some elongation suggests that
embedded bowing structures and mesovortices could develop,
accompanied by a damaging gust and tornado risk. For additional
short-term details, see Mesoscale Discussion 780.

...Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the Carolinas...
Deep-layer moisture will advect northward ahead of a meandering
surface low, beneath a nearly uncapped troposphere. As such, diurnal
heating needs only to boost surface temperatures into the lower 70s
F to initiate convection. These temperatures, along with low to mid
60s F dewpoints, will support around 1000 J/kg SBCAPE by afternoon.
Flow aloft is generally not expected to be overly strong, with
slightly curved and short hodographs likely resulting in mainly
pulse multicellular storms, although some supercells are possible
across the Tennessee Valley toward southern Appalachians. Damaging
gusts and hail will be the main threats, though a brief tornado or
two could occur.

...Central Rockies into the Central High Plains...
The approach of a low-amplitude mid-level trough, and diurnal
heating of an uncapped boundary layer, will support scattered to
numerous thunderstorms during the afternoon and evening hours. A
deep and dry boundary layer should become established by afternoon
peak heating, resulting in high-based pulse/multicell storms
capable of producing isolated severe gusts (given 7-9 C/km low and
mid-level lapse rates). A couple instances of severe hail may also
accompany storms over the central High Plains, where low-level
moisture is slightly more favorable.

...West/northwest Texas...
A narrow corridor of thunderstorm potential exists ahead of a
diffuse dryline over western Texas by afternoon peak heating, where
the dryline circulation may be strong enough to assist in the
initiation of isolated thunderstorms amid minimal CINH. Low-level
moisture will be meager, with mid 80s F surface temperatures and low
50s F dewpoints contributing to over 30 F spreads, so any storms
that develop will be high based. If/where storms develop, somewhat
elongated hodographs suggest that supercells would be the dominant
mode of convection, accompanied by an isolated severe wind/hail
risk.

...Northern New England...
An adequately unstable environment on the southern fringe of
stronger westerlies aloft could support a few strong to locally
severe storms this afternoon, potentially spanning parts of northern
New York and Vermont/New Hampshire into nearby Maine.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0900 AM CDT Mon May 13 2024

Areas affected...Portions of coastal MS/AL into the western FL
Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 234...

Valid 131400Z - 131530Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 234
continues.

SUMMARY...A greater threat for severe/damaging winds should focus
along the Mississippi/Alabama Coast into the western Florida
Panhandle this morning.

DISCUSSION...A small bowing cluster is ongoing over southern/coastal
AL this morning. A warm front is draped east-southeastward across
southern AL into the western FL Panhandle based on latest surface
observations. Recent velocity data from KMOB show strong inbound
velocities at low levels. A greater threat for severe/damaging winds
should be focused along and south of the warm front into parts of
the western FL Panhandle, where there will be a better likelihood
for downdraft winds to reach the surface. Enhanced low-level flow
and strong boundary-layer shear noted on recent VWPs from KMOB may
also support some threat for an embedded tornado.

0833 AM CDT Mon May 13 2024

Areas affected...Portions of south-central TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 131333Z - 131530Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The threat for very large hail and damaging winds should
continue to increase this morning. Watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...The 12Z sounding from DRT shows rich low-level moisture
beneath steep mid-level lapse rates, with resulting MUCAPE
approaching 4000 J/kg. Strong deep-layer shear of 50-60 kt will
easily support supercell structures, and multiple thunderstorms have
already developed near Eagle Pass TX with a weak mid-level
perturbation ejecting from northern Mexico across TX. Current
expectations are for this ongoing activity to gradually spread
eastward across south-central TX this morning, while posing a threat
for very large hail (around 2-3 inches in diameter) with any
sustained supercells. Occasional severe/damaging downdraft winds may
also occur as low-level lapse rates gradually steepen with filtered
daytime heating. Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance will likely be
needed to address the increasing threat for very large hail this
morning.
