Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 141200Z - 201200Z

Upper-level troughing is expected over both the East and West Coasts
Day 3/Thursday - Day 5/Saturday, with upper-level ridging slowly
shifting from over the central US to over portions of the eastern
US. There is forecast uncertainty regarding how this amplified
upper-level pattern progresses early next week, which will have
ramifications for potential fire weather concerns in
southern/central California and the Northeast. 

...Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...
An approaching warm front with associated cloud cover and possible
shower activity will limit fire weather concerns across the
Mid-Atlantic and into portions of the Northeast on Day 3/Thursday.
However, dry/breezy conditions are likely to develop across portions
of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Day 4/Friday - Day 6/Saturday.
Given the recent drought, lack of forecast rain, and near to record
high fire danger, 40% probabilities were expanded and introduced
during what appears to be a multi-day fire weather episode. Some
forecast uncertainty remains regarding forecast precipitation and
where the greatest overlap of elevated/critical winds/RH will be,
but confidence is increasing in at least elevated fire weather
conditions for portions of New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, the
Hudson Valley/vicinity, and southern New England late this week
through the weekend. 

...Southern/central California...
Breezy/gusty north-northwest winds are possible in portions of
central/southern California Day 5/Saturday into Day 7/Monday as
multiple cold fronts sweep south and east over the region. The
southern extent of forecast precipitation and the magnitude of these
winds remain uncertain precluding 40% areas at this time. Confidence
is increasing in an offshore/Santa Ana wind event mid-next week,
which is on the edge of the outlook period. This event may start on
Day 8/Tuesday and last multiple days. This will be monitored and if
trends hold, probabilities will likely be added in subsequent
extended outlooks.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 122000Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may impact parts of the
Texas South Plains and Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle vicinity into far
southwestern Kansas this evening, possibly accompanied by some risk
for hail and gusty winds.

...20Z Update...
The primary change to this outlook was to expand Marginal Risk
probabilities northward into portions of far southwestern KS. Here,
guidance consensus depicts 700-1000 J/kg MUCAPE amid elongated
hodographs, which may support an instance or two of marginally
severe hail with the more persistent, discrete updrafts that can
form. Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 11/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1024 AM CST Tue Nov 12 2024/

...Southern High Plains...
An upper-level trough over the eastern Great Basin/Four Corners at
midday will continue eastward toward the south-central High Plains
tonight. Gradual lee-side cyclogenesis will occur particularly late
today into tonight, with a sharpening southern High Plains
dryline/lee trough, with an eastward-moving Pacific cold front that
will overtake the dryline/lee trough from west-to-east tonight.
Modest-caliber low-level moisture return will occur
north-northwestward across the southern High Plains, with surface
dewpoints tending to remain limited to the upper 40s/lower 50s F
into this evening.

It still appears likely that deep convective potential across
northwest Texas and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles will remain
limited through peak heating, owing to the moisture limitations and
a persistent capping inversion. Isolated thunderstorm development
will become more probable after sunset as lift associated with a
strengthening low-level jet increases, and as the surface cold front
overtakes the lee trough.

While MUCAPE is expected to remain rather weak (generally 500-1000
J/kg or less), strong deep-layer shear will support organized
updrafts with any sustained convection. Isolated hail appears to be
the main threat, as thunderstorms should have a tendency to remain
slightly elevated. But, some chance for strong/gusty winds may also
exist. The window for severe hail should remain small in space and
time this evening, as convection will likely grow upscale fairly
quickly. Even so, small hail may occur farther north/east into parts
of Kansas and Oklahoma overnight into early Wednesday morning.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 PM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not currently expected on
Thursday.

...Synopsis...
A negatively titled shortwave trough is forecast to extend from the
Upper Midwest into the southern Appalachians early Thursday morning.
This trough is expected to lose amplitude as it continues eastward
while also developing a closed mid-level circulation. This resulting
cyclone will then likely progress across the Upper OH Valley and
into the Mid-Atlantic by early Friday. In response to this
evolution, surface cyclogenesis is anticipated off the Carolina
coast, or perhaps just inland over the coastal Carolinas.

Farther west, the overall upper pattern will amplify as ridging
builds across the Plains and troughing deepens along the West Coast.

...Central/Northeast Gulf Coast vicinity...
Showers and thunderstorms will likely be ongoing over the central
Gulf Coast early Thursday morning, as a cold front pushes eastward
through moist and modestly buoyant warm sector in place across the
region. Northern extent of this warm sector is expected to become
increasingly confined throughout the day with the cooler, more
continental airmass over the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic remaining
place. A strong storm or two is possible within this warm sector,
particularly Thursday morning from southwest/southern AL into the
western FL Panhandle, but limited buoyancy and weakening shear
should keep any severe threat isolated, precluding the need for any
severe probabilities with this outlook.

...Coastal Carolinas...
Uncertainty regarding the strength and location of the surface low
expected to deepen over the region late Thursday night/early Friday
morning limits the confidence on how far inland any favorable
low-level moisture/buoyancy would penetrate. Current guidance
suggests there could be a confined area along the warm front near
the northern NC Coast where there is enough overlap between modest
buoyancy and strong shear to support some severe potential. Given
the limited spatial extent of this region and the general
uncertainty regarding the overall pattern, no severe probabilities
were introduced with this outlook. However, a small area maybe
needed in future outlooks if forecast confidence increases.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0100 PM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

The Elevated area was expanded slightly based on the latest
high-resolution forecast guidance and current dry/windy conditions.
Elsewhere, locally elevated conditions are possible in portions in
southwest Texas and along the Sierra Front. Locally elevated
conditions are also possible in the Appalachians from
Tennessee-North Carolina border through the West Virginia-Virginia
border as southeast winds strengthen with some downslope enhancement
ahead of precipitation Wednesday night.

..Nauslar.. 11/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CST Tue Nov 12 2024/

...Synopsis...
Gusty post-frontal off-shore flow will continue across portions of
the Northeast from far eastern PA and southern NJ extending
northeast through southern New England. A very dry air mass will
remain in place with relative humidity reductions to around 30-35
percent likely. Given the drought conditions and receptive fuels in
this region, an Elevated delineation was maintained with this
outlook. Locally Critical conditions may be possible, though the
limited spatial extent of this threat precludes the need to include
a Critical area at this time.

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/CENTRAL GULF COAST REGION...AND COASTAL PORTIONS
OF PACIFIC NORTHWEST...

...SUMMARY...
A marginal tornado/wind threat is apparent on Wednesday afternoon
into Wednesday night across a part of the central Gulf Coast States.
Thunderstorms with strong to locally severe gusts are also possible
near the immediate coasts of Washington, Oregon, and northern
California.

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough is forecast to move from the Plains through the
MS Valley on Wednesday, becoming more negatively tilted as it does.
An occluded surface low associated with this system will begin the
period over the mid MO Valley before moving eastward across IA and
reaching the northern IL early Thursday morning. More consequently
for the severe-weather potential, a secondary triple-point low is
expected to progress eastward across the northern portion of the
Southeast states, along the northern edge of an eastward-evolving
warm sector. Cold front associated with this low will gradually move
eastward across the Southeast states during the day.

Farther west, an upper-level trough is forecast to progress farther
inland across the western CONUS, as an embedded shortwave trough
moves across northern CA into the interior Northwest/northern Great
Basin.

...Lower Mississippi Valley/Central Gulf Coast...
General expectation is for a triple-point surface low to evolve over
the Mid-South vicinity through the early afternoon as low-level
moisture continues to advect northward across the central Gulf Coast
region. Dewpoints in the upper 60s/low 70s are anticipated ahead of
this low and associated cold front. The airmass is expected to
destabilize amid this low-level moisture, but overall buoyancy will
still be modest given the lack of steep lapse rates. The combination
of destabilization and increasing ascent is forecast to result in
thunderstorm development across the warm sector, but along and ahead
of the eastward-progressing cold front. 

The stronger shear will likely be displaced north of the stronger
buoyancy, but enough shear is expected across the warm sector to
support organized storms if updrafts can persist and deepen. This
evolution could support a few marginal supercells and/or stronger
clusters during the afternoon and evening, with a threat of locally
damaging winds and possibly a tornado or two.

Elevated storms will also be possible through the day/evening to the
north of the richer surface moisture. While effective shear will be
sufficient for a few strong elevated storms, the severe potential
with northward extent will tend to be limited by weak midlevel lapse
rates and generally marginal buoyancy.

...WA/OR/Northern CA coasts...  
Cold mid-level temperatures (i.e. -24 to -28 deg C at 500 mb)
associated with the upper trough are expected to spread eastward
throughout the day. These cold mid-level temperatures and associated
steep mid-level lapse rates will contribute to modest buoyancy along
the coastal portions of the Pacific Northwest. Highest storm
coverage is anticipated over the northern CA coast vicinity from the
late morning into the early afternoon along as the frontal band
moves through, but persistent forcing for ascent within this
modestly buoyant airmass is expected to result in more cellular
storms throughout the remainder of the afternoon and evening. A more
linear mode is anticipated within the frontal band, with a few
convectively enhanced gusts possible. Low-topped cellular activity
is anticipated in the wake of the frontal band, with a few instances
of small hail, and potentially even a brief tornado, possible.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0910 AM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The Elevated area in the Northeast was expanded southward based on
current observations (winds gusting 20-45 mph, RH of 40-60%) and the
latest high-resolution forecast guidance. RH and temperatures will
be close to elevated criteria, but wind gusts of 25-50 mph and near
to record setting high fire danger will create elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions in the outlook area. 

The Elevated area in southern California remains on track. Overnight
RH recovery was moderate to excellent with north-northwest wind
gusts of 25-60 mph early this morning. The strongest winds will
struggle to overlap with elevated/critical RH, but elevated fire
weather conditions remain likely in portions of the Transverse
Ranges/vicinity, primarily on southern/ocean-facing slopes.

..Nauslar.. 11/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Tue Nov 12 2024/

...Synopsis...
...Southern California...
A weak cold front will move across southern California through the
morning. Behind this frontal passage, gusty northwest winds
will be enhanced near favored downslope terrain features across
Santa Barbra and Ventura Counties. Relative humidity will hover
around elevated thresholds. Relative humidity will decrease,
especially at mid/upper slopes, below critical relative humidity
thresholds with poor overnight recovery tonight into D2/Wednesday
morning. However, winds are expected to weaken below thresholds
during this period. An Elevated delineation was maintained with this
outlook.

...New England...
Gusty northwesterly flow will overlap relative humidity reductions
to 35-40 percent across New England this afternoon. Though relative
humidity will be marginal, recent fire activity has shown fuels in
this region are receptive to fire spread with drought conditions and
very little recent rainfall. An Elevated delineation was included to
cover this threat, given the potential for strong and gusty winds.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear unlikely through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, troughing will cross the Great Lakes and West
Coast regions this period, with a substantial synoptic-scale ridge
in between, across the Great Plains.  The western trough will cross
most of the Pacific Coast between 18-00Z today, then progress to
near a line from GEG-BOI-ELY-PHX to Hermosillo, MX.  In the lengthy
zone of strong large-scale ascent/cooling aloft that precedes the
trough, isolated thunderstorms already have been noted offshore, and
over the southwestern OR Coast.  This potential will spread inland
today until the trough moves past at least marginally favorable
low/middle-level moisture to support deep convection. 

Elsewhere, thunder potential will be minimal, except for part of the
central Gulf Coast from near the mouth of the Mississippi River to
around PNS.  Isolated to widely scattered, episodic thunderstorms
will be possible near an inverted trough and convergence zone in low
levels, extending northeastward from the weakening, post-tropical
remains of Rafael.  Though most of the convection will remain over
the Gulf, isolated thunderstorms are possible in the outlook area.
