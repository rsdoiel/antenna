Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
A highly amplified mid/upper-level pattern will persist over the
CONUS, characterized by an elongated cyclone over the Great Lakes
and Northeast, with a primary center initially over the lower St.
Lawrence River region.  The associated 500-mb low should drift
erratically near its present location for most of today, then move
northeastward toward the easternmost extension of QC overnight.  A
strong, basal trough was evident in moisture-channel imagery over
the Lower Great Lakes and southern Upper Great Lakes region,
westward across the upper Mississippi Valley.  This trough will
pivot southeastward through the period, then by 12Z tomorrow, extend
from offshore of New England across VA, the western Carolinas,
northern GA, to central MS and the Arklatex region.  Associated cold
air aloft, steep low/middle-level lapse rates (aided by
boundary-layer flow off the relatively warm lakes) and weak moisture
will foster isolated thunderstorm potential south of portions of
Lakes Erie and Michigan today. 

Elsewhere, thunderstorms have persisted all night in a residual,
quasistationary, convectively reinforced baroclinic zone draped
across the Bahamas and southern/western Straits of FL.  This thunder
potential should persist episodically through the period, with some
inland development possible this afternoon across the Everglades and
perhaps adjoining southern parts of metro South FL.  A stronger
boundary, moving southward through northern/central FL as a cold
front, may support isolated thunder near that part of the FL East
Coast today, amid modest moisture/lift.  In the Four Corners region,
isolated to widely scattered, high-based thunderstorms are expected
this afternoon as heating/mixing reduce generally 30s F surface
dewpoints into the 20s, but still just enough moisture to support
weak (generally less than 200 J/kg) peak MLCAPE.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN SOUTH DAKOTA...MUCH OF
CENTRAL NEBRASKA...AND INTO NORTHERN/NORTHWEST KANSAS....

...Synopsis...
...Central and Northern Plains...
A strong (sub 1000mb) surface cyclone will develop across eastern
Montana on Monday, with strong winds expected across much of the
central and northern Plains. This is due to the tight pressure
gradient between this surface low and the strong area of high
pressure centered over the Tennessee Valley. The strongest winds are
expected from west-central Kansas to southern South Dakota where
sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph are possible. The lowest relative
humidity is also expected in a similar area with sub 20 percent
relative humidity from the Texas Panhandle to central Minnesota. A
Critical area has been added from west-central Kansas to southern
South Dakota where these strongest winds and low relative humidities
overlap the driest fuels.

...Central Nevada into western Utah...
Some troughing may develop in the lee of the Sierra on Wednesday as
a mid-level trough crosses California. The combination of some
modest mid-level flow strengthening above a well mixed airmass, and
some tightening of the pressure gradient, may result in 15 to 20 mph
winds across central Nevada and into western Utah. An extended
period of above normal temperatures have dried fuels substantially
in this region recently. Therefore, an Elevated delineation has been
added to address the threat. 

...Gulf Coast...
Some dry and breezy offshore flow is possible across portions of the
Gulf Coast Wednesday with relative humidity of 20 to 30 percent and
surface winds of 10 to 15 mph. The strongest winds are currently
only forecast near the coast where fuels are not as receptive. The
only exception is across central Louisiana where some stronger winds
are possible. However, relative humidity is also not forecast to be
as dry across this region.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected tonight.

...Discussion...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible, mainly this evening, across
the Four Corners States ahead of a weak mid-level trough drifting
southeast over the southern Great Basin. Lake-effect showers and
embedded thunderstorms should remain most prevalent over Lake MI,
but will also be possible south of Lake Huron and Erie. Steep
mid-level lapse rates, sampled by the 00Z GRB/DTX soundings, will
slowly slide south atop the relatively warm waters and support weak
buoyancy for sporadic lightning flashes.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0459 PM CDT Mon Oct 14 2024

Valid 161200Z - 221200Z

...Days 3/Wednesday...
On Day 3/Wednesday, an expansive surface anticyclone will move
eastward from the central Plains into the OH Valley. At the same
time, a lee trough will deepen over the northern/central High Plains
-- in response to strengthening deep-layer southwesterly flow ahead
of an amplifying large-scale trough over the West. This will result
in a tightening pressure gradient and strong/gusty southerly surface
winds across much of the northern/central High Plains -- aided by
boundary-layer mixing into a strong low-level jet. Limited low-level
moisture return will favor near-critical RH, and given very dry
fuels, elevated to critical conditions are expected. Confidence in
the development of critical conditions is highest over south-central
SD and central NE, where the best overlap of strong winds and low RH
is forecast amid the warmest surface temperatures. 

Farther west, the strong southwesterly midlevel winds accompanying
the large-scale trough will overspread a relatively dry air mass
over the Great Basin. This will promote elevated to locally critical
fire-weather conditions during the afternoon. 

...Days 4-5/Thursday-Friday...
A tight pressure gradient and enhanced low-level jet will continue
to promote strong/gusty southerly surface winds over a large portion
of the Plains into the MS Valley on Day 4/Thursday. While elevated
to near-critical conditions are expected, confidence in critical
conditions is slightly lower than Day 3/Wednesday owing to
uncertainty in RH reductions. 

On the backside of the large-scale trough, strong deep-layer
northerly flow will overspread portions of central CA on Day
5/Friday. This will favor increasing fire-weather concerns, and
elevated to critical conditions are possible.
