Mesoscale Discussion 0442
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 PM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Areas affected...eastern Tennessee...northern Georgia...extreme
western Carolinas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 102045Z - 102245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms, a few of which may be severe, are likely
to affect parts of northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee, and
possibly into the far western Carolinas by early evening.

DISCUSSION...Storms continue to increase across TN, beneath the
cooler midlevel temperatures. Meanwhile, a midlevel cloud band has
moved out of the region, allowing heating behind. Given this
expected destabilization via heating and advection out of the west,
cells moving into the region are expected to remain strong or
severe, producing hail and localized wind gusts. The greatest risk
of damaging hail will be over southern areas, including northern GA,
where temperatures have warmed substantially and lapse rates are
quite steep.

Mesoscale Discussion 0441
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Areas affected...primarily from northern Mississippi into central
and northern Alabama

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 101956Z - 102230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to develop later this afternoon and
evening, with large hail and localized damaging gusts likely.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows a boundary/wind shift moving
south across AR and toward the MS River. Ahead of this boundary,
west/southwest winds are helping to maintain a plume of mid 50s F
dewpoints which now extend into AL. Meanwhile, strong heating
continues.

The southerly periphery of the midlevel cooling is evident on
visible imagery, indicated by the CU fields from northeast AR into
TN.  As this cooling aloft rapidly pushes southeast, corridors of
thunderstorm development are expected. The combination of strong
cooling aloft overspreading the surface theta-e plume should result
in corridors of severe storms. Long hodographs, cold temperatures
aloft, and favorable time of day coincident with peak heating will
favor both large hail and localized wind damage. Isolated
significant hail cannot be ruled out with the strongest cells.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 102000Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are expected from portions
of the lower Ohio Valley into the Southeast through this afternoon
and evening. Large hail and damaging winds should be the main
threats.

...20z Update...
Ahead of the cold front moving across the OH/MS Valleys, strong
heating has promoted gradual destabilization and multiple corridors
of storm formation this afternoon. 70s and 80s F surface
temperatures indicate the air mass is well-mixed with dewpoints
generally in the 40s F. The relatively dry boundary layer should
support efficient downward momentum transfer of stronger
tropospheric winds, and a threat for scattered damaging winds. Some
clustering and a stronger cold pool currently becoming established
may focus this threat across the lower OH Valley into parts of
TN/KY. Otherwise, isolated damaging gusts and some hail are
possible.

Across parts of the mid to lower MS valley, predominately cellular
storms are expected late this afternoon continuing through the
evening. Hail appears likely with these storms given the very
favorable lapse rates aloft (8-9 C/km) and elongated hodographs
favoring supercells. Some significant hail near 2 inches in diameter
cannot be ruled out with the more robust rotating storms. Upscale
growth overnight may foster a wind threat as one or more
clusters/line segments spread east across AL and GA with damaging
gusts.

..Lyons.. 04/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1126 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025/

...Lower Ohio Valley into the Southeast...
Large-scale upper troughing is forecast to further amplify today
over the eastern CONUS, as multiple embedded shortwave troughs
rotate through its base. A lead shortwave trough will advance
eastward over the upper OH Valley and central Appalachians through
the day, while a trailing shortwave trough is expected to move
southeastward across the mid MS Valley, lower OH Valley, and TN
Valley through this evening. A weak/diffuse cold front is likewise
forecast to develop southeastward across these regions through the
day, providing some focus for thunderstorm development later this
afternoon and evening.

12Z soundings across the Southeast indicate shallow/limited
low-level moisture in place, but also relatively steep mid-level
lapse rates. Strong daytime heating, gradual low-level moistening
from the southwest, and cooling mid-level temperatures associated
with the trailing shortwave trough should all aid in the development
of around 1000-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE ahead of the front by mid
afternoon. Weak low-level westerly winds are forecast to gradually
veer and strengthen with height through the mid/upper levels, which
will likely foster relatively long/straight hodographs and 40-55+ kt
of effective bulk shear. This should easily support organized
updrafts, including the potential for supercells.

Current expectations are for robust thunderstorm development to
occur over the lower OH Valley/Mid-South region by 18-20Z. This
initial activity will likely be supercellular, with an associated
threat for large hail given steep lapse rates aloft and strong
deep-layer shear. Additional strong to severe thunderstorms should
develop through the rest of the afternoon and early evening across a
larger portion of the lower OH Valley into the TN Valley and
Southeast. Any convection which can remain at least semi-discrete
should pose a continued hail threat. Some tendency for upscale
growth into multiple bowing clusters seems likely by late
afternoon/early evening. A well-mixed boundary layer should support
efficient downward momentum transfer and a threat for scattered
damaging winds, before convection eventually weakens by mid/late
evening with the loss of daytime heating.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

Primary adjustment to forecast across the Northern Plains was a
southward extension of Elevated highlights into portions of
Nebraska. Increasing surface winds are expected from the south in
response to Northern Rockies lee troughing development. These winds
will overlap sufficiently dry fuels within a well mixed boundary
layer, where afternoon relative humidity is expected to drop into
15-20 percent range. This will promote an Elevated fire weather
threat Friday for portions of the Dakotas and Nebraska. Otherwise,
forecast (see below) remains on track across central Florida for
Elevated fire weather conditions.

..Williams/Lyons.. 04/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1219 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025/

...Synopsis...
A near-stationary mid-level trough will amplify along the East Coast
as upper ridging continues to build over the central U.S. and
another mid-level trough traverses the Pacific Northwest tomorrow
(Friday). Ahead of the approaching Northwest mid-level trough,
surface lee troughing will take place across the central and
northern High Plains, supporting strong southerly flow in the
process. A dry airmass will be transported northward across the
northern High Plains, with 15-25 mph sustained southerly winds
overlapping with 15-25 percent RH tomorrow afternoon. Elevated
highlights have been introduced given dry/windy conditions
overlapping at least marginally to modestly dry fuels.

Meanwhile, a surface cold front is expected to sweep across the
Florida Peninsula tomorrow, with dry/breezy conditions likely in the
post-frontal regime. Winds may sustain over 15 mph for at least a
few hours during the afternoon, as RH dips as low as 20-30 percent
in some areas. Rainfall accumulations have barely exceeded 0.25
inches over the past week for most parts of the central Florida
Peninsula, and given the presence of dry fuels, Elevated highlights
have been introduced.

0230 PM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Saturday or Saturday night.

...Central Rockies to the Upper Midwest...
A mid-level ridge will deamplify through the day on Saturday as a
mid-level shortwave trough progresses out of the northern Rockies
into the northern Plains. Large-scale ascent will strengthen near
peak diurnal heating across parts of the central Rockies to the
Black Hills. With limited buoyancy, isolated/short-lived
thunderstorms are anticipated amid scattered high-based/low-topped
showers. Where deeply mixed thermodynamic profiles exist in eastern
WY and western SD, isolated strong wind gusts are possible.

As the low-level jet strengthens across the central Plains on
Saturday night, sufficient elevated instability could support some
thunderstorms across the Mid-Missouri Valley into the Upper Midwest.
Limited moisture/instability should limit any large hail threat from
this activity.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
EASTERN CAROLINAS INTO FAR SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA AND FOR NORTHERN
FLORIDA AND FAR SOUTHEAST GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to locally severe thunderstorms are possible from
the eastern Carolinas into southeast Virginia and across far
southeast Georgia and northern Florida.

...Eastern Carolinas into Southeast Virginia...
A line of showers with embedded thunderstorms is approaching the
southern Appalachians by mid-day Thursday along a low-mid-level
front which will continue east through the day. Some intensification
of these thunderstorms (or additional convective development along
the mountains) is expected today which will impact the Friday/Day 2
forecast. As the remnants of this front/mountain convection interact
with better low-level moisture across eastern North Carolina later
tonight, some intensification of these storms are anticipated. While
these storms likely will remain sub-severe without any surface
heating and thus minimal instability, the intensification should
assist in the remnant outflow boundary/front moving offshore during
the morning hours on Friday. This will have a stabilizing effect
which results in a conditional severe threat on Day 2/Friday.

Some guidance shows a strengthening surface low which results in
substantial return flow across the eastern Carolinas, which will
result in low 60s dewpoints and weak to moderate instability by
later morning to early afternoon. However, if this stronger
cyclogenesis does not occur (as forecast by several hi-res models
this morning), the instability and severe weather threat will remain
mostly offshore. No modifications were made to the marginal risk,
but a 2% tornado probability was added for parts of eastern North
Carolina. If stronger southerly/southeasterly flow and low 60s
dewpoints can develop ahead of a strengthening surface low, a
tornado is possible.

Overall, a few strong to isolated severe storms are possible with a
primary threat of large hail. However, this threat is conditional on
destabilization, which remains questionable at this time.

...Southeast Georgia and northern Florida...
Strong heating is anticipated along a frontal zone from southeast
Georgia to northern Florida Friday afternoon. Forecast soundings
show 500 to 750 J/kg MLCAPE with a well-mixed boundary layer
extending to near 3km. Overall lack of moisture should limit
instability and storm intensity, but 35 to 45 knots of shear will
support some storm organization. Therefore, the strongest storms
could exhibit some updraft rotation with an increased large
hail/severe wind threat, but overall expect the threat to remain
isolated.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...Morning Update...
The prior outlook remains valid with only minor modifications. The
Elevated area was expanded across parts of central SD where
post-frontal gusty winds of 15-20 mph and low RH are expected for a
few hours this afternoon. Areas across western SD have received
around 0.25-0.5 inches of rainfall over the last 24 hours, and have
been trimmed from the risk area. Otherwise the outlook was
unchanged, see the previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 04/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1149 PM CDT Wed Apr 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the eastern CONUS as upper
ridging persists across the Interior West, supporting surface high
pressure and deep-layer northwesterly flow to overspread the central
Plains today. Given the presence of a dry boundary layer, efficient
downward momentum transport of the stronger flow aloft is expected
by afternoon peak heating given boundary-layer mixing. Widespread
15-20 mph northwesterly surface winds (perhaps reaching 25 mph
locally) will coincide with 20 percent RH for several hours across
parts of the central Plains, warranting the continuation of Elevated
highlights given at least modestly dry fuels.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 101630Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are expected from portions
of the lower Ohio Valley into the Deep South this afternoon and
evening. Large hail and damaging winds should be the main threats.

...Lower Ohio Valley into the Southeast...
Large-scale upper troughing is forecast to further amplify today
over the eastern CONUS, as multiple embedded shortwave troughs
rotate through its base. A lead shortwave trough will advance
eastward over the upper OH Valley and central Appalachians through
the day, while a trailing shortwave trough is expected to move
southeastward across the mid MS Valley, lower OH Valley, and TN
Valley through this evening. A weak/diffuse cold front is likewise
forecast to develop southeastward across these regions through the
day, providing some focus for thunderstorm development later this
afternoon and evening.

12Z soundings across the Southeast indicate shallow/limited
low-level moisture in place, but also relatively steep mid-level
lapse rates. Strong daytime heating, gradual low-level moistening
from the southwest, and cooling mid-level temperatures associated
with the trailing shortwave trough should all aid in the development
of around 1000-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE ahead of the front by mid
afternoon. Weak low-level westerly winds are forecast to gradually
veer and strengthen with height through the mid/upper levels, which
will likely foster relatively long/straight hodographs and 40-55+ kt
of effective bulk shear. This should easily support organized
updrafts, including the potential for supercells.

Current expectations are for robust thunderstorm development to
occur over the lower OH Valley/Mid-South region by 18-20Z. This
initial activity will likely be supercellular, with an associated
threat for large hail given steep lapse rates aloft and strong
deep-layer shear. Additional strong to severe thunderstorms should
develop through the rest of the afternoon and early evening across a
larger portion of the lower OH Valley into the TN Valley and
Southeast. Any convection which can remain at least semi-discrete
should pose a continued hail threat. Some tendency for upscale
growth into multiple bowing clusters seems likely by late
afternoon/early evening. A well-mixed boundary layer should support
efficient downward momentum transfer and a threat for scattered
damaging winds, before convection eventually weakens by mid/late
evening with the loss of daytime heating.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS OF
THE LOWER OH VALLEY INTO THE DEEP SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong-severe thunderstorms are expected from portions of
the lower Ohio Valley into the Deep South this afternoon. Hail and
wind are the primary concerns.

...Synopsis...
Broad upper troughing is forecast to shift eastward across the
eastern CONUS today, as a series of embedded shortwave trough
progress through its base. The lead wave in this series is currently
moving through Lower/Middle OH Valley with a second wave farther
back northwest across the Upper Midwest/Mid MO Valley. This second
wave, which is accompanied by an 80 kt 500 mb jet streak, is
expected to continue southeastward throughout the day, reaching the
Mid-South vicinity by this evening before continuing more eastward
into southern Appalachians by early Friday. 

Surface pattern preceding this upper troughing will be somewhat
disorganized and broad, with one weak low moving northeastward
across the Upper OH Valley and another moving southeastward across
the Mid MS Valley and KY/TN. A diffuse cold front is forecast to
shift southeastward across the OH Valley into the Mid-South and
eventually the Southeast. Strong to severe thunderstorms are
anticipated in the vicinity of this front throughout the afternoon
and evening. 

...Mid-South/TN and OH Valleys into the Southeast...
Area soundings reveal the steep mid-level lapse rates (i.e. greater
than 7 deg C per km) extend throughout much of the region, supported
by a large area of cold mid-level temperatures (-18 to -24 deg C at
500 mb). These cold mid-level temperatures will help support airmass
destabilization and modest buoyancy ahead of the approaching
shortwave trough and cold front, despite relatively modest low-level
moisture. Forcing for ascent along the front, as well as more broad
large-scale ascent, will interact with this destabilized airmass to
support thunderstorm development across much of the region this
afternoon. Thunderstorm coverage will likely be maximized along the
front, but initiation could also occur elsewhere across the region
given the broad ascent and large destabilized area. 

Deep mixing is anticipated across the region, resulting in a
thermodynamic profile that is somewhat unique for this part of the
country. This profile will result in high-based thunderstorms
capable of producing strong cold pools, particularly given that
shear is quite strong and updraft organization is likely. Primary
factor precluding greater severe potential is the limited low-level
moisture and resulting modest buoyancy. That being said, the long
hodographs suggest storms could be efficient at producing hail
during their initially more discrete stage, with a trend towards
cold pool amalgamation thereafter. Consequently, several bowing
segments could develop, each with the potential to produce damaging
gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 131200Z - 181200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Primary feature of interest will be a shortwave trough over MT at
12Z Sunday and its major amplification into a broad eastern
CONUS/southeast Canadian trough through mid-week. Poleward moisture
quality from the western Gulf will remain sub-optimal, but will
improve through D5/Monday. The northeast extent of weak surface
buoyancy should reach the OH Valley by Monday afternoon, where
guidance has been trending farther south with an intense mid-level
jet. Given a prior EML and the deep surface cyclone tracking over
Lake Superior to central ON vicinity, convective coverage may be
limited along the trailing cold front. Still, consensus of guidance
suggests that some fast-moving convection should accompany the
portion of the front in the OH Valley vicinity. Robust 700-500 mb
wind profiles should offer at least a threat for damaging winds. 

Depending upon timing of frontal passage, a limited-area severe
threat may exist on D6/Tuesday along the Southeast Atlantic coast. A
compact southern-stream shortwave impulse, approaching the backside
of the broad east CONUS trough, indicates low-probability severe
potential over the southern Great Plains on D7/Wednesday into the
western Gulf Coast vicinity D8/Thursday.

Areas affected...Central/southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072047Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in convection may be sustained along the
deeper wind shift/cold front, but severe storms appear unlikely.

DISCUSSION...West of the pre-frontal convection, a recent increase
in updraft depth/intensity has occurred across central GA.  This
deepening convection appears to be along the deeper wind shift, with
a band of ascent impinging on residual moisture in the wake of
earlier convection.  However, the prior convection cooled surface
temperatures, lapse rates are poor, and vertical shear has
weakened/become more unidirectional with time, and shear vectors are
primarily parallel to the line orientation.  Thus, the storms are
expected to remain largely sub-severe, and an additional watch or
watch extension appears unnecessary.

0335 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of NC SC and southern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134...

Valid 072035Z - 072130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat continues across WW134, primarily
with the band of storms moving over eastern NC and southern VA.
However, additional storms remain possible farther south.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar imagery shows an
organized linear cluster of thunderstorms ongoing from far
southeastern VA into eastern NC. Over the last 2 hours, several
reports of wind damage, and measured severe gusts have been reported
with the line segment across parts of VA and NC. This appears likely
to continue to the coast as the line segment moves east-northeast at
50 kt.

Farther south, lingering cloud cover has resulted in only isolated
weak convection and showers across parts of SC. Some recent CA
guidance suggests a few stronger cells may eventually emerge closer
to the coast where heating has been more pronounced. A damaging wind
gusts threat could evolve with any deeper connective cells that
become established in the next couple of hours as the primary cold
front continues to shift east.

Mesoscale Discussion 0433
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn through e cntrl GA...wrn and cntrl SC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071240Z - 071445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...At least low probabilities for an additional tornado or
two and/or locally damaging surface gusts continues in scattered
thunderstorm activity overspread the region through 10-11 AM EDT. 
It is still not clear that a severe weather watch is needed in the
near term, but trends will continue to be monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer instability, characterized by
CAPE near or above 1000 J/kg, still remains confined to a narrow
pre-frontal corridor across the western Florida Panhandle through
southwestern into southern portions of central GA.  However, some
cooling loft appears to be contributing to at least weak
destabilization north-northeastward toward the South Carolina
Piedmont.

The front, with a couple of weak waves along it, will continue a
slow eastward progression through mid to late morning, with the
Rapid Refresh indicating that a moderate south-southwesterly
low-level jet (in excess of 40 kt around 850 mb) will maintain
sizable, clockwise-curved low-level hodographs within the
instability axis.

Cloud cover spreading downstream of the stronger ongoing convective
development probably will slow boundary-layer destabilization, and
it is not certain that there will be a substantive further increase
in thunderstorm intensities in the near term.  However, the MCV,
which apparently recently contributed to a tornado south-southwest
of the Greater Atlanta area, continues east-northeastward toward the
South Carolina Piedmont, and it not clear that the downstream
environment will not support an additional relatively short-lived
tornado or two.  Farther south, in the corridor of better
instability, focused along the low-level jet axis near/north and
east of the Albany into Macon vicinities, there may also be
continuing potential for short-lived intensification of
meso-vortices embedded with the ongoing narrow band of convection.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 132
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1000 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern and Eastern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle
  Western and Northern Georgia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and evening from 1000 AM until
  600 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Severe storm potential, including a few supercells ahead
of a convective line, may increase into the afternoon across the
region, with the strongest storms posing a tornado risk aside from
damaging winds.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 25 miles north of Atlanta GA to 50
miles east of Mobile AL. For a complete depiction of the watch see
the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 131...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0428
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern AL...southwest/central GA...into
the western FL Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 132...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 132 continues.

SUMMARY...Several bands of strong to severe storms will remain
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes. Some local
extensions of WW132 may be needed, but the downstream threat appears
more limited.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar observations indicate a
band of convection across southeastern AL and west-central GA
continues to show embedded supercell and bowing structures capable
of damaging gusts and tornadoes. This should continue for a couple
more hours as storms approach the eastern edge of the Tornado Watch
132. Areal extensions of a few counties may be needed as storms
begin to outrun the watch. As storms continue farther east, a
gradual decrease in buoyancy should favor weakening into the evening
hours. Until then, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain
possible.

To the southwest, a second smaller band of convection across
southern AL will likely maintain intensity for a few more hours this
afternoon. A few more isolated cells have also developed farther
east within the warm sector across southwest GA and the northern FL
Panhandle. 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 40+ kt of effective shear
could support a continued severe threat into this evening. This
matches with some hi-res guidance that shows a gradual expansion of
strong storms into southwest GA and possibly northern FL. However,
forcing for ascent is some what nebulous and storm coverage has
remained more isolated thus far. With storms approaching the
southeast corner of WW132 in the next few hours, some consideration
may be given to a small downstream watch. However the extent of the
severe risk and need for any new watches is currently unclear.

Mesoscale Discussion 0425
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0734 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern MS through cntrl AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 131...

Valid 061234Z - 061430Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 131 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection may continue to undergo further organization
and intensification through 9-10 AM CDT, accompanied by increasing
risk for strong surface gusts, and a continuing risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...At least a bit broader, lower/mid-tropospheric cyclonic
circulation appears to be evolving, perhaps including a surface
meso-low now migrating east-northeastward into/across the Demopolis
AL vicinity.  Latest Rapid Refresh now indicates a more prominent
south-southwesterly speed maximum associated with this feature,
including 50+ kt in the 850-700 mb layer.  Although moisture
characterized by mid 60s+ surface dew points across central Alabama,
between Montgomery and Birmingham still appear to supporting only
modest CAPE (around 500 J/kg sampled in 12Z BMX sounding), low-level
moisture advection and at least some boundary layer warming are
likely to contribute to further destabilization in advance of the
convection during the next few hours.  Inflow of this air mass may
be sufficient to support at least a gradual further intensification
of activity during the next few hours, accompanied by increasing
potential for strong surface gusts and a few tornadoes. 

Discrete thunderstorm development is also being maintained near/just
ahead of the southern flank of the evolving convective system, and
the occasional intensification of these cells, before merging into
the line, may also be accompanied by increasing potential for a
tornado near the Selma/Montgomery vicinities through mid morning.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southwest Alabama
  Northwest Georgia
  Far Southeast Mississippi

* Effective this Sunday morning from 245 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms continue to gradually move southeastward
across the Southeast States. Low-level wind fields remain strong,
supporting the potential for damaging gusts and line-embedded
tornadoes. Additionally, there is also some chance for a few storms
ahead of the main line. Environmental conditions suggest that any
persistent discrete storms could become supercellular and capable of
producing damaging gusts and tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 135 miles southwest of Birmingham AL
to 15 miles southeast of Rome GA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
