## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-09-15, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, with minor changes made to
the Elevated areas to reflect the latest guidance consensus.
Additionally, a couple of dry strikes may accompany isolated
thunderstorms along the Front Range in eastern Colorado (and
surrounding areas), but overall modest fuel receptiveness suggests
that lightning-induced fire ignitions should remain a localized
concern, so no isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have been added.

..Squitieri.. 09/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
Preceding an amplifying large-scale trough over the West Coast,
enhanced deep-layer meridional flow will overspread the Great Basin,
while a related surface cyclone evolves over northern NV. Deep
boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft, along with a
tightening pressure gradient peripheral to the surface cyclone, will
yield 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds and 15-20 percent
RH over southern/central NV. Given modestly receptive fuels here,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected during the afternoon. 

Additionally, large-scale ascent accompanying the amplifying
midlevel trough will promote a mix of wet/dry thunderstorms across
the northern Great Basin/Intermountain West. While quick storm
motions and limited precipitation with some of this activity could
yield a risk of lightning-induced ignitions, marginal fuels should
generally limit the threat. 

Over the southern High Plains, breezy/gusty southerly surface winds
will develop amid a warm/dry boundary layer near a lee trough during
the afternoon. This will favor a few hours of elevated fire-weather
conditions.

## Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 13

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Ileana has been devoid of deep convection since yesterday afternoon, 
as the system has been within a strong wind shear and very dry 
environment. Given the lack of convection, the system is being 
designated as a post-tropical remnant low.  An ASCAT-C pass from 
late last night depicted winds near 30 kt over the Gulf of 
California near northern Sinaloa.  Given this, will hold the 
intensity at 30 kt for this advisory, although that may be generous.
 
The system has been meandering over the Gulf of California with a 
motion of 310/3 kt.  The remnant low will increase forward speed 
later today as it continues northwestward.  The remnant low will 
continue to weaken throughout the day, and is forecast to dissipate 
on Monday. 

This is the last advisory on this system. For additional 
information on the remnant low please see High Seas Forecasts issued 
by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of isolated severe gusts and hail will be
possible today across parts of the central and northern High Plains.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a blocky longwave pattern will remain over the
CONUS, with amplifying troughing in the West and a Rex configuration
in the East.  Cyclonic flow already covers most of the land west of
the Rockies.  That will continue but with backing of the flow aloft,
as a cyclone now centered over Vancouver Island strengthens and digs
south-southeastward down the West Coast.  By 12Z tomorrow, the
associated 500-mb low should be located near OAK, with strongly
difluent flow and modest ridging over the High Plains from eastern
NM to MT.  The southern part of a weak shortwave trough -- evident
in moisture-channel imagery from UT to eastern AZ -- should cross CO
today and reach the eastern border of WY to near GLD by 12Z, likely
enhanced from this evening onward by convectively generated
vorticity.

A mid/upper anticyclone now over the Lower Great Lakes will stretch
eastward and open up to that direction around the end of the period.
The base of the eastern pattern block will be composed of a broad,
nearly zonal height weakness anchored by:
1. The decaying remains of Francine, long merged with a mid/upper
low, and forecast to drift erratically over the Mid-South while
weakening further;
2.  An intensifying, deep-layer cyclone with low-level manifestation
as a deepening wave cyclone along a frontal zone, offshore from the
Carolinas.

The 11Z surface analysis showed a wavy, quasistationary frontal zone
attached to a strengthening low located roughly south of EWN and
east of SAV.  The front extended across northern FL to the western
FL Panhandle and southwestern AL.  A remnant low was drawn well
inland over northern MS, connecting to the Gulf boundary via an
occluded front.  These features should move little through the
period, but with further weakening of the western low, and
intensification of the eastern one.  Elsewhere, a lee trough and
dryline either overlapped, or were drawn within less than 100 nm
apart, near the eastern border of WY, eastern CO, the northern/
western TX Panhandle, and east-central/southeastern NM.  The dryline
should shift somewhat eastward today amid diurnal heating.

...Central/northern High Plains...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms are possible across a
large part of the Rockies, Intermountain West, and Desert Southwest
today.  Some of this activity will mature atop deep, well-mixed
boundary layers of desert valleys and the High Plains, with non-zero
potential for a strong-severe gust.  The most concentrated/organized
potential for gusts near to above severe limits, as well as marginal
hail, still appears to be over portions of the central High Plains
into the Black Hills and vicinity, near the lee trough/dryline. 
East of that, low-level moisture will be relatively maximized in a
return-flow airmass of predominantly continental origin, with a
north-south belt of 50s to mid 60s F surface dewpoints.  Where the
western part of that moisture coincides with strong surface heating,
and underlies the eastern part of the EML, a north-south corridor of
MLCAPE in the 1500-2500 J/kg range should develop, with 500-1500
J/kg extending into the more deeply mixed regime nearest the lee
trough.  East of the trough, considerable veering of winds with
height is expected, with some low-level hodograph enhancement
potentially moving 0-3-km SRH to near 150 J/kg, but lack of stronger
midlevel flow will temper overall shear.

...Coastal NC, extreme eastern SC...
Many progs deepen the low-level cyclone and transition it to
subtropical or tropical character through the end of day 2, while
eroding the frontal zone's baroclinicity; however, inconsistency
among models is high.  The most aggressive among the synoptic and
CAM guidance with the speed of the transition and approach to the
coast (e.g., 06Z GFS and 00Z ARW high-res window respectively) show
favorably large low-level shear, but barely have surface-based
effective inflow onshore at the end of the period, with greatest
convective coverage and buoyancy still offshore.  As such, the
associated coastal tornado threat still appears too low and
conditional to outlook until day 2 (after 16/12Z).  Potential for
faster/deeper development and shoreward translation of the low will
continue to be monitored for onshore supercell threat the last few
hours of day 1.  See latest NHC tropical outlook for guidance on
overall development potential with this system.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1222 PM CDT Sat Sep 14 2024

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible Sunday
afternoon and evening across parts of the central High Plains.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough currently residing over the northeastern
Pacific is forecast to deepen substantially over the next 48 hours
along the West Coast. This will establish a broad swath of
strengthening south/southwesterly flow across the greater Great
Basin region into the central/northern Rockies. Low-level moisture
return into the central Plains should increase as a lee surface
trough slowly deepens in response to the evolving upper-level
pattern. The increasing moisture/buoyancy quality may support some
intensification of convection as it migrates out of the central
Rockies and into the High Plains Sunday afternoon and evening. 

...Central High Plains...
High-based convection is expected to develop within the central
Rockies by mid/late afternoon Sunday as a combination of deep-layer
ascent and diurnal warming steepen lapse rates. Isolated
thunderstorms are also possible in the vicinity of a deepening
surface trough across eastern WY/northeast CO where surface pressure
falls are currently expected to be strongest. Forecast guidance
suggests that this activity will intensify as it migrates northeast
and impinges on the western periphery of the moisture reservoir to
the east of the surface trough where MLCAPE values may be as high as
1000-2000 J/kg. While the central High Plains will likely remain
displaced from the strongest mid/upper-level flow, 25-30 knot
mid-level winds with modest low-level flow should provide sufficient
deep-layer shear to support some degree of storm organization with
an attendant large hail threat. Additionally, boundary-layer mixing
on the edge of the deeper moisture will be adequately deep
(mixed-layer LCLs near 2.5 km AGL) to support strong to severe gusts
with the more organized cells and/or clusters. 

...Great Basin/Four Corners...
Increasing broad scale ascent over the Great Basin and Four Corners
region should result in isolated to scattered thunderstorm
development by late afternoon. While some degree of moisture return
is anticipated from the Gulf of California across southern AZ, most
regions will remain fairly warm and dry in the low-levels.  Such
thermodynamic conditions will be conducive for dry downbursts that
may be capable of very localized strong to severe gusts. The
predictability of where such gusts are most likely across the
broader region remains too limited to warrant risk probabilities.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Sat Sep 14 2024

Valid 141630Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing isolated severe gusts and hail
will be possible over parts of the north-central Plains this
afternoon and evening.

...Northern/Central Plains...
Modest ascent associated with a weak shortwave trough over eastern
WY is encouraging towering cu and recent thunderstorm initiation
across parts of western/central NE late this morning. This
convective development is also occurring along/near a weak surface
trough. Even though large-scale ascent is expected to remain fairly
modest across much of the northern/central Plains today in the wake
of a more prominent upper trough moving northeastward over central
Canada, most guidance still shows potential for isolated to
scattered thunderstorms developing this afternoon across parts of
northwest NE into western/central SD along/near the surface trough.
With modest/shallow low-level moisture in place, but steep mid-level
lapse rates per 12Z LBF/UNR soundings, robust daytime heating will
likely support around 1000-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid afternoon.

West-southwesterly flow at mid levels is forecast to be only
modestly enhanced by the passing shortwave trough. Still, a veering
and gradually strengthening wind profile with height through mid
levels should support around 25-35 kt of deep-layer shear.
Occasional hail may occur with any marginal supercells that can
initially develop, although tendency for clustering and outflow
interactions may lead to an isolated severe wind threat with time
late this afternoon and early evening. The overall severe risk
should quickly wane this evening with the loss of daytime heating.

...Southern High Plains...
At least isolated high-based thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon across parts of the TX Panhandle and vicinity along/east
of a weak surface front/trough. With a deeply mixed boundary layer
expected with daytime heating, occasional strong/gusty downdraft
winds may occur with the more robust cores. However, weak deep-layer
shear should keep the overall severe wind threat rather isolated.

...East Texas into Southern Louisiana/Mississippi...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms may develop along a weak
front from parts of east TX into southern LA/MS later this
afternoon. This activity would occur on the back side of a remnant
mid-level circulation over the Mid-South. While modestly enhanced
mid-level flow will be present, the potential for a more organized
severe wind threat appears too low to include probabilities at this
time.

## Tropical Storm Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 9

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Sat Sep 14 2024
 
Satellite imagery shows that Ileana is being affected by increasing
southwesterly shear.  A large burst of convection that occurred in
the early morning hours has moved northeast of the exposed
low-level center, while new convection is forming to the north and
southeast of the center. The initial intensity is held at 35 kt
based on various satellite intensity estimates and earlier surface
data from Topolobampo, Mexico.
 
The initial motion is just east of due north or 010/6 kt.  This
general motion should continue for the next 6 hours or so, bringing 
the center near or over the coast of Mexico near Topolobampo and Los
Mochis today.  After that, Ileana should begin a slow motion toward
the northwest over the Gulf of California roughly parallel to the
coast of Mexico, with this motion continuing until the system
dissipates.  The new track forecast is nudged to the north and east
of the previous track and lies near the various consensus models.
 
Ileana is expected to weaken below tropical-storm strength later
today due to a combination of shear and land interaction.  However,
before that happens, the cyclone should bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the northern coast of Sinaloa and
southern coast of Sonora through this afternoon.  The system is
expected to degenerate to a remnant low between 12-24 h, with the
remnant low dissipating over the central Gulf of California on
Monday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of
coastal Sinaloa, Mexico through this weekend. This heavy rainfall
will bring a risk of flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the
area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area
of northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora through this afternoon.

## Tropical Storm Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 5

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Fri Sep 13 2024
 
Recent satellite imagery shows that Ileana is producing a large
convective canopy with clouds top temperatures as cold as -80C.
However, data from the Mexican radar at Cabo San Lucas shows that
the convective banding under the canopy is poorly organized and
suggests that the circulation center is still broad and elongated.
The various satellite intensity estimates are little changed since
the previous advisory, so the initial intensity remains 40 kt.
 
The initial motion is 335/8 kt. This general motion should continue 
for the next 12 h or so, bringing the center across the southern 
portion of the Baja California peninsula later today and into the 
southern Gulf of California by early Saturday.  After that, a slower 
northward to north-northwestward motion is forecast until the 
cyclone dissipates over the weekend.  There are no significant 
changes to either the track forecast guidance and the forecast 
track.

Ileana currently appears too disorganized to take advantage of the 
current environment of light to moderate shear, good moisture, and 
warm water. Thus, little change in strength is expected before 
landfall in Baja California Sur.  When the cyclone reaches the Gulf 
of California, it is forecast to move into increasing westerly shear 
and a drier airmass, which should cause weakening despite the very 
warm sea surface temperatures.  Based on this scenario and the 
intensity guidance, the intensity forecast continues to show 
weakening, with the cyclone forecast to become a remnant low by 48 h 
and dissipate by 72 hr.


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of 
western Mexico and southern Baja California through this weekend. 
This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding and 
mudslides to portions of the area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of
Baja California Sur during the next several hours where Tropical 
Storm Warnings are in effect.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 669
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 AM CDT Thu Sep 12 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Thursday morning and afternoon from 550 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...As Francine's center continues moving northward over MS
and weakens further through midday (per NHC forecast), a slot of
wind/moisture/instability fields favorable for supercells and a few
tornadoes will shift slowly northward/inland as well.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles west southwest of Evergreen
AL to 35 miles south southeast of Marianna FL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 668. Watch number 668 will not be in effect after
550 AM CDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 50 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 16030.

Valid 111250Z - 111615Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for occasional tornadoes may begin to increase
near southeastern Louisiana coastal areas by late morning (10
AM-Noon).  Trends are being monitored for the possibility of a
tornado watch.

DISCUSSION...The center of Francine has been migrating across and
northeast of the Gunnison Oil Platform vicinity of the northwestern
Gulf of Mexico during the past hour or so, and is still roughly 170
miles from its forecast south central Louisiana coastal landfall
later today.  However, the leading edge of a broader convective
precipitation shield preceding Francine is beginning to overspread
coastal areas, accompanied by saturating thermodynamic profiles with
lapse rates trending moist adiabatic in mid-levels.

In the wake of this regime, and with the continued approach of
Francine, model forecast soundings suggest that a subtle increase in
boundary-layer temperatures and dew points may contribute to modest
destabilization by midday along coastal areas from west of
Boothville into the Vermilion Bay vicinity.  It appears that this
will coincide with more notable strengthening of low-level wind
fields, which are forecast to contribute to enlarging low-level
hodographs increasingly supportive of convection with embedded
low-level mesocyclones potentially capable of producing tornadoes.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will quickly intensify
Wednesday, as a shortwave perturbation and mid-level jet streak move
onshore over the West Coast. As the trough strengthens, mid-level
flow over much of the West will increase. A surface low will deepen
over the northern Great Basin, while a cold front moves onshore and
also strengthens. To the east, TS Francine will approach the Gulf
Coast with offshore winds likely over parts of the mid South. Strong
surface winds, low humidity, and thunderstorms over parts of the
West and central US will support critical fire-weather concerns
Wednesday.

...Great Basin...
Ahead of the deepening trough, a potent mid-level jet streak will
move over parts of the western Great Basin beginning early
Wednesday. A deepening surface low in parts of the eastern Basin
will drive 20-25 mph winds over much of NV into western UT.
Augmented by downslope flow off the Sierra and the approaching cold
front, a brief period of winds of 25-30 mph will be possible along
with RH below 15%. Widespread critical fire-weather conditions are
likely over parts of the Great Basin. Fire-weather concerns should
diminish behind the front as cooler and more quiescent conditions
are expected behind the front into early Thursday.

...Lee of the Rockies and High Plains...
As the trough approaches, height falls and stronger flow aloft will
overspread the Rockies and High Plains. A surface low will deepen
first in eastern MT, with a lee trough extending south into the
central High Plains. Near the lee trough, strong southerly winds
will overlap with areas of low RH and drying fine fuels. Elevated
fire weather concerns are expected over parts of the High Plains
Wednesday afternoon and evening.

...Mid South...
As Francine approaches the Gulf Coast Wednesday and Wednesday night,
offshore pressure gradients will increase over parts of the lower MS
Valley and Mid South. While humidity values are not expected to be
overly low with the tropical air mass approaching, strong gusts are
expected to overlap with areas of relatively dry fuels and little
recent rainfall. Brief elevated fire-weather conditions are possible
before rain chances increase into early Thursday.

...Northwest Thunder...
Ahead of the cold front, increasing mid-level moisture and strong
lift from the trough will promote scattered thunderstorms Wednesday
afternoon. Lightning may interact with areas of somewhat drier fuels
over parts of the Northwest and northern Rockies before broader
wetting rainfall develops. However, these storms will likely have
higher precipitation efficiency with a cooler air mass and more
plentiful Pacific moisture in place. This lends significant
uncertainty on the threat for any lightning ignitions.
