...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm potential should remain low today.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Convection producing lightning is expected to remain offshore from
the NC/SC Coast today, as an upper trough continues eastward over
the western Atlantic. Across the western CONUS, an amplified upper
trough/low is forecast to persist through the period while moving
slowly eastward. While cold mid-level temperatures will accompany
this feature and an occasional lightning flash may occur from parts
of CA into the Great Basin, low-level moisture and instability
should remain quite limited. Accordingly, overall thunderstorm
potential appears less than 10 percent.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong to severe thunderstorms posing a risk for gusty winds
and perhaps a tornado could still occur across parts of coastal
North Carolina this evening/tonight.

...20Z Update...
The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. Some of the
latest CAM guidance continues to show potential for surface-based
storms to impinge on the coastal Carolinas tonight, accompanied by
an isolated damaging gust/tornado threat.

..Squitieri.. 11/14/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1025 AM CST Thu Nov 14 2024/

...Coastal Carolinas...
Within an amplifying upper flow regime over the CONUS, an upper
trough over the Midwest/Upper Great Lakes will progress
east-southeastward toward the central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas through tonight. In response, steady surface
cyclogenesis (9-10mb/12hr) is expected tonight along the coastal
Carolinas, with some potential inland advancement of the offshore
warm/moist sector where middle 60s F surface dewpoints exist in
proximity to the Gulf Stream. 

Scenario-typical short-term model characteristics and biases are
experientially apparent in latest available guidance, with recent
NAM runs most optimistic for near-coastal/just-inland cyclogenesis
and destabilization, potentially too much so as compared to more
offshore GFS/ECMWF guidance given the expected increasingly
prevalent precipitation inland tonight. Regardless, some
near-coastal potential will exist tonight for a couple of
supercells/severe-caliber severe storms potentially capable of wind
damage and/or a tornado, with the North Carolina Outer Banks having
the primary vulnerability late this evening into the overnight.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Saturday.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Deep upper troughing is expected to extend from Alberta/Saskatchewan
southwestward to off the Baja Peninsula early Saturday morning. Two
shortwave troughs are forecast to evolve out of this parent
troughing as it moves gradually eastward throughout the day, with
the northernmost wave progressing across the northern Plains into
the Upper Midwest and the southernmost wave progressing
southeastward across southern CA into the northern/central Baja
Peninsula. By early Sunday morning, enhanced southwesterly flow
aloft is expected to extend between these two shortwaves, from
northern Mexico across the southern High Plains and central Plains
into the Upper Midwest.

Surface low associated with the northern shortwave trough will
likely begin the day over western SD before then progressing
northeastward across the central/eastern Dakotas and northwestern MN
throughout the period. An associated cold front will push
eastward/southeastward across the northern and central Plains and
into the Upper Midwest in the wake of this low.

Airmass modification is anticipated across the Plains throughout the
period as low-level flow veers to southeasterly across the western
Gulf of Mexico and a modest low-level jet develops in response to
the northern Plains shortwave trough. However, this early-stage
moisture return will remain confined to the southern Plains where
warm mid-level temperatures will preclude any buoyancy. A plume of
elevated moisture could support weak elevated convection from parts
of the central Plains late Saturday afternoon/early evening into the
into the upper Midwest late Saturday night into early Sunday.
Limited buoyancy should keep the severe-thunderstorm potential very
low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 PM CST Thu Nov 14 2024

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

The ongoing forecast for elevated fire-weather conditions tomorrow
(Friday) is still on track across portions of New England (see
previous discussion below).  The area was slightly expanded to the
north and south where meteorological conditions will be similar to
the rest of the area, and fuels are also abnormally dry (i.e., ERC
values exceeding the 90th percentile).

Over portions of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, strong
south-southwesterly surface winds and low RH are likely during the
afternoon hours, but fuels will likely not be receptive for
large-fire spread (i.e., ERC values generally below the 60th
percentile).

..Jirak.. 11/14/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CST Thu Nov 14 2024/

...Synopsis...
...New England...
Post-frontal offshore flow will return across the New England coast
on Friday. Relative humidity reductions to around 30-40 percent will
be possible with northwesterly breezes around 10-15 mph. Given
drought conditions and very little recent rainfall, Elevated fire
weather concerns will be likely with fuels in the region remaining
receptive to fire spread. 

...Southern Arizona and Western New Mexico...
A deepening trough will bring increasing westerly flow aloft and
strong southwesterly surface winds across portions of Arizona and
New Mexico. Relative humidity reductions to around 10-15 percent
will overlap sustained winds around 15-20 mph. Portions of
southeastern Arizona and western New Mexico have seen less recent
rain/snowfall, with potential for some drying of fine fuels
possible. Overall, ERCs are largely at or below the 50th percentile.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Friday.

...Synopsis...
A maturing mid-latitude cyclone is forecast to begin the period over
eastern NC before then continuing eastward into the western
Atlantic. A few lightning flashes are possible within the warm
conveyor of this cyclone early Friday morning, but any higher storm
coverage is expected to remain well offshore.

The upper pattern farther west across the majority of the CONUS is
expected to amplify as a strong trough gradually progresses from the
West Coast to the Intermountain West, and downstream ridging across
the Plains builds as it moves through the MS Valley. By early
Saturday morning, the upper troughing is forecast to extend from
Alberta/Saskatchewan southwestward to off southern CA/northern Baja
Peninsula, and upper ridging will likely extend from the central
Gulf of Mexico through the Upper Great Lakes into northwestern
Ontario. 

A few flashes are possible along the trough as it moves across
northern/central CA and into the Great Basin, supported by cold
mid-level temperatures and strong ascent. However, coverage is
currently expected to remain below 10%. A dry continental airmass
and warm mid-level temperatures will remain over the Plains,
precluding any buoyancy.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL GULF COAST AND ALONG PARTS OF THE WEST COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, associated with a marginal threat for
tornadoes and wind damage, will be possible across the central Gulf
Coast this evening. Isolated severe gusts will also be possible
along parts of the West Coast.

...Central Gulf Coast...
A mid-level trough, evident on water vapor imagery, is moving into
the Ark-La-Tex. Further to the east, a lead shortwave trough is
moving through the central Gulf Coast states, where a moist airmass
is in place. Surface dewpoints across the central Gulf Coast region
range from the mid 70s F near the coast to the mid 60s F over much
of southwestern Alabama. Scattered thunderstorms are ongoing near
the moist axis. The stronger cells are expected to move
northeastward across far southern Mississippi and into southwest
Alabama this evening. RAP forecasts soundings in far southwest
Alabama at 03Z have MLCAPE near 750 J/kg, 0-6 km shear in the 35 to
40 knot range, and some directional shear in the low to mid-levels.
This should be sufficient for a marginal severe threat this evening.
A potential for isolated severe gusts may exist with semi-organized
line segments. A marginal tornado threat will also be possible with
the more discrete rotating cells.

...West Coast...
A mid-level trough is evident on water vapor imagery over southwest
Oregon and northern California. Mid-level moisture associated with
the trough, large-scale ascent and steep lapse rates are
contributing to thunderstorm potential along the coast of northern
California, Oregon and Washington. Some of the storms may become
strong enough to mix low-level winds of about 35 to 40 knots down to
the surface. A few gusts could approach severe limits this evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CST Wed Nov 13 2024

Valid 151200Z - 211200Z

Fire weather concerns are anticipated across parts of the country
through the extended period - particularly across portions of the
Northeast and southern California coast where active wildfires have
been noted over the past several days. Long-range ensemble guidance
depicts an active upper-level regime through the middle of next
week, characterized by the passage of highly amplified upper waves
across the country. Widespread precipitation chances will accompany
these waves with recent ensemble guidance suggesting most locations
will see at least some chance for wetting precipitation over the
next week. Two exceptions to this are the New England region and
southern CA/lower CO River Valley where rain chances are minimal
during the D3-8 period. Despite seasonal temperatures, continued
rain shortfalls should promote drying fuels. 

...D3/Fri to Sun/D5 - New England...
The passage of a cold front late D2/Thursday into D3/Friday will
establish an offshore flow regime along the New England coast. Cool,
but dry, continental air filtering into the region should promote
diurnal RH reductions into the 30-40% range (though possibly as low
as 25% for some locations). Although winds are not expected to be
overly strong given a gradually weakening pressure gradient,
somewhat breezy conditions coupled with the drying trend and
receptive fuels will promote fire concerns for the late week and
into the weekend. 

...D3/Fri - Arizona/New Mexico...
An amplifying upper trough across the West Coast will support
widespread pressure falls across the greater Four Corners with an
attendant mass response across AZ and NM. Latest deterministic and
ensemble guidance show strong signals for 15-25% RH and 20-30 mph
southwest winds across eastern AZ into west/southwest NM where
10-hour fuels remain dry after several days of limited rainfall.
While ERCs remain somewhat low (generally below the 60th
percentile), drying of fine fuels through the remainder of the week
should support a fire concern. 

...D7/Tue to D8/Wed - Southern California...
Long-range ensemble guidance has begun to show a signal for an
offshore flow event during the early/middle part of the upcoming
work week. Both the GEFS and ECENS show reasonably good agreement in
an unseasonably strong (1040-1045 mb) surface high building across
the northern Great Basin/northern Rockies in the wake of a strong
upper trough. This signal suggests that offshore pressure gradients
may be sufficiently strong to support critical wind speeds off the
terrain of the southern CA coast. Given antecedent receptive fuels
(as evident by ongoing large fires) and the anticipated downslope
warming/drying, critical fire weather conditions appear possible
during the D7/Tue to D8/Wed period.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may impact parts of the
Texas South Plains and Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle vicinity this
evening, possibly accompanied by some risk for hail and gusty winds.

...Southern High Plains...
An upper-level trough over the eastern Great Basin/Four Corners at
midday will continue eastward toward the south-central High Plains
tonight. Gradual lee-side cyclogenesis will occur particularly late
today into tonight, with a sharpening southern High Plains
dryline/lee trough, with an eastward-moving Pacific cold front that
will overtake the dryline/lee trough from west-to-east tonight.
Modest-caliber low-level moisture return will occur
north-northwestward across the southern High Plains, with surface
dewpoints tending to remain limited to the upper 40s/lower 50s F
into this evening.

It still appears likely that deep convective potential across
northwest Texas and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles will remain
limited through peak heating, owing to the moisture limitations and
a persistent capping inversion. Isolated thunderstorm development
will become more probable after sunset as lift associated with a
strengthening low-level jet increases, and as the surface cold front
overtakes the lee trough.

While MUCAPE is expected to remain rather weak (generally 500-1000
J/kg or less), strong deep-layer shear will support organized
updrafts with any sustained convection. Isolated hail appears to be
the main threat, as thunderstorms should have a tendency to remain
slightly elevated. But, some chance for strong/gusty winds may also
exist. The window for severe hail should remain small in space and
time this evening, as convection will likely grow upscale fairly
quickly. Even so, small hail may occur farther north/east into parts
of Kansas and Oklahoma overnight into early Wednesday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0910 AM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The Elevated area in the Northeast was expanded southward based on
current observations (winds gusting 20-45 mph, RH of 40-60%) and the
latest high-resolution forecast guidance. RH and temperatures will
be close to elevated criteria, but wind gusts of 25-50 mph and near
to record setting high fire danger will create elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions in the outlook area. 

The Elevated area in southern California remains on track. Overnight
RH recovery was moderate to excellent with north-northwest wind
gusts of 25-60 mph early this morning. The strongest winds will
struggle to overlap with elevated/critical RH, but elevated fire
weather conditions remain likely in portions of the Transverse
Ranges/vicinity, primarily on southern/ocean-facing slopes.

..Nauslar.. 11/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Tue Nov 12 2024/

...Synopsis...
...Southern California...
A weak cold front will move across southern California through the
morning. Behind this frontal passage, gusty northwest winds
will be enhanced near favored downslope terrain features across
Santa Barbra and Ventura Counties. Relative humidity will hover
around elevated thresholds. Relative humidity will decrease,
especially at mid/upper slopes, below critical relative humidity
thresholds with poor overnight recovery tonight into D2/Wednesday
morning. However, winds are expected to weaken below thresholds
during this period. An Elevated delineation was maintained with this
outlook.

...New England...
Gusty northwesterly flow will overlap relative humidity reductions
to 35-40 percent across New England this afternoon. Though relative
humidity will be marginal, recent fire activity has shown fuels in
this region are receptive to fire spread with drought conditions and
very little recent rainfall. An Elevated delineation was included to
cover this threat, given the potential for strong and gusty winds.
