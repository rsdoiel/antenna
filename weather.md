Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1038 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Cool temperature, weak winds and recent/ongoing precipitation over
much of the CONUS will keep fire-weather concerns minimal through
the forecast period.

..Lyons.. 12/17/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023/

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper pattern will characterize the synoptic
environment over the CONUS today, with multiple mid-level troughs
traversing the eastern U.S. as a third mid-level trough impinges on
the California coastline. Regardless, surface high pressure and
associated cooler air will surge southeast across the Rockies toward
the Mississippi Valley, with wet conditions likely along the West
Coast, mitigating major wildfire-spread concerns across the CONUS.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1028 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Valid 171630Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging gusts and a couple of tornadoes will be possible
through tonight across the coastal Carolinas.

...Discussion...
Recent surface analysis shows a low just off the northeastern
Florida/southeastern Georgia coast at this time, which is progged to
steadily deepen while shifting north-northeastward through tonight. 
At this time, what appears to be the most likely track for the low
will be to remain just off the South Carolina coast through the
daytime hours, and then possibly move just inland across coastal
North Carolina or the Outer Banks overnight.  

North of the low track, widespread/steady precipitation is ongoing,
which should reinforce a persistent cool/stable boundary layer
inland through the daytime hours.  With that said, the favorably
strong/veering wind field observed within the northeast quadrant of
the low continues to support occasionally rotating cells just
offshore.  This will continue, along with gradually increasing
potential that a couple of these cells will begin moving inland
across South Carolina coastal counties northeast of Charleston. 
While any storms would become increasingly elevated along their
inland advance, storms may remain rooted near enough to the surface
across immediate coastal counties of northeastern South Carolina --
and then later over eastern North Carolina and in particular the
Outer Banks -- to yield risk for a couple of tornadoes, and possibly
locally damaging wind gusts.  As such, will maintain current
delineation of the SLGT risk area just inland across South Carolina
for today, and then across eastern North Carolina and the Outer
Banks area for this evening and overnight.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0646 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH TONIGHT
ACROSS THE COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging gusts and a tornado or two will be possible
through tonight across the coastal Carolinas.

...Coastal Carolinas through tonight...
A deepening cyclone will progress from north FL this morning to
eastern NC by 09-12z Monday, in response to gradual phasing of Gulf
of Mexico shortwave troughs with a larger-scale trough over the
eastern CONUS.  Midlevel drying with the passage of a lead shortwave
trough and diminished ascent have acted to limit deep convection
across FL overnight.  Any lingering severe threat will end across
southeast FL by mid-late morning as drying occurs from the west and
vertical shear continues to weaken.  The cyclone will skirt the GA
coast during the day and then approach SC this afternoon and NC
tonight.  A narrow portion of the surface warm sector could spread
far enough inland to support some threat for near-surface-based
convection across the coastal Carolinas, where vertical shear will
be strong.  However, poor lapse rates aloft will tend to limit
buoyancy in the zone of stronger forcing for ascent where vertical
shear will be strongest, and cool shelf waters will likely maintain
a shallow stable layer near the coast.  Will maintain the outlook
area given the conditional potential for isolated damaging gusts and
a tornado or two, but it is not clear how much of the potential will
be realized inland.

...Northern CA coast...
To the east of a closed low over the eastern Pacific, isolated
lightning flashes will be possible with embedded/elevated
convection.
