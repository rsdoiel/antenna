Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0639 AM CST Tue Feb 04 2025

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorm development will be possible
across central California and along the Oregon Coast, but no severe
thunderstorms are expected.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A mid/upper cyclone is currently centered off the Pacific
Northwest/British Columbia coast, with moderate southwesterly flow
aloft extending from the base of this low across much of the West
Coast. A low-amplitude shortwave trough is currently moving through
this southwesterly flow into central CA, with continued
northeastward progression across the Great Basin expected today.
Another shortwave trough is expected to follow quickly behind the
first, moving into central CA tonight. Cooler mid-level temperatures
will accompany this second shortwave, supporting the potential for a
few lightning flashes as the frontal band moves ashore. Cooler
temperatures aloft and increased forcing for ascent ahead of a third
shortwave trough could also support isolated lightning flashes early
tomorrow morning along the OR Coast.  

Farther east, upper ridging is expected to amplify as it shifts
eastward across the Plains. At the same time, a fast-moving,
low-amplitude shortwave trough will progress through southern
Ontario and the Northeast. Additional southward progress of the cold
front that currently extends from the Mid-Atlantic, TN Valley,
Mid-South, and TX will be limited, with the portion of this front
over TX potentially returning northward as a warm front Wednesday
morning. Warm mid-level temperatures and associated poor lapse rates
will limit buoyancy along this boundary, precluding any thunderstorm
potential.

## SPC Feb 4, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Tue Feb 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models are in reasonably good agreement through day 6
(Sunday), in terms of large-scale features.  Substantial divergence
begins thereafter, casting substantial uncertainty into the forecast
beyond the upcoming weekend.

Day 4, as an upper short-wave trough crossing the Northeast moves
into/across the Canadian Maritimes, the quasi-zonal flow pattern
over the U.S. will continue.  Weak amplification of the flow will
occur over the West with time, however, as a short-wave trough moves
across the Rockies.  As this occurs, frontal low development is
expected along the persistent west-to-east front lying from the
southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic region.  However, with only weak
instability expected near the developing low, and eastward along the
front, convection is forecast to remain disorganized.

Day 5, the upper wave is forecast to continue eastward across the
central and northern Plains through the day, and into and across the
Great Lakes region overnight.  The associated frontal low --
initially progged to lie over the Oklahoma vicinity, will deepen as
it shifts east-northeastward with time, reaching the northeast
through the end of the period.  The trailing surface front will
sharpen and advance southeastward, extending from the Mid-Atlantic
region southwestward to coastal Texas late.  While showers and a few
thunderstorms will be associated with the frontal advance, weak
instability anticipated at this time should again hinder convective
intensity.

Day 6, as the low moves offshore and the front continues advancing
steadily southeastward, it should clear the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts
during the evening, lingering only across Florida through the end of
the period.  The continued trend of weak instability, as well as
weakening flow with southward extent, should hinder prospects for
more robust convection.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2025-02-02, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 AM CST Sun Feb 02 2025

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Predominately zonal mid-level flow will persist over much of the
CONUS D2/Monday. Low-amplitude ridging within the zonal flow should
slowly build over the central Plains supporting relatively quiescent
weather. While occasional gusty surface winds are expected near a
lee trough across the High Plains, overall fire-weather conditions
appear limited.

...Southern Plains...
Occasional dry and breezy conditions will continue across the
southern Plains through Day2/Monday. A lee low and cold front over
west TX could support occasional gusts to 15 mph. Dry conditions
should also persist, though stronger southerly flow should increase
humidity gradually. Additional drying of fuels is likely with little
to no precipitation expected. This could support localized
fire-weather potential across the southern High Plains, but
widespread concerns are not expected.
