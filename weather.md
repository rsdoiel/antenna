Mesoscale Discussion 1130
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 368...

Valid 052051Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 368
continues.

SUMMARY...Risk of very large hail continues across parts of the
Texas Trans-Pecos.

DISCUSSION...Splitting supercells are ongoing across the TX
Trans-Pecos -- in an environment with long/fairly straight
hodographs (around 40-50 kt of effective shear) and 2000-3000 J/kg
MLCAPE. Given the continued splitting/semi-discrete mode, very large
hail (3+ inches) remains the primary concern. In particular, a
large/persistent supercell cluster undergoing additional storm
merging west of Fort Stockton should pose a risk of very large hail
and severe wind gusts -- especially given recent signs of southward
propagation.

Mesoscale Discussion 1129
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0346 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...far eastern NM...TX South Plains

Concerning...Tornado Watch 367...

Valid 052046Z - 052245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 367 continues.

SUMMARY...Supercell hail and tornado potential increasing through 23
UTC.  A strong tornado or two is probable once a dominant
right-moving supercell becomes established.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite/radar mosaic shows the
outflow/differential heating zone and maturing updrafts becoming
sustained along the boundary.  Enhanced storm-relative environmental
helicity (SRH) and elongated hodographs and a very unstable airmass
will strongly favor discrete supercell development.  Giant hail is
forecast over the next 1-3 hours with the stronger supercells (3 to
4 inches in diameter).  The tornado risk will markedly increase over
the next 0.5 to 2 hours as storms begin to propagate within the
moist boundary layer with backed low-level flow and enlarged
hodographs.

Mesoscale Discussion 1128

0333 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southwest Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 369...

Valid 052033Z - 052200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 369 continues.

SUMMARY...Risk of very large hail continues with an eastward-moving
supercell in far southwest KS. Tornado risk may be increasing as
well.

DISCUSSION...Ahead of a weak lee cyclone and surface boundary over
far southeastern CO, a supercell has evolved over far southwest KS.
A long/mostly straight hodograph (around 50 kt of 0-6 km shear) per
DDC VWP and moderate surface-based instability should continue to
favor large to very large hail and locally severe gusts with this
activity. Ahead of this storm, visible satellite imagery still shows
billow cloud structures -- indicating antecedent boundary-layer
static stability. However, the associated sheltered boundary layer
should be accompanied by enhanced low-level SRH, and given the
established mesocyclone, the tornado risk may be increasing.

Mesoscale Discussion 1127
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0320 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...southeast OH...northern WV...southwest PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 052020Z - 052215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe gusts capable of wind damage may
focus across southeast OH eastward into northern portions of WV and
southwest PA through 7-8pm EDT.

DISCUSSION...An MCV evident in radar imagery has moved
north-northeastward across western OH and another portion of this
mid-level vorticity maximum is moving east across south-central OH. 
The southern portion of this larger-scale convective-aided
disturbance is likely acting to enhance thunderstorm development
across the eastern 1/3rd of OH late this afternoon.  Surface
conditions ahead of the storm activity in southeast OH have warmed
into the lower 80s with dewpoints in the lower 60s.  Objective
analysis data shows around 1000 J/kg MLCAPE but effective shear at
or below 20 kt.  As a result, storm organization potential will
likely remain limited in terms of more organized multicellular
modes.  However, the MCV may act to focus thunderstorms and an
isolated risk for damaging gusts for the next several hours across
parts of the upper OH Valley.

Mesoscale Discussion 1126

0306 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 052006Z - 052200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of severe wind gusts and large hail could
continue spreading eastward across central Oklahoma this afternoon.
Trends are being monitored for a possible downstream watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has become increasingly organized
as it tracks eastward along a boundary across west-central OK, as it
interacts with a warm/moist air mass amid 40 kt of effective shear.
While an earlier ACARS sounding from OKC and mesoanalysis suggest
lingering inhibition ahead of the ongoing cluster of storms,
continued diurnal heating amid upper 60s dewpoints and modestly
steep lapse rates could support the maintenance of these storms with
eastward extent across central OK through the afternoon. If this
were to occur, the 40 kt of effective shear would continue to
promote an organized cluster (and possibly embedded supercell
structure) -- capable of severe winds gusts and large hail.
Convective trends are being monitored for a possible watch
downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 366.

Mesoscale Discussion 1125
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0245 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeastern NM into the far western OK/TX
Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051945Z - 052145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of severe storms capable of producing large hail
and severe wind gusts will increase over the next few hours. The
tornado threat could eventually increase with east-southeastward
extent.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are developing along a wind shift over
northeastern NM this afternoon. Ahead of these evolving storms,
upper 50s to lower 60s dewpoints are contributing to moderate
surface-based instability -- given steep midlevel lapse rates.
Around 50 kt of effective shear (characterized by a long/straight
hodograph) oriented parallel to the zone of low-level ascent should
support a few supercell clusters as they move east-southeast into
the increasingly unstable air. Initial storms will pose a risk of
very large hail and severe wind gusts. The severe risk becomes more
uncertain with southeastward extent into the western TX Panhandle.
However, if storms can mature into this region, enhanced low-level
helicity would favor an increasing tornado threat as well. Trends
are being monitored for a possible watch over the area.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 371
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central Oklahoma

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A cluster of storms with embedded bowing/supercell
structures will likely persist while moving east-southeastward
through central Oklahoma (especially the southern half of the OKC
metro).  Damaging gusts of 60-70 mph and large hail up to 1.5 inches
in diameter will be possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles east northeast
of Oklahoma City OK to 60 miles southeast of Oklahoma City OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Areas affected...Parts of the southern Great Basin and Southwest

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051906Z - 052130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe downbursts are possible with high-based
thunderstorms through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered high-based thunderstorms are evolving
across the southern Great Basin into the Southwest. Diurnal heating
beneath steep midlevel lapse rates (sampled by the 12Z VEF sounding)
and sufficient midlevel moisture are yielding a weakly unstable air
mass. While weak deep-layer flow/shear should generally limit storm
longevity/organization, enhanced evaporative cooling amid the steep
low-level lapse rates will support strong to severe downbursts with
the stronger cores. Severe-gust potential will be maximized with any
small clusters that can develop.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 370
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM MDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Colorado
  Far Western Kansas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify through the afternoon.  Initially cellular storms will
pose mainly a risk for large hail and severe gusts, but a tornado is
also possible.  This activity will likely evolve into a cluster of
storms towards the evening with the risk for severe gusts possibly
becoming more prevalent.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Akron
CO to La Junta CO. For a complete depiction of the watch see the
associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
125 PM CDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 125 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Splitting supercells are expected to form early this
afternoon immediately east of the Guadalupe and Davis Mountains, and
spread eastward into the Pecos Valley through this evening.  The
most intense storms will be capable of producing very large hail up
to 3.5 inches in diameter and isolated severe outflow gusts of 60-75
mph.  An isolated tornado or two may occur with favorable storm
interactions in the strongly unstable environment.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 20 miles northeast of
Wink TX to 45 miles west southwest of Dryden TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update

Tornado Watch Number 367
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
120 PM CDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  East central and southeast New Mexico
  West central Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 120 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered supercell development is expected by mid
afternoon, and storms will spread eastward through late evening. 
The initial supercells could produce very large hail of 3-4 inches
in diameter, with an increasing threat for tornadoes (a couple of
which could be strong) as the storms interact with a residual
outflow boundary.  There will also be some potential for upscale
growth by this evening, with the potential for severe outflow winds
up to 75 mph.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 95 statute miles
north and south of a line from 70 miles east southeast of Lubbock TX
to 70 miles north of Carlsbad NM. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern and
central Plains into tonight. Several tornadoes (some possibly
strong), large to very large hail, and severe gusts are possible.
Severe gusts are also possible over parts of the Northeast this
afternoon.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast largely remains on track with only some
adjustments needed. The primary change was an expansion of 15%
hail/wind probabilities east of the Front Range in CO where deep
convection is beginning to develop. Recent guidance continues to
display a dry bias across eastern CO where dewpoints have increased
to the low to mid 50s. Consequently, buoyancy is considerably higher
than previously anticipated by morning model solutions, which should
increase the potential for robust/severe thunderstorms as convection
begins to develop along subtle low-level confluence axes. See MCD
#1123 for additional near-term details. 

A cold pool associated with a convective cluster across western OK
casts some uncertainty regarding the evolution of the convective
environment downstream of maturing storms over southeast CO later
this afternoon/evening. However, heating to the south of the cold
pool may yield a focused boundary for convective
development/propagation later tonight amid a modest strengthening of
southerly low-level flow around/after 00 UTC. Recent HRRR/RRFS
solutions appear to capture the ongoing trends well and continue to
suggest a well-organized cluster/MCS will emerge out of southwest KS
into the recovering air mass across northwest OK later tonight. As
such, risk probabilities are maintained. 

Further south across western TX, the psuedo warm front/outflow
boundary is becoming increasingly apparent in GOES visible imagery.
A few initial attempts at convective initiation are noted along this
boundary with sustained convection becoming more probable through
mid-afternoon as residual capping continues to erode (evident by
dissipating billow clouds). The expectation is that the tornado
threat will likely be maximized along this boundary through the
evening hours given enhanced low-level SRH and the potential for
long storm residence times. The 10% tornado risk area has been
adjusted to account for this potential. 

Elsewhere, the forecast largely remains on track. See MCDs 1118,
1121, 1122, 1123, 1124, and 1125 for additional near-term details.

..Moore.. 06/05/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025/

...Southern High Plains...
Morning surface analysis depicts a convectively reinforced
quasi-stationary surface boundary extending across north-central TX
westward through the TX South Plains to southeast/east-central NM.
This boundary may have a tendency of moving slowly northward as a
warm front over the High Plains later this afternoon -- in response
to an approaching midlevel impulse and gradually deepening lee
cyclone over southeast CO. Along/immediately south of this boundary
(over the TX South Plains), deep/rich boundary-layer moisture (upper
60s/lower 70s dewpoints) is in place, with impressive moisture
sampled by the 12Z MAF sounding (15.8 g/kg mean mixing ratio).
Persistent cloud coverage will tend to shelter this moisture from
diurnally driven boundary-layer mixing through the afternoon, while
heating in cloud breaks will still yield strong surface-based
instability (upwards of 3000 J/kg MLCAPE). As a low-amplitude
impulse and related jet streak advance east-northeastward across the
central High Plains, peripheral large-scale ascent will aid in
scattered thunderstorm development across east-central/southeast NM
into the TX South Plains -- focused near the intersection of the
northward-moving warm front and lee trough. Around 50-60 kt of
effective shear and the modest large-scale ascent will favor
discrete supercells, initially posing a risk of very large hail.
However, a strengthening evening low-level jet atop the backed
low-level flow near the boundary will support enlarging clockwise
hodographs (300+ m2/s2 effective SRH). Given the deep/rich moisture
and enhanced helicity, a focused corridor for tornadoes (some
possibly strong) is evident over the TX South Plains -- where
10-percent tornado probabilities were added. Localized upscale
growth into organized clusters is expected into western North Texas
this evening, where a swath of severe wind is possible.

Father south from the TX South Plains to parts of the TX Trans-Pecos
vicinity, deep boundary-layer mixing amid lower/middle 60s dewpoints
will contribute to moderate-strong surface-based instability, with a
long (albeit straighter) hodograph away from the surface boundary.
This will also support intense discrete/semi-discrete supercells,
though the primary concern here will be very large hail (possibly 3+
inches). 

...Central High Plains into the southern Plains...
In the left-exit region of a 40-50-kt midlevel jet streak impinging
on the central High Plains, thunderstorm development is expected
ahead of a gradually deepening lee cyclone over southeastern CO this
afternoon. Diurnal heating (within cloud breaks) of a moist air mass
(lower 60s dewpoints) will yield moderate surface-based instability
ahead of developing storms. Given around 50 kt of effective shear
(characterized by a long/generally straight hodograph), several
semi-discrete supercell clusters are expected. Large hail and severe
wind gusts are expected, though the rich/sheltered boundary-layer
moisture and sufficient low-level streamwise vorticity for
established right-mover cells will support a couple tornadoes as
well. With time, storms will spread east-southeastward into
northwest OK -- where upscale growth into an MCS seems increasingly
likely. This will favor an increased risk of a swath of severe wind
gusts into the overnight hours. 

...Northeast...
Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected along/ahead of a cold
front draped across the region this afternoon. Visible satellite
imagery shows a moist/destabilizing air mass ahead of the front,
where moderate surface-based instability is expected. The warm/moist
air mass, combined with around 30 kt of effective shear, should
promote a few loosely organized clusters capable of producing wind
damage -- aided by the steepening boundary-layer lapse rates.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Valid 071200Z - 131200Z

The sub-tropical ridge across the Gulf early in the period will
retrograde toward the western US and then briefly amplify as a
shortwave trough digs southeast across the East. This amplification
will bring a period of warming/drying across the West but the
duration should be brief as the pattern quickly flattens in response
to the approach of a couple of low-amplitude troughs.

This overall pattern will yield cooler and wetter conditions across
much of the eastern US, with at least a short period of warmer,
drier conditions across the West as the ridge amplifies. However,
fuel moisture across the West should be high enough to preclude
widespread critical fire weather conditions. 

Late in the period as low-amplitude troughs impinge upon the
sub-tropical ridge, an increase in thunderstorm potential may occur.
Dry thunderstorms will be possible, especially with the first
trough, but the details (timing and location) are too uncertain to
introduce probabilities.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level and surface pattern on Friday will be quite similar
to Thursday. Dry and windy conditions are still possible in
Southwest, though surface winds may be slightly weaker on account of
a weaker pressure gradient. Another day of locally elevated
conditions are possible, but the overall fire weather threat should
be low. Thunderstorms are probable over the same areas of the Great
Basin. These storms will likely bring wetting rainfall and
significant lightning ignition concerns are not expected.

Day 3 Convective Outlook

0211 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected from the southern Great
Plains to the Southeast States on Saturday through Saturday evening.
Damaging winds should be the primary hazard.

...Southern Plains to the Southeast...

A series of upper shortwave troughs will be located over the central
Plains and the central/southern Appalachians Saturday morning,
providing a belt of enhanced mid/upper westerly flow across the
region. An MCS is likely to be ongoing across OK at the beginning of
the period. This activity may weaken through the morning as it
shifts east into AR through midday. Downstream across the Mid-South,
a corridor of moderate to strong instability is forecast amid rich
boundary-layer moisture. Convection will likely redevelop/intensify
by early afternoon and shift east across parts the TN Valley to SC
through the evening hours. Additional convection may develop across
eastern NC during the afternoon within a moderately unstable airmass
and within enhanced mid/upper flow associated with the eastern upper
shortwave trough. Swaths of scattered damaging gusts will be the
main hazard with this activity.

More isolated convection may develop along residual outflow and
within a corridor of strong heating and low-level upslope flow
across the southern High Plains late Saturday afternoon. A deeply
mixed boundary layer and supercell wind profiles amid steep midlevel
lapse rates could support isolated severe wind/hail despite weak
forcing for ascent. 

...Eastern Dakotas into northwest MN...

A deepening upper shortwave trough over the Canadian Prairies will
develop southeast across the northern Plains on Saturday.
Boundary-layer moisture will remain modest, with surface dewpoints
generally remaining in the upper 40s to mid 50s F ahead of a
southeastward-advancing cold front. Nevertheless, cooling aloft and
surface heating into the 80s will support weak instability and
steepened low-level lapse rates. Vertically veering wind profiles,
with 30-40 kt flow from 850-500 mb will support organized cells.
Isolated strong gusts could occur with this activity during the
afternoon and early evening.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1228 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS TO THE TN/LOWER OH VALLEYS...AND ACROSS PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected from the southern High
Plains to the Tennessee and Lower Ohio Valleys on Friday into Friday
night. Damaging winds and a couple tornadoes are the main hazards.
Large to very large hail is possible over the southern High Plains.
Additional severe storms producing damaging wind gusts are possible
across portions of southern New England Friday afternoon.

...Central/Southern High Plains into OK...

An MCS will likely be ongoing Friday morning across portions of the
Ozarks and arcing into parts of OK. The southern end of this
convection over the southern Plains will likely weaken during the
morning with an outflow reinforced boundary becoming oriented across
southern OK into the southern TX Panhandle/South Plains and
east-central NM. It is uncertain how far northward this boundary may
modify northward through the afternoon. Southerly low-level flow
will maintain a very moist airmass (mid 60s to low 70s F dewpoints)
near and south of the boundary, with more modest dewpoints (50s to
low 60s F) further north from eastern CO/northeast NM into southern
KS/northern OK.

Moderate westerly flow aloft will persist through the day, with
neutral height tendencies until late (after 06z) in the period when
some modest height falls are forecast as a shortwave impulse moves
east/southeast across the central Rockies into the central Plains.
This will aid in the development of a 30-40 kt southwesterly jet
across the southern High Plains during the overnight hours. 

The expectation is that isolated to widely scattered supercells will
develop over the higher terrain of southeast CO/eastern NM/far west
TX in a moist upslope flow regime as strong heating occurs through
the afternoon. Stronger MLCAPE (up to 3000 J/kg) will be confined to
the area near the surface outflow where stronger low-level moisture
will be focused. Elongated/straight hodographs above 2 km and steep
midlevel lapse rates suggest large to very large hail will be
possible (greater than 2 inch diameter) in addition to strong gusts.
There is some potential convection could organize into a southeast
propagating cluster/MCS moving from southeast CO/northeast NM into
the northwest OK overnight. Higher outlook probabilities could
become necessary if confidence in this scenario increases and as
mesoscale details (location of surface outflows) become better
resolved. 

...Ozarks to TN/Lower OH Valleys...

An MCV tied to ongoing morning MCS over the Ozarks will develop
eastward into the OH Valley through evening. Morning convection may
weaken initially before re-invigoration/redevelopment occurs during
the afternoon as the downstream airmass becomes moderately to
strongly unstable, aided by strong heating and dewpoints in the
upper 60s/low 70s F. Damaging gusts will be the main hazard with
this activity, especially if updraft consolidation occurs within
storm clusters closer to the MCV where midlevel flow will be
enhanced, resulting in some forward propagation. Vertical shear will
be more modest with southward extent, but instability will be
stronger, supporting at least an isolated severe wind risk into the
TN Valley vicinity.

...Portions of southern New England...

A weak surface boundary will be draped across portions of New
England into central OH Friday afternoon. Ahead of this boundary,
rich low-level moisture (mid 60s to low 70s F) dewpoints will be
focused in a corridor from eastern PA into MA/CT and southern
VT/NH/ME. Strong heating within this corridor will result in a
narrow corridor of moderate destabilization (MLCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg). Steepened low-level lapse rates also will foster DCAPE
near 1000 J/kg. Vertical shear will remain modest, around 20-25 kt
effective shear magnitudes, but strong instability will support
strong to severe storms capable of damaging gusts through the
afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Valid 051630Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern and
central Plains into tonight. Several tornadoes (some possibly
strong), large to very large hail, and severe gusts are possible.
Severe gusts are also possible over parts of the Northeast this
afternoon.

...Southern High Plains...
Morning surface analysis depicts a convectively reinforced
quasi-stationary surface boundary extending across north-central TX
westward through the TX South Plains to southeast/east-central NM.
This boundary may have a tendency of moving slowly northward as a
warm front over the High Plains later this afternoon -- in response
to an approaching midlevel impulse and gradually deepening lee
cyclone over southeast CO. Along/immediately south of this boundary
(over the TX South Plains), deep/rich boundary-layer moisture (upper
60s/lower 70s dewpoints) is in place, with impressive moisture
sampled by the 12Z MAF sounding (15.8 g/kg mean mixing ratio).
Persistent cloud coverage will tend to shelter this moisture from
diurnally driven boundary-layer mixing through the afternoon, while
heating in cloud breaks will still yield strong surface-based
instability (upwards of 3000 J/kg MLCAPE). As a low-amplitude
impulse and related jet streak advance east-northeastward across the
central High Plains, peripheral large-scale ascent will aid in
scattered thunderstorm development across east-central/southeast NM
into the TX South Plains -- focused near the intersection of the
northward-moving warm front and lee trough. Around 50-60 kt of
effective shear and the modest large-scale ascent will favor
discrete supercells, initially posing a risk of very large hail.
However, a strengthening evening low-level jet atop the backed
low-level flow near the boundary will support enlarging clockwise
hodographs (300+ m2/s2 effective SRH). Given the deep/rich moisture
and enhanced helicity, a focused corridor for tornadoes (some
possibly strong) is evident over the TX South Plains -- where
10-percent tornado probabilities were added. Localized upscale
growth into organized clusters is expected into western North Texas
this evening, where a swath of severe wind is possible.

Father south from the TX South Plains to parts of the TX Trans-Pecos
vicinity, deep boundary-layer mixing amid lower/middle 60s dewpoints
will contribute to moderate-strong surface-based instability, with a
long (albeit straighter) hodograph away from the surface boundary.
This will also support intense discrete/semi-discrete supercells,
though the primary concern here will be very large hail (possibly 3+
inches). 

...Central High Plains into the southern Plains...
In the left-exit region of a 40-50-kt midlevel jet streak impinging
on the central High Plains, thunderstorm development is expected
ahead of a gradually deepening lee cyclone over southeastern CO this
afternoon. Diurnal heating (within cloud breaks) of a moist air mass
(lower 60s dewpoints) will yield moderate surface-based instability
ahead of developing storms. Given around 50 kt of effective shear
(characterized by a long/generally straight hodograph), several
semi-discrete supercell clusters are expected. Large hail and severe
wind gusts are expected, though the rich/sheltered boundary-layer
moisture and sufficient low-level streamwise vorticity for
established right-mover cells will support a couple tornadoes as
well. With time, storms will spread east-southeastward into
northwest OK -- where upscale growth into an MCS seems increasingly
likely. This will favor an increased risk of a swath of severe wind
gusts into the overnight hours. 

...Northeast...
Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected along/ahead of a cold
front draped across the region this afternoon. Visible satellite
imagery shows a moist/destabilizing air mass ahead of the front,
where moderate surface-based instability is expected. The warm/moist
air mass, combined with around 30 kt of effective shear, should
promote a few loosely organized clusters capable of producing wind
damage -- aided by the steepening boundary-layer lapse rates.

...Synopsis...
Broad troughing in the West will persist today. A stalled boundary
will be located in the central Great Basin. Some enhancement to
mid-level flow will occur across the Southwest. This will lead to
dry and breezy conditions in parts of eastern Arizona and western
New Mexico. However, fuel indices have recently decreased due to
precipitation. Only locally elevated conditions are expected.
Scattered storms are expected near the Great Basin boundary. Given
storm coverage, slow storm motions, and limited fuel receptiveness
in most locations, lightning ignition potential should remain low.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM FAR
SOUTHEAST NM INTO THE TX SOUTH PLAINS...AND FROM FAR SOUTHEAST CO
INTO SOUTHWEST KS AND THE OK PANHANDLE....

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the High Plains
from southwestern Kansas into west Texas. A few tornadoes, large to
isolated very large hail, and severe gusts are possible.

...Southern High Plains...
A modest MCS has persisted through the early morning, moving from
the TX Panhandle into northwest TX. This MCS will likely continue
southeastward into more of north TX over the next several hours. The
downstream airmass is forecast to become increasingly unstable amid
daytime heating, suggesting there is some potential for this system
to strengthen once heating commences in earnest. However, vertical
shear will remain modest, likely limiting the overall organization
and intensity of this system and keeping the severe potential low.

A greater severe potential is anticipated in the vicinity of the
outflow associated with this early morning MCS. This outflow
currently extends from the MCS westward across the TX South Plains
into southeast NM. Some continued southward progress of this
boundary is likely over the next few hours before it stalls. There
is some potential for this boundary to then move back northward as
an effective warm front during the late afternoon, but this depends
on the coverage of any morning/early afternoon storms to its north.
Given the mesoscale nature of that evolution, uncertainty is high on
where this boundary will be by this afternoon. Even so, the general
expectation is that this outflow will likely serve as the focus for
robust convection later this afternoon as temperatures warm into the
mid 80s-lower 90s, west and south of the outflow. 

Strong buoyancy is anticipated across much of this region,
particularly south of the outflow boundary where the highest
temperatures and dewpoints are anticipated. Southeasterly low-level
flow beneath the enhanced westerlies aloft will result in long
hodographs with moderate to strong low-level veering. These
environmental conditions will be very supportive of discrete
supercells capable of all severe hazards, including very large hail,
severe wind gusts, and tornadoes. Hail probabilities were increased
across far southeast NM into the TX South Plains where the highest
supercell coverage is anticipated. There could be a corridor of
higher tornado potential along the outflow boundary, but uncertainty
on its location precludes introducing any high probabilities with
this outlook. 

A discrete cell or two could also develop north of the outflow along
a sharpening lee trough over eastern NM. Buoyancy will be slightly
lower than areas farther south, but similar kinematic profiles will
still support supercells capable of all severe hazards.

...Central High Plains into KS and OK...
A second severe area is possible today from the central High Plains
downstream into KS and OK. A subtle shortwave trough is expected to
move within the southwesterly flow aloft, contributing to
thunderstorm development across the high terrain and its movement
off the terrain during the early evening. Northward-advecting
low-level moisture will result in a east-west oriented warm front
from southeast CO into southern KS. The storms coming off the
terrain will likely interact with this boundary, with in-situ
development likely along this boundary as well. Environmental
conditions favor supercells along this boundary, with the
interactions contributing to upscale growth into a larger complex of
storms that spreads downstream along the KS/OK. Very large hail and
tornadoes are possible with any early, more discrete storms before
upscale growth and a transition to damaging gusts as the primary
hazard.

...Mid MS Valley through the OH Valley into the Northeast...
High-PW airmass currently stretches from the Mid MS Valley through
the OH Valley into the lower Great Lakes/southeast Canada. Scattered
convection will readily develop along this corridor, juxtaposed
along a weak frontal zone. Poor lapse rates should limit updraft
strength and vertical shear will be weak, but some risk for isolated
water-loaded downbursts capable of damaging gusts does exist.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0356 AM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Valid 081200Z - 131200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The active severe-weather pattern from the southern High Plains to
the Southeast should persist into D4/Sunday. A low-amplitude
mid-level trough is progged across the Southeast with a belt of
enhanced westerlies. The degree of ongoing convection on Sunday
morning lowers confidence on how broad a region of scattered
severe-storm potential exists in the Southeast. The best area for
less-impactful morning convection appears to be across the South
Atlantic Coastal Plain and adjacent eastern Piedmont. Scattered
damaging winds should be the main hazard from afternoon storms in
this region.

With a brief respite in the wake of multiple MCSs on D1 to early D3,
buoyancy should become large to locally extreme across a portion of
the southern High Plains to OK/TX Red River Valley by Sunday
afternoon. Latest guidance is quite insistent on more widespread
convective development during the late afternoon into Sunday night,
along the persistent quasi-stationary front. Although
mid/upper-level winds may be weaker relative to prior days, an
increased west-northwesterly component along with the very unstable
airmass will support severe hail/wind, which could be significant. 

Guidance has shown less predictability in the D5-6/Monday-Tuesday
time frame. This seems related to handling of downstream MCV
evolution from the probable Sunday night MCS over OK/TX, as well as
individual shortwave impulses embedded within the broad upper trough
over the Upper Midwest to Great Lakes. Expansive swaths of
low-probability severe are evident across the southern to eastern
states but predictability is too low for any 15 percent highlights.
By mid-week, guidance is still signaling a reduction in overall
severe potential with a synoptic pattern change to predominantly
weak shear coincident with areas of moderate to large buoyancy.

Mesoscale Discussion 1113
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 042055Z - 042300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and locally severe gusts will be
possible if storms can mature over the Trans-Pecos region this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...The latest visible satellite imagery shows deepening
boundary-layer cumulus where a stationary front is intersecting the
higher terrain in the TX Trans-Pecos region this afternoon. Isolated
convective initiation is also underway along the TX/MX border. While
weak large-scale ascent and antecedent inhibition cast uncertainty
on storm longevity (especially away from the higher terrain
features), a long/straight hodograph (around 40-50 kt of effective
shear) and moderate-strong buoyancy will conditionally support a
discrete/semi-discrete supercell or two capable of producing large
hail and locally severe gusts. Given the conditional and potentially
localized nature of the threat, a watch is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1112

0143 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southeast Missouri into southern/central
Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041843Z - 042115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms are possible through the
afternoon. The primary concern is locally damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorms are evolving
northeastward across southeastern MO -- within a zone of
differential heating along/ahead of the cold front. Despite poor
midlevel lapse rates, heating within cloud breaks amid upper
60s/lower 70s dewpoints is yielding sufficient (albeit weak)
surface-based instability. While deep-layer shear is modest across
the region (20-30 kt of effective shear), small, clockwise-curved
hodographs could still support localized convective organization
into clusters and transient supercell structures. The primary
concern is locally damaging wind gusts, especially with any
localized clustering, though a brief/weak tornado cannot be entirely
ruled out with any mini supercells that can evolve. Given the
expected localized nature of the severe threat, a watch is not
expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1094

0344 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...North-central Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 359...

Valid 032044Z - 032145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 359 continues.

SUMMARY...The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts,
large hail, and a tornado or two will exist in north-central
Missouri in WW 359.

DISCUSSION...A mature QLCS recently impacted the Kansas City metro
and vicinity and is continuing eastward through WW 359. A
consolidated bow echo is present at the northern extent of the line
(currently approaching Linn County), with a more outflow-dominated
signature present with southward extent. Both areas should continue
to pose a threat for severe wind gusts over the next couple of
hours. Periods of stronger low-level rotation were observed
recently, and some re-intensification is possible given locally
stronger low-level shear. Some semi-discrete cells have also formed
in a convergent zone ahead of the QLCS, which will pose a locally
greater threat for large hail in the short term.

Mesoscale Discussion 1093
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern IL and northwest IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032039Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe potential will increase over the next couple of
hours. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 359 may be needed
late this afternoon across parts of eastern IA into northwest IL.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery has slowly occurred across eastern IA
into northwest IL in the wake of morning convection. Temperatures
have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, and dewpoints from 66-72
F are contributing to increasing MLCAPE. With time, vertical shear
is expected to remain favorable for organized convection as the QLCS
across northern MO track east/northeast with time and additional
convection develops along a cold front oriented across eastern IA.
Damaging gusts will be the main hazard with this activity. However,
the VWP at KDVN shows some enlargement of the low-level hodograph,
due in part to a 30-40 kt 850 mb southwesterly low-level jet over
the region, which is also supporting 0-1 km SRH around 100-150
m2/s2. As such, a tornado or two also could occur in addition to
strong gusts. A downstream watch may be needed in the next couple
hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1092
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0313 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...central OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360...

Valid 032013Z - 032215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360
continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential may be increasing across central OK.

DISCUSSION...Strong cells have developed just west of the I-35
corridor in central OK. These cells show rotation aloft and the VWP
from KTLX shows an increasing low-level hodograph with 0-1 SRH near
150 m2/s2. Backed surface winds are also noted in surface
observations, along with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F.
This is contributing to strong instability and further storm
organization and intensification is possible over the next couple of
hours as these storms track northeast across central OK and the
greater OKC Metro area, and a brief tornado or two could occur with
these developing supercells. Additionally, as storms across
southwest OK move into this environment, some tornado and damaging
risk will be possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 1078
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...the Texas Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353...

Valid 022048Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next 1 to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed outflow boundary has developed and is
emanating from storms across the western Texas Panhandle. This
outflow has mostly outrun the storms thus far. However, it is
quickly moving toward more favorable instability across the central
and eastern Panhandle. In fact, a boundary is apparent on the AMA
0.5 degree base reflectivity east of the radar which likely
represents the edge of the low 70s dewpoints across the eastern
Panhandle. 

As these boundaries collide, expect strong updrafts which should
strengthen the cold pool and severe wind gusts within the line. The
greatest threat for isolated 80-90 mph wind gusts this
afternoon/evening likely exists from this boundary collision
northeastward. This region has the most favorable diurnal timing and
the expectation for storm intensification as this line moves towards
the greater instability.

Mesoscale Discussion 1077
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado northeastward through
southwestern MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022047Z - 022245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon and
evening along a cold front across much of central Nebraska and
adjacent areas. Severe wind gusts and large hail will be the main
threats.

DISCUSSION...A Cu field is developing this afternoon across central
Nebraska to the south of a slowly sagging cold front. Very large
instability is present with temperatures rising into the upper 80s
and low 90s F across the region. Continued boundary-layer mixing
should erode any remaining inhibition, supporting convection
initiating in the next couple of hours. A number of factors should
contribute to quickly amalgamating storms, including widespread
initiation, largely line-parallel (and relatively modest) bulk shear
vectors, and ML LCLs between 1500-2000 m AGL. Large hail will be
possible with the strongest cores, particularly early in individual
storms' lifecycles, with a transition to a more widespread wind
threat likely during the evening. A tornado or two cannot be ruled
out amidst possibly complex storm interactions and/or stronger
updrafts interacting with locally enhanced surface vertical
vorticity near the front. A watch is possible this afternoon to
address these threats.

0321 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Portions of West Texas and the Trans Pecos into
southeast New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022021Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are possible
this afternoon and into this evening.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across the Trans
Pecos and into West Texas with 1500 to 2000 J/kg MLCAPE. Some
convection has formed along the higher terrain from southeast New
Mexico to the Davis Mountains in Texas. A belt of slightly stronger
mid-level flow will overspread this region through the late
afternoon and into the evening, with RAP forecast soundings
indicating 35 to 40 knots of effective shear where southerly or
southeasterly flow remains by 23Z to 00Z. Therefore, a few
supercells are possible with a threat for large hail and severe wind
gusts. 

Large-scale forcing is mostly moving away from the region, so storm
coverage will likely remain isolated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1075
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado and western Kansas into far
southwest Nebraska.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 021947Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected this afternoon with a primary
threat of severe wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...A gradient of instability exists across the central
High Plains with dewpoints in the 40s near the Front Range and in
the upper 60s across southwest Kansas. SPC mesoanalysis shows a
weakly unstable, but uncapped environment across southeast Colorado
where cold air associated with the upper low has started to move
east of the terrain. As heating continues and temperatures continue
to cool aloft, expect an uncapped environment across much of eastern
Colorado and western Kansas. In addition, ascent will increase as
the trough advances east. 

Therefore, expect a gradual increase in convective coverage across
northeast New Mexico and eastern Colorado this afternoon.
Eventually, these storms should become more intense as they move
toward greater instability. Some large hail is possible initially,
however, severe wind gusts will be preferred. Very steep lapse rates
will support the potential for some significant severe wind gusts of
80-90 mph this evening (in western Kansas), particularly where any
bowing line segments can develop. 

A watch will likely be needed later this afternoon for the threat
from these storms, and storms which will likely move into southwest
Kansas from watch 353.

Mesoscale Discussion 1074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into
western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 021914Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon, posing
a threat primarily for severe wind gusts and large hail.

DISCUSSION...Congested Cu are present in visible satellite imagery
across southeastern Wyoming, especially along the higher terrain in
advance of a slowly-southward-sagging cold front. A surface low is
developing in northeastern Colorado, promoting backing southeasterly
low-level flow and some moisture advection into the area. Limited
upper-level cloudiness has supported temperatures rising into the
mid-/upper-70s across the area, likely yielding minimal convective
inhibition in the short term.

As the cold front continues to move southward and a mid-level wave
impinges on the region, scattered thunderstorm development appears
likely in the next couple hours. 12z HREF guidance depicts multiple
stronger updrafts developing off the Laramie Mountains and moving
east into a well-mixed and unstable airmass. Amidst modest bulk
shear values (~30-35 kts) and relatively straight shear profiles,
some splitting supercells and mixed-mode storms are possible. The
primary threats should be large hail and local severe wind gusts
with the stronger cores, especially as they mature in the Nebraska
Panhandle.

Additional thunderstorms are expected in western Nebraska and points
eastward as storms erupt along the cold front later this
afternoon/evening. Trends will continue to be monitored in that
region for possible MCD/watch issuance there.

Mesoscale Discussion 1064
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central into southeast Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352...

Valid 012037Z - 012200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk of large hail and severe wind gusts continues
across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352.

DISCUSSION...A couple semi-discrete supercells continue to track
southeastward along the stationary boundary from central into
southeast TX -- along the east/southeastern periphery of around 2500
J/kg MLCAPE. While these storms are generally becoming removed from
this stronger instability, they will still pose a risk of isolated
large hail and locally severe gusts in the near term. To their
northwest, fresh updrafts are evolving along the stationary boundary
near Waco TX. Given that these evolving storms will track
southeastward through the strongest instability amid 40 kt of
effective shear, gradual intensification into semi-discrete

Mesoscale Discussion 1063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central North Carolina and far
northern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011913Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue
developing/advancing eastward across western/central NC and far
northern SC through the afternoon. The strongest storms will be
capable of producing locally damaging wind gusts and marginally
severe hail. The severe threat is expected to remain too isolated
for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Along the southern periphery of a large-scale trough
over the Northeast, VWP data and earlier 12Z soundings sampled a
belt of 40-50 kt midlevel westerly flow across NC. Here,
differential heating along a weak E/W-oriented surface boundary is
supporting isolated to widely scattered showers, which should
continue to deepening into thunderstorms -- given sufficient (albeit
weak) surface-based instability. The moderate/strong westerly flow
aloft is yielding elongated/mostly straight hodographs (around 40 kt
of effective shear), which could promote localized convective
organization into small clusters capable of locally damaging wind
gusts and perhaps marginally severe hail. Current thinking is that
the overall severe threat will remain too isolated for a watch,
though convective trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1062
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...central Colorado and north-central New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011853Z - 012130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to develop through the
afternoon. Instability will support at least some potential for hail
and gusty thunderstorm outflows. However, the lack of stronger
deep-layer shear should limit the overall severe threat to being
more transient in nature. A watch is not likely.

DISCUSSION...Terrain-driven low-level convergence has resulted in
the development of convection across the higher terrain of central
Colorado and north-central New Mexico. To the east of the higher
terrain, surface dewpoints in the 50s coupled with diurnal heating
has resulted in a corridor of MUCAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg, with
the higher values tied to higher surface moisture. Despite
sufficient instability for storm maintenance, deep-layer shear is
weak, with effective-layer shear generally less than 20 knots should
limit the ability for updraft organization. The result should be
updrafts initially tied to the terrain, where low-level convergence
will force ascent. Isolated hail and perhaps a strong wind gust or
two may be possible with these terrain-driven storms.

With time, aggregate cold pools may move off the terrain and into
the high-elevation plains adjacent to the mountains allowing for
additional thunderstorm development. Here, continued heating will
allow most-unstable CAPE to continue to increase until convective
cloud debris overspreads the area reducing insolation. However,
MUCAPE around 2000-2500 J/kg will remain possible. Forecast
soundings indicated that some increase in effective-layer shear, but
still generally below 30 knots. This may allow for some
conglomeration of updrafts and at least transient multi-cell
clusters capable of producing large hail and a strong wind gust or
two.

Given the anticipated isolated/transient nature of any organized
severe threat (should it develop) a watch is not anticipated.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 352
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
140 PM CDT Sun Jun 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central and East Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 140 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercell development are expected
this afternoon as a moist environment heats and destabilizes. Large
hail is expected with the most intense storms, with wind damage also
possible as these storms generally spread southeastward through
early/mid-evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles north of
Stephenville TX to 75 miles south southeast of Huntsville TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.
