Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0626 AM CDT Tue Oct 22 2024

Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today through tonight.

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough over IA/MO will continue eastward toward
Lower MI/IN/OH and lose amplitude, while phasing gradually with an
upstream trough now over MT.  Isolated, elevated thunderstorms will
be possible this morning across the middle MS Valley in the zone of
ascent.  Weak buoyancy and ascent will come out of phase by later
this afternoon into tonight, when the threat for thunderstorms will
diminish.  Farther north, weak convection and isolated lightning
flashes may occur across northeast MN in a band of ascent and
minimal buoyancy along a cold front this afternoon/evening.

Elsewhere, lingering low-level moisture, a subtle midlevel trough,
and surface heating over higher terrain could support isolated
thunderstorms this afternoon over the Davis Mountains in southwest
TX.

## Tropical Storm Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 3

date: 2024-10-22, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

WTPZ42 KNHC 220835
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Kristy Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
300 AM CST Tue Oct 22 2024
 
Satellite images indicate that Kristy has continued to gradually 
become better organized during the overnight hours.  A convective 
burst has been occurring over the low-level center, an indication 
that a central core could be forming.  The cyclone also has some 
impressive curved banding to the north and west, although these 
bands are a bit far from the center.  A pair of ASCAT passes from 
22/0346 UTC and 22/0441 UTC showed tropical storm force winds in 
the northern semi-circle, with vectors in the 35 to 38 kt range.  
Since the time of the ASCAT passes, Kristy's convection has become 
better organized, with latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB at a consensus T-3.0/45 kt.  The initial intensity 
is nudged upward to 45 kt for this advisory.

Kristy is estimated to be moving west-northwestward, or 285/13 kt. 
A strong subtropical ridge to the north of the cyclone will steer 
it westward for the next 3 days or so.  Friday into the weekend, a 
turn to the west-northwest or northwest is expected as Kristy rounds 
the western periphery of the mid to upper-level ridge, and a 
mid-latitude upper-level trough approaches from the west.  The track 
forecast is largely unchanged from the previous official forecast 
and lies in the middle of the guidance envelope.  It should be noted 
that there is quite a bit of spread in the track guidance at days 4 
and 5, so confidence in this part of the forecast is a bit below 
average.

Environmental conditions are favorable for steady strengthening, 
and rapid intensification cannot be ruled out.  For the next 
72 h, Kristy will remain within an environment of warm ocean 
temperatures, relatively weak vertical wind shear, and a moist 
troposphere.  Beyond 72 h, southerly or southwesterly vertical wind 
shear will begin to increase over the cyclone, becoming strong in 4 
to 5 days.  Kristy should also cross the 26C isotherm in about 4 
days and move into a much more stable environment.  Therefore, 
weakening should begin in 3 to 4 days, with the potential for rapid 
weakening in 4 to 5 days.  The intensity forecast is largely 
unchanged from the previous prediction, which calls for Kristy to 
peak at 100 kt in a few days, and lies near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1219 PM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
No severe thunderstorms are forecast on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough is forecast to be over western IA early Tuesday
morning before continuing northeastward throughout the day across
the Mid/Upper MS Valley and Upper Great Lakes and becoming absorbed
in the stronger westerlies. Isolated to widely scattered elevated
thunderstorms are possible Tuesday morning ahead of this wave across
the Mid MS Valley. Buoyancy will be modest, which should temper
updraft strength in most of these storms. However, relatively cool
mid-level temperatures and enhanced mid-level flow could result in
enough buoyancy and shear for a few instances of small hail.

Another shortwave trough is expected to progress through the
Canadian Prairies on Tuesday. This shortwave is expected to amplify
considerably as it moves into far northwestern Ontario. By 12Z
Wednesday, this shortwave is expected to extend from the Hudson Bay
through western Ontario and the Upper Midwest. A surface low will
precede this system, with an attendant cold front pushing
southeastward across the Upper Midwest and Upper Great Lakes.
Low-level moisture in the vicinity of this front will be minimal,
but increasing mid-level moisture coupled with cold mid-level
temperatures could still promote enough buoyancy for a few deeper
updrafts capable of producing lightning from northern MN into far
northern WI and western upper MI. 

Lastly, a thunderstorm or two appears possible across southern
portions of far west TX/TX Big Bend vicinity Tuesday afternoon.
Here, some airmass destabilization appears possible amid strong
heating, and there could be just enough low-level convergence for
convective initiation. Overall coverage in this area is currently
expected to be less than 10%.

1150 AM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed to the current D1 Fire Weather Outlook. See
previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 10/21/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1159 PM CDT Sun Oct 20 2024/

...Synopsis...
The overall fire weather threat will remain low Monday. A mid to
upper-level low will traverse the central Plains during the day,
with southerly surface winds increasing from West TX northward into
the Upper Midwest. Precipitation chances, cloud cover, and a narrow
corridor of increasing low-level moisture, however, will accompany
this aforementioned low keeping RH well above critical thresholds.
Some areas of minor concern may be from far southeastern KS and
southwestern MO, northward into IA where slightly lower RH will
coincide with sustained winds near 15 mph and highly receptive
fuels. In addition, persistent dry conditions will continue across
the West where localized elevated conditions appear possible within
the Snake River Plain. Westerly winds may approach 15-20 mph here.
These conditions may also extend southward into the northern Great
Basin, but should remain too localized to warrant any Elevated areas
at this time.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FROM CENTRAL KS INTO SOUTH CENTRAL NE...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe thunderstorms with large hail are possible across
central Kansas into south central Nebraska, mainly from mid
afternoon to early evening.

...Central Plains...
A compact upper low over eastern CO will track eastward today into
the central Plains.  As this occurs, an associated surface Pacific
cold front / dryline will sweep eastward across KS/northwest OK. 
The air mass ahead of the front will be moderately moist with
dewpoints in the 50s to near 60 F, along with at least pockets of
considerable daytime heating.  This will lead to a corridor of
potential convective initiation during the peak-heating hours.  Most
CAM solutions suggest 2-3 mesoscale zones along the boundary where
robust storms may form.  One is near the weak surface low in
southern NE where a few low-topped supercells capable of large hail
and perhaps a tornado are possible.  Another is in the area of
strongest diurnal CAPE in southern KS where hail should be the main
concern.  The final one is much lower confidence over southwest OK,
where only a small minority of CAMs initiate convection.  

Also expanded marginal wind probabilities northeastward into eastern
NE and northeast KS.  CAPE will be very limited in this region, but
strong insolation will produce steep low-level lapse rates as
convection arrives from the west around peak-heating.  This might be
sufficient for gusty winds in the stronger cells.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0800 AM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 241200Z - 291200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A mid-level trough will cross the central and eastern CONUS on
D4/Thursday and D5/Friday with a surface front advancing east
through the period. Moisture will remain limited ahead of this front
and thus, severe weather is not expected. In the wake of this front,
high pressure will build into the Midwest on D6/Saturday and move
into the Mid-Atlantic by D7/Sunday. This will result in tranquil
weather through the weekend. Extended range guidance does suggest
the potential for some return moisture flow by early next week, but
there is considerable uncertainty in the upper-level pattern and any
potential severe weather threat would likely be after Monday/D8.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1240 AM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid to upper-level shortwave trough is expected to traverse the
Midwest throughout the day Tuesday. An associated cold front will
accompany it, with breezy northwesterly surface winds moving down
the northern and central Plains during the afternoon. A cooler
post-frontal air mass will keep RH above critical thresholds for
most locations. However, a narrow corridor of drier conditions/lower
RH from northwestern NE into portions of SD may exist where rain did
not fall from the previous day. Temporal confidence is not quite
high enough to introduce a small Elevated area for this region,
though subsequent forecasts may require it depending on the
progression of the front and Monday's rainfall footprint. Overall,
the fire weather threat should remain relatively low Tuesday.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND PARTS OF WEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Large hail, severe gusts and some tornado threat remain possible
across eastern New Mexico and portions of far West Texas this
evening.

...01z Update...

Strongest 500mb flow appears to be translating through the base of
the trough into western NM early this evening. This speed max will
advance into northern NM by the end of the period which will allow
the upper low to begin ejecting northeast toward the Four Corners.
Even so, negligible height changes will be noted across eastern
NM/West TX during the overnight hours. Scattered-numerous
thunderstorms have developed ahead of this upper feature with a
broken band of strong/severe convection currently extending from
near El Paso, northeast into Harding County NM, southwest of
Clayton. Several supercells have developed along this corridor which
are likely producing hail at/near severe levels, especially Chaves
County. 00z soundings from both AMA and MAF exhibited substantial
capping in the 700-750mb layer, though mid-level lapse rates are
steep. A bit west, uncapped profiles are noted at EPZ and ABQ with
strong deep-layer shear evident. Thunderstorms should continue to
develop along the leading edge of upper trough/influence where
inhibition is weak. Organized structures remain possible and large
hail is the primary risk, though gusts and perhaps a tornado or two
can not be ruled out this evening.
