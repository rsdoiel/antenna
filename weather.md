Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0745 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF THE
GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on Sunday
evening into early morning Monday across parts of the Great Plains.
Large hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes are all possible.

...Synopsis...
Early morning satellite imagery shows modest upper ridging between 
a pair of well-defined cyclones, one centered over NV and the other
centered over northern NY/VT. The NV cyclone forecast to shift
slightly eastward throughout the day as a shortwave trough, and
associated jet streak, rotate through its base. Moderate to strong
southwesterly flow associated with this shortwave will spread
northeastward from the Southwest into central Plains and Mid MO
Valley. 

Recent surface analysis reveals an expansive area of high pressure
centered over the Upper Great Lakes covering much of the eastern
CONUS. A broad area of low pressure exists over the intermountain
West, with several embedded lows. A tight surface pressure gradient
exists between these two features across the Plains, and the
resultant moderate low-level flow will contribute to northward
moisture advection throughout the period.

Any large-scale forcing for ascent associated with the shortwave
progressing around the NV cyclone will remain west of this better
low-level moisture (and associated buoyancy) until later tonight,
when it reaches the northern High Plains. Ample buoyancy and
moisture will exist across the central and southern High Plains, but
the lack of stronger large-scale forcing for ascent will result in a
more conditional severe thunderstorm potential.

...Southeast MT...Western Dakotas...
A deepening lee trough is forecast to result in surface cyclogenesis
in the far eastern MT/WY border vicinity by late this afternoon.
Strong boundary-layer mixing is anticipated across the region,
promoting airmass destabilization but also likely keeping dewpoints
in the 40s across much of the region. Convergence along several
boundaries across the region, including a surface trough extending
across southeast MT and the lee trough along the eastern WY border
vicinity, amid this destabilized airmass will result in thunderstorm
development, particularly during the late afternoon/early evening as
increasing large-scale ascent complements the low-level convergence.

An eastward storm motion should take any storms that develop in
better low-level moisture over time, with a strengthening low-level
jet helping to maintain favorably moist low-level inflow. Even with
this modest improvement in thermodynamics, nocturnal stabilization 
should result in storms becoming more elevated over time. Primary
threat across this region are large hail and damaging gusts. 

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Mid 60s dewpoints are already in place across the Permian Basin and
the general expectation is for low-level moisture to increase
throughout the day. 60s dewpoints will likely be in place across all
but far western KS by 21Z and into much of central NE by 00Z. Strong
heating is anticipated across this region as well, resulting in an
area of moderate to strong buoyancy from southwest NE into west TX
by the late afternoon. Large-scale forcing for ascent across the
region will be nebulous, but low-level convergence along the dryline
amid little to no convective inhibition may result in convective
initiation. 

With dryline convergence as the mechanism for convective initiation,
predictability is low and convection-allowing guidance has limited
utility. Dryline circulations will likely be strongest across the TX
Panhandle/West TX where temperatures west of the dryline will be
warmest, but low-level coverage will likely maximize in the CO/NE/KS
border intersection vicinity near a developing surface low. As a
result, these two areas may have a greater risk for thunderstorms
today. 

The overall environment will be very supportive of supercells with
any storms that do form, with large to very large hail as the
primary risk initially. Strong downdrafts are possible as well. A
westward shift of the dryline and strengthening low-level jet will
support an increase tornado threat during the evening with any
storms that persist (or develop along the retreating dryline). The
kinematic environment improves notably across the TX Panhandle,
western KS, and western NE between 00Z and 06Z, so any storms that
are ongoing may be able to organize considerably before eventually
weakening due to nocturnal stabilization.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
A lingering mid-level trough over the western U.S. (and its
associated southwest flow), along with deep boundary layer mixing,
will result in at least Elevated fire-weather conditions across
portions of central and eastern New Mexico on Monday.

...Central and Eastern New Mexico...
With receptive fuels (ERCs exceeding the 80th-90th annual
percentiles) and dry, windy conditions across much of central and
eastern New Mexico, at least Elevated fire-weather conditions are
expected. 00Z HREF guidance suggests that there is potential for
Critical conditions, particularly across central New Mexico, but
there is enough ensemble spread in the HREF to preclude adding
highlights at this time. While the dry and windy conditions are
likely to occur further east into the Texas Panhandle, recent
wetting rainfall over the last several days should limit fire
danger.

0250 PM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern OK...nern TX...swrn AR...nwrn LA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 261950Z - 262145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Ongoing thunderstorm development is likely to continue to
intensify through 4-6 PM CDT, including a couple of supercells
posing a risk for severe hail, locally strong surface gusts, and
perhaps a brief tornado or two.

DISCUSSION...The early day convective cluster has generally
weakened, with at least a couple of remnant mesoscale circulations
continuing to migrate northeastward and eastward into/across parts
of south central Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma.  The Rapid
Refresh indicates that there is a lingering pocket of relatively
cold mid-level air (-12 to -13C around 500 mb), associated with a
low-amplitude short wave perturbation overspreading the Red River
Valley vicinity, within moderate westerly mid/upper flow.  It
appears that this is supporting an increase in thunderstorm
development west-northwest of Durant toward the Ark-La-Tex vicinity.

The more recent convection is focused along a diffuse near surface
baroclinic zone within weak surface troughing, where inflow
emanating from a seasonably moist boundary layer characterized by
CAPE in excess of 2000 J/kg seems likely to support further
intensification into late afternoon.  This may include supercell
structures with potential to produce severe hail.  Low-level
hodographs are generally forecast to remain modest, but a brief
tornado might not be out of the question.

Mesoscale Discussion 0569
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Areas affected...Portions of eastern New Mexico into the Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 261928Z - 262130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large to very-large hail and perhaps a tornado or two are
possible with supercells near an outflow boundary this
afternoon/evening. A watch may eventually be needed. Convective
trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...With continuing convection within Oklahoma and western
North Texas, outflow has continued to push west/southwestward into
eastern New Mexico and through the South Plains. While a few
towering cumulus have been observed along this outflow boundary
during the afternoon, residence time within the zone of ascent has
been too short to promote deep convection. Farther to the west,
southeasterly winds have pushed mid/upper 50s F dewpoints into the
southern Rockies. Convection has been slowly deepening per day cloud
phase imagery. The most likely scenario is for a few storms to
develop within the next 2-3 hours and propagate east-southeastward
as the outflow boundary pushes up against the terrain.

With 1000-2000 J/kg MLCAPE near and just behind the outflow boundary
(where it has remained cloud free) and 30-40 kts of effective shear
across the boundary, supercells would likely be the dominant storm
mode. Steep mid-level lapse rates sampled in this mornings observed
soundings in the region suggest large to very-large hail would be
possible along with isolated severe gusts. The tornado threat is
somewhat less certain given what will at least initially be weak
low-level winds. However, backed surface winds along/near the
outflow boundary will provide greater SRH for storms that favorably
interact with it. There will be a modest increase in the low-level
jet this evening, but, given the more stable conditions with
eastward extent, the spatial window for greater tornado potential
appears limited/conditional. Convective trends will continue to be
monitored. A watch may eventually be needed, but timing remains
uncertain.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Valid 262000Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND THE PERMIAN BASIN AND PARTS OF THE TEXARKANA REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible over eastern New Mexico
into parts of west Texas this afternoon through the evening.  A
threat for very large hail and possibly a couple of tornadoes are
the primary risks.  Scattered damaging gusts are possible this
afternoon for parts of the Red River Valley.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast largely remains on track with the only notable
change being an eastward shift/expansion of 15% wind probabilities
(Slight risk) across portions of southeast OK, northeast TX, and
into far southwest AR. As of 19 UTC, regional radar mosaics show
deepening thunderstorms along a residual outflow boundary/effective
warm front ahead of a decaying MCS. Along this boundary,
temperatures have warmed into the low 80s with upper 60s/low 70s
dewpoints, resulting in MLCAPE exceeding 2000 J/kg. A recent ACARS
sounding from DFW sampled 30-35 knot mid-level flow over the region,
which should be sufficient for some storm organization/longevity
with an attendant threat for all hazards. Storm interactions should
favor clustering through late afternoon and may support a focused
corridor of wind damage/gust potential downstream of the developing
storms. See the previous discussion below and MCDs #568 and #569 for
additional details.

..Moore.. 04/26/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1143 AM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025/

...NM into the Southern Plains and ArkLaTex...
Visible satellite-radar composite shows a front/outflow pushing
south across South Plains and Caprock over portions of west TX and
westward into parts of eastern NM.  This boundary will likely stall
later this afternoon while moist upslope flow is maintained from the
Permian Basin northwestward into southeast/eastern NM.  Surface
observations show a reservoir of lower to mid 60s dewpoints over
southeast NM and west TX south of the boundary.  Moderately strong
west-southwesterly mid to high-level flow will extend east from the
base of a West Coast trough into the southern Great Plains today.

Strong heating over eastern NM will aid in moderate destabilization
(1000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE) from parts of northeast NM southward into
the Eastern Plains/Permian Basin where buoyancy will be greatest. 
Models shows gradual erosion of convective inhibition later this
afternoon with isolated to scattered storms developing in the
vicinity of the dryline/composite front.  Steep 700-500 mb lapse
rates sampled on the 12z Midland, TX raob atop a deep/moist boundary
layer will support supercell development in conjunction with a
veering and gradually strengthening wind profile.  Large to very
large hail will be possible with a few of these stronger storms.  A
tornado risk may develop during the late afternoon/early evening. 
Some of this activity may grow upscale into a small cluster this
evening posing a hail/wind threat is moves east-southeast into parts
of west TX.  

Farther east, an MCS will continue east across OK this afternoon. 
Moist low levels in the vicinity of the Red River may enable a
re-invigoration of storms this afternoon.  Damaging gusts appear to
be the primary risk with these storms.  

...Northeast/Mid Atlantic/Carolinas...
A shortwave trough will continue moving through southern Ontario and
the adjacent Lower Great Lakes. A cold front will progress eastward,
moving through the northern Mid-Atlantic by this evening and the
remainder of the Mid-Atlantic States by tonight. A relatively moist
airmass is already in place ahead of this front, and thunderstorm
development appears likely along the front as it moves eastward
throughout the period. Highest coverage is anticipated from the
Hudson Valley/NYC vicinity southward across the Delmarva to the
Chesapeake Bay. 

Gradually strengthening midlevel flow and deep-layer shear could
support a few stronger cells/clusters during the afternoon and
evening. Diurnal heating will be tempered by cloud cover, limiting
the overall buoyancy and updraft magnitude. Even so, some locally
damaging wind and small to near-severe hail could accompany
the strongest storms. Best overlap between the buoyancy and shear is
expected from NJ into the Delmarva vicinity from 18Z to 21Z.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN CENTRAL AND
EASTERN IA/SOUTHEAST MN/WESTERN WI...

...SUMMARY...
An outbreak of severe weather remains likely across portions of the
Upper Midwest, centered on Monday afternoon and evening. Very large
hail, strong tornadoes, and damaging winds are expected.

...Synopsis...
Multiple shortwave impulses embedded within a broader positive-tilt
upper trough will eject into/across the North-Central States during
the period. Primary surface cyclone, over central/eastern SD Monday
morning, will remain nearly steady-state as it tracks east-northeast
across the Upper Great Lakes.

...Upper Midwest...
Elevated convection should be ongoing at 12Z Monday, centered on ND
arcing southeast across the Upper MS Valley. Isolated severe hail
may accompany this morning activity as it progresses eastward along
the leading edge of a stout EML. Regenerative elevated storm
development should persist northeast of the surface cyclone track
across the Red River Valley through northern MN, likely limiting the
northward advancement of the surface warm front during the day.
Guidance differs markedly with the degree of northward
destabilization into northern MN, lowering confidence in the degree
of severe threat here.

South of early-period storms/cloud coverage, pronounced
destabilization will occur beneath the initially stout EML amid
strong low-level moist advection. Cooling mid-level temperatures
during the afternoon will be favorably timed with peak heating to
support thunderstorms across southern MN into northern IA. Greater
coverage is expected with northern extent which may yield more
linear organization, compared to more discrete/isolated coverage
trailing southward. A mix of all hazards is anticipated with an
increasing severe threat into the early/mid evening as the low-level
jet strengthens across the Upper MS Valley to Upper Great Lakes. The
southern portion of this will be the more favored corridor for open
warm sector discrete supercells capable of producing strong
tornadoes. By late evening, linear clusters will likely overtake
much of the discrete convection as the cold front  advances rapidly
east-southeast. Damaging wind gusts and embedded tornadoes will
remain possible through the late evening and perhaps into the
overnight hours.

...KS/MO to west TX...
A strongly unstable/sheared warm sector will exist along/east of the
dryline. Forcing for ascent should be much weaker than farther north
with only weak mid-level height falls along the dryline. Most
probable storm signals are after the nocturnal low-level jet
increases during the evening in the southern Great Plains. This
could support isolated supercells into Monday night.

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF THE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on Sunday
evening into early morning Monday across parts of the northern and
central Great Plains. Large hail should be the predominant hazard.

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level jetlet will eject through the basal portion of
a broad trough over the West. This should overspread the southern
Rockies into the central High Plains by Sunday night. Primary
surface cyclone will diurnally deepen over the central High Plains,
with a secondary low downstream of the Bighorn Mountains. The
primary low will advance northeast into the central SD vicinity by
12Z Monday. A north/south-oriented lee trough/dryline will extend
through the southern High Plains.

...Northern Great Plains to NE...
Large-scale ascent will be focused across this region, especially
Sunday evening/night as mid-level height falls/upper-level
diffluence increase ahead of the approaching trough/jet streak. Two
corridors of initial storm development are apparent by early
evening, centered on the NE Panhandle and southeast MT, just ahead
of the aforementioned surface lows. Rich low-level moisture will
likely remain displaced to the southeast of both regions, but
adequate moisture should be present for a few supercells with
low-level southeasterlies beneath strengthening southwesterly
mid/upper winds. The breadth of the uncapped warm-moist sector will
be confined though and convection will likely become predominately
elevated Sunday night. However, increasing convective coverage is
anticipated within the exit region of a strong low-level jet nosing
into the Mid-MO Valley. Large hail should be the overarching threat,
with a mixed wind/hail threat possibly evolving amid signals of a
linear cluster into western/central SD.

...KS to west TX...
A very conditional severe threat will extend along the dryline. A
plume of large buoyancy coincident with a supercell wind profile
will exist from northwest TX into western KS. Forcing for ascent,
outside of a weakly retreating dryline circulation, is nebulous.
Thunderstorm probabilities appear to be around 10 percent or less,
outside of the TX Big Bend during the late afternoon and evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR EASTERN ARIZONA INTO
WEST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

...Day 1 Update...
Latest model consensus continues to indicate a broad fire weather
threat across portions of the Southwest today. Expected
meteorological conditions supports expansion of Critical highlights
well into portions of northeast Arizona. However, fuels are
undergoing green-up transition across the Four Corners area which
should act to mitigate significant wildfire spread, although
Elevated highlights were expanded northward into southeastern Utah
and southwestern Colorado to capture the overall fire environment
concern.

..Williams.. 04/26/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough (and associated southwesterly mid-level flow) is
forecast to be over central California by the early evening, with a
surface low centered over the Great Basin. Deep boundary layer
mixing beneath the mid-level jet, in combination with a surface low
to the north, will result in Critical fire-weather conditions across
portions of New Mexico and Arizona. 

...West-central New Mexico into Far Eastern Arizona...
20-25 MPH winds and 10-15% relative humidity values are forecast
over much of western New Mexico into Eastern Arizona, but most of
the receptive fuels (based on ERC percentiles) are confined to
central and southern New Mexico. Therefore, only a relatively small
area of Critical highlights are forecast where meteorological
conditions and fuels exceeding the 80th annual percentile overlap.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Valid 261630Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND THE PERMIAN BASIN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible over eastern New Mexico
into parts of west Texas this afternoon through the evening.  A
threat for very large hail and possibly a couple of tornadoes are
the primary risks.  Scattered damaging gusts are possible this
afternoon for parts of the Red River Valley.

...NM into the Southern Plains and ArkLaTex...
Visible satellite-radar composite shows a front/outflow pushing
south across South Plains and Caprock over portions of west TX and
westward into parts of eastern NM.  This boundary will likely stall
later this afternoon while moist upslope flow is maintained from the
Permian Basin northwestward into southeast/eastern NM.  Surface
observations show a reservoir of lower to mid 60s dewpoints over
southeast NM and west TX south of the boundary.  Moderately strong
west-southwesterly mid to high-level flow will extend east from the
base of a West Coast trough into the southern Great Plains today.

Strong heating over eastern NM will aid in moderate destabilization
(1000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE) from parts of northeast NM southward into
the Eastern Plains/Permian Basin where buoyancy will be greatest. 
Models shows gradual erosion of convective inhibition later this
afternoon with isolated to scattered storms developing in the
vicinity of the dryline/composite front.  Steep 700-500 mb lapse
rates sampled on the 12z Midland, TX raob atop a deep/moist boundary
layer will support supercell development in conjunction with a
veering and gradually strengthening wind profile.  Large to very
large hail will be possible with a few of these stronger storms.  A
tornado risk may develop during the late afternoon/early evening. 
Some of this activity may grow upscale into a small cluster this
evening posing a hail/wind threat is moves east-southeast into parts
of west TX.  

Farther east, an MCS will continue east across OK this afternoon. 
Moist low levels in the vicinity of the Red River may enable a
re-invigoration of storms this afternoon.  Damaging gusts appear to
be the primary risk with these storms.  

...Northeast/Mid Atlantic/Carolinas...
A shortwave trough will continue moving through southern Ontario and
the adjacent Lower Great Lakes. A cold front will progress eastward,
moving through the northern Mid-Atlantic by this evening and the
remainder of the Mid-Atlantic States by tonight. A relatively moist
airmass is already in place ahead of this front, and thunderstorm
development appears likely along the front as it moves eastward
throughout the period. Highest coverage is anticipated from the
Hudson Valley/NYC vicinity southward across the Delmarva to the
Chesapeake Bay. 

Gradually strengthening midlevel flow and deep-layer shear could
support a few stronger cells/clusters during the afternoon and
evening. Diurnal heating will be tempered by cloud cover, limiting
the overall buoyancy and updraft magnitude. Even so, some locally
damaging wind and small to near-severe hail could accompany
the strongest storms. Best overlap between the buoyancy and shear is
expected from NJ into the Delmarva vicinity from 18Z to 21Z.

## SPC Apr 26, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 AM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 041200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Tuesday - West Texas to the Northeast...
Moderate instability will be present along an elongated frontal zone
from the southern Plains to the Northeast on Tuesday. Modest shear
along the frontal zone will support some organization into multicell
clusters and perhaps supercells. A greater severe weather threat
will exist across the eastern Great Lakes where forcing and shear
will be strongest as a 75 knot mid-level jet streak crosses southern
Ontario. 

Another focused zone of greater coverage of severe storms will be
across parts of West Texas where multiple rounds of storm are
anticipated. The first chance of storms will be during the afternoon
as the front continues to move south across Oklahoma and perhaps
into North Texas. An additional round of storms will be possible
across parts of West Texas as the low-level jet strengthens Tuesday
night in the presence of strong instability and shear. 

...Day 5/Wednesday - North Texas to the ArkLaTex...
Ongoing Day 4 convection may have some impact on the exact location
of the severe weather threat on Tuesday. However, regardless of Day
4 convective evolution, there will likely be a region with a more
focused severe weather threat on Day 5/Wednesday where moderate to
strong instability exists ahead of strengthening mid-level flow and
a mid-level trough which will move across the southern Plains. 15%
probabilities have been added for Day 5 from North Texas to the
ArkLaTex where this location of greatest severe weather threat
appears most likely at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0561
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...the Trans-Pecos and Permian Basin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 173...

Valid 252044Z - 252215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 173
continues.

SUMMARY...A localized very large hail threat should be confined to
the Trans-Pecos and adjacent Pecos Valley into early evening.

DISCUSSION...A slow-moving supercell has been drifting east, west of
Fort Stockton. Additional storm-development appears likely to be
delayed until early evening or later based on recent visible
satellite and HRRR trends. 19Z observed sounding at Midland sampled
weak 0-3 km shear/SRH, limiting low-level hodograph curvature.
Still, adequate speed shear through the buoyancy layer will support
large to very large hail potential with the supercell or two that
anchor near the higher terrain. As low-level southeasterlies
increase in the next few hours, additional storms may develop north
into far southeast NM.

Mesoscale Discussion 0560
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...the TX South Plains

Concerning...Tornado Watch 172...

Valid 252019Z - 252145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 172 continues.

SUMMARY...Greatest potential for a slow-moving, long-lived intense
supercell will be across the Texas South Plains portion of WW 172,
along a largely west/east-oriented outflow boundary.

DISCUSSION...Initial sustained supercell development has been
drifting east over Bailey County, with additional incipient cells to
its east towards Plainview. Surface/low-level convergence will
remain maximized near the TX/NM border over the next couple hours,
which should support further intensification of this ongoing
activity. With only around 20-kts of 0-3 km shear per the Lubbock
VWP, very large hail should remain the overarching threat in the
near term, potentially reaching baseball to softball size. But
strengthening of low-level east-southeasterlies should commence in
the next couple hours. A corresponding increase in tornado potential
is expected into early evening with ingest of mid 60s surface dew
points from the Low Rolling Plains. Given weak large-scale ascent,
convection should remain discrete enough into this time frame to
support potential for a strong tornado in the most intense/mature
supercell anchored along the mesoscale outflow boundary.

Mesoscale Discussion 0559
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0219 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...Central/eastern Kentucky into southern Ohio

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251919Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated strong/potentially damaging wind gust could
occur this afternoon. A watch is not needed.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed within an area of thinner
cirrus canopy in central Kentucky. This is occurring in response to
a weak shortwave in the Midwest. Modest effective shear of around 25
kts could promote a stronger storm or two. Enhanced 850 mb winds
ahead of the surface low/cold front will allow few
stronger/potentially damaging winds to mix to the surface in the
most intense storms. Furthermore, weak but sufficient low-level
hodograph curvature is noted in KLVX/KJKL VAD data. It is possible a
storm or two could exhibit weak low-level rotation. However, tornado
potential is low. Additionally, low/mid-level lapse rates and
mid/upper-level wind shear are all weak. Any severe threat that
develops will be spatially limited and marginal.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 172
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
155 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Eastern New Mexico
  Texas Panhandle and South Plains

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 155 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop this
afternoon and evening.  Once storms develop, the stronger storms
will likely evolve into intense supercells capable of large to giant
hail.  The risk for tornadoes will probably maximize late this
afternoon into the evening as low-level winds strengthen.  A strong
tornado is possible.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 85 statute miles
north and south of a line from 55 miles south southwest of Cannon
Afb NM to 25 miles northeast of Childress TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 4 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 27010.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 173
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
240 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  West Texas

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 240 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify this afternoon into the evening.  Initially storms will
likely focus near the higher terrain but will eventually move east
into lower elevations.  The stronger storms will likely become
supercells with both left and right splitting supercells possible. 
Large to very large hail will be the primary risk with these storms.
 A tornado is possible during the early evening as low-level winds
strengthen.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles east northeast
of Carlsbad NM to 45 miles southwest of Fort Stockton TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.

Mesoscale Discussion 0544
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242045Z - 242245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Some instances of severe hail and gusty winds possible
this afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity is ongoing near and south of the
Denver metro this afternoon. Moisture in this region is limited,
with dew points in the upper 40s to 50s. Nonetheless, ongoing
convection will have potential to produce instances of mainly
sub-severe hail given steep lapse rates and cooling aloft. 

As this development and any additional development shifts further
south and east, it will enter a region with temperatures in the low
to mid 70s and dew points in the low to mid-50s near the CO/KS
border MLCAPE around 500-1000 J/kg and deep layer shear around 30-35
kts is observed in surface objective analysis as of 20z. This
environment may support some increase in coverage and intensity,
with better potential for severe hail and wind. Trends will be

Mesoscale Discussion 0543
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl and sern TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 241933Z - 242130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms continues to organize, with
signs of increasing potential to produce strong to severe gusts
while propagating southeastward toward the mid/upper Texas coastal
plain through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...Forcing for ascent associated with
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, and southeasterly updraft
inflow of seasonably moist boundary-layer air (characterized by CAPE
in excess of 2000 J/Kg), have maintained vigorous thunderstorm
development.  Activity has undergone notable intensification and
increasing organization, and it appears that a meso-beta scale
cyclonic circulation is becoming better-defined near the Waco
vicinity, where a couple of 50+ kt surface gusts have recently been
observed.  

Despite continued gradual warming around 700 mb, and some suggestion
that the larger-scale forcing for ascent may weaken, the
boundary-layer ahead of the storms remains potentially supportive of
further intensification of the convective system, southeastward
toward the mid/upper Texas coastal plain into early evening. 
Deep-layer mean flow and shear remain generally modest, as does the
strength of the surface cold pool (as of 19Z observational data). 
However, with further strengthening of the mesoscale vortex and
west-northwesterly rear inflow, there remains potential for a
continued increase in risk for strong to severe gusts during the
next few hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 167
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
335 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Oklahoma Panhandle
  Texas Panhandle and South Plains

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 335 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to rapidly
develop this afternoon into the early evening.  Environmental shear
and buoyancy combinations strongly favor intense, discrete
supercells.  Large to giant hail will be probable with any
supercell.  The tornado risk will likely focus for a few hours
during the early evening near a residual outflow boundary draped
over parts of the Watch area.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
east and west of a line from 30 miles northeast of Guymon OK to 60
miles southeast of Lubbock TX. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 166
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central into East Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A linear cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms will
likely continue east across much of the Watch area this afternoon
into the early evening.  Severe gusts 60-70 mph appear to be the
primary hazard, but large hail may accompany the stronger cells on
the southwestern flank of the thunderstorm band.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles west of Temple
TX to 25 miles east of Lufkin TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.

Mesoscale Discussion 0539
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0637 AM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...Central and North Texas...Southern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241137Z - 241400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A severe threat may continue across parts of central and
north Texas this morning. Isolated severe gusts and hail will be the
primary threats. The potential for weather watch issuance is low.

DISCUSSION...Mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
thunderstorms located from southern Oklahoma into north Texas, with
a linear cluster extending southward into central Texas. The storms
are located near a moist axis where surface dewpoints are in the mid
to upper 60s F. Across the moist airmass, the RAP is estimating
MLCAPE in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range. The instability, combined
with large-scale ascent ahead of a shortwave trough and warm
advection are supporting the storms. In addition, the FWS WSR-88D
VWP has 0-6 km shear has 30 to 35 knots with some directional shear
in the low to mid-levels. This shear environment should be enough to
continue an isolated wind-damage and hail threat. The severe threat
may increase locally over the next hour or two, as the cells to the
south merge with the line to the north.

Mesoscale Discussion 0528
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of wrn KS...sern CO...OK Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 231939Z - 232215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorm development appears increasingly
probable through the 4-6 PM CDT time frame, including the potential
for supercells posing a risk for large hail and tornadoes in a
focused area near/southeast of Goodland.

DISCUSSION...With daytime heating and mixing, the boundary-layer
within surface troughing across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle
vicinity through western Kansas continues to deepen and destabilize.
It now appears generally characterized by surface temperature/dew
point spreads in excess of 30 F, with CAPE increasing to 1500-2000+
J/kg.

Inhibition is in the process of weakening, and deepening high-based
convection is now evident within the axis of stronger
destabilization.  With further insolation, the initiation of
thunderstorms appears increasingly probable, some of which may
eventually be accompanied by small hail and localized strong
downbursts.

Of greater concern is the potential for convective development where
better low-level moisture, on the western periphery of outflow
associated with persistent ongoing convection across central Kansas,
intersects the axis of stronger heating.  This appears focused near
a weak developing cyclonic circulation southeast of Goodland, where
shear associated with clockwise turning of low-level wind fields
with height, beneath a belt of 30 kt westerly flow around 500 mb, is
likely sufficient for supercells.  This is where potential for large
hail appears maximized, and near-surface CAPE/upward vertical
accelerations may promote the potential for tornadoes.

SUMMARY...Risk for gusty winds and large hail possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is observed across the Davis
Mountains and ahead of the surface dryline across far western Texas.
Temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to 80s which has led to
weakening of MLCIN across the region. Convective initiation should
occur in the next 1-2 hours. Ahead of the dryline, MLCAPE around
1000-2000 J/kg  with deep layer shear around 35-40 kts. This will
support supercells capable of large hail (some very large) and
damaging winds, given steep lapse rates around 8-9 C/km. A watch may
be needed in the coming hour.

Mesoscale Discussion 0517
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0325 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Oklahoma...south-central Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 222025Z - 222230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and severe hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has initiated and expected to
continue to form along the dryline across the Texas Panhandle this
afternoon. Additional thunderstorm development is expected across
the frontal boundary draped across western/central Kansas into the
Oklahoma Panhandle. Ahead of this development, the air mass across
western Oklahoma into central/eastern Kansas has been suppressed
owing to weak forcing and stout MLCIN most of the afternoon.
Temperatures are warming, with MLCIN eroding west to east across the
Texas Panhandle as temperatures have climbed into the 80s. Aloft
sounding analysis indicates, steep lapse rates and ample CAPE above
the 850 mb inversion.

Thunderstorm activity will gradually shift into this region by late
afternoon/evening. A mix of multi-cell clusters and embedded
supercells capable of large hail and damaging wind are expected. A
watch will likely be needed in the coming hours to cover this risk.

Mesoscale Discussion 0516
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 221917Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows the dryline extending across the
Texas Panhandle into far eastern New Mexico and southward to the
Texas Big Bend as on 19z. Daytime heating under mostly sunny skies
has led temperatures to rise into the 80s (some mid to upper 80s
further south near the Mexico border). Satellite data shows towering
cu, mainly near and adjacent to the higher terrain of the Cap Rock
and Stockton Plateau. Morning observed soundings from AMA and LUB
would suggest that convective temperatures are around 80-85 F, which
in combination with increase in towering cu suggests initiation over
the next 1-2 hours. 

Initial development will likely be supercellular. Though flow aloft
and deep layer shear are more marginal, MLCAPE around 1500-2500 J/kg
and steep low to mid-level lapse rates will support potential for
large hail (some very large 2"+) and damaging wind. Where discrete
modes can interact with outflow/boundaries enhancing surface
vorticity, a tornado could be possible. As storms increase in
coverage this afternoon, clustering along outflows will tend to
create mixed mode of supercells and multi-cells, with an increase in
potential for damaging wind (some 70-80 mph). A watch will be needed
to cover these threats soon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0515
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...the South Carolina and North Carolina Piedmont

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221914Z - 222145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorm activity may continue to
gradually develop and strengthen through 5-7 PM EDT, accompanied by
at least some risk for marginally severe hail and potentially
damaging surface gusts.  This may remain fairly localized and a
severe weather watch is not anticipated, but trends will continue to
be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorm development appears
underway, perhaps supported by subtle mid-level cooling on the
northwestern periphery of deep-layer ridging centered off the south
Atlantic coast.  Based on forecast soundings, destabilization for a
modestly moist and warming boundary layer remains inhibited by weak
high-level lapse rates.  However, CAPE within the mixed-phase layer
might still be sufficient to support small to marginally severe
hail, aided by favorable shear beneath a 40 kt southwesterly jet
streak around 500 mb.  

Lower-level wind fields will remain more modest, but with at least
some further boundary-layer destabilization through peak daytime
heating, scattered thunderstorm activity will probably continue to
intensify.  And downward mixing of momentum may lead to a few
potentially damaging wind gusts, before storms weaken this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0514
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern LA...srn MS...swrn/cntrl AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221830Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A gradual increase in thunderstorm activity and intensity
appears probable through 4-6 PM CDT, with short-lived stronger
storms posing a risk for locally severe hail and wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...As low-amplitude mid-level troughing and more subtle
smaller-scale perturbations progress through weak (on the order of
10-20 kt) west-southwesterly mean flow across the Gulf Coast states,
associated forcing for ascent appears likely to contribute to
increasing thunderstorm development through 21-23Z.  Inhibition for
moist boundary-layer parcels (with dew points near 70F) is becoming 
increasingly negligible with continuing insolation, with modestly
steep lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates contributing to CAPE around
1500-2000+ J/kg.  

Despite the rather modest to weak low-level and deep-layer shear,
thunderstorms are likely to continue to slowly intensify within the
destabilizing environment, into and beyond peak daytime heating. 
Stronger updraft pulses may eventually pose increasing potential to
produce severe hail and damaging downbursts.  As convection begins
to consolidate and become more widespread, this threat should
diminish, but strengthening convective outflow may continue to pose
potential for gusty/locally damaging winds into early evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 159
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
315 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 315 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop and increase in coverage
through the afternoon and evening across much of west Texas, in an
increasingly moist and unstable environment.  The strongest cells
are expected to produce large hail and damaging wind gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Amarillo TX to 35 miles east of Dryden TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27025.

0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far
southeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.
