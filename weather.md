Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0952 AM CDT Wed Apr 03 2024

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast reasoning (see below) remains the same, and no
additions were made with this update. Despite fairly high confidence
in the development of a north-south corridor of locally elevated
meteorological conditions from south-central NE through central KS
this afternoon, marginal fuels limit confidence in any large-fire
potential -- precluding Elevated highlights.

..Weinman.. 04/03/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1246 AM CDT Wed Apr 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
A large scale upper-low will amplify across the eastern CONUS today.
An occluded surface low near Lake Michigan will result in a tight
pressure gradient across much of the Plains. This pressure gradient
combined with a deeply mixed atmosphere and strong winds aloft will
lead to strong northerly winds across the central Plains from
Nebraska to Oklahoma. In addition, minimum relative humidity will be
around 20 to 30 percent. Despite these conditions favorable for fire
weather in the central Plains, no areas are needed due to moist
fuels.

Mesoscale Discussion 0367
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0905 AM CDT Wed Apr 03 2024

Areas affected...Portions of north FL and extreme southeast GA

Concerning...Tornado Watch 85...

Valid 031405Z - 031530Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 85 continues.

SUMMARY...An isolated damaging wind and tornado threat may continue
across parts of north FL. A local extension in area of Tornado Watch
85 is possible. Or, a new downstream Watch could be issued.

DISCUSSION...A cluster/loosely organized line of convection is
ongoing across north FL and far southeast GA this morning ahead of a
cold front. While the 12Z sounding from JAX showed substantial
capping/inhibition and visible satellite indicates some anvil
shading, continued diurnal heating of the moist low-level airmass
ahead of the line of thunderstorms should help gradually erode most
of the remaining MLCIN. Weak instability will likely be sufficient
to maintain convective structure and intensity given ample low-level
and deep-layer shear present on recent VWPs from KJAX. With around
200-250 m2/s2 of 0-1 km SRH present, embedded updraft rotation
within the line should continue to pose some threat for a few
tornadoes through the rest of the morning and perhaps into the
afternoon, as convection spreads east-southeastward across the north
FL Peninsula. Occasional damaging winds will also remain a concern
as low-level lapse rates gradually steepen. A local extension in
area of Tornado Watch 85, or a new downstream Watch, will need to be
considered for parts of north FL.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  North and central Florida
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 1040 AM
  until 500 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...A pre-frontal band of thunderstorms will continue to
develop slowly southeastward from north into central Florida through
the afternoon.  Embedded storms will be capable of producing
damaging winds of 60-70 mph, while the potential for a couple of
tornadoes will be greater with any isolated supercells that can form
just ahead of the main line of storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
north and south of a line from 60 miles south southwest of Cross
City FL to 25 miles east of St Augustine FL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

## SPC Apr 3, 2024 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0726 AM CDT Wed Apr 03 2024

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL FLORIDA INTO SOUTHEAST GEORGIA AND FAR SOUTHERN
SOUTH CAROLINA...AND FOR PORTIONS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to occasionally severe thunderstorms are possible today from
parts of the Mid-Atlantic states to Florida.  Damaging gusts and an
isolated risk for a tornado or two are the primary hazards.

...Mid-Atlantic states into the coastal Carolinas and GA/FL...
Morning water-vapor imagery shows a deep-layer cyclone centered over
southern Lake Michigan and this feature will slowly migrate east
into OH during the period.  Occluded low over southern Great Lakes
will slowly fill as a secondary cyclone deepens as it moves from
NC/VA this morning to south/east of Long Island late tonight.  A
cold front will sweep east across the Southeast and through much of
the FL Peninsula.  

Strong to severe thunderstorm activity this morning concentrated
over the FL Panhandle and southern GA will continue to progress east
to the immediate southeast of an intense mid-level speed max over
the southern Appalachians.  The airmass south and east of the front
in north FL and southern GA will slowly heat/destabilize today
despite relatively poor 850-500 mb lapse rates (reference 10z Cape
Canaveral and 12z Tampa and Jacksonville raobs).  Strengthening and
gradually veering flow with height will support organized line
segments and occasional supercell structures embedded within the
convective band.  A tornado or two and damaging gusts will be
possible with the stronger activity through midday.  As this
activity pushes southeastward over north FL into the central part of
the Peninsula this afternoon, wind damage will likely become the
primary severe hazard of concern.  

Farther north, strong mid-level height falls and the aforementioned
deepening of the low will invoke a strong mass response across the
Mid-Atlantic states.  Relatively rich low-level moisture over NC
this morning (low to mid 60s surface dewpoints) will advance
northward in tandem with a warm front as the low develops northeast
during the day.  Model guidance indicates a band of scattered
thunderstorms will develop over central VA by early afternoon and
move east towards the coast.  A few of the stronger storms will
potentially evolve into supercells and/or organized line segments
with damaging gusts/tornado as the main threats.  Farther south over
central NC into northeast SC, some stabilizing influence from early
morning convection (reference the 12z Charleston raob) and
large-scale ascent focusing farther north lends uncertainty on
coverage/magnitude of the severe risk near/south of VA/NC border. 
Have lowered severe probabilities in parts of NC/SC to account for
this observational trend and forecast scenario.  

...Southwest OR into Central ID...
Mid-level moistening is anticipated across the region as upper
troughing approaches from the northwest. This moistening atop a
deeply mixed boundary will support modest buoyancy. Increasing
ascent will interact with this destabilizing air mass to support
thunderstorm development during the late afternoon. Deep-layer shear
should be strong enough to support updraft organization and
potentially a few supercells. These rotating updrafts may support
isolated hail, while high cloud bases support the potential for
strong outflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0344
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0959 AM CDT Tue Apr 02 2024

Areas affected...Portions of WV

Concerning...Tornado Watch 74...

Valid 021459Z - 021630Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 74 continues.

SUMMARY...A substantial severe wind threat (70-90+ mph gusts), along
with isolated tornadoes, will approach Charleston West Virginia and
vicinity through noon.

DISCUSSION...KHTS recently measured a significant severe wind gust
to 80 kt (92 mph) with a compact but well organized cluster
currently moving quickly eastward across parts of WV. Even though
the airmass across this region remains only weakly unstable, very
strong low-level and deep-layer shear is helping to compensate and
provide convective organization. Recent radar data from KRLX shows
enhanced inbound velocities embedded within the line that suggest
70-90+ mph wind gusts will likely continue to be a threat with this
line as it approaches the Charleston WV metro and vicinity over the
next hour (through noon EDT). In addition to this substantial
severe/damaging wind threat, isolated tornadoes embedded within the
line also appear possible given the strength of the low-level flow
and related shear.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0605 AM CDT Mon Apr 01 2024

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
A cold front will move south across Texas on Tuesday. In the wake of
this cold front, dry and breezy conditions are expected. The best
potential for Elevated fire weather conditions will be portions of
the Texas Hill Country into far South Texas where sustained winds of
15 to 20 mph and relative humidity around 20 percent are expected.
However, fuels have mostly greened up in this region and fuel
availability may be limited. Therefore, an Elevated delineation was
not added at this time.
