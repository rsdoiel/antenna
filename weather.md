URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
210 PM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Iowa
  Southern and East-Central Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 210 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to develop this afternoon
while posing a threat for large hail up to 1.5-2.5 inches in
diameter. As this activity spreads east-northeastward, damaging
winds around 60-70 mph may become more of a threat through this
evening, especially if thunderstorms can form into clusters. A
tornado or two also appears possible with any persistent,
surface-based supercell.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles north northwest
of Eau Claire WI to 15 miles southwest of Mason City IA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24030.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

Valid 192000Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE UPPER MIDWEST INTO EASTERN KANSAS...WESTERN MISSOURI...AND FAR
NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon and
evening across central/eastern Minnesota, Iowa, and western
Wisconsin. A couple of tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds may
occur across this region. Farther south, an area of locally severe
wind gusts and hail may also develop over parts of eastern Kansas,
southwest Missouri, and northeast Oklahoma.

...20Z Update...
The 18Z observed Minneapolis sounding showed steep mid-level lapse
rates in addition to a long and predominantly straight hodograph.
The expectation remains that a few supercells may initially develop
from north-central Iowa into east-central Minnesota over the next
2-3 hours. These storms would pose the greatest risk for
large/very-large hail. Given weak low-level shear evident on area
VAD data in combination with linear forcing from the cold front,
upscale growth should still occur quickly with a transition to more
of a damaging wind threat. As this is in line with the thinking of
the previous forecast, no changes have been made other than minor
changes to the general thunderstorm area.

See the previous discussion for further details.

..Wendt.. 09/19/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1126 AM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024/

...Minnesota/Wisconsin/Iowa...
Widely spaced and mainly elevated thunderstorms ongoing late this
morning across parts of IA into eastern MN and western WI should
continue to diminish in coverage over the next couple of hours. In
their wake, daytime heating of a seasonably moist low-level airmass
(surface dewpoints generally in the 60s) and somewhat steep
mid-level lapse rates will contribute to at least moderate
instability by mid afternoon along/ahead of a cold front extending
north to south from western MN into eastern NE and western IA. An
upper low over northern ND and southeast SK/southwest MB will
continue to advance slowly northeastward across south-central Canada
through the period. A belt of 35-50 kt mid-level west-southwesterly
winds on the southern periphery of the upper low will spread
eastward from the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest through
this evening. A veering/strengthening wind profile with height
through mid levels will support around 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear
across the warm sector. This shear will be sufficient for organized
thunderstorms, including the potential for a few supercells.

Current expectations are that scattered thunderstorms will develop
by mid to late afternoon across central/eastern MN into
northern/central IA along or just ahead of the eastward-advancing
cold front. A rather favorable thermodynamic environment will foster
robust updrafts, and any initial supercells should pose a threat for
large to very large hail (around 1.5-2.5 inches in diameter). But, a
fairly quick transition to more linear structures should occur given
the presence of the cold front, with a potentially greater damaging
wind threat evolving with eastward extent through the evening before
convection eventually weakens. South-southwesterly low-level flow
and related shear ahead of the front is not forecast to be overly
strong by most guidance this afternoon. But, some threat for a
couple of tornadoes remains apparent, especially with any sustained
supercells across east-central/southern MN into northern IA late
this afternoon/early evening.

...Eastern Kansas into Missouri and Northeast Oklahoma...
An upper ridge, with rather warm mid-level temperatures, will remain
centered over the southern Plains today. The surface cold front is
forecast to continue moving east-southeastward across the mid MO
Valley and central Plains through late this afternoon. A surface
trough extending southward from this front across the southern High
Plains should also mix eastward through peak daytime heating. Given
weak large-scale ascent and rather warm mid-level temperatures
across this area, there is still a fair amount of uncertainty
regarding how many additional thunderstorms will develop later
today, notwithstanding the ongoing (mainly elevated) convection over
eastern KS and far northwest MO. Still, other surface-based
thunderstorms may develop later this afternoon along/near the
front/dryline intersection in south-central KS/north-central OK, and
along the cold front in eastern KS. While low/mid-level flow should
remain fairly modest, steepened low-level lapse rates and moderate
instability should support a risk for mainly severe/damaging
downdrafts as convection spreads east-southeastward into western MO
and northeast OK through this evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Multiple mid-level troughs will traverse the Intermountain West and
eject into the central and northern Mississippi Valley through the
middle of next week, encouraging surface high pressure and cooler
air to gradually overspread much of the CONUS. Appreciable rainfall
accumulations are likely across the southern Plains into the Ohio
Valley through next week, which should help dampen very dry fuels
across these regions. Approaching cooler temperatures or meaningful
rainfall accumulations over much of the CONUS suggests that
quiescent fire weather conditions should prevail for this upcoming
week. Locally dry and breezy conditions may occur over portions of
the Interior West or High Plains, but such conditions appear too
localized to warrant critical probabilities this outlook.

0240 PM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF NM INTO
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...PARTS OF THE UPPER MIDWEST INTO THE
CENTRAL PLAINS...CENTRAL APPALACHIANS VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Saturday afternoon to
early evening in New Mexico and the southern High Plains, mid
Missouri Valley to upper Mississippi Valley, and central
Appalachians region.

...Southern High Plains...
In advance of a southern-stream shortwave trough reaching the Four
Corners, a strong midlevel jet is forecast to eject over NM by early
evening Saturday. This will yield favorable deep-layer shear for
organized storms across NM into parts of northwest TX. Strengthening
large-scale ascent within a low-level warm/moist conveyor should
overspread this region by Saturday morning. This should yield
early-period convection and renders moderate uncertainty over the
degree of destabilization by afternoon. 

Still, with ample boundary-layer heating to the south of early-day
activity, a plume of at least weak-surface based buoyancy should
develop. Renewed afternoon to early evening thunderstorms could
become severe. Steep mid-level lapse rates should be confined along
and west of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, rendering further
uncertainty over the intensity and coverage of the severe threat.
The eastern extent of the threat should be limited by the confined
buoyancy plume and decreasing instability deeper into TX/OK. 

...Central Plains and Lower/Mid-MO Valley to the Upper MS Valley...
A relatively complex and uncertain evolution to convective potential
remains evident on Saturday afternoon/evening. This region will
largely remain within a low-amplitude mid-level ridge. This may
flatten somewhat in between a southern-stream shortwave trough in
the Southwest and a northern-stream trough over the southern Prairie
Provinces to along the ND/MN international border. In association
with the latter wave, a surface cold front should push southeast in
the north-central states. Guidance varies with the degree of
destabilization ahead of it, and especially with the spatial extent
of afternoon/evening convection. There is sufficient confidence in
destabilization and storm coverage to introduce a 5% area from the
mid MO Valley to the upper MS Valley, though uncertainty remains
rather high. 

...Parts of the Northeast/Mid Atlantic...
A low-amplitude midlevel shortwave trough is forecast to move
through northwesterly flow aloft across parts of the upper Ohio
Valley into the Mid Atlantic on Saturday. Isolated to scattered
thunderstorm development will be possible across the region during
the afternoon. Veering wind profiles within the northwesterly flow
regime will support effective shear for some storm organization,
though it remains somewhat uncertain if instability will become
sufficient to support an organized severe threat. Guidance has
trended toward somewhat greater instability and storm coverage, and
a small Marginal Risk has been included where confidence is
currently highest in some severe threat.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0209 PM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains generally on track. A few hours of dry
and occasionally breezy conditions may precede isolated thunderstorm
development across northern portions of the Texas Panhandle into
northwestern Oklahoma. However, the marginal nature of these
conditions suggest that wildfire-spread concerns should remain
localized, so no fire weather highlights have been introduced this
outlook.

..Squitieri.. 09/19/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0121 AM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024/

...Synopsis...
A low-latitude midlevel low will advance eastward across the Lower
CO River Valley, while a related belt of strong deep-layer
southwesterly flow overspreads the Southwest. Boundary-layer mixing
into this strong deep-layer flow will favor dry/breezy conditions
across portions of western NM and eastern AZ during the afternoon.
While this could lead to locally elevated fire-weather conditions,
fuels are generally unsupportive of large-fire spread at this time.
Elsewhere, a minimal overlap of breezy surface winds and low RH
should limit fire-weather concerns.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

Valid 191300Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
MINNESOTA...IOWA AND WESTERN WISCONSIN SOUTHWARD INTO EASTERN KANSAS
AND WESTERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across central/eastern
Minnesota, Iowa, and western Wisconsin. A couple tornadoes, isolated
large hail, and damaging winds may occur. An area of locally severe
gusts and hail may also develop over parts of eastern Kansas,
southwest Missouri, and into northeast Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery shows a slow-moving mid- to
upper-level low near the SK/MB/Dakotas border.  A negatively tilted
shortwave trough will move across the Dakotas and MN through the
day.  A belt of strong (40-50 kt) 500mb flow will extend through the
base of the trough from NE wrapping cyclonically through the Upper
MS Valley into western ON and to the northwest of a flattening ridge
over the mid MS Valley/southwest Great Lakes.  Farther south, weaker
west to northwest winds will encompass an area around a southern
Plains upper high from KS/OK into MO and AR.  In the high levels,
flow will be strongest across the central Plains, with weakening
winds over the northern Plains/upper MS Valley.

In the low levels, a cyclone will develop northeastward from
southeast SK into central MB by early Friday morning, while a cold
front moves into MN/western IA by mid afternoon, with frontolysis
expected during the latter part of the period.  A wind shift/surface
trough will also extend southward across eastern KS and into
northern OK.  Ahead of the aforementioned boundaries, southerly flow
will maintain a plume of mid to upper 60s F dewpoints.

...MN/IA/WI...
Scattered weak, elevated storms from the lower MO Valley northward
into MN/WI will gradually move east this morning and likely
dissipate by midday.  Cloud breaks and clearing in their wake will
contribute to appreciable heating and moderate to strong buoyancy
developing from near the MO River in western IA northward into MN. 
Forecast soundings show 2500-3000 J/kg MLCAPE with a veering and
strengthening wind profile into the mid levels.  A broken band of
quasi-discrete storms (including supercells) is forecast to develop
from MN southward into at least northern IA.  The risk for a couple
of tornadoes may be highest from MN into northern IA where effective
SRH may exceed 200 m2/s2.  A couple of stronger supercells may also
develop into western/southwest IA per recent HRRR model trends. 
Given the northward lifting of the shortwave trough, and increasing
inhibition east of the MS River, the primary threat should remain
relatively narrow.

...Eastern KS into western MO and into OK...
Widely scattered thunderstorms are ongoing this morning from
south-central into northeast KS.  Much of this activity will likely
dissipate but a few residual storms may continue or regenerate on
outflow over parts of western MO later this afternoon.  Strong
heating and the steepening of 0-3 km lapse rates will favor the
development of other isolated to widely scattered storms later this
afternoon near the wind shift.  12 UTC regional raobs sampled warm
mid-level temperatures (around -1 deg C at 525 mb at Norman, OK). 
These warm midlevel temperatures will limit the overall magnitude of
instability.  However, lengthy mid to upper level hodographs will
support storm organization with any robust/established updraft.  The
stronger storms will potentially be capable of a risk for severe
gusts and perhaps large hail.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0356 AM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

Valid 221200Z - 271200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Some severe potential is evident on both D4/Sunday and D5/Monday.
But both regimes appear to be focused on the mesoscale, rendering
insufficient predictability at this time frame for a 15 percent
highlight. A combination of both low predictability and potential is
apparent mid-week next week.

A southern-stream shortwave trough is expected to progress from the
Southwest into the central Great Plains on D4. A confined belt of
enhanced mid-level southwesterlies overspreading a corridor of rich
boundary-layer moisture just ahead of an attendant weak surface
cyclone may yield a severe-storm threat on Sunday afternoon. Per
consensus of latest guidance, the most favored area could be
centered around the Lower MO Valley. This shortwave trough may
continue northeastward towards the Upper MS Valley into D5. Guidance
spread increases with the degree of forward speed, along with
potential weakening of the flow fields surrounding the trough.
Still, a similar setup may occur on Monday in parts of the Midwest,
centered on the southwest Great Lakes region. Mid-level lapse rates
on both days are uniformly depicted to be weak, suggestive of
lower-end severe potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 2084
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0342 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Areas affected...The eastern Texas Panhandle into northwest Oklahoma
and southern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 182042Z - 182245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is expected by late
afternoon/early evening across the eastern Texas Panhandle and into
adjacent portions of northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas.
Thunderstorm coverage should remain sufficiently isolated to
preclude watch issuance, but instances of severe hail/wind will be
possible.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery shows deepening cumulus along a
weakly confluent surface trough across the TX Panhandle into
southern KS. The southerly flow regime across the region has helped
offset the influence of diurnal mixing with dewpoints remaining the
low to mid 60s. Concurrently, temperatures are warming into the low
to mid 90s, which is eroding inhibition and supporting MLCAPE
upwards of around 1000 J/kg. Any further improvements to the
thermodynamic environment will be modest through late afternoon,
namely in the form of steepening low-level lapse rates as
temperatures peak in the mid to upper 90s. However, nearly zonal
30-35 knot flow aloft is supporting somewhat elongated mid-level
hodographs with similar effective bulk shear values. This kinematic
environment should support organized convection, including the
potential for a supercell or two with an attendant risk for large
hail (most likely up to 1.0-1.75 inches in diameter) and severe
winds. Based on the aforementioned satellite trends, at least a
couple of storms appear probable, but the fairly weak forcing for
ascent along the surface trough and stronger inhibition downstream
into OK and KS suggests that storm coverage and duration may be
limited. Consequently, watch issuance is unlikely.

Mesoscale Discussion 2083
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Areas affected...parts of eastern South Dakota...adjacent
northeastern Nebraska and southwestern Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181953Z - 182230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of one or two strong storms appears
possible late this afternoon.  Sustained storm development may
include the evolution of supercell structures posing a risk for
severe hail, and perhaps some potential for a tornado by early
evening.  Due to the isolated nature, it is not certain that a
severe weather watch is needed, but trends are being monitored.

DISCUSSION...Although stronger mid-level height falls appear to be
shifting to the north, a destabilizing warm sector boundary layer
across the eastern South Dakota vicinity will remain beneath weakly
difluent cyclonic mid-level flow into early evening.  With
mixed-layer CAPE now on the order of 1500 J/kg, beneath 30-50 kt
southwesterly mid/upper flow, the environment appears at least
conditionally supportive of supercells, and low-level hodographs may
enlarge with clockwise curvature as southerly flow around 850 mb is
forecast to strengthen some (to around 30+ kt) through 22-00Z.

Although low-level forcing for sustained convective development
remains unclear, weak warm advection to the east of the dryline may
be supporting ongoing attempts at deepening convection east of Huron
into the Watertown vicinity.  And objective analysis has indicated a
persistent localized area of enhanced convergence along a confluence
zone near/west of Yankton.

Model output, including the convection allowing guidance, suggest
that probabilities for thunderstorm development are generally low
into early evening.  However, the initiation of one or two storms
appears possible.  If this is sustained, this may include the
evolution of supercell structures posing a risk for severe hail, and
perhaps some potential for a tornado.

1230 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from mid-afternoon to
mid-evening on Thursday across central/eastern Minnesota, Iowa, and
western Wisconsin. A few tornadoes, isolated very large hail, and
damaging winds may occur.

...Upper Midwest...
A seasonably strong stacked cyclone initially near the ND/SK/MB
border region is forecast to move northeastward through the period.
An attendant cold front will move eastward through the day across
parts of the upper Midwest and central Plains. Diurnal heating of a
rather moist airmass along/east of the front will support a
relatively narrow zone of moderate to large MLCAPE (1500-3000 J/kg)
by peak heating. Moderate midlevel flow will support sufficient
effective shear for storm organization, with shear vectors generally
aligned perpendicular to the front. This will support supercell
potential from central/eastern MN into western WI and parts of IA,
though the timing of initial development and western extent of the
primary severe threat remain somewhat uncertain.

Favorable instability and an initially discrete storm mode will
support large to very large hail as storms mature, along with some
potential for isolated damaging wind. Low-level hodographs will also
be sufficiently curved/enlarged to support a tornado threat. A
tendency toward clustering and perhaps some modest upscale growth is
possible later in the storm evolution, with a severe threat likely
persisting into the early/mid evening. The threat should begin to
wane by late evening into Thursday night, as instability weakens
with time and eastward extent. 

...Eastern KS/northern OK into southeast NE/western MO... 
A conditionally favorable storm environment is also expected to
develop from southeast NE into eastern KS/western MO and northern
OK, along/ahead of the approaching front. While storm coverage will
generally be less compared to areas farther north (due to weaker
large-scale ascent), isolated supercells and/or stronger clusters
will be possible from late afternoon into the evening. Increasingly
warm midlevel temperatures will tend to limit updraft intensity with
southward extent, but an isolated severe threat could extend as far
south as northern OK.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHEAST NEBRASKA INTO FAR NORTHWEST IOWA...EASTERN SOUTH
DAKOTA...AND WESTERN MINNESOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing severe wind gusts and large hail
are possible today across parts of the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota
into the mid Missouri Valley. A marginal severe threat will also
extend southward into parts of the central and southern Plains.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest to the Southern High Plains...
A closed upper low centered over eastern MT will continue
northeastward during the period, reaching southeast SK by early
Thursday morning. Upper-level ridging extending northward from the
northwest Gulf Coast into the upper MS Valley will slowly shift
eastward to the Upper Great Lakes. A belt of enhanced southwesterly
mid-level flow will extend from southern CA through the central High
Plains, while also wrapping cyclonically through the eastern Dakotas
and into southern Canada. At the surface, a trough/front extends
southward from central ND into SD and western NE, before continuing
southwestward over the central/southern High Plains. This boundary
may serve as a focus for renewed thunderstorm development later
today.

A band of elevated convection has generally moved northward from
northeast ND and northwest MN into southern MB. In the wake of this
activity, cloud cover remains prevalent across much of the warm
sector across the northern Plains/Upper Midwest. Still, filtered
daytime heating of an adequately moist boundary layer should aid in
the development of around 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE by late
afternoon. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms may form along/east
of the surface trough/front within a favorable zone of 30-40 kt of
effective bulk shear. But, better large-scale forcing associated
with the upper low over the northern High Plains will tend to remain
displaced north and west (in southern Canada). Accordingly, 12Z
high-resolution guidance continues to vary regarding storm coverage
across the Slight Risk (isolated versus scattered) given the weaker
forcing aloft. Even with this continued uncertainty, various NAM/RAP
forecast soundings still suggest a somewhat conditional risk for
organized storms (mix of multicells and supercells). Severe
hail/wind may accompany the stronger storms from late afternoon
through early evening, before this activity eventually weakens.

Further south into the central/southern Plains, low-levels are
forecast to be somewhat drier near the surface trough, with surface
dewpoints expected to mostly range in the upper 50s to low 60s by
late afternoon with pronounced boundary-layer mixing. Warmer
mid-level temperatures and limited large-scale ascent across these
regions should temper the overall intensity of any updrafts that can
form and be sustained, and resultant intensity/coverage of this
convection. Still, some guidance shows locally greater thunderstorm
coverage and resulting isolated severe wind threat from the eastern
TX Panhandle into far northwest OK and southern KS during the late
afternoon/early evening, where low-level lapse rates should be
maximized with robust daytime heating.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...17z Update...
Morning observations show widespread precipitation greater than 0.1
inches, with pockets as high as 1-1.25 inches, has fallen over much
of western SD and western NE in the last 72 hours. While some drier
pockets remain, fuel guidance shows a notable decrease in dryness as
a result. Meteorological conditions may still support some localized
fire-weather concerns with strong southwesterly winds expected
behind the surface low this afternoon. However, the strongest winds
are likely to remain farther northwest where the heaviest
precipitation has fallen. Gusty winds and humidity below 20% may
support some drying today, but fuel recovery is expected to be
modest such that no areas will be introduced. See the prior
discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 09/18/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024/

...Synopsis...
A deep low-pressure system will move slowly east-northeastward over
the northern High Plains through the period. On the backside of this
system, a tight pressure gradient, and boundary-layer mixing into a
belt of strong flow aloft, will yield strong post-frontal surface
winds and 15-20 percent RH from eastern WY into the central Dakotas.
While this would ordinarily support fire-weather concerns,
precipitation over the past 24 hours should limit fuel receptiveness
and the overall fire-weather threat.

## Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 13

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Ileana has been devoid of deep convection since yesterday afternoon, 
as the system has been within a strong wind shear and very dry 
environment. Given the lack of convection, the system is being 
designated as a post-tropical remnant low.  An ASCAT-C pass from 
late last night depicted winds near 30 kt over the Gulf of 
California near northern Sinaloa.  Given this, will hold the 
intensity at 30 kt for this advisory, although that may be generous.
 
The system has been meandering over the Gulf of California with a 
motion of 310/3 kt.  The remnant low will increase forward speed 
later today as it continues northwestward.  The remnant low will 
continue to weaken throughout the day, and is forecast to dissipate 
on Monday. 

This is the last advisory on this system. For additional 
information on the remnant low please see High Seas Forecasts issued 
by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
