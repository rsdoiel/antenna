Mesoscale Discussion 0113
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern OK into northwest AR and
extreme southwest MO

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 181348Z - 181645Z

SUMMARY...Light to locally moderate freezing rain and/or sleet is
possible this morning. Increasing snow rates are possible by late
morning across northeast Oklahoma and vicinity.

DISCUSSION...Light precipitation is gradually increasing this
morning across parts of central/eastern OK, in response to warm
advection near/above 850 mb atop a southward-advancing arctic
airmass. The 12Z OUN sounding depicts saturation primarily below a
notable temperature inversion around 700 mb. In the short term,
given the relatively shallow saturated layer and lack of deeper
ascent above this layer, a period of freezing drizzle/light freezing
rain will be possible, with relatively efficient ice accretion in
areas where near-surface temperatures fall through the 20s F. 

With time, deeper/stronger ascent will result in locally heavier
precipitation rates later this morning. This may be accompanied by
an transition to sleet and snow (especially with northward extent),
due to continued near-surface cold advection and wet-bulb cooling of
the initially dry layer near 700 mb. Snow rates may begin to
increase by late morning across northeast OK and vicinity, with
locally heavy snow possible this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0630 AM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Valid 181300Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHEAST TEXAS AND SOUTHERN LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible this evening across parts
of southeast Texas, shifting across southern Louisiana tonight. Hail
should be the primary hazard, but a brief tornado and occasional
severe gusts may occur along the immediate Louisiana Coast.

...Southeast Texas into Southern Louisiana...
A mid-level shortwave trough will progress east-southeastward from
the Great Basin to the southern Plains by tonight. At the surface,
an arctic cold front will continue surging southward across TX
through the day, eventually reaching the TX Coast by late tonight.
Modest low-level moisture is forecast to advance northward
along/near the middle/upper TX Coast ahead of the front.
Thunderstorms should eventually form by this evening across parts of
southeast TX as the shortwave trough approaches. Various NAM/RAP
forecast soundings suggest this convection will likely remain
elevated above a near-surface stable layer. Still, around 1000-1250
J/kg of MUCAPE aided by modestly steepened mid-level lapse rates,
and strong deep-layer shear in the cloud bearing layer, may support
isolated severe hail with the more robust cores. This activity will
spread eastward across portions of southern LA late this evening and
overnight while posing mainly a continued hail threat. There is also
a low, but non-zero, chance of near-surface-based thunderstorms
along the immediate LA Coast late tonight into early Wednesday
morning, where somewhat greater low-level moisture should be
present. If convection can become surface-based across this area,
then isolated strong to severe wind gusts and perhaps a brief
tornado would be possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Height rises and building high pressure across the western US and
southern/central Rockies will result in lighter winds where dry
conditions are expected. Across the Plains, an arctic air mass will
settle in, with cool and wet conditions across much of the southern
and central Plains. Less precipitation is forecast across western
Texas, but light winds and higher relative humidity is expected.
Overall, fire weather concerns will be minimal owing to cool
conditions and lighter wind speeds where the driest conditions are
expected.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 13

  100 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A line of thunderstorms will continue to move

Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0110
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern Florida...Southeast Georgia...Eastern
Southern Carolina...Far Southern North Carolina

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13...

Valid 161348Z - 161545Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13
continues.

SUMMARY...A threat for damaging wind gusts will continue this
morning from parts of northern Florida northeastward into southeast
Georgia and the Carolinas.

DISCUSSION...The latest mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
to severe storms from the eastern Florida Panhandle northeastward
into the central Carolinas. Ahead of the line, surface dewpoints in
the 60s F are contributing to weak instability. The RAP has MUCAPE
less than 500 J/kg in most areas across the Atlantic coastal plains.
In spite of this, frontal forcing is strong near the line, which
will likely help the line to maintain strength over the next few
hours. With the strong low to mid-level flow in place, evident on
regional WSR-88D VWPs, the line is expected to continue to produce
isolated damaging gusts, especially along the parts that are more
organized. The wind-damage threat will likely persist into the mid
to late morning as the line moves through the Atlantic coastal
areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 0109
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern New York...Northern New England

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 161328Z - 161930Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snow will likely develop across parts of northern
New York and northern New England this morning. Further south into
parts of east-central New York and central New England, a mix of
snow, sleet and freezing rain will be possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level trough will quickly move through the
southern and central Appalachians this morning. A surface low will
deepen and move northeastward into the Northeast. Ahead of the
system, a band of strong warm-advection was located from New York
eastward into the southern New England, where widespread
precipitation is ongoing. The freezing line is currently located
from southern New York eastward into southern New England. A zone
(about 100 miles wide) of freezing rain and sleet is located to the
north of the freezing line. This freezing rain and sleet will spread
northward over the next few hours. A changeover to rain will occur
as the freezing line moves northward. In addition, areas that are
experiencing snow may changeover to freezing rain. Freezing rain
rates could exceed 0.05 inches per hour.

Further north into northern New England, surface temperatures are in
the teens and single digits. The cold air in the low to mid-levels
will make snow the primary precipitation type. As strong warm
advection and isentropic lift increase across the region, the
development of heavy snow will likely occur in many areas. Snowfall
rates could exceed 1 inch per hour.
