## Hurricane Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 12

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024
 
Kristy's satellite presentation has improved this morning as the eye
has reappeared on infrared and visible imagery, with deep convection
wrapping around the center. A recent AMSR2 microwave pass depicted
that the system has completed an eyewall replacement cycle, with an
inner core becoming re-established and contracting towards the
center. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimate data-T values
have increased since the previous advisory with T6.5 from both
TAFB and SAB. Given these intensity estimates and recent satellite
images, the intensity is set to 130 kt for this advisory.
 
The hurricane is moving westward at an estimated motion of 270/15
kt, being steered by a ridge located over the northeastern Pacific.
Kristy will gradually round the southwestern portion of the ridge
over the next day or so, with a turn to the northwest then
north-northwest continuing through the weekend between the flow of
the aforementioned ridge and a trough to the west. By the end of the
weekend, Kristy is forecast to rapidly weaken with the remnants
turning west-southwestward within the low-level steering flow. The
NHC forecast was nudged slightly to the right of the previous
forecast, closer to the simple consensus aids.
 
Kristy is forecast to remain within a favorable environment for the
next 24 hours or so, with warm sea surface temperatures and light
vertical wind shear. The intensity forecast calls for some slight
re-intensification during this time, although recent microwave
imagery depicts that another eyewall replacement cycle could occur,
which would cause some intensity fluctuations in the short term.
Thereafter, the environment quickly becomes hostile with strong wind
shear, drier air and cooler sea surface temperatures along the
forecast track of Kristy. Guidance is in fairly good agreement that
rapid weakening should occur through the end of the forecast period.
Model simulated satellite imagery depicts that Kristy will begin to
lose convection and become a post-tropical remnant low around 72 h,
and depicts the system opening into a trough by 120 h. The NHC
intensity forecast follows these trends, showing rapid weakening,
and now has the remnant low status at 72h, and dissipation at 120 h.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Thu Oct 24 2024

Valid 241300Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING
INTO EARLY TONIGHT FROM EASTERN KS TO NORTHERN MO AND IA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated large hail (1-1.75 inch diameter) and isolated strong gusts
(50-60 mph) will be possible from eastern Kansas into northern
Missouri and much of Iowa this evening into early tonight.

...Eastern KS/northern MO/IA this evening into tonight...
A midlevel shortwave trough over western WY this morning will
progress to the central Plains this evening and the mid MS Valley by
early Friday.  Downstream from this midlevel trough, lee
cyclogenesis is expected across the central High Plains this
afternoon, which will aid in northward advection of a partially
modified Gulf air mass (boundary-layer dewpoints of 55-60 F). 
Strong surface heating/mixing across KS/OK will result in a narrow
surface warm sector with moderate buoyancy (MLCAPE near 1000 J/kg)
by mid-late afternoon across eastern KS.  The eastern extent of the
surface warm sector will be demarcated by a warm front into western
MO.

Surface-based thunderstorm development will be possible by roughly
22-00z along a surface trough/cold front across eastern KS, with
subsequent expansion of elevated convection farther northeast across
northern MO/southern IA through early tonight in a zone of
strengthening low-level warm advection.  Isolated strong outflow
gusts (50-60 mph) will be possible with the initial storms across
eastern KS this evening in the zone of steeper low-level lapse
rates.  Steep midlevel lapse rates, moderate buoyancy, and
sufficiently long/curved hodographs will support some potential for
embedded supercells capable of producing isolated large hail (1-1.75
inch diameter) into early tonight.  The area from eastern KS to
northwest MO was considered for a SLGT risk upgrade, and this area
will be monitored closely in later outlook updates.

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes were necessary and please see the previous discussion for
more details.

..Nauslar.. 10/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1148 PM CDT Tue Oct 22 2024/

...Synopsis...
Large-scale critical fire weather conditions are not anticipated on
Wednesday. 

A surface high pressure will move across the central United States
today in the wake of a departing mid-level shortwave. This will
reinforce the dry airmass entrenched across the central U.S.
However, slightly cooler temperatures, especially as you go farther
north, will act to limit relative humidity from falling low enough
to support critical fire weather conditions. 

Across the Northeast, gusty winds will develop ahead of an
approaching cold front. Despite these strong, gusty winds (perhaps
gusting up to 30 mph), relative humidity should remain sufficiently
high (around 40%) to prevent the need for highlights.

## Hurricane Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 8

date: 2024-10-23, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 AM MST Wed Oct 23 2024
 
The impressive rapid intensification of Kristy has continued this 
morning. The gradually warming eye of the hurricane is surrounded by 
a ring of very deep convection, with infrared cloud tops as cold as 
-75 to -80 deg C. GOES-West derived motion winds indicate good 
upper-level outflow, particularly over the southern and western 
portions of the circulation. Subjective Dvorak classifications were 
a consensus T5.5/102-kt from TAFB and SAB at 12 UTC. Satellite 
trends suggest Kristy has kept strengthening since that time, and 
the initial intensity is set at 110 kt, following the rising 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS.

The hurricane is moving quickly westward (265/17 kt) while being 
steered by a strong subtropical ridge to its north. This quick 
westward motion should continue for the next 24-36 h. Then, an 
upper-level trough between the Hawaiian Islands and the west coast 
of the United States is forecast to erode the western extent of the 
ridge. As a result, Kristy is expected to move toward the 
west-northwest and northwest late this week and into the weekend. A 
westward motion is shown by day 5, as it is anticipated that Kristy 
will become highly sheared and decoupled, with the vertically 
shallow vortex steered by the low-level ridge. No significant 
changes were made to the latest NHC track forecast.

Kristy is a relatively small hurricane that remains susceptible to 
rapid intensity fluctuations in a weak shear environment over warm 
SSTs. The latest GFS and ECMWF SHIPS output shows a 50 to 60 percent 
chance of a 20-kt increase during the next 12 h, and the satellite 
trends suggest continued near-term strengthening is likely. The 
updated NHC forecast reflects these signals and lies above the 
intensity guidance in the near term, showing Kristy peaking as a 
category 4 hurricane on Thursday. By Friday, the aforementioned 
trough is expected to impart increased shear on the hurricane, which 
should induce weakening through the rest of the 5-day forecast 
period. With SHIPS-diagnosed shear values of 40-50 kt by the 
weekend, Kristy is forecast to quickly weaken over the weekend and 
degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low by 120 h.

BULLETIN
Hurricane Kristy Advisory Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 AM MST Wed Oct 23 2024
 
...KRISTY RAPIDLY INTENSIFIES INTO A MAJOR HURRICANE...
...ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.3N 113.9W
ABOUT 650 MI...1045 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
ABOUT 365 MI...590 KM SSW OF SOCORRO ISLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 265 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...954 MB...28.17 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kristy was located 
near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 113.9 West. Kristy is moving 
toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue through Thursday. A gradual turn toward the 
west-northwest and northwest is expected on Friday and into the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Kristy is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional steady to rapid 
strengthening is expected during the next day or so. Gradual 
weakening is forecast to begin on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy will affect portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula late this week. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

## Hurricane Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 5

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 PM MST Tue Oct 22 2024
 
Recent satellite and ASCAT data show Kristy has strengthened 
significantly over the last six hours. Satellite imagery shows 
persistent convection starting to wrap around a potential inner 
core, with high-level cirrus clouds beginning to clear out, 
revealing a developing eye. The ASCAT pass from 1618z showed a 
robust wind field, with a max wind retrieval of 53 kt. The 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates also concur with these 
observations, with T3.5/55 kt from TAFB and T4.0/65 kt from SAB at 
18 UTC. Given the improvement on satellite since that time, the 
initial intensity is now set at the upper-end of these estimates at 
65 kt, making Kristy a hurricane.
 
Kristy continues to move just north of due west this afternoon as it 
skirts along the periphery of a deep-layered subtropical 
ridge. Current motion is set at 275/16 kt and this westward motion 
should continue for the next couple of days. The cyclone will begin 
to track poleward starting this weekend around 60-72 hours as a 
mid-level trough impinges on the ridge. Uncertainty increases by 
that time given differences in the global models as to the evolution 
of the synoptic pattern.  As such, the latest NHC track forecast 
remains close to the previous one over the next couple of days and 
is just a little to the south of the previous forecast track 
thereafter.
 
The intensity forecast remains quite bullish, with rapid 
intensification expected within the next 12-24 hours as Kristy 
encounters a very favorable environment as indicated by the GFS- and 
ECMWF-SHIPS guidance. The latter aid also indicates a 40 percent 
chance of a 40 kt increase in intensity in 24 hours, nearly ten 
times the climatological average. The latest NHC forecast will 
explicitly show Kristy intensifying up to 100 kt major hurricane 
intensity in 24 h, with a peak intensity of 115 kt at 60 h. After 
60-72 h, Kristy will encounter a more hostile environment, with 
increasing shear and cooler sea surface temperatures which will 
likely weaken the cyclone by the end of the forecast. Kristy is 
likely to become post-tropical in 120 h as it loses convective 
organization.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0346 PM CDT Tue Oct 22 2024

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

Fire weather concerns will remain low in the extended. High pressure
will build in across the CONUS through the mid to late week, with
occasional shortwave progression across the northern periphery
bringing a more zonal westerly flow pattern across the Rockies. This
may bring potential for breezy conditions across portions of the
northern and central Plains, primarily on D3 - Thursday. A period of
Elevated to Critical winds and relative humidity will be possible in
the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles. Recent rainfall has left fuels in
this region less receptive to fire spread. Elsewhere, confidence in
any areas of widespread relative humidity reductions overlapping
winds remains limited at this time.  

A deeper trough may impact the CONUS late in the period D6 - Sunday
into D7 - Monday bringing a potential increase in winds but also
potential for cooler/wetter conditions. Areas across southern
Arizona will remain dry and may see a period of Elevated to Critical
fire weather conditions on D7 - Monday. This area may need
highlights as confidence increases in the coming days.

Day 3 Convective Outlook RESENT 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Tue Oct 22 2024

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
KANSAS INTO NORTHERN MISSOURI AND SOUTHERN IOWA...

...SUMMARY...
A few storms may produce hail on Thursday from far northeast Kansas
across northern Missouri and into southern Iowa.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
On Thursday, a progressive upper trough will move from the central
and northern Rockies into the Plains, as upper ridging briefly
develops from the OH Valley into the Northeast. High pressure will
be in place over much of the East in the wake of the previous days
cold front, providing generally stable conditions there.

In association with the Rockies/Plains trough, a cold front will
push quickly southeastward across the northern and central Plains,
extending roughly from MN into the TX Panhandle by 00Z. Modest
boundary-layer moistening will occur with dewpoints in the low to
mid 50s F as far north as southwest IA.

As the cold front interacts with the narrow plume of instability, at
least isolated surface-based storms are anticipated during the late
afternoon, trending toward elevated through the evening, from
northeast KS into northern MO and IA. Forecast soundings show
steepening lapse rates aloft along with veering winds with height,
suggesting a supercell, even if elevated, may occur, with hail risk.
The favored zone for initiation will be the KS portion of the cold
front where low-level lapse rates will be steepest. Overall, the
main limiting factor for this event will be moisture quality as lift
and shear will be favorable.

0255 PM CDT Tue Oct 22 2024

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed to the current D2 Fire Weather Outlook. See
previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 10/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Tue Oct 22 2024/

...Synopsis...
Large-scale critical fire weather conditions are not anticipated
across the contiguous United States on Wednesday. 

A very dry, continental airmass will remain entrenched across much
of the central United States. As a surface ridge slides east toward
the Great Lakes, a dry return flow pattern will develop across much
of the Plains. At this point, critical fire weather conditions are
not expected, but an increase in initial attack may occur. Areas
across the Plains will be monitored for potential elevated
highlights in later forecasts.

## Tropical Storm Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 3

date: 2024-10-22, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

000
WTPZ42 KNHC 220835
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Kristy Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
300 AM CST Tue Oct 22 2024
 
Satellite images indicate that Kristy has continued to gradually 
become better organized during the overnight hours.  A convective 
burst has been occurring over the low-level center, an indication 
that a central core could be forming.  The cyclone also has some 
impressive curved banding to the north and west, although these 
bands are a bit far from the center.  A pair of ASCAT passes from 
22/0346 UTC and 22/0441 UTC showed tropical storm force winds in 
the northern semi-circle, with vectors in the 35 to 38 kt range.  
Since the time of the ASCAT passes, Kristy's convection has become 
better organized, with latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB at a consensus T-3.0/45 kt.  The initial intensity 
is nudged upward to 45 kt for this advisory.

Kristy is estimated to be moving west-northwestward, or 285/13 kt. 
A strong subtropical ridge to the north of the cyclone will steer 
it westward for the next 3 days or so.  Friday into the weekend, a 
turn to the west-northwest or northwest is expected as Kristy rounds 
the western periphery of the mid to upper-level ridge, and a 
mid-latitude upper-level trough approaches from the west.  The track 
forecast is largely unchanged from the previous official forecast 
and lies in the middle of the guidance envelope.  It should be noted 
that there is quite a bit of spread in the track guidance at days 4 
and 5, so confidence in this part of the forecast is a bit below 
average.

Environmental conditions are favorable for steady strengthening, 
and rapid intensification cannot be ruled out.  For the next 
72 h, Kristy will remain within an environment of warm ocean 
temperatures, relatively weak vertical wind shear, and a moist 
troposphere.  Beyond 72 h, southerly or southwesterly vertical wind 
shear will begin to increase over the cyclone, becoming strong in 4 
to 5 days.  Kristy should also cross the 26C isotherm in about 4 
days and move into a much more stable environment.  Therefore, 
weakening should begin in 3 to 4 days, with the potential for rapid 
weakening in 4 to 5 days.  The intensity forecast is largely 
unchanged from the previous prediction, which calls for Kristy to 
peak at 100 kt in a few days, and lies near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1219 PM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
No severe thunderstorms are forecast on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough is forecast to be over western IA early Tuesday
morning before continuing northeastward throughout the day across
the Mid/Upper MS Valley and Upper Great Lakes and becoming absorbed
in the stronger westerlies. Isolated to widely scattered elevated
thunderstorms are possible Tuesday morning ahead of this wave across
the Mid MS Valley. Buoyancy will be modest, which should temper
updraft strength in most of these storms. However, relatively cool
mid-level temperatures and enhanced mid-level flow could result in
enough buoyancy and shear for a few instances of small hail.

Another shortwave trough is expected to progress through the
Canadian Prairies on Tuesday. This shortwave is expected to amplify
considerably as it moves into far northwestern Ontario. By 12Z
Wednesday, this shortwave is expected to extend from the Hudson Bay
through western Ontario and the Upper Midwest. A surface low will
precede this system, with an attendant cold front pushing
southeastward across the Upper Midwest and Upper Great Lakes.
Low-level moisture in the vicinity of this front will be minimal,
but increasing mid-level moisture coupled with cold mid-level
temperatures could still promote enough buoyancy for a few deeper
updrafts capable of producing lightning from northern MN into far
northern WI and western upper MI. 

Lastly, a thunderstorm or two appears possible across southern
portions of far west TX/TX Big Bend vicinity Tuesday afternoon.
Here, some airmass destabilization appears possible amid strong
heating, and there could be just enough low-level convergence for
convective initiation. Overall coverage in this area is currently
expected to be less than 10%.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1105 AM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 211630Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FROM CENTRAL KS INTO SOUTH CENTRAL NE...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe thunderstorms with large hail are possible across
central Kansas into south central Nebraska, mainly from mid
afternoon to early evening.

...Central Plains...
A compact upper low over eastern CO will track eastward today into
the central Plains.  As this occurs, an associated surface Pacific
cold front / dryline will sweep eastward across KS/northwest OK. 
The air mass ahead of the front will be moderately moist with
dewpoints in the 50s to near 60 F, along with at least pockets of
considerable daytime heating.  This will lead to a corridor of
potential convective initiation during the peak-heating hours.  Most
CAM solutions suggest 2-3 mesoscale zones along the boundary where
robust storms may form.  One is near the weak surface low in
southern NE where a few low-topped supercells capable of large hail
and perhaps a tornado are possible.  Another is in the area of
strongest diurnal CAPE in southern KS where hail should be the main
concern.  The final one is much lower confidence over southwest OK,
where only a small minority of CAMs initiate convection.  

Also expanded marginal wind probabilities northeastward into eastern
NE and northeast KS.  CAPE will be very limited in this region, but
strong insolation will produce steep low-level lapse rates as
convection arrives from the west around peak-heating.  This might be
sufficient for gusty winds in the stronger cells.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0800 AM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 241200Z - 291200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A mid-level trough will cross the central and eastern CONUS on
D4/Thursday and D5/Friday with a surface front advancing east
through the period. Moisture will remain limited ahead of this front
and thus, severe weather is not expected. In the wake of this front,
high pressure will build into the Midwest on D6/Saturday and move
into the Mid-Atlantic by D7/Sunday. This will result in tranquil
weather through the weekend. Extended range guidance does suggest
the potential for some return moisture flow by early next week, but
there is considerable uncertainty in the upper-level pattern and any
potential severe weather threat would likely be after Monday/D8.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND PARTS OF WEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Large hail, severe gusts and some tornado threat remain possible
across eastern New Mexico and portions of far West Texas this
evening.

...01z Update...

Strongest 500mb flow appears to be translating through the base of
the trough into western NM early this evening. This speed max will
advance into northern NM by the end of the period which will allow
the upper low to begin ejecting northeast toward the Four Corners.
Even so, negligible height changes will be noted across eastern
NM/West TX during the overnight hours. Scattered-numerous
thunderstorms have developed ahead of this upper feature with a
broken band of strong/severe convection currently extending from
near El Paso, northeast into Harding County NM, southwest of
Clayton. Several supercells have developed along this corridor which
are likely producing hail at/near severe levels, especially Chaves
County. 00z soundings from both AMA and MAF exhibited substantial
capping in the 700-750mb layer, though mid-level lapse rates are
steep. A bit west, uncapped profiles are noted at EPZ and ABQ with
strong deep-layer shear evident. Thunderstorms should continue to
develop along the leading edge of upper trough/influence where
inhibition is weak. Organized structures remain possible and large
hail is the primary risk, though gusts and perhaps a tornado or two
can not be ruled out this evening.
