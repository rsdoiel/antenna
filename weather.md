Mesoscale Discussion 1704
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0531 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Areas affected...Southern Arizona

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 559...

Valid 242231Z - 250000Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 559
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across WW 559, primarily for
severe wind gusts from thunderstorm outflow.

DISCUSSION...The severe thunderstorm threat continues for WW 559
across southern Arizona, where daytime heating has resulted in
surface temperatures rising into the 110s F. With surface dewpoints
in the lower-to-mid 60s F, MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/kg across
southwest portions of the watch area will continue to support
thunderstorm development in the short term. Proximity sounding
profiles show deeply mixed boundary layers with large saturation
deficits, and very-weak to weak deep layer shear, supporting the
threat for severe wind gusts from thunderstorm outflow. 

The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts is currently
confined to southern portions of the watch, where buoyancy is
maximized and thunderstorms are ongoing. This threat will continue
as storms move southwest towards the Mexican border, but should
diminish after dark.

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and southern Arizona

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 200 PM
  until 900 PM MST.

* Primary threats include...
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of thunderstorms will form over the Rim and
spread southwestward to the lower deserts through late evening.  The
storm environment will favor strong downdrafts capable of producing
occasional damaging/severe outflow gusts of 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west southwest
of Phoenix AZ to 65 miles east northeast of Tucson AZ. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
03020.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

Fire weather concerns will focus in parts of the Great Basin and
northern Rockies late this week into the weekend. Thereafter, fire
weather concerns will become more localized given an amplifying
upper ridge in part of the western/central U.S. and a benign surface
pattern where fuels remain driest.

...Wind/RH Concerns...
While the main shortwave trough will exit Montana into the Canadian
Prairie, some moderately strong mid-level winds will linger across
Montana and Idaho. Farther south, the compact tropical disturbance
will move into the Great Basin. A few locations may see elevated
fire weather on Friday. The highest confidence is in Northeast
California into adjacent Nevada/Oregon as well as the Snake River
Plain and parts of northwest Montana.

On Saturday, the shortwave trough in the Great Basin will be losing
amplitude, but a enhanced mid-level winds will remain in the
southern Basin. Strong surface winds are possible during the
afternoon. Some area fuels will have been impacted by several days
of convection. However, latest ERC data suggest there are still dry
enough fuels to support fire spread. When coupled with the recent
lightning activity, some potential for holdover fires to increase in
activity is possible with the stronger winds/low RH expected.

For Sunday and beyond, the upper-level pattern will feature a
building ridge centered along the Divide. Dry conditions are
probable in many places within the West, but winds will generally be
lighter outside of terrain/mesoscale-enhanced areas. Predictability
of critical fire weather is too low for any highlights.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
With the approach of the weak disturbance, a few drier thunderstorms
are possible in parts of central/northern Nevada on Friday. These
storms will generally occur over areas that have had fuel
receptiveness decrease recently. Thunderstorm activity will shift
into eastern Idaho into western Wyoming on Saturday and possibly
Sunday. Fuels are drier in these areas, but moisture may be too
limited and storm coverage is somewhat in question this far in
advance.

With some very broad troughing over the Northwest, some isolated
thunderstorms could occur over some of the terrain features.
Coverage is likely too low for highlights and fuels may moderate
somewhat due to the cooler conditions under the influence of the
upper trough.

## Tropical Storm Bud Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Storm Bud Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022024
200 PM MST Wed Jul 24 2024
 
Satellite imagery indicates that the disturbance located several 
hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja 
California peninsula has become much better organized over the past 
12 hours or so.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimate 
from TAFB is T-2.0/30 kt, and a pair of recent ASCAT passes shows 
a well-defined cyclone with 35-kt winds.  Based on the ASCAT data 
and the improvement in convective organization observed on GOES-18 
satellite images, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Storm 
Bud.

Bud is currently moving to the west-northwest at 14 kt.  A mid-level 
ridge to the north of Bud will cause a gradual turn to the west over 
the next day.  On Friday, with Bud likely weakening, the cyclone 
should turn to the southwest and decelerate, following the low-level 
flow.

Bud is currently in an environment that appears favorable in terms 
of warm SSTs and a moderately moist environment, but there appears 
to be some easterly shear affecting the cyclone.  Therefore, no 
change in strength is expected during the next day or so,
although some slight intensification cannot be ruled out.  Beyond 
36 h, the cyclone should begin traversing decreasing sea surface 
temperatures, and move into an environment of drier air and 
increasing vertical wind shear.  Therefore, gradual weakening is 
forecast during that time.  The intensity forecast is near 
the middle of the guidance envelope and calls for the cyclone to 
become a remnant low on Friday, and dissipate on Saturday.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 242000Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
WESTERN/CENTRAL NY INTO NORTHWESTERN PA...AND SOUTHERN ARIZONA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms may produce damaging wind gusts
across western/central New York and vicinity, the northern Rockies,
and across southern Arizona this afternoon/evening.

...20z Update...
The current D1 Outlook remains on track with no changes needed with
this update. 

Several clusters of thunderstorms are ongoing along a cold front
extending from the Great Lakes region northeastward into portions of
New York. In this region, daytime heating has yielded around
1000-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE with 30-40 kts of deep layer shear. In this
regime, some more organized cells have produced wind damage across
portions of New York and Pennsylvania. The threat for strong to
severe gusts will continue through the afternoon and evening,
shifting eastward with the front.

Farther west, two areas of potential continue with a Marginal Risk
across the Northern Rockies and a Slight Risk across southern
Arizona. Within these regions, damaging wind will be possible with
thunderstorm activity this afternoon. See MCD #1701 for more
information on the threat across southern Arizona.

..Thornton/Thompson.. 07/24/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024/

...Western/central NY and northwest PA this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel trough will progress eastward from the upper Great Lakes
toward NY as an associated surface cold front likewise moves
eastward into western NY and southeastward into OH/northwest PA
through this evening.  Surface heating is underway in a corridor
ahead of the cold front from northern OH into western NY where
boundary-layer dewpoints are in the mid-upper 60s with surface
temperatures warming into the lower 80s, and a band of convection
has already developed from Lake Erie to western Lake Ontario.  These
storms may persist into the afternoon while spreading eastward, with
additional development possible along convective outflow, a
pre-frontal confluence zone and/or local lake breeze boundaries. 
Midlevel lapse rates will remain modest (roughly 6.5 C/km), but the
low-level moisture/warming temperatures will drive MLCAPE in the
1000-1500 J/kg range.  Deep-layer vertical shear/hodograph length
will be on the lower margins for organized clusters/cells per local
VWPs now sampling 30-40 kt midlevel flow, while steepening low-level
lapse rates will support the potential for occasional wind damage
with strong thunderstorm outflow in the 50-60 mph range.

...Southern AZ this afternoon/evening...
Strong surface heating is underway near and south of the Rim, and
late afternoon temperatures will peak near or above 110 F across the
lower deserts into southern AZ.  Moisture will be sufficient for
thunderstorm development this afternoon along the Rim and the
mountains in southeast AZ, while northeasterly midlevel flow of
15-20 kt will steer outflows southwestward toward the lower deserts.
 MLCAPE will increase to the 1000-1500 J/kg with deep inverted-V
profiles favoring strong downdrafts and outflow winds of 60-75 mph
capable of producing wind damage and substantial blowing dust.  The
relatively greater severe threat will be with the stronger/deeper
convection driven by outflow mergers.

...Northern Rockies area this afternoon/evening...
A plume of mainly midlevel moisture with PW values of 0.75-1 inch
(per BOI and LKN 12z soundings) will persist around the northern
periphery of a midlevel high over the Great Basin, and southeast of
a midlevel trough approaching WA.  High-based thunderstorms are
expected in a few loosely organized clusters within this plume,
where deep inverted-V profiles will support the potential for a few
strong-severe outflow gusts 50-65 mph.

...Mid-Atlantic into NC this afternoon...
Modest surface heating within small cloud breaks and boundary-layer
dewpoints of 72-74 F will contribute MLCAPE approaching 1500 J/kg to
the east of the Blue Ridge, though midlevel lapse rates will remain
poor.  Still, the southern extent of 30-40 kt midlevel flow will
support a low-end wind damage threat with the stronger storm
clusters this afternoon.

0200 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 07/24/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0812 AM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024/

...Synopsis...
Isolated dry thunderstorms are anticipated across portions of
southern Idaho into southwestern Montana as an upper-level trough
continues to progress eastward across the Northwest. Additionally,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected across the southern
Cascades, portions of northern Montana, and the northern Great
Plains. 

...Pacific Northwest...
As an upper-level trough is forecast to continue progressing
eastward out of the Pacific Northwest and into Montana on Thursday,
isolated dry thunderstorms are expected across much of the region
over receptive fuels. While thunderstorm coverage could approach
scattered criteria, current forecast guidance suggests a mix of both
wet and dry thunderstorms, in addition to at least some minor
potential for some wetting rainfall from the previous day's weather.
This uncertainty currently precludes the expansion of the isolated
dry thunder area and the inclusion of any scattered dry thunder
areas, though forecast trends will continue to be monitored for
subsequent updates. 

Elevated fire-weather conditions are expected to occur over the
southern Cascades, especially where local gap flow enhanced winds
could contribute to wildfire spread with existing fires. Current
forecast guidance suggests that there is less potential for winds to
reach elevated criteria over the northern Cascades as the
upper-trough begins to leave the region, resulting in the removal of
the area from the previous forecast. Some elevated fire weather
conditions are also possible in portions of north-central Montana,
but the overlap of stronger surface winds and receptive fuels is
somewhat narrow. 

...Northern Great Plains...
Elevated fire-weather conditions are anticipated, particularly along
portions of western Montana and Wyoming, into eastern Nebraska and
the Dakotas. Strong southerly flow, coupled with hot, dry boundary
layer profiles, are expected to persist for much of the afternoon
and into the evening. However, current fuel guidance leaves some
uncertainty on where these conditions have significant overlap with
receptive fuels, particularly with eastward extent.

0758 AM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 241300Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHERN
ARIZONA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may produce damaging wind
gusts across southern Arizona, and from parts of Iowa and Illinois
into Pennsylvania/New York. Other locally strong storms are possible
in parts of the Northwest, northern Rockies and Mid-Atlantic
regions.

...Arizona...
A relatively active scenario for thunderstorms is expected later
today with the potential for thunderstorms/outflows to spread
generally south-southwestward onto the desert floor by evening. The
upper-level ridge over the western states will remain centered over
parts of Nevada/Utah today, with 15-20 kt of northeasterly mid-level
flow across central/eastern Arizona. This should help steer storms
onto the desert flow where a moist/deeply mixed boundary layer
environment will exist, with the potential for severe-caliber wind
gusts and considerable blowing dust late this afternoon into
evening.

...Midwest including Iowa/Illinois/Indiana...
The region will be influenced by the western cyclonically curved
portion of the upper-level trough over the Great Lakes/Ontario, with
a cold front moving southward across Iowa/Illinois and into
Indiana/Ohio, with very warm and humid conditions south of the
front. Some thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across eastern
Iowa and northern Illinois, but a greater coverage and intensity of
storms is expected later this afternoon near/south of the front.
Moderately strong west-northwesterly flow aloft, steep lapse rates,
and ample buoyancy suggest the potential for strong/isolated severe
storms capable of damaging winds and some hail.

...Northeast including Pennsylvania/New York....
As a front sags into western New York, modestly enhanced
southwesterly low-level winds will strengthen warm advection and
lift over the region. This will likely lead to scattered
thunderstorms through the afternoon. Forecast soundings show MLCAPE
values over 1000 J/kg and sufficient deep-layer shear for a few
organized storm clusters capable of locally gusty/damaging winds.

...North Carolina/Virginia...
Deep west-southwesterly winds will strengthen by this afternoon
along a corridor from the southern Appalachians into the
Mid-Atlantic states. This enhanced flow/shear profile will aid in
helping to organize scattered diurnal thunderstorm development from
western North Carolina into parts of southern/eastern Virginia.
Mid-level lapse rates will be poor, but strong heating and high PWAT
values will promote a risk of a few intense storm clusters capable
of gusty/damaging winds.

...Northwest...
Relatively fast cyclonic flow aloft will remain over the Pacific
Northwest states into the northern Great Basin. Mid-level moisture
will spread eastward and aid in afternoon thunderstorm development
from Oregon into parts of Idaho/Montana. Forecast soundings show
weak CAPE, but a few of the stronger cells could produce locally
gusty/damaging winds.

...Coastal Texas/southern Louisiana...
Aided by the possibility of weak surface low development, some
guidance suggests that a modest strengthening of low-level flow may
occur today. However, mid-level winds will remain weak, with inland
destabilization expected to be limited. This should minimize the
potential for anything beyond a few very weak/transient
mesocyclones.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0953 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The ongoing forecast remains on track. No changes were made. 

... Northern Rockies ...

Several hours of gusty winds will promote elevated-to-critical fire
weather conditions in and around the Cascade Gaps. A categorical
upgrade to Critical was contemplated with this forecast, but the
spatial extent of the area potentially achieving critical thresholds
is too small and the duration too short to attempt to highlight.
That said, the combination of wind, relative humidity, along with
the potential for new fire starts associated with isolated dry
thunderstorms, may result in an active fire weather day.

Elsewhere, no changes were made to the ongoing forecast.

..Marsh.. 07/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough over the Northwest will remain in place west of
a weakening upper ridge centered across the northern Rockies.
Stronger flow aloft will gradually overspread the Northwest and
northern Rockies through the week. Isolated dry thunderstorms and
gusty downslope winds will promote elevated fire-weather potential
today and tonight.

...Northwest and northern Rockies...
Lingering mid-level moisture ahead of the consolidating Pacific
trough will again support the risk for thunderstorms across the
Northwest and northern Rockies this afternoon and evening. While
weaker than previous days, subtle ascent and diurnal heating over
the terrain should allow for isolated storms to develop across parts
of the northern Great Basin and Northwest by early afternoon. Low
precipitation efficiency, owing to PWATs under 1 inch, and low
surface RH will support the risk for lightning with little to no
wetting rainfall. With area fuels still receptive to ignitions,
IsoDryT probabilities have been maintained.

West/southwest flow aloft is forecast to increase over the northern
Rockies and Cascade Gaps ahead of the trough. This may promote
several hours of gusty downslope winds across parts of eastern ID
and western MT. Model guidance shows surface winds of 15-25 mph
overlapping with RH values below 25%. This, along with the increase
in lightning and numerous ongoing fires, will support the potential
for elevated fire-weather conditions this afternoon.
