Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0731 AM CDT Tue Mar 12 2024

Valid 121300Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE WESTERN
OZARKS/EASTERN KANSAS REGION TO NORTHERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon and
evening from the western Ozarks/eastern Kansas region to northern
Missouri.

...Synopsis...
The period begins with a progressive, fairly low-amplitude mid/
upper-level pattern over most of the CONUS.  However, a trough now
over the West Coast vicinity will strengthen as it moves inland and
reaches ID, NV and the lower Colorado River Valley by 12Z tomorrow. 
This will spread a large field of height falls and generally
difluent mid/upper flow across the Great Basin, Intermountain West
and Rockies tonight, reaching the High Plains by the end of the
period.  A broad area of low-end, isolated thunderstorm potential
exists ahead of the trough in the West.

Ahead of these developments, a preceding shortwave trough --
apparent in moisture-channel imagery over eastern parts of WY/CO/NM
-- will move eastward over the central Plains today.  This
perturbation should reach southeasternmost NE, extreme eastern KS
and northeasternmost OK by 00Z, then cross the lower Ohio Valley
around 12Z.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a weak frontal-wave low over
west-central KS, south of the associated cyclonic circulation center
nearer the KS/NE border.  The cyclone center and pressure low should
consolidate better today as the frontal wave shifts eastward.  By
00Z, the surface low should reach northwestern MO, with trailing
trough/weak cold front to northwestern OK, the northern TX
Panhandle, and southeastern CO.  The low should drift eastward over
northern MO through tonight, as the trailing front/trough stall over
western OK and the eastern TX Panhandle, then begin shifting north
again in a regime of lee cyclogenesis preceding the main western
CONUS trough.  A dryline -- now analyzed over Coahuila and parts of
west TX from about MAF southward, should become better defined today
from west-central TX to northeastern OK and extreme eastern KS (near
the cold front) as moist advection continues across central TX,
eastern OK, and the western Ozark Plateau.

...Ozarks/eastern KS to western/northern MO...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms are possible over the
outlook area late this afternoon and/or this evening, with a
marginal large-hail and damaging-wind threat.  The western part of
the outlook area is intended more for any late-afternoon development
(conditional), with evening activity somewhat more certain over
eastern parts.

Moisture return will be quite immature across the region, but still
potentially sufficient for thunderstorm development, with surface
dewpoints generally reaching the mid 40s to low 50s F, east of the
dryline and south of the warm front.  Cooling aloft and steepening
of low/middle-level lapse rates will occur this afternoon as DCVA
increases and low-level warm advection continues ahead of the
favorably timed shortwave trough.  Boundary-layer theta-e advection
and diabatic surface heating should boost buoyancy and reduce MLCINH
throughout the afternoon, resulting in a narrow plume of about
800-1300 J/kg MLCAPE, atop a well-mixed boundary layer.  Daytime
initiation, should it occur, would be between the surface moist
axis, warm front, and dryline/cold front.

Though low-level shear is expected to be favorable for supercells,
midlevel winds (generally 400-700 mb) are expected to weaken with
northward extent, closer to where low-level forcing is strongest,
near the low and frontal triple point.  This will reduce effective-
shear magnitudes from around 40-50 kt in southern areas (Ozarks
vicinity) to less than 30 kt near and north of I-70.  Though
convection may persist longer in that corridor this evening due to
greater instability aloft, and support from the LLJ, its
increasingly elevated inflow layer, messier mode and lack of greater
moisture will temper severe potential.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CDT Tue Mar 12 2024

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO...WESTERN
TEXAS INTO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...PORTIONS OF WESTERN OKLAHOMA INTO
THE EASTERN OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE....

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced westerly mid-level flow will round the western US
longwave trough on Wednesday before overspreading the Rocky
Mountains and the central Plains. Lee cyclogenesis will occur across
the central high Plains, with a surface dryline extending from
central Kansas southward into western/central Texas. Elevated to
Critical fire weather conditions are expected behind the surface
dryline, where strong westerly flow is expected to overlap low
afternoon relative humidity.

Across southeastern New Mexico into western Texas and northward into
western Oklahoma, relative-humidity reductions to 10-20 percent will
overlap surface winds around 20-25 mph (locally as high as 30 mph).
Latest fuel guidance indicates fuels within this region remain
critically dry, which will support inclusion of a Critical risk.
Recent fire activity also supports the notion that fuels within this
area remain critically dry.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook RESENT 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1201 PM CDT Mon Mar 11 2024

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN WYOMING INTO FAR SOUTHWEST
SOUTH DAKOTA AND THE NORTHWEST NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...THE
TX/OK PANHANDLES...MUCH OF CENTRAL/WEST-CENTRAL KANSAS...AND EASTERN
NEBRASKA...

Expanded the Critical area into eastern Nebraska based on morning
high resolution guidance showing sustained winds up to 25 mph and
relative humidity in the teens. In addition, expanded the Elevated
area slightly farther east into Iowa and southwest Minnesota.

..Bentley.. 03/11/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CDT Mon Mar 11 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave will move into the Great Basin on Monday, with
westerly flow increasing across the Rockies and strengthening lee
troughing across the Plains. This will result in strong downslope
warming and drying across the central and south-central Plains. Two
regions of Critical fire weather conditions are expected, with more
widespread Elevated fire weather concerns across much of the central
High Plains into the southern High Plains.

...Eastern Wyoming into far southwest South Dakota and the northwest
Nebraska Panhandle...
Westerly downslope flow (sustained around 20-25 mph) across the high
terrain in eastern Wyoming and southwestern South Dakota will allow
to relative-humidity reductions around 15-20 percent (locally as low
as 10 percent). Rainfall deficits over the last month have led to
fine fuels sufficiently dry to support fire spread. As such, a
Critical delineation was maintained in this region.

...Far northeast New Mexico into the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles and
much of central/west-central Kansas...
Westerly downslope flow (sustained at 20-25 mph) across eastern New
Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles will result in
relative-humidity reductions to around 10-15 percent. Early spring
green up of fine fuels, which were subsequently cured by recent
freezing temperatures, has led to large fire activity in the last
month across these regions. A Critical delineation was maintained
across this region. 

Critical conditions will extend into portions of western and
west-central Kansas where afternoon relative-humidity reductions to
around 15-20 percent will overlap sustained winds around 15-20 mph).
Fuel guidance suggests that fine fuels in this region will are
sufficiently dry enough to support fire spread.
