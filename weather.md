Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0133 PM CST Tue Jan 14 2025

Valid 142000Z - 151200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with no changes required.
Thunderstorm potential remains very limited across the CONUS with
only a low chance of a lightning flash or two off the far southern
TX coast early Wednesday. See the previous discussion for additional
details.

..Moore.. 01/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1010 AM CST Tue Jan 14 2025/

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Expansive surface high pressure will continue to dominate much of
the CONUS through the period, with minimal thunderstorm potential.
Weak low-level warm/moist advection is forecast to occur tonight
across parts of deep south TX. While modest MUCAPE should eventually
develop over this region, limited large-scale ascent suggests
thunderstorm chances should remain low.

## SPC Jan 14, 2025 1930 UTC Day 3 Severe Thunderstorm Outlook

date: 2025-01-14, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day3otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day3otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 3 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 PM CST Tue Jan 14 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected on Thursday.

...Discussion...
An upper trough will shift steadily across the eastern half of the
U.S. Thursday, while the next feature -- an energetic short-wave
trough digging southeastward out of western Canada -- reaches the
northern Intermountain Region/northern Plains late.

As this feature advances, a deepening surface cyclone is forecast to
shift eastward across the Canadian Prairie Provinces, while a
trailing Arctic cold front progresses southward across the northern
Rockies/northern Plains Thursday night.  

Meanwhile, with cold/dry low-level air already in place across the
U.S., thunderstorms are not anticipated.
