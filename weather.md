Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1134 AM CDT Wed May 29 2024

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

No changes were made to the ongoing forecast.

Elevated meteorological fire conditions may extend farther north
(across eastern Utah, western Colorado, and south-central Wyoming)
from the delineated elevated area. Here, a dry airmass will combine
with modest winds (up to 15 mph) to promote elevated meteorological
fire conditions. However, ERC percentiles below 80 indicate that
fuels may be unreceptive to fire or rapid fire spread.

..Marsh.. 05/29/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0109 AM CDT Wed May 29 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid to upper-level trough is expected to traverse the
Intermountain West and Great Basin throughout today. West to
southwest surface winds around 15 to 20 mph will again develop
across portions of western NM, and near the Four Corners region, as
a lee surface trough slowly deepens during the afternoon. Low teens
to single-digit RH are anticipated within a deeply mixed air mass,
and will combine with these breezy conditions over increasingly
receptive fuels within the Elevated area. This area was extended
slightly northwestward to include portions of far
southern/southeastern UT, and far northern/northeastern AZ where ERC
percentiles are beginning to creep above 80.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CDT Wed May 29 2024

Valid 291630Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS AS WELL AS THE TRANS PECOS REGION
IN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong storms posing a risk for severe hail and wind still
appear likely across the northern and central High Plains late this
afternoon and evening. Isolated large hail will also remain possible
in southwest Texas.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the northern Rockies as an embedded
impulse overspreads the southern High Plains and a second mid-level
trough meanders over the Northeast today. Along the East Coast and
High Plains regions, surface lee troughing will result, that in
tandem with moisture advection, supports the potential for at least
scattered thunderstorm development through the afternoon and evening
hours. Over the High Plains, modest mid-level flow overspreading a
developing low-level jet (especially over the northern High Plains
during the evening hours) will provide enough vertical wind shear to
support strong to potentially severe thunderstorms.  

...Northern and Central High Plains...
Diurnal heating ahead of the surface lee trough will assist in
deepening/mixing the boundary layer by afternoon. MLCAPE should
reach 1500-2500 J/kg by afternoon peak heating as 8-9 C/km mid-level
lapse rates overspreads low to mid 50s F. As the mid-level trough
begins to overspread the region and convective temperatures are
reached, convective initiation should occur along the higher
terrain. Deep-layer shear will not be overly strong from the MT/ND
border southward, so mainly multicell clusters (perhaps outflow
dominant) are expected. Given the degree of buoyancy available, at
least a few severe gusts or instances of large hail are possible
with the initial storms. Locally stronger mid-level flow/deep-layer
shear will overspread eastern MT, where a deep boundary layer will
exist. Fast moving, high-based storms may quickly merge their cold
pools, promoting a relatively concentrated threat of strong wind
gusts (some of which may be severe). These storms should track
eastward and merge with the High Plains convection, supporting one
or more MCSs with a severe gust threat into the evening.

...Trans Pecos Region in Texas...
Though deep-layer ascent will be relatively weak, enough lift will
be provided by a subtle passing mid-level impulse, along with strong
diurnal heating and orographic lift over the Davis Mountains, to
support convective initiation ahead of the dryline. 2000+ J/kg
MLCAPE will become commonplace as a 8-9 C/km mid-level lapse rates
plume overspreads the Trans Pecos area, with over 35 kts of
effective bulk shear also likely given modestly curved, elongated
hodographs. Splitting supercells are expected to be the main mode of
convection, accompanied by primarily a large hail threat (some
instances of which may exceed 2 inches in diameter).  

...Southeastern Texas...
A remnant MCV continues to meander over eastern TX today, serving as
a source of lift for convective initiation this afternoon as
convective temperatures are reached. Surface dewpoints well over 70
F, overspread by 7 C/km mid-level lapse rates, will boost MLCAPE to
2500 J/kg. The presence of the MCV will also locally boost
deep-layer shear in the absence of other synoptic foci to support
elongated hodographs. Stronger multicells and perhaps a supercell
could pose an isolated severe hail/wind risk through afternoon.

...Portions of the Mid Atlantic...
Scattered thunderstorms (perhaps a few briefly becoming strong) will
be possible this afternoon as a 60+ kt 500 mb jet streak overspreads
the Mid Atlantic. Mid-level lapse rates should remain poor over the
region, with expected 250-500 J/kg of MLCAPE constrained to short
and thin profiles. When also considering modest deep-layer shear,
the severe threat should remain too sparse to support the
introduction of Category 1/Marginal risk probabilities. Nonetheless,
a strong wind gust capable of tree or powerline damage cannot be
completely ruled out.

...Far southern Florida Peninsula...
Surface temperatures exceeding 90 F by afternoon peak heating will
support convective initiation along sea-breeze boundaries,
particularly south and east of Lake Okeechobee. The relatively hot
temperatures will mix the boundary layer, and when considering poor
mid-level lapse rates, 1500-2000 J/kg of the expected MLCAPE should
be constrained to tall and thin profiles. Since deep-layer shear
should also be weak, the severe threat should remain too limited for
the introduction of severe probabilities. Nonetheless, a stronger
and longer lasting storm could produce a severe gust.

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0741 AM CDT Wed May 29 2024

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH LATE EVENING ACROSS THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS AND IN
SOUTHWEST TX...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong storms posing a risk for severe hail and wind
appear likely across the northern and central High Plains late this
afternoon and evening. Isolated large hail will also be possible in
southwest Texas.

...Northern/central High Plains this afternoon into tonight...
A midlevel shortwave trough over the northern Rockies will continue
eastward with associated lee troughing expected across the
northern/central High Plains through the afternoon/evening.  A
corridor of modest low-level moistening (boundary-layer dewpoints
potentially into the 50s) will occur along and east of the lee
trough, where afternoon surface temperatures will warm well into the
80s beneath steep midlevel lapse rates and result in SBCAPE of
1000-2000 J/kg with minimal convective inhibition.  Scattered
high-based thunderstorms are expected to form by mid afternoon near
the lee trough and spread eastward through late evening, with some
potential for storms to be maintained into tonight in association
with a strengthening low-level jet and warm advection.  Occasional
severe outflow gusts of 60-70 mph and isolated large hail of 1-1.5
inches in diameter will be the main threats with primarily multicell
clusters and possibly some weak supercell structures given
weak-modest deep-layer vertical shear (effective shear generally
25-30 kt). 

...Southern Plains today into tonight...
Widespread convective overturning has occurred across TX in the past
24 hours, with the remnants of a large MCS now weakening just off
the lower TX coast.  Lingering low-level moisture and steep lapse
rates across the Trans-Pecos (northwest of the MCS remnants) could
support isolated thunderstorm development this afternoon near the
Davis Mountains.  Here, MLCAPE in excess of 2000 J/kg and
sufficiently long hodographs will favor splitting supercells capable
of producing isolated large hail, potentially 2 inches in diameter
or larger.  

Otherwise, marginally severe storm development may occur near the
upper TX coast later today with a remnant MCV on the edge of the
richer low-level moisture.  The southern portion of the central High
Plains convection may persist through tonight and grow into a
loosely organized MCS from western KS southward into the TX
Panhandle and western OK, where the storms will encounter gradually
increasing low-level moisture in a warm advection regime.  A few
strong gusts and isolated/marginally severe hail may occur with the
strongest embedded storms. 

...Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic this afternoon...
A midlevel trough now over OH will progress eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic coast by early tonight.  Low-level moisture will be
relatively limited in advance of the midlevel trough and a weak
surface reflection, but surface heating and steepening of low-level
lapse rates will contribute to weak SBCAPE of 250-500 J/kg. 
Scattered, low-topped thunderstorms will be possible this afternoon
across PA/MD/VA and convection will spread to the coast this
evening.  The steep low-level lapse rates will promote gusty outflow
winds, but severe/damaging winds appear unlikely given marginal
buoyancy and weak low-level flow to limit momentum transfer.

Mesoscale Discussion 1038
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1013 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

Areas affected...northwest OK into adjacent southwest KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 281513Z - 281645Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated hail to around 1.75 inches diameter is possible
the next 1-2 hours across northwest Oklahoma into adjacent southwest
Kansas.

DISCUSSION...Elevated thunderstorms have developed this morning in
an area of low-level east/southeasterly flow beneath upper northwest
flow. Very steep midlevel lapse rates are supporting modest
instability. VWP data from KVNX shows elongated hodographs above 2-3
km amid deeper shear supporting transient supercells. This activity
will be capable of producing severe hail to near 1.75 inches over
the next 1-2 hours. With southward extent, overnight convection and
outflow has modified the airmass into parts of southwest and central
OK. The expectation is that this cluster of storms should gradually
decrease in intensity with southeast extent over the next couple of
hours. Trends will be monitored but watch issuance is not currently
expected.

0900 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

Areas affected...northeast Texas into western Louisiana

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 341...

Valid 281400Z - 281530Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 341
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong gusts of 45-65 mph remain possible with
east/southeast propagating bow over northeast Texas.

DISCUSSION...An organized and strong bow continues to shift
east/southeast across northeast TX along an instability gradient.
Recent radar data shows an outflow boundary associated with an area
of convection to the northeast of the bow surging southeast and
intersecting the bow near its apex. This may have a deleterious
impact on the organization of the bow over the next hour. The
strongest measured gust noted in the past 30-60 minutes was a 47 kt
gust at KTYR. Strong to severe gusts of 45 to 65 mph and isolated
hail remain possible in the near term. Trends will be monitored for
possible downstream watch issuance into parts of western/central LA.
