Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0800 AM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 241200Z - 291200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A mid-level trough will cross the central and eastern CONUS on
D4/Thursday and D5/Friday with a surface front advancing east
through the period. Moisture will remain limited ahead of this front
and thus, severe weather is not expected. In the wake of this front,
high pressure will build into the Midwest on D6/Saturday and move
into the Mid-Atlantic by D7/Sunday. This will result in tranquil
weather through the weekend. Extended range guidance does suggest
the potential for some return moisture flow by early next week, but
there is considerable uncertainty in the upper-level pattern and any
potential severe weather threat would likely be after Monday/D8.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 211300Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FOR CENTRAL KS INTO SOUTH CENTRAL NE...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe thunderstorms with large hail are possible across parts
of central Kansas into south central Nebraska, mainly from mid
afternoon to early evening.

...Central Plains through this evening...
A midlevel low over CO this morning will continue to evolve into an
open wave while progressing eastward over KS/NE today to IA/MO
overnight.  Largely elevated convection is ongoing this morning in a
broken band from the TX Panhandle into western KS, in the zone of
ascent preceding the midlevel trough.  Isolated, marginally severe
hail and gusty outflow winds will be possible this morning with
these storms, given MUCAPE up to 1000 J/kg and midlevel lapse rates
near 7.5 C/km.  In the wake of the morning convection, a narrow
corridor of low-level moisture (boundary-layer dewpoints in the 50s)
and surface heating will precede the midlevel trough and an
associated lee surface trough from the eastern TX Panhandle into
western and central KS/NE.  

A few thunderstorms will be possible along/immediately east of the
lee trough by mid-late afternoon this afternoon as convective
inhibition diminishes with at least weak ascent.  Forecast profiles
suggest the potential for isolated supercells capable of producing
large hail (1-1.75 inches in diameter), isolated strong outflow
gusts of 50-60 mph, and potentially a tornado or two.  The severe
threat will peak late this afternoon before decreasing near/after
sunset as the low levels begin to stabilize and the zone of ascent
shifts east of the confined moist sector.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1240 AM CDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid to upper-level shortwave trough is expected to traverse the
Midwest throughout the day Tuesday. An associated cold front will
accompany it, with breezy northwesterly surface winds moving down
the northern and central Plains during the afternoon. A cooler
post-frontal air mass will keep RH above critical thresholds for
most locations. However, a narrow corridor of drier conditions/lower
RH from northwestern NE into portions of SD may exist where rain did
not fall from the previous day. Temporal confidence is not quite
high enough to introduce a small Elevated area for this region,
though subsequent forecasts may require it depending on the
progression of the front and Monday's rainfall footprint. Overall,
the fire weather threat should remain relatively low Tuesday.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND PARTS OF WEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Large hail, severe gusts and some tornado threat remain possible
across eastern New Mexico and portions of far West Texas this
evening.

...01z Update...

Strongest 500mb flow appears to be translating through the base of
the trough into western NM early this evening. This speed max will
advance into northern NM by the end of the period which will allow
the upper low to begin ejecting northeast toward the Four Corners.
Even so, negligible height changes will be noted across eastern
NM/West TX during the overnight hours. Scattered-numerous
thunderstorms have developed ahead of this upper feature with a
broken band of strong/severe convection currently extending from
near El Paso, northeast into Harding County NM, southwest of
Clayton. Several supercells have developed along this corridor which
are likely producing hail at/near severe levels, especially Chaves
County. 00z soundings from both AMA and MAF exhibited substantial
capping in the 700-750mb layer, though mid-level lapse rates are
steep. A bit west, uncapped profiles are noted at EPZ and ABQ with
strong deep-layer shear evident. Thunderstorms should continue to
develop along the leading edge of upper trough/influence where
inhibition is weak. Organized structures remain possible and large
hail is the primary risk, though gusts and perhaps a tornado or two
can not be ruled out this evening.
