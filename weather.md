## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 311200Z - 061200Z

Fire weather potential through the work week remains limited, though
regional concerns may emerge across southwest Texas by next weekend.
Latest long-range ensemble guidance continues to show reasonably
good agreement in the maintenance of an upper ridge over the
Intermountain West and Plains through the middle of the work week.
This pattern will favor dry conditions across the central U.S. while
southwesterly flow along the West Coast and a shortwave trough
across the OH River Valley/Southeast introduce precipitation chances
elsewhere. A persistent west/northwest flow regime is expected to
promote unseasonably warm temperatures across the Plains that may
result in some fuel drying through the week, though winds are
forecast to remain sufficiently light to preclude fire concerns.

Heading into the upcoming weekend, long-range guidance depicts a
subtropical jet extension nosing into northern Mexico/southern TX.
This should support lee troughing/cyclogenesis across the southern
High Plains with breezy westerly winds across southern NM into
southwest TX. Deterministic solutions have come into better
agreement regarding this scenario, and the probability for at least
elevated (to possibly critical) fire weather conditions across
southwest TX has increased in latest ensemble guidance. Fuels across
this region are currently not receptive, but may trend drier prior
to this weekend. Forecast and fuel trends will be monitored in
subsequent outlooks for an increasing fire weather threat.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0125 PM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 292000Z - 301200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20Z Update...
No changes needed to the previous outlook.

..Mosier.. 01/29/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0957 AM CST Mon Jan 29 2024/

...Synopsis/Discussion...
A mid/upper-level trough will continue eastward from the Eastern
Seaboard into the western Atlantic Ocean today, while an amplified
upper ridge persists over the West. On the backside of the eastern
CONUS trough, large-scale subsidence amid a cold/dry post-frontal
air mass will limit thunderstorm potential east of the Rockies.
Similarly, low theta-e air accompanying an expansive continental
polar surface high over the Intermountain West will preclude
thunderstorms west of the Rockies. 

While a robust shortwave trough with cold temperatures aloft will
track southeastward across the Midwest tonight, limited elevated
instability ahead of a related cold front and expected band of
low-topped convection should also limit lightning potential.

..Moore.. 01/29/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CST Mon Jan 29 2024/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will persist in the Rockies and across the
Plains on Tuesday. A weak cold front will move into the southern
High Plains early in the period. Similar to Monday, dry conditions
are possible in parts of the Southwest/southern High Plains. Again,
winds will be light and fuel receptiveness is still likely to be
poor. Fire weather concerns remain minimal across the CONUS.

## SPC Jan 29, 2024 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

date: 2024-01-29, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0629 AM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
The mid/upper-level pattern will remain unsuitable for deep moist
convection through the period over most of the CONUS.  A strong,
synoptic-scale trough -- now exiting the East Coast, has been
preceded by a surface cold front leaving a cool, stable boundary
layer behind it, east of the Rockies.  Meanwhile, a high-amplitude
ridge will shift slowly eastward across the Intermountain West,
Great Basin and northern Rockies.  

A northern-stream shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-channel
imagery over MB -- is forecast to dig southeastward to the Upper
Great Lakes and mid/upper parts of the Mississippi Valley overnight.
This feature will be preceded by a strengthening low-level cold
front and large-scale lift aloft.  An associated band of precip --
with embedded, weak, mainly midlevel convection -- should cross
parts of MI/Lake Michigan/IL overnight, reaching northern IN by 12Z.
While some forecast soundings indicate very weak elevated MUCAPE
(less than 100 J/kg) in roughly the 600-500-mb layer, any lighting
potential appears too uncertain and isolated for an unconditional,
10% general-thunder area.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected on Monday.

...Synopsis...

A dry, continental airmass will envelop much of the CONUS in the
wake of a cold frontal passage into the Gulf of Mexico and western
Atlantic. Stable conditions will prevail given a dearth of
boundary-layer moisture and thunderstorms are not expected.

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1027 AM CST Sun Jan 28 2024

Valid 281630Z - 291200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast today.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
A midlevel low currently centered over the Ohio Valley will track
eastward into the western Atlantic ocean as it devolves into an open
wave through the period. A related cold front extending
south-southwestward along the Gulf Stream into central Florida will
continue southeastward across southern Florida into this evening.
Along/immediately ahead of the southeastward-moving front, diurnal
heating of a moist boundary layer (lower 70s dewpoints) should
support isolated thunderstorm development across central/southern
Florida despite poor midlevel lapse rates and dry air aloft.
Organized severe thunderstorm potential appears low owing to veered
surface winds/weak frontal convergence, weak instability, and modest
deep-layer shear.

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (below) remains on track with no changes
needed. Morning observations and latest forecast guidance continue
to suggest low potential for fire weather concerns across the
country.

..Moore.. 01/28/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1115 PM CST Sat Jan 27 2024/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will build into the West and extend into the
High Plains region today. Surface high pressure will extend from the
Northwest into the southern Plains. With some downslope flow,
temperatures in the southern High Plains will warm. Given weak
winds, marginal RH, and poorly receptive fuels, fire weather
concerns are not expected within the region. Similarly, modest dry
offshore winds are anticipated in southern California. However, poor
fuels receptiveness will mitigate fire weather risk here as well.
