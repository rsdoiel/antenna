Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CST Fri Dec 27 2024

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS
OF EAST TEXAS...THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY INTO THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe storms, with large hail, damaging
winds, and strong tornadoes is possible Saturday into Saturday
night, from East Texas, across the Lower Mississippi Valley, into
parts of the Tennessee Valley.

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow is expected to rapidly amplify over the southern
CONUS Saturday, as several southern stream perturbations intensify
as they move near the Gulf Coast. A prominent shortwave trough,
initial located across the southern OH Valley, will quickly eject
northward as a second stronger shortwave approaches from the
southern Plains vicinity. A roughly east-west oriented warm front
will quickly move inland overnight Friday and into early Saturday in
response to increased mid-level height falls and a deepening surface
low near the Red River. This will allow for robust moisture return,
with upper 60s to low 70s F dewpoints likely across the lower MS
Valley by daybreak. While clouds and precipitation from inland
moisture advection may complicate destabilization to some degree,
sufficient buoyancy is expected to support numerous strong to severe
storms with all hazards possible from East TX and the lower MS
valley, into the TN valley from Saturday morning into early Sunday.

...East TX, Lower MS Valley...
As the mid-level flow pattern quickly amplifies Saturday, the
prominent shortwave trough and a subtle lead wave over the southern
plains should rapidly strengthen, taking on neutral to slightly
negative tilts by 00z Sunday. As this occurs, increasingly strong
diffluent flow aloft will overspread East Texas toward the ArkLaMiss
vicinity, where middle 60s F surface dewpoints will become more
common. Steepening low/mid-level lapse rates and diurnal heating
should allow for moderate destabilization, despite some lingering
clouds and isolated elevated storms.

Deeper convection is expected to develop early in the period
(11-14z) as ascent from the embedded perturbation and main trough
move over a pre-frontal confluence axis across East TX/Western LA. A
second round of robust convection may also develop across eastern TX
later in the afternoon as a Pacific front associated with the
surface low over North TX impinges on the warm sector from the west.
A mix of semi-discrete supercells and linearly organized bowing
segments are expected with sufficient buoyancy/deep-layer shear
overlap for storm organization. An initial risk for large hail,
especially where low-level flow is somewhat veered, should
transition to a risk for damaging winds and tornadoes as 0-1 km SRH
increases to 150-300 m2/s2 into mid/late Saturday afternoon with a
35+ kt 850 mb low-level jet.

Convection should quickly spread northeast into the lower MS Valley,
peaking in intensity through the afternoon and early evening hours.
Coincident with an increase in the low-level jet to 45-65 kt and
intensifying surface pressure falls, low-level hodographs will
expand with 0-1 km SRH of 300-400 m2/s2 likely. This will support
the potential for strong tornadoes with any established
suppercellular elements.

...Tennessee Valley and Cumberland Plateau...
As the upper trough continues to amplify through the day, the warm
front will gradually lift north into the southern TN valley by early
afternoon. A broad area of cloud cover and perhaps light stratiform
precipitation is expected in the presence of strong isentropic
ascent along the advancing warm front. This remains the primary
uncertainty regarding the northern/eastern extent of the
surface-based severe risk later Saturday afternoon into Saturday
night. While buoyancy/destabilization may be muted, the intensifying
upper trough and surface low will favor very strong low and
mid-level wind fields supportive of storm organization into Saturday
evening and early Sunday. With very large low-level hodographs (0-1
km SRH 300-500 m2/s2) weakly buoyant near-surface based parcels will
still allow for some tornado and or damaging wind risk into the
overnight hours, especially with any established supercell or bowing
structures across parts of AL, TN and western GA.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1052 AM CST Fri Dec 27 2024

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast is on track. Some gusty winds are possible across parts
of the southern High Plains this afternoon along with low RH.
However, above average fuel moisture in the region should preclude a
significant fire threat. See the previous discussion for further
details.

..Supinie.. 12/27/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1231 AM CST Fri Dec 27 2024/

...Synopsis...
Enhanced westerly flow across the central/southern Rockies will lead
to a dry/warm downslope flow regime across the southern High Plains
this afternoon. Relative-humidity reductions to 15-25 percent will
overlap with sustained winds around 10-15 mph (gusting 20-30,
locally higher across the higher elevations). Latest guidance
suggests fuels in this region will largely not be receptive to fire
spread, precluding the need to include any areas at this time.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING FROM SOUTHEAST LA/MS INTO SOUTHWEST AL AND THE WESTERN
FL PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong to locally severe thunderstorms could occur today
across parts of the central Gulf Coast States.

...Central Gulf Coast Region...
A compact negative-tilted shortwave trough that has provided
occasionally strong thunderstorms to parts of southern MS/southeast
LA is tracking away from the Gulf Coast region.  Low-level winds are
slowly veering/decreasing with time, suggesting the threat of
supercell structures and associated severe threat is marginal
through mid-afternoon.  

Another strong upper trough that is now over north TX will graze the
same area late this afternoon, possibly resulting in a
re-invigoration of convection across southeast MS and southwest AL. 
The air mass has been slow to recover, with mid 60s dewpoints
restricted to areas just a few rows of counties inland.  Widespread
clouds will also limit destabilization.  Locally gusty winds or a
brief tornado will remain possible with this renewed early evening
activity, but the overall threat appears marginal.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL GULF COAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong to locally severe thunderstorms could occur today
across parts of the central Gulf Coast States.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a broad area of cyclonic flow will persist
around mean troughing, from the Great Basin and Rockies across the
Great Plains to the Mississippi Valley.  The leading shortwave
trough -- in a series of them to influence convective potential
through early next week -- is apparent in moisture-channel imagery
over the MO Bootheel southward over portions of the Mid-South
region.  This feature will weaken considerably as it ejects
northeastward to OH by 00Z, in response to an upstream trough
initially over the southern/central Plains to Black Hills and
western Dakotas.  That higher-amplitude perturbation will reach the
eastern Dakotas, lower Missouri Valley and Ozarks by 00Z, then eject
northeastward to the Upper Great Lakes by the end of the period.  A
third shortwave trough -- currently moving inland from the Pacific
Northwest Coast -- should dig southeastward rapidly across the Great
Basin, reaching the southern High Plains and Permian Basin regions
by 12Z tomorrow.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a low over the western Ozarks
between SGF-HRO, with occluded front arching across the Mid-South to
west-central MS, warm front over south-central MS to near MOB then
southeastward across the FL Keys.  A slow-moving cold to
quasistationary front was drawn from west-central MS across the
southwestern LA coastline and TX shelf waters to a weak low over
Padre Island.  The low should move north-northeastward to northern
WI by 12Z tomorrow, with frontolysis occurring to its south near the
Mississippi Valley.  Cyclogenesis will occur overnight over
northwest TX in advance of the third mid/upper-level shortwave
trough.

...Portions of central Gulf Coast region...
Multiple rounds of convection are expected through this evening,
with the best-organized cells offering locally strong-severe gusts
and a marginal tornado risk.  This includes a couple bands of
ongoing convection -- along a dominant western convergence zone just
ahead of the cold front, from eastern to southwestern MS and coastal
south-central LA, and another near I-59 in southern MS.  The 12Z LIX
sounding sampled the coastal airmass between these well, with MLCAPE
around 1400 J kg, effective SRH around 270 J/kg, modest winds
between 250-500 mb, and effective-shear magnitude near 30 kt.  With
the leading trough ejecting away from the area and weakening fast,
and the next remaining stronger but passing abeam of the outlook
area to the north, net height changes through most of the period
should be near neutral, with some rises possible in the near term
(indicating the ongoing activity is unlikely to get substantially
better organized than at present).  

However, a progressive lobe of midlevel vorticity -- extending
southeastward from the second trough -- will foster large-scale
DCVA/lift late this afternoon into evening over portions of MS and
northern/western AL before the lobe ejects away and dissipates. 
This will be well-timed with peak afternoon warming, to steepen
low-middle-level lapse rates and weaken MLCINH, contributing to
potential regeneration/strengthening of the western convective/
convergence band.  That process, with 60s F warm-sector surface
dewpoints between the cold and warm fronts, should contribute to
1000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE.  Deep shear and low-level hodographs should
favor at least isolated supercells, with 35-45-kt effective-shear
magnitudes and 200-300 J/kg effective SRH (maximized near the warm
front).  However, by mid/late afternoon, deep ascent and shear will
have peaked over most of the area.  With increasing displacement
between the stronger flow/forcing aloft related to the second
trough, and the favorable boundary-layer airmass, already marginal
severe potential should diminish overnight.

## SPC Dec 26, 2024 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0410 AM CST Thu Dec 26 2024

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
At least some severe-weather risk is expected on Sunday/Day 4 across
the Southeast States as an upper trough shifts east-northeastward
from the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys toward the Appalachians. Very strong
deep-layer winds will overspread the region, but guidance
variability exists regarding the availability and
north-northeastward extent of minimal buoyancy, especially with
GFS/ECMWF-related guidance depicting the possibility of considerable
scattered convection ongoing Sunday morning. Regional areas
including northern Florida into southern/eastern Georgia and parts
of the Carolinas will continue to be reevaluated in subsequent
outlooks as far as Sunday's severe potential, but at least
some/low-end severe risk seems probable even with these instability
uncertainties.

Thereafter, severe-weather potential early next week is currently
expected to remain low.

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad/strong west-northwesterly midlevel flow across the
central/southern Rockies will maintain lee troughing along the
adjacent High Plains. As a result, breezy downslope flow with modest
RH reductions will develop across the southern High Plains during
the afternoon. However, marginal RH and fuels should limit
fire-weather concerns.
