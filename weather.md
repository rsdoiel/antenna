Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0745 AM CDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Valid 191300Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FOR PARTS OF CENTRAL/NORTHERN ILLINOIS AND WEST
CENTRAL INDIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon/evening
from central/northern Illinois to western Indiana.  A few tornadoes,
large hail, and damaging wind gusts will be possible.

...IL/IN this afternoon into early tonight...
A deep (989 mb) cyclone near the northeast KS/northwest MO border
will move northeastward to northern IL by this evening and Lower MI
overnight, in conjunction with a deep midlevel trough and 100+ kt
midlevel jet streak.  Elevated convection is ongoing this morning in
a zone of focused ascent with warm advection/frontogenesis across
IA, where isolated large hail may occur with MUCAPE around 500 J/kg
and steep midlevel lapse rates/cool midlevel temperatures.  The warm
sector of the cyclone is characterized by a narrow/modest corridor
of returning moisture (low-mid 50s boundary-layer dewpoints) that
will overspread MO/IL through the afternoon.  Surface heating in
cloud breaks, continued moisture advection and relatively cool
midlevel temperatures will all contribute to warm sector
destabilization (MLCAPE 500-750 J/kg) through the afternoon across
IL.

Surface-based thunderstorm development will become probable by
early-mid afternoon in a broken band along and just ahead of a
remnant dryline moving from MO into IL, and storms will subsequently
move eastward/northeastward into IN by early tonight before
weakening gradually.  The deeper buoyancy profiles will be on the
cyclonic side of the midlevel jet, where 500 mb temperatures will be
< -20 C. Forecast wind profiles suggest supercell potential with
long hodographs (effective bulk shear vectors >50 kt), and
sufficient low-level hodograph curvature/shear for tornado
potential.  The primary uncertainty centers of the degree of
low-level moistening/destabilization, and the current forecast
represents a conditional/reasonable worst case scenario.  Otherwise,
occasional large hail (1-1.5 inches in diameter) will be possible in
IL this afternoon/evening, and the threat for damaging gusts (60-70
mph) and a couple of tornadoes will persist into IN through early
tonight.

...TN/MS/AL this afternoon/evening...
Boundary-layer dewpoints will slowly increase to the upper 50s/lower
60s ahead of the surface wind shift moving across AR/LA this
afternoon.  Forcing for ascent should be sufficient to remove the
cap, allowing some deep convection in a broken band this
afternoon/evening.  Buoyancy will be relatively weak compared to the
vertical shear, so it will be difficult to get sustained severe
storms and isolated wind damage will be the most probable threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0241
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0554 AM CDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central KS into central/eastern
NE...northwest IA...and extreme southeast SD/south-central MN

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 191054Z - 191600Z

SUMMARY...Blizzard conditions will gradually spread eastward through
the morning. Snow rates of 1-2+ inches per hour are possible, along
with widespread 50-60+ mph gusts.

DISCUSSION...Blizzard conditions are ongoing this morning from
southwest/south-central NE into western KS, to the northwest of a
powerful 987 mb cyclone centered over northeast KS. Very strong
deep-layer ascent will continue to  support heavy precipitation
rates through the morning, aided by very favorable low/midlevel
frontogenesis, and the presence of elevated buoyancy and
regenerative convection along the eastern periphery of heavier
precipitation, near the midlevel dry slot. The heaviest
precipitation rates will gradually shift eastward through the
morning, in conjunction with the movement of the cyclone, while
low-level cold advection and strong ascent result in cooling of the
column and a changeover to snow in areas that are currently in the
mid/upper 30s F. 

Meanwhile, very strong low-level flow increasing to near/above 70 kt
at 1 km AGL (as noted on the KUEX VWP) will continue to support wind
gusts in the 50-70 mph range (as already noted through the night
across parts of KS/NE), resulting in widespread blowing snow and
blizzard conditions. 

Short-term guidance generally suggests that the heaviest snow rates
will become focused from central/northern KS into northeast
NE/northwest IA later this morning. Areas within the most intense
snow bands may experience rates of 1-2+ inches per hour, along with
wind gusts near/above 60 mph, near-zero visibility, and occasional
lightning. A rather sharp gradient in snow rates is expected along
the eastern periphery of the heavier precipitation, though the very
strong wind gusts may result in blizzard conditions even in areas
that experience only light to moderate snow.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 AM CDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Valid 221200Z - 271200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Saturday/Day 4 to Sunday/Day 5...
A mid-level trough will move through the central U.S. on Saturday
and Sunday, as moisture advection takes place across the southern
Plains, lower Mississippi Valley and Ark-La-Tex. Thunderstorm
development will likely take place ahead of the trough on Sunday
afternoon and evening, along the northern edge of the moist airmass
from the Red River Valley eastward into the lower Mississippi
Valley. A threat for large hail and severe wind gusts will be
possible within the more organized components of a developing MCS.
The MCS is forecast to move southeastward through the lower
Mississippi valley during the overnight period.

...Monday/Day 6 to Wednesday/Day 8...
On Monday, the trough is forecast to become amplified across the
Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, as a cold front moves southward through
the Gulf Coast states. Isolated severe storms could occur near the
central Gulf Coast early in the day, but the majority of the storms
are expected to move offshore into the Gulf. On Tuesday and
Wednesday, surface high pressure is forecast to settle over the
eastern half of the nation. This dry and cool airmass will make
conditions unfavorable for thunderstorms over most of the
continental U.S.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 AM CDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions are expected again on
Thursday for parts of the southern High Plains. Surface high
pressure is expected to build into the south-central CONUS through
the day Thursday in the wake of the strong surface low currently
over the Plains and its attendant cold front. Meanwhile aloft, a
relatively low-amplitude upper wave will begin impinging on the
northern Rockies, resulting in modest lee troughing from the
northern to central High Plains. West/southwesterly downslope winds
are expected to develop to the west of the lee trough, resulting in
dry/windy conditions from eastern MT and WY southward into NM and
southwest TX. Downslope warming/drying will support RH values in the
teens across much of the High Plains with the lowest RH (5-15%)
expected across eastern NM given antecedent dry conditions.
Sustained winds of 15-25 mph appear likely across northeastern NM
where fuels remain dry and limited precipitation is expected over
the next 48 hours. Weaker winds with southward extent will limit the
potential for critical conditions, but winds in the between 15-20
mph will still support areas of elevated fire weather conditions.
Further north into the central High Plains, elevated to critical
meteorological conditions are likely, but ongoing rain/snow will
likely mitigate fuel dryness for the next few days.

Mesoscale Discussion 0222
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Areas affected...North Florida and southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161128Z - 161300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A broken band of storms will spread eastward into
southeast Georgia and north Florida through late morning.  A new
tornado watch appears likely.

DISCUSSION...A broken band of storms has persisted overnight from
south central GA into the eastern FL Panhandle, with
occasional/embedded supercell structures.  Low-level moistening over
the next few hours and the onset of diurnal heating will drive
destabilization across north FL/southeast GA later this morning. 
Though the low-level jet core will develop northeastward toward the
Carolinas through the day, low-level flow/shear will remain
sufficiently strong to support additional supercells through the
morning across north FL/southeast GA.  The storms will remain
capable of producing occasional damaging winds and possibly a couple
of tornadoes, and a new tornado watch will likely be needed from
12-13z.
