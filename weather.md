Mesoscale Discussion 1079
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1257 PM CDT Thu May 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of extreme northeast New Mexico into the
Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles...far southeast Colorado...and far
southwestern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301757Z - 302030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat is increasing over portions of the
southern High Plains. Severe wind and hail are the main threats,
with some instances of hail exceeding 2 inches in diameter and gusts
exceeding 65 kts possible. A tornado or two cannot be ruled out. A
WW issuance may be needed within the next few hours pending
favorable convective trends.

DISCUSSION...Adequate insolation across the southern High Plains
continues to modify a post-convective airmss, with CU and attempts
at convective initiation noted from Union County, NM to Oldham
County, TX. 17Z mesoanalysis indicates that appreciable MLCINH
remains across the warm sector. However, continued diurnal heating
amid clearing skies should erode remaining CINH and support greater
storm development and coverage as the afternoon progresses.
Thunderstorm development is most likely along baroclinic boundaries
currently positioned along the NM/CO/KS border areas, and over the
western TX Panhandle. 

By mid afternoon, surface temperatures should warm into the 80s F in
most locations as 8+ C/km mid-level lapse rates overspreads the
southern High Plains, boosting MLCAPE to over 3000 J/kg. RAP
forecast soundings depict hodographs with modest low-level
elongation and some curvature, but short segments in the mid to
upper-levels, limiting effective bulk shear values to around 30-35
kts. As such, multicells and transient supercells are the expected
mode of convection. Given ample buoyancy and at least modest
deep-layer shear, severe wind and hail still appear likely with the
more organized, longer-lasting thunderstorms. If a more robust
supercell structure could be realized, 2+ inch diameter hail could
occur. With forecast soundings showing the boundary layer becoming
potentially well-mixed to almost 700 mb, a 65+ kt gust cannot be
ruled out. Finally, ample low-level vertical vorticity is present in
far southeastern Colorado in the presence of a weak surface low. If
a thunderstorm can traverse this environment without becoming
quickly outflow dominant, a landspout or hybrid supercell tornado is
possible.

A WW issuance may be needed in the next few hours if greater
thunderstorm coverage become apparent.

Mesoscale Discussion 1078
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1250 PM CDT Thu May 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of western and central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 301750Z - 301945Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms organizing into a line or bow are expected
to develop and shift south/southeast through early evening. Damaging
gusts and large hail will be possible with this activity.

DISCUSSION...Convection is developing along an outflow boundary
stretching across the Texas South Plains into north-central Texas.
This boundary is being reinforced and shunted southward from ongoing
convection over northwest Texas. Low-level flow ahead of the outflow
is not overly strong at only about 10 kt from the south/southeast.
As a result, the outflow may continue to shift south through the
afternoon. This is resulting in some uncertainty, as outflow may
outpace developing convection along the boundary. CAMs guidance
differs in the evolution of the boundary and convection tied to it.
Nevertheless, a moist and very unstable airmass is in place
downstream. Vertical shear will also increase modestly through the
afternoon. As a result, severe thunderstorm potential from a
developing bowing line of storms is present. Severe gusts to 80 mph
and isolated large hail will be possible should a well-organized,
southward-propagating band of storms develop. Trends will be
monitored and a watch will likely be needed this afternoon, though
timing is a bit uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1077
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1224 PM CDT Thu May 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of north/east TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301724Z - 301930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will increase in coverage/intensity through
the afternoon. Strong gusts to 50-65 mph are possible, along with
isolated large hail.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are beginning to develop early this
afternoon across north into northeast TX to the south and and east
of an outflow boundary and ongoing line of storms near the Red
River. This activity is developing in a very moist airmass (low to
mid 70s F dewpoints). Strong heating into the 80s and midlevel lapse
rates near 7-7.5 C/km are contributing to strong instability
(2000-3000 J/kg). This will support robust updrafts, however,
vertical shear is expected to be somewhat modest with eastward
extent across northeast TX. As a result, stronger updrafts may be
transient and overall storm organization more messy. Nevertheless,
isolated gusts in the 50-65 mph range appear possible, along with a
few instances of large hail. If thunderstorm clusters can organize
via consolidating outflow/cold pool generation, a line of storms may
develop and shift east/southeast. If this occurs, damaging wind
potential will increase. However, this scenario remains uncertain.
Trends are being monitored for possible watch issuance within the
next couple of hours.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1239 PM CDT Thu May 30 2024

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
CENTRAL/SOUTHEAST TEXAS INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND ACROSS
THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
One or two organized clusters of storms may evolve by Friday morning
into afternoon and pose a risk for severe wind and hail continuing
across parts of the southern Great Plains into lower Mississippi
Valley, Texas Gulf coast and Deep South Texas by Friday evening.
Additional storms are expected across the central High Plains with a
threat for large hail and severe wind gusts. Finally, storms are
possible across the Mid-Mississippi Valley with the potential for a
tornado or two.

...Synopsis...
On Friday, a positively tilted mid-level trough will exit the
Northeast US with a ridge building in its wake. Meanwhile, a broad
mid-level trough will be present across the central CONUS with a
convectively enhanced mid-level trough developing and slowly moving
across Oklahoma and into Arkansas. A weak surface low/MCV may be
present with this feature as it moves east through the afternoon and
could provide a focus for a localized threat for a tornado or two.

...Central Texas to the western Gulf Coast...
Considerable uncertainty remains with the presence and evolution of
morning convection across Texas. There seems to be some consistency
synoptically and with most CAM guidance for elevated convection to
develop around 12Z in the Lubbock to Abilene vicinity. However,
there is considerable uncertainty how this convection develops from
here. A MCS from Thursday evening/overnight thunderstorms is
expected to expand through the overnight period and perhaps maintain
intensity to the Gulf Coast. Wherever the composite outflow boundary
stalls from this convection, likely from the Edwards Plateau
northwest to near San Angelo will likely be very unstable and
strongly sheared with supercells capable of primarily large hail and
severe wind gusts. The greater question will be how much recovery
can occur north of this outflow boundary in the wake of morning
convection. Therefore, the severe threat across central into
southeast Texas is more conditional and may need modified once Day 1
convective evolution becomes more clear.

...Mid-Mississippi Valley...
A MCV/surface low will traverse slowly across Oklahoma and Arkansas
through the day on Thursday into a moist airmass. Forecast models
which seem to correctly resolve this MCV show shear which would be
favorable for mini supercells and low-level hodographs that could
support a tornado or two Thursday afternoon/evening, particularly
where some heating can occur.

...Central High Plains...
Weak upslope flow and terrain circulations will support thunderstorm
development across the Front Range by early afternoon. These storms
will eventually move into an increasingly unstable airmass across
the Plains with 1000 to 1500 J/kg MLCAPE and around 40 knots
effective shear and mid-to-upper level backing flow. This will
support splitting supercells with a threat for both large hail and
damaging wind gusts. The chaotic storm motion of both the left and
right moving storms should lead to relatively quick upscale growth
into one or more clusters with an increasing severe wind threat as
storms move east.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Thu May 30 2024

Valid 301630Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF WEST/CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms with large hail up to baseball size,
damaging winds of 60-75 mph, and a couple of tornadoes are expected
this afternoon into tonight across west/central Texas. Other
isolated severe storms are possible today across east Texas, as well
as the central Plains to Upper Midwest.

...Southern Plains...
Multi-faceted mesoscale scenario exists across north Texas/southern
Oklahoma this morning with a southeastward-moving small-scale bowing
complex across western North Texas, with a history of isolated
severe-caliber wind gusts early this morning. This is focused along
outflow that extends west/northwest to east/southeast across the
region, and is in the southwestern wake of an MCV across
south-central Oklahoma at late morning. After a potential lull,
storms may grow upscale and further intensify this afternoon across
the Low Rolling Plains/Big Country of northern Texas, with related
damaging wind and hail potential. This could include occasional
severe outflow winds of 60-70 mph and isolated large hail of 1-1.75
inches in diameter.

Related convective outflow otherwise continues to spread
southwestward in the wake of these morning storms. Scattered severe
storm development is expected near the dryline across a broad
north-south extent of western Texas, including the Panhandle
southward to the Stockton Plateau/Rio Grande. However, the
aforementioned outflow, where it intercepts the dryline, will likely
be a focused for somewhat more intense/concentrated severe storm
development this afternoon/evening across the Texas South Plains and
Big Country.

Strong buoyancy (MLCAPE of 2500-3500 J/kg), steep mid-level lapse
rates, and effective bulk shear of 35-40 kt will support supercells
with initial storm development this afternoon, especially within the
aforementioned modifying outflow-focused corridor. The
southern-most/more discrete storms will have the greater potential
to produce very large hail near baseball size (2.75"), along with a
couple of tornadoes if storms can interact favorably with zone of
somewhat enhanced low-level moisture/shear along the residual
outflow boundary. Upscale growth of these storms into another MCS is
expected tonight, with occasional damaging winds and large hail
continuing well into the overnight hours as storms progress
generally southeastward into central/north Texas.

...Kansas/eastern Colorado/Nebraska...
Prior convective overturning and lingering convection this morning
in western/southern Kansas continues to cast uncertainties regarding
the extent and magnitude as far as the regional severe-weather risk
later today. Residual low-level moisture and surface heating in
cloud breaks later today should result in sufficient destabilization
for a few strong-severe storms with hail/wind, potentially within
multiple sub-regional corridors. Mostly multicellular storms are
expected as vertical shear through a deep layer will also be
relatively weak.

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally elevated winds and RH are possible on portions of the
Florida Peninsula today. Additionally, isolated to scattered
thunderstorms from south into central Florida could become a source
for ignition due to lightning away from the rain cores combined with
near record high KBDI and ERC values. Otherwise, the previous
forecast remains on track.

..Nauslar.. 05/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0100 AM CDT Thu May 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
A late afternoon onset of localized elevated fire weather conditions
will develop across portions of southern NM and west TX today. In
particular, sustained westerly wind speeds may briefly approach 20
mph just east of the Sacramento Mountains, and in/around the Davis
and Guadalupe Mountains. This is also where single-digit RH is again
expected. The areal extent of these conditions, however, is too
small to warrant an Elevated area.

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH LATE EVENING ACROSS THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS AND IN
SOUTHWEST TX...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong storms posing a risk for severe hail and wind
appear likely across the northern and central High Plains late this
afternoon and evening. Isolated large hail will also be possible in
southwest Texas.

...Northern/central High Plains this afternoon into tonight...
A midlevel shortwave trough over the northern Rockies will continue
eastward with associated lee troughing expected across the
northern/central High Plains through the afternoon/evening.  A
corridor of modest low-level moistening (boundary-layer dewpoints
potentially into the 50s) will occur along and east of the lee
trough, where afternoon surface temperatures will warm well into the
80s beneath steep midlevel lapse rates and result in SBCAPE of
1000-2000 J/kg with minimal convective inhibition.  Scattered
high-based thunderstorms are expected to form by mid afternoon near
the lee trough and spread eastward through late evening, with some
potential for storms to be maintained into tonight in association
with a strengthening low-level jet and warm advection.  Occasional
severe outflow gusts of 60-70 mph and isolated large hail of 1-1.5
inches in diameter will be the main threats with primarily multicell
clusters and possibly some weak supercell structures given
weak-modest deep-layer vertical shear (effective shear generally
25-30 kt). 

...Southern Plains today into tonight...
Widespread convective overturning has occurred across TX in the past
24 hours, with the remnants of a large MCS now weakening just off
the lower TX coast.  Lingering low-level moisture and steep lapse
rates across the Trans-Pecos (northwest of the MCS remnants) could
support isolated thunderstorm development this afternoon near the
Davis Mountains.  Here, MLCAPE in excess of 2000 J/kg and
sufficiently long hodographs will favor splitting supercells capable
of producing isolated large hail, potentially 2 inches in diameter
or larger.  

Otherwise, marginally severe storm development may occur near the
upper TX coast later today with a remnant MCV on the edge of the
richer low-level moisture.  The southern portion of the central High
Plains convection may persist through tonight and grow into a
loosely organized MCS from western KS southward into the TX
Panhandle and western OK, where the storms will encounter gradually
increasing low-level moisture in a warm advection regime.  A few
strong gusts and isolated/marginally severe hail may occur with the
strongest embedded storms. 

...Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic this afternoon...
A midlevel trough now over OH will progress eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic coast by early tonight.  Low-level moisture will be
relatively limited in advance of the midlevel trough and a weak
surface reflection, but surface heating and steepening of low-level
lapse rates will contribute to weak SBCAPE of 250-500 J/kg. 
Scattered, low-topped thunderstorms will be possible this afternoon
across PA/MD/VA and convection will spread to the coast this
evening.  The steep low-level lapse rates will promote gusty outflow
winds, but severe/damaging winds appear unlikely given marginal
buoyancy and weak low-level flow to limit momentum transfer.

1013 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

Areas affected...northwest OK into adjacent southwest KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 281513Z - 281645Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated hail to around 1.75 inches diameter is possible
the next 1-2 hours across northwest Oklahoma into adjacent southwest
Kansas.

DISCUSSION...Elevated thunderstorms have developed this morning in
an area of low-level east/southeasterly flow beneath upper northwest
flow. Very steep midlevel lapse rates are supporting modest
instability. VWP data from KVNX shows elongated hodographs above 2-3
km amid deeper shear supporting transient supercells. This activity
will be capable of producing severe hail to near 1.75 inches over
the next 1-2 hours. With southward extent, overnight convection and
outflow has modified the airmass into parts of southwest and central
OK. The expectation is that this cluster of storms should gradually
decrease in intensity with southeast extent over the next couple of
hours. Trends will be monitored but watch issuance is not currently
expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1037
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0900 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

Areas affected...northeast Texas into western Louisiana

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 341...

Valid 281400Z - 281530Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 341
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong gusts of 45-65 mph remain possible with
east/southeast propagating bow over northeast Texas.

DISCUSSION...An organized and strong bow continues to shift
east/southeast across northeast TX along an instability gradient.
Recent radar data shows an outflow boundary associated with an area
of convection to the northeast of the bow surging southeast and
intersecting the bow near its apex. This may have a deleterious
impact on the organization of the bow over the next hour. The
strongest measured gust noted in the past 30-60 minutes was a 47 kt
gust at KTYR. Strong to severe gusts of 45 to 65 mph and isolated
hail remain possible in the near term. Trends will be monitored for
possible downstream watch issuance into parts of western/central LA.
