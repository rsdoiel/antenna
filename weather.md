Mesoscale Discussion 0680
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...southern Lower MI...eastern IN...western OH...far
northern KY

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 072033Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...As supercells spread quickly east-northeast from southern
Lower MI and northwest IN, an additional tornado watch/watches will
be needed prior to 22Z. This may also include a combined/separate
watch farther south in eastern IN/western OH ahead of supercells
intensifying over the Wabash Valley.

DISCUSSION...As mentioned in MCD 0679, an increasingly favorable
setup for supercells, a couple of which may be long-tracked, is
underway across northwest IN to the Wabash Valley. The northern
storms may being to outpace the rapid boundary-layer
warming/moistening that is occurring across northeast IN and
northwest OH into southern Lower MI. Nevertheless, the intense
mid-level jet will likely foster sustained supercells even as they
become slightly elevated towards southeast Lower MI. With backed
low-level flow and ample low-level shear (per IWX VWP data), the
tornado threat will remain prominent with any supercells along and
south of the surface warm front. A couple strong tornadoes are
possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0679
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...eastern IL...IN...and southwest Lower MI

Concerning...Tornado Watch 195...

Valid 071953Z - 072100Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 195 continues.

SUMMARY...Additional supercells are expected to develop and
intensify from the Lake Michigan vicinity southward towards the
Wabash Valley. Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible,
with the tornado threat increasing as supercells mature into
Indiana.

DISCUSSION...A pair of supercells have been sustained along the
IL/WI border and earlier across the south part of Chicagoland, both
of which should weaken as they progress across southern Lake
Michigan. Several additional updrafts are gradually maturing farther
south over eastern into southern IL and northwest IN. Richer
boundary-layer moisture and stronger low-level shear across the
Wabash Valley portion of the region, all render increasing concern
for one or two of these storms to become long-track supercells.
Within an environment characterized by STP around 3-4, potential
will exist for a strong tornado. A limiting factor though with
southern extent is the degree of mid-level warmth/dryness south of
the intense jet that is ejecting farther north across northern IL
into southern Lower MI. This also renders uncertainty with how far
south sustained supercell development will occur in the near-term
over the Lower OH Valley.

Mesoscale Discussion 0678
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...parts of central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071905Z - 072130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated storms may develop by late afternoon, with a
conditional threat of very large hail. A small Slight Risk is also
being added to the 20Z convective outlook.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows a stationary front from Dallas
southwestward toward Del Rio, with generally weak wind convergence.
Ample low-level moisture exists south and east of the boundary, with
70s F dewpoints and MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg. Convective
inhibition continues to decrease due to heating, as temperature rise
into the upper 80s to near 90 F. 

Visible imagery shows increasing CU fields west of the I-35 corridor
from Austin to San Antonio, particularly along the west edge of a
thicker but eroding cloud deck. 

Over the next few hours, isolated severe storms may form over this
small region. Relatively long and straight hodographs along with the
deepening moist boundary layer and very strong instability will
conditionally support very large hail. Splitting cells may occur as
well, with left movers also producing hail.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 PM EDT Tue May 7 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Northern Illinois
  Central and Northern Indiana
  Southwest Lower Michigan
  Southeast Wisconsin
  Lake Michigan

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 225 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify this afternoon into the early evening.  The
environment will continue to destabilize through the mid to late
afternoon across much of the Watch area.  The stronger storms will
likely become supercellular and pose a risk for large to very large
hail, severe gusts, and tornadoes.  A couple of the more intense
supercells may yield the potential for a strong tornado.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 100 statute miles
east and west of a line from 30 miles east northeast of Racine WI to
60 miles southwest of Bloomington IN. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO AND
THE TRANS-PECOS...

No changes are needed to the D2 Fire Weather Outlook. See previous
discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 05/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CDT Tue May 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
The upper trough will broaden and elongate across much of the CONUS
on Wednesday. Mid-level winds, though weakening some, will still
remain across the southern Rockies. The surface low will migrate
southward into parts of Central Texas and the Rio Grande Valley.
With time, some colder air will push southward into New Mexico.

...Southwest and Trans-Pecos...
Surface winds of 15-25 mph are expected again across the region.
Coverage of these winds will likely be less given the weaker
synoptic features. The area with the highest confidence for stronger
winds of sufficient duration will be across southern New Mexico into
the Trans-Pecos. Stronger winds also appear possible in northeast
New Mexico, but the duration of these winds is not certain. RH will
fall to 10-15% for most of the region. Elevated to critical fire
weather will occur for a few hours during the afternoon.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
INDIANA...WESTERN AND CENTRAL OHIO...AND NORTHERN KENTUCKY...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley through evening.  A few tornadoes (some
strong), large to very large hail, and severe/damaging winds all
appear possible.

...20z Update...

Most of the ongoing outlook remains on track and reasoning has not
changed from the previous forecast. See Tornado Watch 195 and any
forthcoming MCDs regarding short term severe potential across parts
of the Midwest. 

A small Slight risk (level 2 of 5) has been added over portions of
central TX. A few storms capable of large hail (2.5+ inches
diameter) appear possible through evening. Agitated cumulus in a
very moist/unstable environment amid modest low-level convergence
continue to deepen this afternoon. Forecast soundings depict a
favorable environment for isolated but possible significant hail.
While this risk is somewhat conditional/isolated, given the
possibility for 2.5+ inch hail an upgrade to 15% SIG hail
probabilities appears warranted. For more details, see MCD 678.

..Leitman.. 05/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1136 AM CDT Tue May 07 2024/

...Southern Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and vicinity...
Considerable uncertainty remains for this forecast due largely in
part to an ongoing broken squall line moving east across KY/IN/Lake
Michigan and the related influences for airmass destabilization in
its wake.  However, clearing skies in the MCS' wake will result in a
seemingly sufficient period of heating during the afternoon. 
Water-vapor imagery shows the deep-layer cyclone centered over the
northern Great Plains.  A mid-level speed max rotating through the
base of the larger-scale trough will move from the mid MS Valley
late this morning into the southern Great Lakes by early evening. 
Rapid strengthening of southwesterly 500-mb flow is forecast over
northern IL into the northern half of IN through the mid-late
afternoon.  As an effective warm frontal zone becomes draped across
the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley regions, curved low-level
hodographs beneath a lengthening of the mid and upper part of the
hodograph will support a supercell risk.  It seems most probable
based on morning model guidance that storms will initially develop
across central/northern IL and move northeast into northern IN. 
Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to eventually develop this
afternoon across parts of the OH Valley in association with
warm/moist-air advection---although considerable uncertainty remains
regarding this scenario.  The stronger storms (i.e., supercells)
will be potentially capable of a large to very large hail threat, in
addition to several tornadoes (perhaps a few which may be strong).  

...Arklatex to north-central and south-central TX...
Not much change in the forecast thinking across the Mid South
southwestward into parts of TX.  Isolated severe thunderstorms are
possible during mid/late afternoon.  Damaging gusts and large hail
would be the main concerns.  The threat over the area is conditional
-- more due to weak lift than thermodynamic considerations.  Surface
dewpoints commonly in the 70s F will underlie a deep troposphere and
enough middle-level lapse rates for MLCAPE in the 3500-4500 J/kg
range.  Weak low-level winds will constrain hodograph size and
boundary- layer shear.  However, enough mid/upper flow remains to
support around 45-55 kt effective-shear magnitudes, yielding a
conditional supercell environment.  In the absence of meaningful
large-scale support, and with shallower overall lift near the
front/dryline, convective coverage over this region is more in
question and likely isolated.  Additional convection may form
overnight in a warm-advection plume near and southeast of the front,
across parts of the Mid-South to Arklatex regions.  Marginal hail
and isolated damaging gusts would be the main concerns.

...Southeast KS late tonight...
A strengthening LLJ and associated warm-air advection will be
focused over the northeast OK/southeast KS region late tonight. 
Forecast soundings show large MUCAPE amidst strong deep-layer shear.
Large hail may accompany a stronger storm or two that manages to
develop/become sustained during the 08-12z period.

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
TEXAS INTO THE MID-SOUTH/MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND LOWER OHIO
VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered to numerous severe thunderstorms appear likely Wednesday
across parts of the southern Plains into the mid Mississippi, Ohio,
and Tennessee Valleys. All severe hazards, including tornadoes, very
large hail, and severe/damaging winds should occur. Some of the
tornadoes may be strong.

...Synopsis...

An upper low/trough, initially over the northern Plains Wednesday
morning, will develop east to the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes vicinity
by Thursday morning. Meanwhile, a more compact upper shortwave
trough over the Lower Great Lakes will shift east/northeast over the
Northeastern U.S. This regime will maintain a broad swath of 50-70
kt southwesterly midlevel/upper flow from the central/southern
Plains to the Midwest/Mid-South and Northeast. This broad area of
enhanced flow aloft will contribute to a strongly sheared
environment atop a very moist boundary-layer. While the upper
low/trough will progress east through the period, overall height
falls across the Midwest/OH-TN Valleys are expected to remain modest
until overnight. Large-scale ascent will be somewhat modest/nebulous
through the day, with mesoscale features/ascent perhaps more of a
driver of storm development/evolution.

At the surface, the general expectation is that a surface low over
MO early in the period will develop east across the Ohio Valley
vicinity. A warm front will extend east from the low across
IL/IN/OH, but there is quite a bit of variability in forecast
guidance regarding how far north this boundary will retreat during
the day. A cold front/dryline also is forecast to extend southwest
from the low across western MO/eastern OK/central TX during the
afternoon. The cold front will surge east/southeast overnight across
the Ozarks/Mid-South. These boundaries will collectively focus
thunderstorm development through the period.

...ArkLaTex into the Mid-MS/OH/TN Valleys...

A very moist and broad warm sector is anticipated, with surface
dewpoints in the upper 60s to mid 70s F already in place across much
of the region. Heating into the 80s F and a plume of steep midlevel
lapse rates overspreading the region will aid in strong
destabilization (MLCAPE 2500-4000 J/kg). With 40-50 kt effective
shear magnitudes, organized convection is expected. Convective mode
may be somewhat messy, with clusters/semi-discrete supercells and
bowing line segments possible. Little inhibition is expected across
the warm sector, so thunderstorm coverage could be quite widespread.

Initial thunderstorms development is likely during the morning near
the triple point in MO. Most guidance suggests this activity will
quickly grow upscale into an eastward advancing line/bow across MO.
More semi-discrete convection is then anticipated by midday/early
afternoon in the vicinity of the warm front across southern
IL/western KY, spreading eastward with time across IN/KY/southern OH
and TN. Additional storms are expected by mid to late afternoon
along the cold front across AR/southeast OK/northeast TX. Large to
very large hail (2-3 inch diameter) will be possible with more
cellular convection given very large instability, steep midlevel
lapse rates and favorable vertical shear. Tornado potential is also
apparent, given favorable low-level shear as is evident in enlarged,
curved 0-3 km forecast hodographs. Mesovortex tornado potential also
will accompany any bows/QLCS structures as well. Furthermore,
potentially widespread damaging/severe winds appears possible,
especially if strong enough cold pools can be generated within
linear segments. 

Given little inhibition across the region and somewhat nebulous
large-scale forcing, convective evolution is somewhat uncertain
(widespread convection all at once vs. semi-discrete convection
growing upscale with time, etc). A corridor of higher probability
severe may develop from southeast MO/southern IL into western KY.
However, confidence is too low at this time for a categorical
upgrade.

...Iowa and Vicinity...

Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms appear possible in
associated with a cold-core upper low across parts of IA and
vicinity, mainly Wednesday afternoon. Although forecast instability
and deep-layer shear appear fairly weak/marginal, a few instances of
hail and strong/gusty winds appear possible. A brief tornado or two
may also occur along/near the occluded front.

...Southern New England into NY and the Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas...

Occasional hail and strong to locally damaging winds appear possible
with isolated thunderstorms across parts of NY into southern New
England as a surface low and attendant cold front move eastward
through the day. 

Farther south into the Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas, more substantial
instability is forecast (up to 2500 J/kg MLCAPE). Large-scale ascent
is expected to remain weak over the region. However, strong heating
of a moist boundary-layer and the presence of a surface trough
extending southward into the Carolinas may be sufficient for greater
thunderstorm coverage than previously expected. As a result, a
Slight risk has been extended eastward across parts of VA/NC. Large
hail and damaging gusts will be possible with thunderstorm activity
through the evening.

Valid 071630Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
INDIANA...WESTERN AND CENTRAL OHIO...AND NORTHERN KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley this afternoon and evening.  A few
tornadoes (some strong), large to very large hail, and
severe/damaging winds all appear possible.

...Southern Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and vicinity...
Considerable uncertainty remains for this forecast due largely in
part to an ongoing broken squall line moving east across KY/IN/Lake
Michigan and the related influences for airmass destabilization in
its wake.  However, clearing skies in the MCS' wake will result in a
seemingly sufficient period of heating during the afternoon. 
Water-vapor imagery shows the deep-layer cyclone centered over the
northern Great Plains.  A mid-level speed max rotating through the
base of the larger-scale trough will move from the mid MS Valley
late this morning into the southern Great Lakes by early evening. 
Rapid strengthening of southwesterly 500-mb flow is forecast over
northern IL into the northern half of IN through the mid-late
afternoon.  As an effective warm frontal zone becomes draped across
the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley regions, curved low-level
hodographs beneath a lengthening of the mid and upper part of the
hodograph will support a supercell risk.  It seems most probable
based on morning model guidance that storms will initially develop
across central/northern IL and move northeast into northern IN. 
Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to eventually develop this
afternoon across parts of the OH Valley in association with
warm/moist-air advection---although considerable uncertainty remains
regarding this scenario.  The stronger storms (i.e., supercells)
will be potentially capable of a large to very large hail threat, in
addition to several tornadoes (perhaps a few which may be strong).  

...Arklatex to north-central and south-central TX...
Not much change in the forecast thinking across the Mid South
southwestward into parts of TX.  Isolated severe thunderstorms are
possible during mid/late afternoon.  Damaging gusts and large hail
would be the main concerns.  The threat over the area is conditional
-- more due to weak lift than thermodynamic considerations.  Surface
dewpoints commonly in the 70s F will underlie a deep troposphere and
enough middle-level lapse rates for MLCAPE in the 3500-4500 J/kg
range.  Weak low-level winds will constrain hodograph size and
boundary- layer shear.  However, enough mid/upper flow remains to
support around 45-55 kt effective-shear magnitudes, yielding a
conditional supercell environment.  In the absence of meaningful
large-scale support, and with shallower overall lift near the
front/dryline, convective coverage over this region is more in
question and likely isolated.  Additional convection may form
overnight in a warm-advection plume near and southeast of the front,
across parts of the Mid-South to Arklatex regions.  Marginal hail
and isolated damaging gusts would be the main concerns.

...Southeast KS late tonight...
A strengthening LLJ and associated warm-air advection will be
focused over the northeast OK/southeast KS region late tonight. 
Forecast soundings show large MUCAPE amidst strong deep-layer shear.
Large hail may accompany a stronger storm or two that manages to
develop/become sustained during the 08-12z period.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, 
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A tornado
watch means that conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form
during the next several hours. If a tornado warning is issued for
your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in a basement or
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

...THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
WESTERN...CENTRAL AND NORTHERN OKLAHOMA TO SOUTH-CENTRAL KANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe weather with multiple strong,
long-tracked tornadoes, as well as very large hail and severe
thunderstorm gusts, is expected over parts of the south-central
Plains from this afternoon through evening.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a strong synoptic-scale trough was evident in
moisture-channel imagery from the northern Rockies, through a low
over northeastern UT, then southward to the international border
near the AZ/NM line.  The main 500-mb low should pivot northeastward
toward the Black Hills and deepen by 00Z, with trough northwestward
over central MT and southward across eastern parts of CO/NM.

A basal shortwave trough -- now from central CO to the Four Corners
area -- should swing northeastward then northward, reaching southern
SD, western NE and eastern CO by 00Z.  This perturbation then should
shift northeastward, possibly merging with convectively generated
vorticity over NE and SD this evening and tonight, and reaching
eastern SD, southwestern MN and IA by 12Z.  A weaker, but still
influential perturbation -- now over parts of southern NV/northern
AZ -- should make a net eastward shift to parts of northeastern NM
and the TX Panhandle by 00Z, reaching southern KS and northern OK by
12Z.  Associated substantial height falls and DCVA should remain
over and north of the Red River Valley through this evening.

At the surface, an elongated area of low pressure was analyzed on
the 11Z chart over eastern WY, with Pacific cold front across
eastern CO and northeastern/north-central NM.  A dryline extended
from the front over southeastern CO to eastern NM and the TX
Trans-Pecos region, and should mix eastward to southwestern KS,
eastern OK/TX Panhandles, and west-central/southwest TX by late
afternoon.  The cold front should overtake the dryline across the
central Plains through the afternoon, then over OK overnight.  A
developing/synoptic warm-frontal zone was apparent from southeastern
WY across central KS to southern MO, and should move northeastward
to the lower/mid Missouri Valley through the period.  The southern
warm front -- demarcating the northern rim of a richly moist Gulf
airmass from outflow-modified air, was drawn near the Red River from
the Arklatex to the southeastern TX Panhandle.  This boundary will
shift northward through OK and much of KS today while becoming
diffuse, and possibly catching up to the northern warm front.

...OK, Southern KS, Red River region...
Thunderstorms are expected to develop by mid/late afternoon along
and ahead of the dryline, near the eastern TX Panhandle/western OK
line or 100W longitude into southern KS, then strengthen quickly to
severe levels as they move eastward.  Given the already very
favorable parameter space by late afternoon, and increasingly so
into early/mid evening, the concern is high for at least a few
cyclic, tornadic supercells producing multiple significant tornadoes
along potentially long paths.  The threat for such tornadoes, as
well as very large/destructive hail, will be maintained well into
the late evening, and may even increase as hodographs further
enlarge beneath the LLJ.  Some uncertainty lingers as to how many
such supercells will track across the outlook area, but given the
unusually favorable environment and increasing confidence, a "high
risk" outlook is warranted for areas between roughly the I-40
corridor in OK and the US-54/500 corridor in southern KS.

Compared to farther north in KS, the environment will feature
slightly stronger CINH, very rich low-level moisture (dewpoints
commonly upper 60s to low 70s F), lack of frontal forcing (mainly
dryline instead), and more orthogonal mean-wind/deep-shear vectors
relative to the boundary.  The 12Z FWD sounding sampled the richly
moist and deep boundary layer that will be shifting northward across
OK today, with mean mixing ratio of 15 g/kg.  As low clouds erode in
the moist sector from west-east, diabatic heating will boost MLCAPE
into the 2500-4000 J/kg range over western/central OK and southern/
central KS, and contribute to greater potential for discrete
supercells to develop and last a few hours before potential major
upscale evolution to lines or clusters this evening.  

Hodographs will be favorable for tornadoes soon after initiation,
and enlarge further ahead of the activity with time.  Effective SRH
commonly around 200-300 J/kg is expected late this afternoon and
300-500 J/kg after 00Z, amidst strengthening LLJ and deep shear
(effective-shear magnitudes reaching 45-60 kt).  Effective-layer STP
in the 5-12 range may be realized for a few hours this evening
across parts of OK and southern KS.  Stronger MLCINH and weaker
large-scale support will contribute to lesser storm coverage with
southward extent over southern OK, though significant tornadoes and
damaging hail may be possible from any that form.

The corridor of favorable buoyancy will enlarge eastward this
evening with continued moisture transport/advection, helping to
maintain surface-based effective-inflow parcels well eastward into
the Ozarks and vicinity to maintain eventual upscale growth,
possibly linking with the southern part of QLCS activity sweeping
across the Missouri Valley region.

...Central Plains...
Thunderstorms should develop as early as midday to early afternoon
over portions of western KS and southwestern NE, where CINH will be
weakest, as the southern part of the front overtakes the dryline and
impinges on a rapidly destabilizing/moistening sector to the east. 
Initial supercell mode is possible, with tornadoes (some strong),
large to very large hail and damaging gusts all possible.  With time
this afternoon into evening, a more quasi-linear storm mode may
evolve as the influence of frontal forcing increases, versus some
component of flow across the boundary.  As that occurs, tornadoes
still will be possible, and the hail threat will transition to
severe wind with eastward extent.  Some significant (near 75 mph or
higher) gusts will be possible as the momentum of stronger flow
aloft gets transported to the surface, with increasing forced ascent
along the leading edge of the complex.  60s F surface dewpoints will
overspread a northward-narrowing sector across much of KS and NE
today, contributing to peak/preconvective MLCAPE increasing into the
2000-3000 J/kg range, as deep shear strengthens, and hodographs
extend, while maintaining favorable curvature.

...Northern Plains...
From central NE northwestward, the prefrontal corridor of favorable
moisture and diurnal destabilization will become quite narrow. 
Nonetheless, it should support scattered thunderstorms in northward-
shifting plume, curving from the western Dakotas (and perhaps parts
of extreme northeastern WY and southeastern MT) southeastward to
central NE, and connecting to the northern part of the central
Plains severe threat.  With strong large-scale lift, cooling aloft,
rapidly weakening MLCINH, and robust low-level mass response/shear
expected ahead of the ejecting shortwave trough, confidence is
growing that an arc of strong-severe thunderstorms will develop,
offering large hail, severe gusts and at least marginal tornado
potential.  Even with 50s to low 60s F surface dewpoints and limited
time for substantial diabatic heating, the net steepening of low/
middle level lapse rates should support peak MLCAPE near or slightly
above 1000 J/kg.  Deep shear may not be particularly intense in a
regime of strongly difluent flow aloft, but still should be adequate
for supercell potential given large lowest-km hodographs possible,
and effective SRH in the 150-300 J/kg range.  Severe potential
should diminish after about 00Z.

...West-central/southwest TX...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible in mid/late afternoon along/
ahead of the dryline over northwest to southwest TX.  Although
large-scale/mid-upper forcing will be negligible, any pockets of
relatively persistent/maximized low-level lift associated with
solenoidal processes on the dryline may persist enough to initiate
convection.  Mid/upper 60s to low 70s F surface dewpoints and steep
low/middle-level lapse rates will contribute to 3000-4000 J/kg
MLCAPE amidst enough deep shear for supercells.  A conditional
significant-hail and marginal tornado threat exists with sustained
supercell(s) -- if any can form.  Coverage concerns preclude more
than marginal categorical outlook at this time.
