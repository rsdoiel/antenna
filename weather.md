Mesoscale Discussion 1864
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 PM CDT Fri Aug 01 2025

Areas affected...parts of northwestern South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 012057Z - 012300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The evolution of a supercell into a small organized
cluster appears possible through 5-7 PM MDT, accompanied by a risk
for severe hail, then increasing potential for strong to severe
surface gusts.

DISCUSSION...Convection has undergone notable recent intensification
within an isolated cell on the southwestern flank of a remnant slow
moving MCV.  This is embedded with generally weak deep-layer mean
flow on the northern periphery of broad mid-level ridging.  However,
forcing for ascent and modest shear associated with veering profiles
with height, near a focused area of enhanced lower/mid-tropospheric
warm advection, may support the continuing evolution of a supercell
to an upscale growing organized cluster into this evening.  This
will be aided by continuing inflow of relatively moist air
characterized by moderate CAPE, within lee surface troughing
southwest of Buffalo through areas west-southwest of Mobridge.

Mesoscale Discussion 1863
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0251 PM CDT Fri Aug 01 2025

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming and Colorado into parts of
western Nebraska and adjacent southwestern South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 011951Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered intensifying thunderstorm development, including
the evolution of a few supercells, appears probable through 3-5 PM
MDT.  Trends are being monitored for the possibility of a severe
weather watch.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of an upper jet nosing inland of the central
California coast through the Great Basin, modest surface troughing
is slowly deepening to the lee of the Wyoming/Colorado Rockies. 
Low-level moisture return on southerly flow to the east of the
trough axis is ongoing, and contributing to substantive
destabilization in the presence of steep lower/mid-tropospheric
lapse rates.  This now appears to include moderately large CAPE in
excess of 2000 J/kg, where deep-layer shear (mostly due to
pronounced veering of winds with height, in the presence of
otherwise weak lower/mid-tropospheric flow) appears at least
marginally conducive to organized convection, including supercells.

High-based convection has been initiating and increasing in coverage
near and west of the Colorado Front Range through the Laramies the
past couple of hours.  Gradually, as mid/upper support for this
activity shifts to the east of the higher terrain, scattered
thunderstorm activity will begin to develop east of the higher
terrain into the stronger potential instability across the adjacent
plains.  As this occurs, substantive intensification appears
probable, including the evolution of a few supercells posing a risk
for large hail, locally damaging wind gusts, and perhaps a brief
tornado or two by 21-23Z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 564
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 PM MDT Fri Aug 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Nebraska Panhandle
  Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 245 PM until
  1000 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are forecast to continue to develop and
intensify this afternoon and persist through the evening.  The
stronger storms will likely become supercellular and pose a risk for
large to very large hail (1 to 3 inches in diameter).  A couple of
tornadoes are also possible mainly towards the late afternoon and
early evening when the peak supercell phase is forecast.  Upscale
growth into a thunderstorm cluster may subsequently occur this
evening and the risk for severe gusts may correspondingly increase.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 15 miles west northwest of Scottsbluff
NE to 30 miles west southwest of Akron CO. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 28015.

## Tropical Storm Gil Forecast Discussion Number 7

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 AM HST Fri Aug 01 2025
 
Gil has slightly strengthened over the past few hours.  A 
scatterometer pass from 1710 UTC showed an area of near 50 kt 
vectors in the northeastern quadrant of the storm.  More recent 
geostationary satellite data shows fragmented convection, with a 
curved band wrapping around the southern semicircle. The imagery 
suggests Gil is experiencing a dry air intrusion wrapping around the 
storm's core.  Based on the ASCAT data (accounting for instrument 
undersampling) and a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak estimates 
the initial intensity is increased slightly to 60 kt.

The initial motion is 290/15 kt.  The track forecast reasoning 
remains unchanged.  Gil should continue a west-northwestward motion 
along the southern periphery of a mid-level ridge for the next few 
days.  As the storm weakens, a turn to the west is forecast around 
day 4.  The NHC track prediction is essentially unchanged from the 
previous cycle's forecast.
 
Gil is currently crossing a cooling gradient of the sea surface 
temperatures and nearing the 26 degree Celsius isotherm.  Therefore, 
the storm's chances for any significant strengthening are quickly 
diminishing.  Beyond 12 hours, global models predict increasing 
shear and a dry and stable airmass will steadily weaken the storm 
for the remainder of the forecast period.  The latest official 
intensity forecast lies near the various consensus aids.  Gil is 
still expected to become a post-tropical cyclone by the end of 
weekend.

## Tropical Storm Iona Forecast Discussion Number 23

date: 2025-08-01, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPA41 PHFO 012036
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  23
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Fri Aug 01 2025
 
Convection associated with Iona remains disorganized, with clusters 
of convection now occurring only in the southern semicircle.  While 
satellite imagery shows that the circulation is becoming elongated, 
it is still uncertain whether it is actually closed. An upcoming 
scatterometer overpass should help provide more information on 
whether the circulation still exists and on the maximum winds. For 
the time being, the initial intensity is held at 35 kt as a blend 
of the objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates. 
 
The initial motion is now at 285/16 kt. Iona is expected to move 
west-northwestward during the next couple of days with a gradual 
decrease in forward speed along the southern periphery of the 
subtropical ridge to the north. A turn toward the northwest is 
forecast after 36-48 h as the system approaches a developing break 
in the ridge west of 165E.  The track guidance has shifted a little 
to the west on this cycle, and the new forecast track is slightly 
to the west of the previous track.
 
The intensity forecast scenario is unchanged from earlier. Iona 
continues to be affected by westerly shear, which should persist 
for the next 12-18 h. After that, the system is forecast to 
interact with an upper-level trough, and it will likely enter an
area of upper-level convergence by 60-72 h.  Based on this scenario
and the dynamical guidance, the intensity forecast calls for Iona 
remain a tropical storm for 12 h or so, followed by weakening to a 
depression by 24 h and degenerating into a remnant low by 72 h.
Given the current state of organization and the generally 
unfavorable environment, there remains the possibility the system 
could weaken to a trough at any time during the next 60-72 h.

## Tropical Storm Gil Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-08-01, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPZ42 KNHC 010848
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 PM HST Thu Jul 31 2025
 
Geostationary satellite images indicate that Gil continues to become
better organized underneath the southern portion of a central dense
overcast that contains a fairly large area of -70 to -80 degree C
cloud tops. Gil is also displaying banding features that wrap most
of the way around the cyclone. The latest subjective Dvorak
estimates are a consensus 3.5/55 kt from TAFB and SAB.  Objective
numbers from UW-CIMSS are a bit lower. Given continued improvement
in organization over the past few hours, the initial intensity has
been set to 55 kt, and this might be a tad conservative.  ASCAT
passes from 0437 and 0527 UTC were helpful in analyzing the wind
field, and the data indicate that Gil's radius of maximum winds
(RMW) is still about 50 n mi.
 
The initial motion is west-northwestward, or 300/14 kt.  A fairly
strong mid-tropospheric ridge will continue to prevail to the north
of Gil for the next few days, which should maintain the
west-northwestward track, with additional acceleration expected over
the next 36 h.  The official forecast is very near the previous one
and lies between the faster HCCA and the slower TVCE consensus
aids.  By late in the forecast period, the system will likely turn
to a more westward track following the low-level flow.
 
Gil should strengthen steadily over the next 12 to 24 h as the
vertical wind shear decreases to the 0-5 kt range.  The chance of
rapid intensification is not very high since the RMW is currently 50
n mi, and the sea-surface temperatures that Gil is forecast to
traverse are forecast to decrease quickly, crossing the 26C isotherm
in about 24 h.  Beyond 24 h, weakening is expected due to decreasing
SSTs.  In about 60 h, the west-southwesterly vertical wind shear is
forecast to increase along Gil's path, and this should cause Gil to
lose its convection and become post-tropical in about 3 days, as
shown by the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite solutions. The NHC
intensity forecast is toward the high end of the intensity guidance
during the first 36 h and down the middle of the guidance envelope
thereafter.

## Tropical Storm Iona Forecast Discussion Number 21

date: 2025-08-01, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>263 
WTPA41 PHFO 010836
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  21
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Thu Jul 31 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that convection associated with Iona 
remains fragmented and poorly organized, with the low-level 
circulation center nearly exposed or located near the western edge 
of the deep convection due to persistent west-northwest shear. A 
recent AMSR2 microwave pass revealed an elongated low-level 
structure oriented from north to south, with no well-defined core. 
Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from HFO, SAB, and 
JTWC ranged from 2.5/35 kt to 3.0/45 kt. Based on these estimates 
and the poor satellite presentation, the initial intensity is 
lowered to 40 kt.

The initial motion is estimated at 285/16 kt. Iona is expected to 
continue moving west-northwestward over the next couple of days 
while gradually slowing, steered along the southern periphery of a 
subtropical ridge to the north. A turn toward the northwest is 
forecast by late this weekend or early next week as the system 
approaches a weakness in the ridge. The updated track forecast 
remains close to the previous one, with a slight rightward 
adjustment that aligns with the consensus guidance.

Little change in intensity is expected over the next day or two, but 
a steady weakening trend should begin by Sunday as the system 
interacts with an upper-level trough and entrains mid- to 
upper-level dry air. Most dynamical guidance suggests that Iona will 
gradually open into a trough by early next week. As such, the 
official forecast now shows the system dissipating by 96 hours, or 
Tuesday. This forecast assumes Iona will maintain sufficient 
convection to remain a tropical cyclone through the weekend. If 
convection fails to persist, however, dissipation could occur sooner 
than currently indicated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1856
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0334 PM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Areas affected...portions of southern/central Idaho and southwestern
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 312034Z - 312130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Potential for strong to severe winds with thunderstorm
activity this afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has developed across portions of
southern Idaho near the Snake River Plain and Sawtooth Range. This
is expected to continue to move northward this afternoon, with
potential for strong to severe winds. Temperatures across
southern/central Idaho are in the mid to upper 80s, with large dew
point spreads around 40 degrees noted in surface observations.
Surface objective analysis shows steep low to mid-level lapse rates
around 8.5-9 C/km. This environment will be supportive of strong
downburst potential. As storms cluster and grow along outflow, a
more organized damaging wind threat may emerge.

Areas affected...parts of southern Pennsylvania...New
Jersey...Delaware...much of Maryland and northern Virginia into the
eastern West Virginia panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 562...

Valid 312002Z - 312200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 562
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm activity may continue to develop and
intensify across the Greater Washington D.C. into Baltimore
vicinities through 5-6 PM EDT, accompanied by a risk for potentially
damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...The environment across much of the northern Mid
Atlantic, from Greater Philadelphia into the Greater New York City
area, is becoming substantially impacted by convective precipitation
and outflow.  In the wake of this activity, it appears that the
surface front is beginning to advance across and south of the
southern Pennsylvania state border, into a seasonably moist
boundary-layer still supporting sizable CAPE across the eastern West
Virginia panhandle through the Greater Washington D.C./Baltimore
area, where shear remains at least marginally conducive to organized
convective development near the southern fringe of the westerlies.

Mesoscale Discussion 1853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0236 PM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Areas affected...parts of southwestern Arkansas into northeastern
Texas and northern Louisiana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 311936Z - 312130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Potential for strong to severe wind gusts may increase
with a cluster of storms spreading toward the Ark-La-Tex through 4-5
PM CDT, before activity tends to weaken to the south and southwest
of the region.

DISCUSSION...Vigorous convective development continues a general
slow south/southwestward propagation, in the presence of weakly
sheared light northerly deep-layer mean flow.  The most recent
flareup southwest through south of Hot Springs has contributed to
further strengthening of an associated cold pool, with 2-hourly
surface pressure rises in excess of 2 mb noted in 19Z observations
at Arkadelphia and a 28 degree F differential in temperature across
the cold pool between Arkadelphia and Texarkana.

Aided by low-level updraft inflow of seasonably high boundary-layer
moisture content characterized by large CAPE, renewed vigorous
thunderstorm development is ongoing near/just ahead of the
southwestward propagating segment of the outflow across southwestern
Arkansas, toward Texarkana, with an expanding area of northward
spreading anvil-level precipitation in its wake.  As this continues
through the next hour or two, it appears possible that
north-northeasterly rear inflow may strengthen/descend and pose
increasing potential for strong to severe gusts across the
Ark-La-Texas vicinity, before the storms encounter more stable
updraft inflow and weaken.

## Tropical Storm Gil Forecast Discussion Number 3

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 AM HST Thu Jul 31 2025
 
Gil has been holding steady since the last advisory.  A 
scatterometer pass from 1729 UTC showed the low-level center near 
the northern edge of the Central Dense Overcast (CDO) suggesting the 
cyclone is experiencing moderate vertical wind shear.  The initial 
intensity is held at 45 kt for this cycle, in agreement with the 
TAFB and SAB Dvorak estimates.  While the scatterometer pass only 
covered the western half of the storm, it did provide information 
used to update some of the tropical-storm-force radii.

The motion is west-northwestward at 11 kt along the southern 
periphery of a mid-level ridge centered over the Baja California 
peninsula.  This general motion, with a gradual increase in forward 
speed, should continue through the weekend.  By early next week, 
Gil should turn more westward in the trade winds.  Only slight 
adjustments have been made to the latest official track forecast.

Global models predict that the vertical wind shear should 
gradually abate over the next 12 hours or so.  After this occurs, 
the warm sea surface temperatures and ample mid-level moisture 
should allow Gil to continue to strengthen for the next day or so.  
By Saturday, the storm is expected to cross the 26 degree isotherm 
and move over progressively cooler waters.  This should induce a 
steady-to-rapid weakening trend through the end of the forecast 
period.  Gil is still predicted to lose its organized deep 
convection and become a remnant low by day 4.  The intensity 
guidance predictions have decreased somewhat this cycle and the 
official forecast now lies near the upper end of the guidance 
envelope.

## Tropical Storm Iona Forecast Discussion Number 19

date: 2025-07-31, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>844 
WTPA41 PHFO 312032
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  19
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Thu Jul 31 2025

Iona is still generating a large area of strong but disorganized 
convection over the low-level center.  An earlier partial SSMI/S 
overpass suggest the convection had poorly-defined banding, and 
that the low-level center may have become elongated. Satellite 
intensity estimated have increased a little over the past several 
hours and now are in the 40-60 kt range. The intensity will be held 
at 45 kt for now.
 
The initial motion is now 285/19 kt. Iona is expected to continue
west-northwestward with a decrease in forward speed for the next 
two to three days as it moves along along the southern periphery of 
a low- to mid-level subtropical ridge located to the north. After 
60-72 h, the models have come into better agreement than Iona should 
turn northwestward toward a break in the subtropical ridge west of 
160E, with the formerly more westward GFS joining the more 
northward ECMWF/Canadian.  The model guidance envelope has shifted 
to the right since the last advisory, and while the new forecast 
track is also shifted to the right it still lies to the left of the 
center of the envelope and the consensus models.

Iona continues to be affected by 20-25 kt of northwesterly shear.
This should continue for the next 24 h or so, and during this time 
the storm is expected to weaken some.  Subsequently, the shear is 
forecast to decrease, but the global models forecast the cyclone to 
move close to an upper-level low or trough. It is not clear at this 
time whether this will be favorable or unfavorable for Iona to 
re-intensify, as small changes in the relative positions of the 
systems could make a large difference in how much intensification 
might occur.  After 96 h, the global models agree that Iona should 
weaken, possibly due to upper-level convergence and dry air 
entrainment. In contrast, the HAFS regional hurricane models 
forecast re-intensification at that time. Overall, the intensity 
guidance has trended higher since the last advisory. Due to the 
uncertainties, the new intensity forecast will not yet make 
significant changes and is an update of the previous forecast. 
However, it lies near the lower end of the intensity guidance.

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 115 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are forecast to
develop and intensify this afternoon.  Several clusters of
thunderstorms will likely focus a risk for strong to severe wind
gusts capable of wind damage.  This activity will likely persist
into the early evening before diminishing or moving east of the
coast.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 95
statute miles east and west of a line from 10 miles east northeast
of Allentown PA to 50 miles southwest of Patuxent River MD. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

## Tropical Storm Gil Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 PM HST Wed Jul 30 2025

Satellite imagery indicates that the disturbance NHC has been 
tracking for the past several days has become much better organized 
during the past 12 hours.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates 
are 2.5/35 kt from TAFB and 1.5/25 kt from SAB.  A 0457 UTC ASCAT-B 
pass showed a well-defined circulation with peak winds near 35 kt. 
Since that time, the convective organization has continued to 
improve significantly, with a central convective area containing 
cloud tops that are becoming colder and more circular on infrared 
imagery, along with developing banding features.  The system is 
upgraded to Tropical Storm Gil based on the above data, and the 
initial intensity estimate is 40 kt to reflect the improved 
structure since the time of the ASCAT pass.

Gil is moving westward, or 275/13 kt.  The track forecast is fairly 
straightforward.  A mid-level ridge to the north of Gil will steer 
the cyclone west-northwestward for the next 3 to 4 days.  As Gil 
weakens and becomes shallow, it should bend more to the west by day 
4.  The track forecast is near the middle of the guidance envelope 
and is close to the TVCE consensus.

Gil is currently located in a moist environment with warm 
sea-surface temperatures and low to moderate vertical wind shear, 
and the cyclone is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane over the 
next 36 h.  The shear is forecast to decrease further over the next 
24 h while upper-level divergence increases.  Given the current 
impressive outflow and relatively fast recent development trends, it 
is possible Gil could strengthen a bit more than forecast over the 
next day or two.  However, Gil is forecast to reach colder water and 
more stable conditions by hour 48 as it gains latitude, which should 
lead to weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is near the middle of 
the guidance envelope.  Gil is forecast to lose its convection and 
become a remnant low by day 5.

## Tropical Storm Iona Forecast Discussion Number 17

date: 2025-07-31, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPA41 PHFO 310843
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  17
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that convection has become more 
concentrated over the center of Iona, with a recent convective burst 
producing cloud tops as cold as -85 C. This burst has obscured the 
previously exposed low-level circulation center, though the overall 
structure generally remains disorganized. Subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates ranged from 2.5/35 kt (JTWC) to 3.0/45 kt (SAB), 
with HFO at 3.5/55 kt. These values are mostly consistent with 
objective satellite intensity estimates, which ranged from 30 to 40 
kt. Based on a blend of these estimates and the current satellite 
presentation, the initial intensity is held at 45 kt.

The initial motion is estimated at 280/20 kt. Iona is expected to 
continue moving westward over the next day or two along the southern 
periphery of a low- to mid-level subtropical ridge located to the 
north. By 48 to 60 hours, a gradual turn toward the west-northwest 
and a decrease in forward speed are anticipated as the system 
approaches a weakness in the ridge. The forecast track remains 
consistent with the previous advisory and is well supported by the 
latest consensus guidance.

Only slight additional weakening is expected in the short term as 
Iona remains embedded within a moderate westerly shear environment 
of 20 to 25 kt. By around 60 hours (Saturday), vertical shear is 
forecast to relax, which could allow the cyclone to hold steady or 
even briefly restrengthen as it moves over slightly warmer waters. 
However, conditions are expected to deteriorate again late this 
weekend through early next week, with increasing shear and mid-level 
dry air likely leading to weakening. The intensity forecast has been 
held steady from the the previous advisory, supported by the recent 
burst of convection and the latest guidance. This forecast assumes 
that Iona will maintain enough convection to remain a tropical 
cyclone, but if convection fails to persist, the system could 
degenerate into a remnant low sooner than currently indicated.

Convection associated with Keli has largely collapsed.  Based on
the geostationary visible imagery, it appears the low-level
circulation has opened into a trough on the northern side of Iona.
The remnants of Keli are moving westward at around 15 kt within
the northeastern circulation of Iona and this motion is expected
to continue for the next day or so.

This will be the last advisory issued for Keli.  For additional 
information, see the High Seas Forecasts issued by the National 
Weather Service under WMO header FZPN02 KWBC and AWIPS header 
NFDHSFEPI.

## Tropical Storm Iona Forecast Discussion Number 15

WTPA41 PHFO 302043
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  15
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
Iona continues to rapidly weaken, as the low-level center is now 
seen in visible imagery exposed well to the west-northwest of the 
remaining poorly-organized convection.  Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates again have decreased significantly 
and currently are in the 40-65 kt range. Based on a blend of these 
estimates, the initial intensity is reduced to a possibly generous 
55 kt, and Iona is downgraded to a tropical storm.
 
The initial motion is 275/19 kt. There is little change in the 
forecast philosophy from the past couple of forecasts, as a general 
westward motion is expected to continue during the next day or two 
while Iona moves along the southern periphery of a low- to mid-level
subtropical ridge to the north.  A turn toward the west-northwest
and a gradual decrease in forward speed are expected after 48 h as 
the system is steered into a weakness in the ridge.  There has been 
little change in the forecast guidance since the last advisory, and 
the new forecast track is similar to the previous track.

Rapid weakening should continue for the next 12 h or so due to
westerly vertical shear and a track over cooler sea surface 
temperatures.  After that, the intensity forecast shows a period of 
little change in strength as sea surface temperatures begin to warm 
along the forecast track and the atmospheric conditions become a 
little more favorable. After 72 h, Iona should again weaken as it 
encounters mid-level dry air and another bout of vertical shear.  
The intensity forecast was again lowered below the previous 
forecast based on the current intensity trends.  Note that the 
intensity forecast is based on the premise that Iona will re-develop 
enough convection to sustain the system as a tropical cyclone. If 
this does not happen, the cyclone could degenerate to a remnant low 
or trough before 120 h.

Mesoscale Discussion 1849
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Wed Jul 30 2025

Areas affected...Central Wyoming into Southern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 302031Z - 302230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms capable of isolated severe hail
and severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon into the
evening. However, given that widespread severe storms are not
expected at this time, the likelihood of weather watch issuance is
low.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorm have developed across portions
of western and central Wyoming this afternoon, in an environment
characterized by 1000-1500 J/kg MUCAPE and 45-40 kts of effective
deep-layer shear. While there is sufficient shear for some storms to
become more intense and organized, the expectation is that any
severe storms will largely be isolated and transient in nature. Any
organized convection would be capable of 60 MPH wind gusts and any
hail is expected to remain below 2.00 inches in size. 

While the probability of watch issuance is expected to remain low,
convective trends will continue to be monitored.

## Tropical Storm Keli Forecast Discussion Number 8

date: 2025-07-30, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPA42 PHFO 300843
TCDCP2
 
Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   8
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Jul 29 2025

Satellite imagery shows that Keli continues to produce organized 
deep convection, and the latest subjective Dvorak numbers from SAB, 
PHFO and JTWC are a consensus 2.5/2.5.  The recent objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 30 to 40 kt.  The 
advisory intensity estimate is held at 35 kt.  The storm remains 
quite small with only about a 30 n mi extent of 34-kt winds from the 
center.
 
Keli is moving faster, with the motion estimated to be westward, or 
280/18 kt.  This faster westward motion is due to its proximity to 
the east-northeast of Iona, as well as the mid-level ridging 
located well to the north of the cyclone.  The track guidance is in 
good agreement, and the official forecast has been nudged to show a 
slightly faster forward motion.

Although Keli is hanging on as a tropical storm for the moment, it
is not likely to last for more than another day or so.  Increasing 
vertical wind shear from the outflow of Iona is likely to cause
weakening, and Keli's inflow should be soon disrupted by Iona's
low-level circulation.  The official forecast calls for weakening 
and dissipation in 36 hours or so.  The global models indicate 
that dissipation could occur a bit sooner than forecast.

## Hurricane Iona Forecast Discussion Number 13

date: 2025-07-30, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPA41 PHFO 300842
TCDCP1
 
Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  13
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
The satellite presentation has continued to deteriorate this 
evening, with the low-level center of Iona obscured by a central 
dense overcast with gradually warming cloud top temperatures.  The 
cyclone is continuing to be influenced by increasing westerly 
vertical wind shear while also moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures around or slightly below 27C, as depicted by the 
Real-time, Global, Sea Surface Temperature Analysis.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates ranged from 
4.5/77 knots to 5.5/102 knots, while the latest objective intensity 
estimates range from 77 to 87 knots.  Taking a blend of these data 
the initial intensity has been lowered to 90 knots for this 
advisory.
 
Iona is moving westward, or 275 degrees, at 15 knots.  This general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days as the 
cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to 
the north.  A turn toward the west-northwest and a gradual decrease 
in forward speed is expected late in the week and over the weekend, 
as the system is steered into a weakness in the mid-level ridge to 
the north.  The official track forecast remains near the center of 
the tightly clustered guidance envelope and is very close to the 
previous advisory. Confidence remains high that Iona will stay well 
south of the Hawaiian Islands.

The cyclone is expected to undergo rapid weakening tonight and 
Wednesday as it experiences increasing westerly vertical wind shear 
while also moving over cooler sea surface temperatures of 26.5 to 
27C.  The intensity forecast then shows little change in strength 
Thursday through Friday as sea surface temperatures begin to warm, 
vertical wind shear gradually eases, and mid-level moisture 
increases.  Iona should then begin to gradually weaken by days 4 
and 5 as the mid-levels dry out and the system becomes influenced by

Mesoscale Discussion 1835
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Nevada into southwestern Oregon

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 292039Z - 292245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to isolated severe thunderstorm wind gusts are
possible across portions of northeast Nevada into southwest Oregon
with dry thunderstorm outflow. Weather watch issuance is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development ongoing in a deeply-mixed, dry
boundary layer will result in some chances of strong to severe
thunderstorm wind gusts. With LCL heights at 3.5km and low-level RH
well below 20%, evaporative cooling within downdrafts will result in
gusty thunderstorm outflow. The greatest chance for strong to severe
winds will be along the leading edge of any outflow boundaries.

Mesoscale Discussion 1834
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...parts of southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 291959Z - 292200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strongest thunderstorm development may become focused
across parts of southwestern into central Nebraska through 4-7 PM
CDT.  This may include a few evolving supercell structures posing a
risk for large hail, locally damaging wind gusts and perhaps a brief
tornado.

DISCUSSION...Within lee surface troughing across much of western
Kansas and adjacent portions of the high plains, a strongly heating
(including surface temperatures approaching 100 F) and increasingly
deeply mixed boundary layer is becoming characterized by moderate
CAPE based on latest objective analysis.  Mid-level inhibition is
gradually eroding and deepening convective development is evident,
including the initiation of scattered thunderstorm activity.  As a
weak mid-level perturbation shifts east of the Front Range, models
suggest that thunderstorm development may increase either side of a
remnant frontal zone within the lee surface trough, which is
forecast to slowly shift southeast of the high plains through early
evening.  

Near the nose of the stronger pre-frontal heating, now developing
north and east of the McCook NE vicinity toward areas between North
Platte and Kearney, surface dew points in the lower 70s F are
contributing to moderate to large CAPE along an initially stalled
segment of the frontal zone, where low-level convergence may
eventually focus strongest thunderstorm development.  Although wind
fields in lower through mid-levels are rather weak, easterly
near-surface flow veering to northerly near the eastward migrating
frontal wave (beneath southerly mid-level flow) may contribute to
sufficient shear for intensifying supercell structures posing a risk
for severe hail and perhaps a brief tornado.  Otherwise, storms,
particularly those forming in the strongly heated pre-frontal
environment, may pose a risk for locally strong to severe surface
gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1833
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...Northwest Wyoming into southern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 291933Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed this afternoon
across portions of northern Wyoming into southern Montana in
anticipation of severe thunderstorms capable of large hail and
damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Convective initiation is well underway across portions
of Yellowstone National Park into southern/central Montana, with
storms anticipated to move off the higher terrain and into the
better buoyancy this afternoon. MLCAPE at or exceeding 1000 J/kg,
combined with 30-40 kts of deep layer shear is expected to support
organized thunderstorms capable of large hail and damaging winds. 

Current SPC surface objective mesoanalysis shows Significant Hail
Parameter values of 1.5-2.0 across portions of southeastern Montana.
RAP/HRRR forecast profiles over the next few hours in the vicinity
of northern Wyoming into Montana corroborate this with steep
low-level lapse rates and strong deep-layer shear. Depending on the
location, low-level wind profiles vary from straight-line (favoring
supercell splits), to cyclonically curved (favoring right supercell
motions). Either scenario will support a large hail threat,
including significant (2.00+ inch) hail with the most robust,
isolated thunderstorms. The steep low-level lapse rates, coupled
with higher LCL heights/dryer boundary layer profiles in the
deeply-mixed air will also support a severe wind threat that will be
maximized with any bowing outflow segments. 

A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed within the next few hours.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   6
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
Keli is a ragged-looking tropical storm.  Thunderstorms have been 
developing in the eastern semicircle of the the circulation 
suggesting some decrease in the southeasterly shear.  Satellite 
intensity estimates from PHFO and JTWC were T2.5 and T2.0, 
respectively, and the initial intensity will be held at 35 kt.  Keli 
is a small tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only 
extend outward from the center about 30 n mi.

The storm appears to be gradually accelerating and is moving 
westward at 13 kt.  A narrow ridge to the north should continue to 
steer Keli westward through the next day or so.  The track guidance 
envelope has shifted northward and increased in forward speed this 
cycle. Thus, the official track forecast has been nudged poleward 
and is slightly faster, lying between the previous forecast and the 
various consensus aids.

Only minimal changes have been made to the intensity forecast.  
Atmospheric conditions and the storm's proximity to Hurricane 
Iona are expected to gradually weaken Keli.  Model guidance has been 
advancing the dissipation of this small storm, and the official 
forecast now shows Keli opening into a trough by 48 h.  However, 
dissipation could still occur sooner than expected.

At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Iona was located
near latitude 10.9 North, longitude 155.7 West. Iona is moving
toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general motion with 
some increase in forward speed is expected during the next few 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts. Iona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening is possible
today, but steady weakening is expected to begin by Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  11

Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
 
After rapidly intensifying over the past day or so, Iona's strength 
appears to have leveled off. The eye of the hurricane is not quite 
as distinct as it was a few hours ago and the convective pattern is 
slightly less symmetric.  The initial intensity is held at 110 kt, 
but this is near the high end of the latest satellite intensity 
estimates. Although Iona is quite powerful, its wind field remains 
compact. The hurricane- and tropical-storm-force wind radii are 
estimated to only extend up to 25 n mi and 80 n mi from the center, 
respectively.
 
The major hurricane is likely near its peak intensity. Water vapor 
images show a large area of dry and likely stable air just west of 
the system, and this stable air combined with increasing shear 
should cause Iona to steadily weaken during the next several days. 
The new forecast is a touch lower than the previous one and lies 
generally near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Iona has been moving due westward at about 12 kt on the south side 
of a narrow mid-level ridge situated across the Hawaiian Islands. 
The hurricane should continue westward on the south side of the 
ridge during the next few days, and then turn west-northwestward to 
northwestward after that when it moves toward the southwestern 
periphery of the high pressure system.  The models are again a 
little slower this cycle, and the new track forecast has been 
adjusted in that direction. Iona is expected to cross the 
International Date Line in about 4 days.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 556
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
230 PM MDT Tue Jul 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Montana
  Central and Northern Wyoming

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 230 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify through the afternoon and persist into the early to mid
evening.  A few supercells may evolve from the stronger
thunderstorms during the afternoon.  Upscale growth into one or two
small clusters is expected.  Large to very large hail will
potentially accompany any supercell that develops, and severe gusts
(60-80 mph) are possible with the more intense downdrafts and
outflow.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 105
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles east northeast
of Harlowton MT to 45 miles east southeast of Lander WY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24025.

## Hurricane Iona Forecast Discussion Number 9

date: 2025-07-29, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPA41 PHFO 290836
TCDCP1
 
Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   9
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
Iona has a very impressive satellite presentation this evening, with 
very cold cloud tops ranging from -70°C to -80°C surrounding the 
well-defined eye.  Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
came in at 5.0/90 knots from PHFO and 5.5/102 knots from SAB.  The 
ADT and AiDT objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged 
between 97 and 104 knots over the past several hours. Based on a 
blend of these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has 
been increased to 100 knots, making Iona a Category 3 major
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.
 
Iona is moving due west, or 270 degrees at 11 knots. This general 
motion, along with a gradual increase in forward speed, is expected 
to continue over the next several days as the cyclone moves along 
the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  A turn 
toward the west-northwest is anticipated by late in the week as the 
system is influenced by a weakness in the mid-level ridge, created 
by a developing upper-level low west of the International Date Line. 
The official track forecast remains near the center of the guidance 
envelope and is nearly identical to the previous advisory.  
Confidence remains high that Iona will stay well south of the 
Hawaiian Islands.
 
Environmental conditions appear conducive for further 
intensification during the next 12 hours or so, as Iona will remain 
over warm sea surface temperatures near 28C, with sufficient 
mid-level moisture and minimal vertical wind shear.  Given the 
conducive environment, the intensity forecast calls for Iona to 
reach category 4 status later tonight or early Tuesday.  Steady 
weakening is forecast to begin Tuesday night or Wednesday and 
continue into the weekend, as the system moves over slightly cooler 
waters, encounters increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and 
begins to entrain drier mid-level air.  The intensity forecast has 
been adjusted slightly upward from the previous advisory, reflecting 
the latest trends in the intensity guidance.  This aligns well with 
regional hurricane models during the next 24 to 36 hours, and then 
lies near or slightly below the intensity guidance envelope 
thereafter.

## Tropical Storm Keli Forecast Discussion Number 4

WTPA42 PHFO 290835
TCDCP2
 
Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   4
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
  
Keli has not changed much this evening, with an area of deep 
convection to the west of the low-level center. The system is 
struggling to become better organized due to vertical wind shear. 
The subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates were T2.0 from 
both PHFO and JTWC. Using these estimates and satellite trends, the 
intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory. Keli is a small 
tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only extend outward 
about 30 n mi from the center.
  
The storm is moving westward, with an estimated motion of 280/10 kt. 
Keli is forecast to continue moving generally westward for the next 
few days steered by a mid-level ridge north of the system.  The 
official track forecast is similar to the previous, although with a 
slightly faster forward motion.
 
Keli is forecast to remain over warm sea surface temperatures, but 
wind shear is forecast to increase later today, thus the official 
intensity forecast shows little change in intensity during the next 
day or so. As Keli continues to feel the upper-level outflow of 
nearby Hurricane Iona the system should begin to weaken by 36 h, and 
dissipate by Day 3. The official intensity forecast lies near the 
simple and corrected consensus aids. Global models indicate that the 
shear could take its toll on Keli quicker than forecast, and due to 
the small storm size it is possible that the system could dissipate 
into a trough earlier then officially forecast.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 552
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
345 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Extreme west central Minnesota
  Northern Nebraska
  Central and eastern South Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 345 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 90
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Initial severe storm development is underway across south
central South Dakota, where supercells with isolated very large hail
up to 2.5 inches in diameter will be possible, as well as an
isolated tornado or two with storms near the front closer to Huron. 
Eventual upscale growth into one or more clusters is expected, with
an increasing threat for swaths of damaging winds (potentially up to
80-90 mph) with any bowing segments.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles north
northwest of Valentine NE to 20 miles southeast of Brookings SD. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 551...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 80 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 650. Mean storm motion vector
26030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1824
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central and southeastern South
Dakota...adjacent north central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281947Z - 282145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered, intensifying thunderstorm development, posing a
risk for a few strong downbursts and perhaps some hail, appears
possible by 4-6 PM CDT.  Timing of a potential severe weather watch
issuance remains unclear, but trends are being monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...A surface cold front, now advancing south of Pierre,
Philip and Rapid City is becoming better defined, with strengthening
differential heating along and ahead of it, centered near the
western South Dakota/Nebraska state border northeastward across the
Winner toward Huron vicinities.  While temperatures are approaching
100 F within the corridor of stronger boundary-layer heating,
surface dew points have been slower to mix below 70F, and through
the 60s F, than suggested by model forecast soundings at Winner and
Valentine.  Even so, latest objective analysis suggests that the
pre- and post-cold frontal boundary layer remains strongly capped
beneath the warm and elevated mixed-layer air as far north as the
North/South Dakota state border vicinity.

Mid/upper support for sustained boundary-layer based convection
anytime soon remains unclear, although it appears possible that a
subtle perturbation progressing across and east-northeast of the
Black Hills is contributing to ongoing attempts at convective
development.  It appears more probable that with further insolation,
continued heating and deeper mixing within the pre-frontal
boundary-layer may eventually support intensifying, high-based
thunderstorm development late this afternoon.  In the presence of
strong deep-layer shear, this activity could pose a risk for severe
hail and increasing potential for strong downbursts into early
evening.

## Hurricane Iona Forecast Discussion Number 7

date: 2025-07-28, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>325 
WTPA41 PHFO 282037
TCDCP1
 
Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   7
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
After rapidly strengthening overnight, the cloud pattern and
overall structure of Iona has changed little during the past 6
hours.  A fairly symmetric Central Dense Overcast is seen over the
center in geostationary satellite imagery, but there has been no
recent microwave data to examine the inner core structure. The
latest subjective satellite intensity estimates are T4.0/65 kt
from SAB, and T3.5/55 kt from both PHFO and JTWC.  Objective
estimates remain lower, although it is possible that the small size 
of the cyclone is making it difficult for those techniques to 
capture the true intensity.  The initial intensity for this advisory 
will remain 65 kt, in line with the higher subjective estimate from 
SAB.
 
Iona is located within a low-shear environment and over sea surface
temperatures of around 28C.  Those conditions favor strengthening,
however some nearby dry mid-level air may have been entrained in 
the circulation which likely caused the recent pause in
intensification.  Given the favorable upper-air pattern and warm 
sea surface temperatures, additional strengthening appears likely.  
The regional hurricane models are more aggressive this cycle and 
indicate that Iona could be near or at major hurricane strength in 
a day or so.  As a result, the lastest official forecast calls 
for rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours and the peak 
intensity is raised slightly from the previous advisory.  Around 
midweek, slightly lower SSTs and an increase in vertical
wind shear are expected to cause gradual weakening through the
remainder of the forecast period.  The updated NHC intensity 
forecast is close to the regional models through 24 hours, and then 
follows the latest multi-model (IVCN) consensus aid after that time.
 
Iona is moving westward or 270 degrees at 9 kt.  The storm is
forecast to move along the southern portion of a subtropical ridge
that is well established over the central Pacific.  This steering
pattern should take the storm westward during the next day or so,
followed by a faster west-northwestward motion after midweek. The
updated track forecast is once again near the center of the model
envelope, close to the various consensus aids.  Confidence remains
high that Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.

## Tropical Storm Keli Forecast Discussion Number 2

date: 2025-07-28, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPA42 PHFO 282034
TCDCP2
 
Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   2
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025

ASCAT data from around 1830 Z showed a small area of 
tropical-storm-force winds just north of the center of the system.  
Based on that data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical 
storm Keli with maximum winds of about 35 kt. Although the winds 
are estimated to be higher than earlier this morning, satellite 
images indicate that the deep convection has generally decreased 
during the past few hours. Keli is a very compact storm with its 
associated cloud field extending only about 90 n mi across. 
 
The storm is moving westward at about 9 kt. Keli is expected to 
continue westward, following Iona, during the next few days as it 
remains on the south side of a narrow mid-level ridge. The latest 
track models have trended a little to the north and are faster this 
cycle, and the official forecast has been nudged in those 
directions.
 
The environmental conditions could favor a little more strengthening 
during the next day or so while the storm is over relatively warm 
water, embedded in a moist air mass, and in generally moderate 
shear conditions. By the middle of the week, however, Iona's outflow 
will likely impinge on the cyclone. These unfavorable upper-level 
winds and stable air should end the opportunity for strengthening 
and cause weakening. Most of the models show Keli dissipating in 
about 2 days, except for the GFS which hangs on to the cyclone for 
about 3 days. Based on the latest guidance, the official forecast 
has moved up dissipation by 24 hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 551
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
115 PM MDT Mon Jul 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central Montana

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 115 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm development is expected through the
afternoon, including the potential for a few supercells.  Large hail
of 1-2.5 inches in diameter will be possible, while severe outflow
gusts of 60-70 mph will be possible with upscale growth into a
cluster or two this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles northwest of
Helena MT to 75 miles east of Lewistown MT. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU1).

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the northern Plains
into the upper Mississippi Valley this afternoon and tonight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Southern Minnesota
  Eastern South Dakota
  Northern Iowa

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  A couple of tornadoes
  Isolated large hail up to baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  Severe storm clusters are expected to form this afternoon in

Mesoscale Discussion 1821
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0721 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Areas affected...parts of western/central ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281221Z - 281415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A persistent supercell or two may yield a confined swath
of large hail and strong gusts into late morning. Monitoring for
possible Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A couple elevated supercells are ongoing across
southwest/west-central ND, along and just north of I-94. Despite a
lack of reported severe thus far, strong westerly speed shear above
3 km (now sampled by the BIS VWP and 12Z observed sounding) has
sustained persistent organizational structures as these cells spread
across the MT/ND border. This elevated activity is likely to persist
into midday along the buoyancy gradient across western ND. Large
hail and strong gusts should be the primary hazards. Severe wind may
increase if flanking convection can form along the outflow into a
destabilizing airmass over SD. But ongoing low clouds/fog in the
swath of richest low-level moisture casts uncertainty on whether
that scenario may occur soon or later today.

## Tropical Storm Iona Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-07-28, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>741 
WTPA41 PHFO 280840
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number   5
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Iona has improved this evening, with a
well-defined curved banding structure and excellent upper-level
outflow evident in all quadrants. A recent 28/0650Z Metop-C ASCAT
pass showed a few wind barbs near 40 knots. The latest subjective
Dvorak current intensity estimates came in at 3.0/45 knots from
PHFO, 3.0/45 knots from SAB, and 2.5/35 knots from JTWC. Objective
intensity estimates ranged from 42 to 49 knots. Taking a blend of
these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has been raised
to 45 knots, which may still be slightly conservative.
 
Tropical Storm Iona is moving westward at 270 degrees/10 knots. This
general motion is expected to continue over the next several days as
the cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical
ridge to the north. A gradual increase in forward speed is also
expected, due to a strengthening low- to mid-level ridge north of
the system. The track forecast remains closely aligned with a blend
of the FSSE, HCCA, and GFEX consensus guidance and is nearly
unchanged from the previous advisory. Confidence remains high that
Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.
 
The environment appears conducive for further intensification over
the next day or so, as Iona remains over warm waters near 28C, with
adequate mid-level moisture and very light vertical wind shear. In
fact, the latest GFS and ECMWF SHIPS guidance indicates more than a
30 percent chance of a 25-knot increase in intensity over the next
24 hours. Given the current structure and favorable conditions, the
intensity forecast explicitly calls for rapid intensification during
the next 24 hours, with Iona expected to become a hurricane late
Monday or Monday night. Iona should reach peak intensity Monday
night or Tuesday, with steady weakening anticipated beginning
Tuesday night, as the system moves over slightly cooler waters,
begins to experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and
starts to entrain drier mid-level air. The cyclone is expected to
become a post-tropical remnant low by Day 5 and could potentially
weaken into a trough by that time. The intensity forecast has been
raised from the previous advisory to reflect the latest trends in
the guidance, and is best aligned with the FSSE and IVCN consensus
solutions.

## Tropical Depression One-C Forecast Discussion Number 3

WTPA41 PHFO 272035

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   3
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The system continues to become better organized this morning, with 
deep convection in curved banding generally to the west of the 
center. Recent imagery shows that convection has been developing the 
last few hours near the low-level center, with some increased 
curvature. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from HFO 
and SAB were T/2.0 this cycle. A scatterometer pass is expected 
shortly which should give a better idea of the surface winds. Using 
the Dvorak estimates, the intensity is held at 30 kt.
 
The system is moving westward at about 270/10 kt. A westward motion 
is expected the next several days as the cyclone moves on the south 
side of a mid-level ridge. There continues to be some spread in the 
along track guidance, although there is high confidence on the 
system remaining well south of the Hawaiian islands. The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous, and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
Environmental conditions appear favorable for some gradual 
strengthening the next couple of days. The hurricane regional models 
remain at the higher end of the guidance envelope, and the latest 
NHC forecast is near the previous. Beyond 48 h, a gradual weakening 
trend should begin as the system moves over slightly cooler sea 
surface temperatures, a drier airmass, and vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase. The gradual weakening trend will cause the 
system to become a remnant low by day 5, potentially even opening 
into a trough.

Areas affected...central/eastern North Carolina...southern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271957Z - 272200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will promote a few
instances of strong to severe wind this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorm activity has increased in
coverage across portions of eastern North Carolina this afternoon.
The air mass in this region is very hot and unstable, but deep layer
shear for a more organized severe threat remains weak. Given the
deep moisture and strong instability, a few wet downbursts may
produce some instances of strong to severe wind. Overall, this
threat will remain too isolated for watch issuance.

the latest satellite images showing improved organization and a 
better defined banding structure.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates came in at 2.0/30 knots from PHFO, 
1.5/25 knots from SAB, and 1.0/25 knots from JTWC.  A recent 
27/0620Z Metop-B ASCAT pass showed a well-defined low-level 
circulation with a large swath of 25-knot winds and a few embedded 
25- to 30-knot wind barbs.  Given the improved structure and 
organization of the system, advisories are being initiated on the 
first tropical cyclone of the season in the central Pacific, 
Tropical Depression One-C.  The initial intensity will be set at 30 
knots.

Tropical Depression One-C is moving toward the west, or 270 degrees, 
at 10 knots.  This general westward motion is expected to continue 
over the next couple of days as the system moves along the southern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  Beyond 48 hours, the 
forward speed is expected to increase considerably in response to a 
low- to mid-level ridge strengthening to the north of cyclone.  The 
track forecast closely follows a blend of the TVCE and HCCA 
consensus guidance.

The environment will remain conducive for intensification over the 
next couple of days, as One-C remains over warm waters between 28 
and 29C, with adequate mid-level moisture and light to moderate 
easterly shear.  As a result, the intensity forecast calls for 
steady strengthening during this time, with One-C becoming Tropical 
Storm Iona on Sunday.  Beyond 60 hours, the cyclone will begin to 
experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear while also 
entraining drier mid-level air.  This is expected to lead to steady 
weakening, with the system becoming a tropical depression again 
around day 5.  The intensity forecast is best aligned with the HCCA 
intensity consensus guidance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1793
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Areas affected...much of central into northern South Dakota into
southern North Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 262050Z - 262315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will increase over the next 1-2 hours over central
South Dakota, with further activity developing north/northeastward
into southern North Dakota. Damaging winds appear likely, with
locally large hail. Isolated significant gusts cannot be ruled out.

DISCUSSION...Visible imagery shows storms beginning to develop near
the surface low over south-central SD, in a very steep lapse rate
environment. The 18Z UNR soundings shows 9.5 C/km midlevel lapse
rates, and modest westerlies aloft. East of there, surface analysis
depicts MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg, and a theta-e axis roughly
along the ND/SD border counties.

Given the observed TCU vigor over south-central SD currently, this
may be the initiation point for a larger-scale,
northward-propagating complex of storms depicted in some CAM
solutions. Otherwise, it is also possible outflow from high-based
storms coming out of WY into western NE may produce outflow aiding
further development as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 1792
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado...western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 262048Z - 262145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm activity across the high terrain will move
eastward into the evening with potential for damaging winds.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has been steadily developing
across the high terrain in Colorado/Wyoming over the last couple of
hours. Dew points in these regions are low in the mid 40s, with
better moisture located across Nebraska into southern South Dakota.
CAM guidance suggests that activity will develop along eastward
moving outflow by late afternoon/evening. Downstream, temperatures
have warmed into the upper 90s to 100s, with dew point spreads
around 40-50 degrees. Though deep layer shear remains weak, large
dew point spreads and steep low to mid-level lapse rates may promote
some damaging wind potential. In addition, the low level jet is
progged to increase through the evening with the deepening of a
surface low across South Dakota. While watch issuance is not
anticipated, trends in this area will be monitored.
