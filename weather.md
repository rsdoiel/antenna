Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0739 AM CDT Tue Mar 18 2025

Valid 181300Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE TONIGHT
FROM EASTERN NE INTO IA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated, marginally severe hail is possible late tonight from
eastern Nebraska across much of Iowa.

...Eastern NE/IA late tonight and early Wednesday...
In advance of a pronounced midlevel shortwave trough over
UT/northern AZ this morning, a surface lee cyclone will deepen
across western KS and then move to far northwest MO by early
Wednesday.  Moisture return in the warm sector of this deepening
cyclone will be limited by a prior frontal passage across the
Gulf/northwest Caribbean, with only a narrow corridor of low-mid 50s
boundary-layer dewpoints expected from eastern OK to far northwest
MO.  Though the warm sector will remain capped through the period,
there could be sufficient ascent/moistening for elevated
thunderstorm development by 06-12z from eastern NE across IA.  Steep
midlevel lapse rates and relatively cold midlevel temperatures will
contribute to MUCAPE of 500-750 J/kg and the potential for isolated
large hail (a few instances near 1 inch diameter) with elevated
convection to the cool side of a baroclinic zone across eastern
NE/IA.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 AM CDT Tue Mar 18 2025

Valid 211200Z - 261200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Friday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 5...
On Friday and Saturday, a shortwave mid-level trough will move
eastward from the Great Plains to the Eastern Seaboard, as a long
fetch of west-northwest flow develops over much of the continental
U.S. Isolated convection may develop ahead of the trough, but
instability will likely be insufficient for a severe threat. In the
wake of this system, low-level moisture return will begin along the
western Gulf Coast. By Saturday, surface dewpoints are expected to
be the upper 50s and lower 60s F over the Texas and Louisiana
Coastal Plain.

...Sunday/Day 6 to Tuesday/Day 8....
On Sunday, moisture advection is forecast to increase over eastern
parts of the southern Plains into the Ark-La-Tex. A mid-level trough
is forecast to move across the central U.S. Ahead of the trough,
moderate instability is forecast to develop across much of a moist
airmass located from the southeastern third of Texas northeastward
into the Ark-La-Tex. On Sunday, thunderstorms with a threat for
isolated large hail and severe gusts are expected to develop along
the northern edge of the moist sector, with a complex of storms
moving southeastward across the Sabine and lower Mississippi Valleys
overnight.

On Monday and Tuesday, the mid-level trough is forecast to move into
the eastern U.S., as a cold front advances southward to near the
Gulf Coast. Although isolated storms could develop in the southern
Gulf Coast states, limited large-scale ascent is expected to be
problematic concerning an organized severe threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Tue Mar 18 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL TO SOUTHERN TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected to persist across the
southern High Plains into central and southern Texas Wednesday
afternoon. More regional fire weather concerns are anticipated
across parts of the upper OH River Valley. 

...Southern Plains...
A Pacific cold front attendant to a deep surface cyclone is expected
to push east/southeast across the southern Plains late Tuesday night
into early Wednesday. In its wake, cool, but very dry air will
overspread eastern NM into OK and TX. Temperature reductions will be
muted with southward extent, resulting in a swath of RH minimums
between 15-25% from eastern NM to eastern TX. Although the surface
low will be lifting to the northeast away from the region, a
lingering belt of 20-30 mph winds between 850-700 mb will promote
breezy conditions at the surface by mid-afternoon. Ensemble guidance
shows a strong signal for sustained winds near 20 mph from the Davis
Mountains region southeastward towards the Edwards Plateau and Rio
Grande Valley, though critical wind speeds may emerge as far north
as the lee of the Sacramento mountains. More broadly across TX, wind
speeds between 15-20 mph will support an expansive swath of elevated
fire weather conditions. 

...Upper OH River Valley...
Southerly winds are expected to strengthen to 15-20 mph ahead of an
approaching surface low across much of the OH River Valley. This
will induce a downslope flow regime off the northern slopes of the
Appalachians with forecast guidance suggesting RH values will fall
into the 20-30% range by mid-afternoon across parts of KY, WV, OH,
and PA. Although elevated meteorological conditions may be somewhat
expansive, the Elevated risk area is confined to locations that
received relatively little rainfall over the past few days and will
have a higher probability of receptive fuels.

Mesoscale Discussion 0222
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Areas affected...North Florida and southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161128Z - 161300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A broken band of storms will spread eastward into
southeast Georgia and north Florida through late morning.  A new
tornado watch appears likely.

DISCUSSION...A broken band of storms has persisted overnight from
south central GA into the eastern FL Panhandle, with
occasional/embedded supercell structures.  Low-level moistening over
the next few hours and the onset of diurnal heating will drive
destabilization across north FL/southeast GA later this morning. 
Though the low-level jet core will develop northeastward toward the
Carolinas through the day, low-level flow/shear will remain
sufficiently strong to support additional supercells through the
morning across north FL/southeast GA.  The storms will remain
capable of producing occasional damaging winds and possibly a couple
of tornadoes, and a new tornado watch will likely be needed from
12-13z.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Florida Panhandle
  Southern into Central and Eastern Georgia
  West-Central South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning from 215 AM until 1000 AM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely

  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A broken band of primarily cellular storms will continue
east into the Watch area this morning and afternoon.  Relatively
moist low levels and strongly sheared wind profiles will support
organized storms, including supercells and small linear segments.  A
couple of tornadoes are possible, as well as damaging gusts with the
stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 55 statute miles

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
610 AM EDT Sun Mar 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Georgia
  Southern North Carolina
  Central and Eastern South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and afternoon from 610 AM until
  200 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 0.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A broken band of thunderstorms will continue east into the
Watch area this morning within a weakly unstable airmass with very
strong flow aloft.  A greater risk for wind damage along with a
threat for a couple of tornadoes, will seemingly focus with
organized bowing segments and perhaps a few embedded circulations
within the band of thunderstorms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 35 miles north northeast of
Fayetteville NC to 45 miles southwest of Savannah GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).
