## Tropical Storm Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2024-09-13, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Fri Sep 13 2024
 
Recent satellite imagery shows that Ileana is producing a large
convective canopy with clouds top temperatures as cold as -80C.
However, data from the Mexican radar at Cabo San Lucas shows that
the convective banding under the canopy is poorly organized and
suggests that the circulation center is still broad and elongated.
The various satellite intensity estimates are little changed since
the previous advisory, so the initial intensity remains 40 kt.
 
The initial motion is 335/8 kt. This general motion should continue 
for the next 12 h or so, bringing the center across the southern 
portion of the Baja California peninsula later today and into the 
southern Gulf of California by early Saturday.  After that, a slower 
northward to north-northwestward motion is forecast until the 
cyclone dissipates over the weekend.  There are no significant 
changes to either the track forecast guidance and the forecast 
track.

Ileana currently appears too disorganized to take advantage of the 
current environment of light to moderate shear, good moisture, and 
warm water. Thus, little change in strength is expected before 
landfall in Baja California Sur.  When the cyclone reaches the Gulf 
of California, it is forecast to move into increasing westerly shear 
and a drier airmass, which should cause weakening despite the very 
warm sea surface temperatures.  Based on this scenario and the 
intensity guidance, the intensity forecast continues to show 
weakening, with the cyclone forecast to become a remnant low by 48 h 
and dissipate by 72 hr.


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of 
western Mexico and southern Baja California through this weekend. 
This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding and 
mudslides to portions of the area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of
Baja California Sur during the next several hours where Tropical 
Storm Warnings are in effect.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 669
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 AM CDT Thu Sep 12 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Thursday morning and afternoon from 550 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...As Francine's center continues moving northward over MS
and weakens further through midday (per NHC forecast), a slot of
wind/moisture/instability fields favorable for supercells and a few
tornadoes will shift slowly northward/inland as well.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles west southwest of Evergreen
AL to 35 miles south southeast of Marianna FL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 668. Watch number 668 will not be in effect after
550 AM CDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 50 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 16030.

Mesoscale Discussion 2051
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Wed Sep 11 2024

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana coastal areas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111250Z - 111615Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for occasional tornadoes may begin to increase
near southeastern Louisiana coastal areas by late morning (10
AM-Noon).  Trends are being monitored for the possibility of a
tornado watch.

DISCUSSION...The center of Francine has been migrating across and
northeast of the Gunnison Oil Platform vicinity of the northwestern
Gulf of Mexico during the past hour or so, and is still roughly 170
miles from its forecast south central Louisiana coastal landfall
later today.  However, the leading edge of a broader convective
precipitation shield preceding Francine is beginning to overspread
coastal areas, accompanied by saturating thermodynamic profiles with
lapse rates trending moist adiabatic in mid-levels.

In the wake of this regime, and with the continued approach of
Francine, model forecast soundings suggest that a subtle increase in
boundary-layer temperatures and dew points may contribute to modest
destabilization by midday along coastal areas from west of
Boothville into the Vermilion Bay vicinity.  It appears that this
will coincide with more notable strengthening of low-level wind
fields, which are forecast to contribute to enlarging low-level
hodographs increasingly supportive of convection with embedded
low-level mesocyclones potentially capable of producing tornadoes.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will quickly intensify
Wednesday, as a shortwave perturbation and mid-level jet streak move
onshore over the West Coast. As the trough strengthens, mid-level
flow over much of the West will increase. A surface low will deepen
over the northern Great Basin, while a cold front moves onshore and
also strengthens. To the east, TS Francine will approach the Gulf
Coast with offshore winds likely over parts of the mid South. Strong
surface winds, low humidity, and thunderstorms over parts of the
West and central US will support critical fire-weather concerns
Wednesday.

...Great Basin...
Ahead of the deepening trough, a potent mid-level jet streak will
move over parts of the western Great Basin beginning early
Wednesday. A deepening surface low in parts of the eastern Basin
will drive 20-25 mph winds over much of NV into western UT.
Augmented by downslope flow off the Sierra and the approaching cold
front, a brief period of winds of 25-30 mph will be possible along
with RH below 15%. Widespread critical fire-weather conditions are
likely over parts of the Great Basin. Fire-weather concerns should
diminish behind the front as cooler and more quiescent conditions
are expected behind the front into early Thursday.

...Lee of the Rockies and High Plains...
As the trough approaches, height falls and stronger flow aloft will
overspread the Rockies and High Plains. A surface low will deepen
first in eastern MT, with a lee trough extending south into the
central High Plains. Near the lee trough, strong southerly winds
will overlap with areas of low RH and drying fine fuels. Elevated
fire weather concerns are expected over parts of the High Plains
Wednesday afternoon and evening.

...Mid South...
As Francine approaches the Gulf Coast Wednesday and Wednesday night,
offshore pressure gradients will increase over parts of the lower MS
Valley and Mid South. While humidity values are not expected to be
overly low with the tropical air mass approaching, strong gusts are
expected to overlap with areas of relatively dry fuels and little
recent rainfall. Brief elevated fire-weather conditions are possible
before rain chances increase into early Thursday.

...Northwest Thunder...
Ahead of the cold front, increasing mid-level moisture and strong
lift from the trough will promote scattered thunderstorms Wednesday
afternoon. Lightning may interact with areas of somewhat drier fuels
over parts of the Northwest and northern Rockies before broader
wetting rainfall develops. However, these storms will likely have
higher precipitation efficiency with a cooler air mass and more
plentiful Pacific moisture in place. This lends significant
uncertainty on the threat for any lightning ignitions.
