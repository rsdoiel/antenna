Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE UPPER MIDWEST...GREAT
LAKES...NORTHEAST...MID-ATLANTIC...PARTS OF SOUTHERN AND COASTAL
TEXAS...AND SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI...

...SUMMARY...
Strong storms are possible across portions of the Upper Midwest,
Great Lakes, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, parts of southern and coastal
Texas, and southern Mississippi.

...20z Update...

Minor adjustments were made to the MRGL areas across northern IN and
LA/MS where morning/afternoon thunderstorms have moved eastward. 

Marginal risks continue across portions of MN/WI to the
Mid-Atlantic, TX/LA/MS, and ME/NH. A few thunderstorms with
transient rotation have been observed across Central and Eastern
Virginia. See MCD 1175 for more information. 

Thunderstorm development is expected to increase in coverage across
portions of MN/WI through the rest of the afternoon. Daytime heating
has yielded MLCAPE around 500 J/kg as mid-level flow increases from
a speed max moving through the trough located across Canada into the
Great Lakes region. Deep layer shear will increase across the
region, mainly across southern MN into northern IA, which may allow
for a few more organized clusters capable of damaging winds and hail
through the afternoon. The Marginal Risk handles this threat well,
with no changes needed this afternoon.

..Thornton/Dean.. 06/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1122 AM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery shows a mid-level shortwave trough over the
western Great Lakes/mid MS Valley with the primary vorticity lobe
rotating northeastward through the Upper Great Lakes through the
early evening.  A blocking pattern located over the Northeast into
Quebec will weaken as a mid-level speed max moves quickly from the
western Dakotas southeastward into the southern Great Lakes by early
Thursday morning.  In the low levels, a cold front will arc
southeastward into the Great Lakes from an occluded low over
Manitoba/western Ontario.  The trailing portion of the front will
progress eastward across the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley, while
the convectively augmented effective front stalls over the northwest
Gulf Coast states.

...MN/WI to the Mid-Atlantic this afternoon/evening...
Surface heating and lingering boundary-layer moisture will
contribute to weak-moderate buoyancy in an environment with
sufficient westerly deep-layer shear/hodograph length for scattered,
low-topped cells to produce isolated severe gusts and marginally
severe hail this afternoon across MN/WI.

Farther southeast over the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley, ascent
associated with the aforementioned Great Lakes mid-level disturbance
will aid in storm development this afternoon as heating weakens
convective inhibition.  Relatively moist low levels (surface
dewpoints 65-70 deg F) will contribute to MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. 
Moderate deep-layer vertical shear (effective bulk shear 20-30 kt)
along with poor midlevel lapse rates around 6 C/km, will favor
mostly strong to locally severe multicells.  Isolated 50-65 mph
gusts and marginally severe hail are the primary hazards.  

Remnant, convectively enhanced midlevel troughs will move
east-northeastward from WV and AL, coincident with the diurnal
heating cycle near and east of the Appalachians.  Widely scattered
storm clusters will be possible this afternoon from GA into the
western Carolinas, but poor lapse rates and weak vertical shear will
limit any severe threat.  Though lapse rates will be similarly poor
into the Mid-Atlantic, there will be a zone of stronger low-level
shear/hodograph curvature across northern VA/MD in advance of the
MCV approaching from WV.  Here, a few weakly rotating storms could
produce isolated wind damage and a brief/weak tornado.

...TX/LA/MS...
Remnant MCS will continue to push southward through the middle TX
coast through early afternoon and offshore the southwest LA coast. 
Several observation sites late this morning recorded strong gusts
(40-45 kt) but the overall displacement of the gust front from the
thunderstorm cores will likely limit gust potential.  A few storms
may develop farther west this afternoon/evening along the trailing
outflow boundary in the area around DRT.  Large CAPE/steep lapse
rates will support both strong updrafts and downdrafts, though weak
vertical shear will generally limit storm longevity and the
magnitude of any hail/wind threat.  Farther east over LA/MS,
scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop near the residual
outflow.  An isolated hail/wind threat may develop with the stronger
storms as one or two clusters develops by mid-late afternoon and
early evening.

...ME/NH this afternoon...
Downstream of shortwave ridging in the midlevels, a weak northwest
flow regime will persist this afternoon over northern New England. 
Lingering low-level moisture, surface heating in cloud breaks
southeast of the higher terrain, and very subtle midlevel vorticity
maxima will support a few thunderstorms this afternoon across
southern/eastern ME and part of NH.  The latest forecast soundings
show MLCAPE of 1000-1500 J/kg and effective bulk shear near 25 kt
(with longer hodographs aloft) will be sufficient for semi-organized
storms capable of producing isolated wind damage and marginally
severe hail for a few hours this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1176
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0302 PM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Areas affected...much of central Minnesota into northwestern
Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 052002Z - 052200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will continue to develop
and overspread the region through 5-7 PM CDT, accompanied by locally
strong to severe surface gusts.

DISCUSSION...Mid-level cooling and lift within the exit region of a
seasonably strong (70-90 kt around 500 mb) jet digging across the
northern Great Plains is contributing to steepening
lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates spreading east-southeast of the
Red River Valley through much of northern and central Minnesota. 
Beneath this regime, a deepening mixed boundary layer remains
sufficiently moist to support CAPE in excess of 500 J/kg, with an
increase in thunderstorm development ongoing in the wake of
preceding thunderstorm activity overspreading the Minnesota
Arrowhead through northwestern Wisconsin vicinity.  As thunderstorms
continue to slowly increase in number and intensify in the peak
afternoon heating, downward mixing of stronger momentum to the
surface will contribute to increasing potential for strong to widely
scattered severe gusts, particularly with storms overspreading
central Minnesota into northwestern Wisconsin through 22-00Z.

Mesoscale Discussion 1175
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Areas affected...Central and Eastern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051925Z - 052130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered afternoon thunderstorms are expected, with a
risk of isolated gusty/damaging winds or perhaps a brief tornado or
two.  Limited areal coverage and brief nature of risk suggests a
watch will not be needed.

DISCUSSION...A band of scattered showers and occasional
thunderstorms is spreading northeastward across eastern VA into
eastern MD.  In the wake of this activity, strong daytime heating is
leading to destabilization of a rather moist air mass across central
VA, where MLCAPE values have risen into the 1000-1500 J/kg range. 
Model guidance suggests the approach of a weak mid-level shortwave
trough, with an accompanied increase in low-level winds.  This will
result in some strengthening of shear profiles and a greater chance
of a few more organized or weak supercellular storms in the coming
hours.  Locally damaging wind gusts are the most likely concern, but
a brief tornado or two are also possible through the afternoon. 
Given the limited nature of the threat, a ww is not currently
anticipated.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains valid. Please see the discussion below
for additional details. It will remain hot and dry across the
Southwest, but relatively low sustained wind speeds will limit the
overall potential for elevated fire spread conditions. Some
localized, short-lived elevated conditions may develop late Thursday
afternoon in and around the Gila Mountains of AZ.

..Barnes.. 06/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will settle over the western CONUS as
northwesterly flow aloft becomes established across the eastern
CONUS. As the ridge continues to build, a weak cold front will
continue westward at the surface bringing moisture into parts of the
southern Rockies and High Plains. With weak surface winds and
increasing moisture, dry and windy fire-weather conditions appear
limited in coverage. However, some potential may exist for lightning
ignitions from high-based storms.

...Southwest Dry Thunderstorms...
As the backdoor cold front continues to weaken over eastern NM and
far west TX, low-level moisture will gradually move westward into
the southern Rockies beneath the upper ridge. While forcing aloft
appears very weak, with the majority of the upper flow displaced
north, orographic ascent and diurnal heating may be sufficient to
support isolated thunderstorm coverage from parts of eastern AZ to
northern NM. Model soundings show deep and well-mixed boundary
layers are present beneath weak buoyancy. This strongly suggests any
storms that do form will be high-based with little potential for
wetting rainfall. Dry lightning strikes with ignition potential
appear possible given the receptive nature of fuels over parts of NM
and AZ. However, height rises aloft and little to no forcing for
ascent casts considerable uncertainty on storm coverage.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1228 PM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF
CENTRAL AND SOUTH FL...PARTS OF THE TX PANHANDLE INTO SOUTHWEST
OK...PARTS OF THE MID ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to potentially severe thunderstorms will be possible
on Thursday across parts of central and south Florida, parts of the
Mid Atlantic into the Northeast, and also from the Texas Panhandle
into southwest Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer cyclone centered over Ontario is forecast to move
southeastward on Thursday, with a belt of northwesterly
mid/upper-level flow extending west and south of the cyclone from
the Great Lakes into parts of the Mid Atlantic. A cold front
attendant to the cyclone will move across parts of New England into
the Carolinas during the afternoon and evening. The trailing cold
front will extend westward into parts of the southern Plains.

...Parts of the Mid Atlantic and Northeast...
Scattered thunderstorms will be possible during the afternoon and
evening along/ahead of the cold front from parts of the Mid Atlantic
into the Northeast, with a threat of isolated damaging wind. 

For northern portions of the region across parts of central/eastern
NY and vicinity, MLCAPE may remain relatively modest (generally
500-1000 J/kg), but moderate deep-layer flow/shear and ascent
attendant to the approaching upper-level trough will support some
storm organization. Multicell clusters and a couple of transient
supercells will be possible. Locally damaging winds appear to be the
most likely hazard at this time, though at least small hail will
also be possible. Some threat could spread into parts of southern
New England before storm intensity diminishes during the evening. 

Farther south, deep-layer shear will be weaker into parts of the Mid
Atlantic and North Carolina. However, relatively stronger
heating/destabilization and somewhat enhanced low-level
southwesterly flow could support a few stronger clusters with
isolated damaging-wind potential from afternoon into the early
evening.  

...Parts of central/south FL...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are expected across parts of the
central and southern FL Peninsula Thursday afternoon, with the
typical sea-breeze-related convection potentially aided by a weak
mid/upper-level shortwave trough over the Southeast. Deep-layer
shear will generally be rather weak, but relatively cool
temperatures aloft and moderate to strong buoyancy will support a
few strong to locally severe storms capable of isolated hail and
damaging gusts. 

...Parts of southwest OK into the TX Panhandle vicinity...
The western portion of the cold front will likely become nearly
stationary from southern parts of the TX Panhandle into southwest OK
Thursday afternoon. Strong heating will support moderate
destabilization near the front, with at least isolated storm
development possible by late afternoon into early evening. While
deep-layer flow will generally be rather weak, northerly midlevel
flow may provide sufficient effective shear for modest storm
organization, including the potential for hail and localized severe
gusts.

1110 AM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast of limited meteorological fire spread
conditions remains on track. In addition to the details of the
discussion below, a few thunderstorms are expected across the
southern Florida peninsula later this afternoon. This is where fuels
remain highly receptive, especially in and around the Big Cypress
National Reserve, and any lightning strikes away from substantial
precipitation cores could potentially result in ignition.

..Barnes.. 06/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging over the western third of the CONUS is expected to
keep surface winds weak as flow aloft is moved northward. Beneath
the ridge, the air mass over parts of the Desert Southwest should be
quite hot, though a backdoor front is expected to move westward over
parts of NM. As moisture increases higher RH recoveries and the
potential for isolated thunderstorms should increase over the
southern Rockies/High Plains. A few high-based storms may produce
sporadic dry lightning, though the overlap with the most receptive
fuels is expected to be poor. The increasing moisture along with
much weaker winds should limit the potential for dry and breezy
conditions over much of the Desert Southwest. Isolated pockets of
10-15 mph surface winds and RH below 15% are possible over the
higher terrain in western NM and eastern AZ but, coverage and
duration of any elevated fire-weather conditions appears limited.

SUMMARY...Clusters of thunderstorms may continue to slowly

the region accompanied by strong to, perhaps, occasionally severe
gusts.  While the overall severe threat still appears generally
marginal in nature, trends are being monitored and it might not be
out of the question that a severe weather watch could become
necessary for at least a portion of the area.

DISCUSSION...Convection has been slowly intensifying on the leading
edge of the convectively generated cold pool which trails a compact,
but well-defined mesoscale convective vortex currently migrating
east-northeastward through northern Indiana.  This appears to be
embedded within 30+ kt west-southwesterly deep-layer mean flow, near
the base of negatively tilted large-scale mid-level trough forecast
to continue slowly pivoting toward the lower Great Lakes region, and
through the Ohio Valley, into this afternoon.

A seasonably moist boundary-layer, including mid 60s to near 70F
surface dew points, is destabilizing to the east and south of the
convective outflow, and, as updraft inflow becomes characterized by
increasing CAPE, there appears potential for further intensification
of this convective cluster as it approaches the western Lake Erie
vicinity.  The trailing outflow has become quasi-stationary
southwestward and westward into central Illinois, where new
thunderstorm development appears to be occurring to the north of
Salem.  This appears supported by an area of favorable enhanced
mid/upper forcing for ascent, and the downstream environment appears
conducive to similar intensification and organization which has
occurred with the lead cluster.  

With continuing thunderstorm intensification, and modest further
steepening of low-level rates in advance of the convection with
continuing insolation, the potential for strong to widely scattered
severe surface gusts seems likely to increase through 17-19Z.  While
most peak gusts might remain near or below 50 kts, some might become
locally damaging.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FOR MN/WI...LOWER MI/IN/OH...NORTHERN
VA/MD...SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ME...AND FROM SOUTH CENTRAL TX TO
SOUTHERN MS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong storms are possible across portions of the Upper Midwest,
Great Lakes, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Texas Coastal Plain to the
southern Mississippi.

...MN/WI to the Mid-Atlantic this afternoon/evening...
Gradual pattern amplification is underway, with rising heights over
the Rockies and a deepening, downstream trough from MB to the upper
Great Lakes.  A primary shortwave trough will dig southeastward from
ND to WI by tonight, accompanied by cool midlevel temperatures and
steep lapse rates below the 500 mb pressure level.  Surface heating
and lingering boundary-layer moisture will contribute to
weak-moderate buoyancy in an environment with sufficient westerly
deep-layer shear/hodograph length for scattered, low-topped cells to
produce isolated wind damage and marginally severe hail this
afternoon across MN/WI.

Farther east, a lead shortwave trough will move generally eastward
from IA/WI toward Lower MI and northwest OH by this afternoon. An
associated, weak surface trough/cold front will accompany the
midlevel trough into the OH Valley, which will help focus
thunderstorm development this afternoon.  Pockets of surface heating
will boost afternoon temperatures to near 80 F with boundary-layer
dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s, which will support MLCAPE up to 1000
J/kg.  However, deep-layer vertical shear will remain rather modest
(effective bulk shear 20-30 kt) along with poor midlevel lapse rates
around 6 C/km, which suggests that isolated wind damage with
multicell clusters will be the main threat.

Remnant, convectively enhanced midlevel troughs will move
east-northeastward from WV and AL, coincident with the diurnal
heating cycle near and east of the Appalachians.  Widely scattered
storm clusters will be possible this afternoon from GA into the
western Carolinas, but poor lapse rates and weak vertical shear will
limit any severe threat.  Though lapse rates will be similarly poor
into the Mid-Atlantic, there will be a zone of stronger low-level
shear/hodograph curvature across northern VA/MD in advance of the
MCV approaching from WV.  Here, a few weakly rotating storms could
produce isolated wind damage and a brief/weak tornado.

...TX/LA today...
An overnight MCS continues to move southeastward into east TX and
LA, though weak vertical shear has led to a cold pool dominated
system with the deeper convection trailing well north of gust front.
This MCS will likely continue to the northwest Gulf coast by late
morning and offshore by early afternoon.  There will be some
potential for isolated strong/damaging outflow gusts, especially if
there is any temporary/diurnal strengthening of the storms. 
However, the overall environment and convective structure suggest
that any wind threat should remain marginal.  A few storms may
develop farther west this afternoon/evening along the trailing
outflow boundary in the area around DRT.  Large CAPE/steep lapse
rates will support both strong updrafts and downdrafts, though weak
vertical shear will generally limit storm longevity and the
magnitude of any hail/wind threat. 

...ME/NH this afternoon...
Downstream of shortwave ridging in the midlevels, a weak northwest
flow regime will persist today over northern New England.  Lingering
low-level moisture, surface heating in cloud breaks southeast of the
higher terrain, and very subtle midlevel vorticity maxima will
support a few thunderstorms this afternoon across southern/eastern
ME and part of NH.  MLCAPE of 1000-1500 J/kg and effective bulk
shear near 25 kt (with longer hodographs aloft) will be sufficient
for semi-organized storms capable of producing isolated wind damage
and marginally severe hail for a few hours this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1165
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0455 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Areas affected...Southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 391...

Valid 042155Z - 042330Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 391
continues.

SUMMARY...A few damaging wind gusts up to 60-65 mph and localized
instances of marginally severe hail near 0.75-1.25" in diameter may
continue to accompany a linear complex of thunderstorms through this
evening.

DISCUSSION...Latest radar and satellite imagery show an MCS
progressing east-southeastward across portions of southern LA and
southern MS. A moderately unstable air mass remains in place ahead
of this system, where diurnal heating has resulted in surface
temperatures climbing into the upper 80s and 90s, with dewpoints
generally in the mid 70s. Recent trends from the POE VAD profiler
indicate westerly 0-3 km shear has increased to around 50 kt over
the past 30 minutes behind the system. This may support an
increasing opportunity for bowing segments, and damaging wind gusts,
oriented north-south on the eastern flank of the complex, and a
general eastward progression into south-central/southeastern MS over
the next 1-2 hours. In addition, brief instances of marginally
severe hail will be possible within any of the more robust updrafts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1164
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0413 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 042113Z - 042315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Rapid thunderstorm initiation is expected within the next
1-2 hours across portions of central Oklahoma. Large hail up to
1.50-2.50" in diameter, wind gusts exceeding 65-75 mph, and perhaps
a tornado or two are expected.

DISCUSSION...Latest visible satellite imagery trends indicate air
mass modification is continuing across north central and central OK
late this afternoon. A developing cumulus field is apparent near a
mesolow just north of I-40 and Clinton, OK. A surface trough and
dryline extend southward from this low into portions of southwestern
OK. An axis of extreme instability has developed within
southeasterly surface winds on the western edge of a residual cold
pool from earlier this morning. As destabilization continues, and
cooler mid-level temps accompany a mid-level trough slowly
progressing eastward over the northern half of OK early this
evening, rapid thunderstorm development is expected near the surface
low and convergence zones.

Although very modest mid to upper flow should limit persistent,
discrete storm organization, a few transient discrete supercells
will remain possible via veering and increasing flow within the
lowest 4 km of the troposphere. In addition, very large CAPE and
steep lapse rates (~8.5 C/km) within the hail growth zone could
support large hail with any of the discrete cells. Furthermore,
localized enhanced 0-1 km SRH is expected near and south of I-40
where surface 10-15 kt winds will likely remained backed increasing
the potential for a tornado or two before storms begin to build
upscale later this evening. Severe, damaging winds will become more
likely by this time. A severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
soon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 390
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 PM CDT Tue Jun 4 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Northeast Kansas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 225 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...A broken band of thunderstorms will probably continue to
pose a risk for large hail and severe gusts across parts of central
Kansas through the afternoon.  As this activity moves east, a severe
threat will possibly move into northeast portions of Kansas. 
Additional isolated thunderstorms over south-central Kansas may
develop later this afternoon into the evening and yield a threat for
large hail and severe gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 60 miles north of
Manhattan KS to 10 miles southwest of Wichita KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A band of developing thunderstorms will continue to
intensify this afternoon.  The stronger storms will potentially be
capable of strong to severe gusts (55-65 mph) and large hail.  This
activity will spread from west to east across the Watch area through
the late afternoon and early evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 40
statute miles east and west of a line from 15 miles west northwest
of International Falls MN to 30 miles east of Redwood Falls MN. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
22025.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Valid 061200Z - 121200Z

An upper-level ridge will settle over the western CONUS as
northwesterly flow aloft becomes established across the eastern
CONUS through the remainder of the week into this weekend.
Thereafter, medium range guidance depicts a gradual breakdown of the
upper-level ridge into early next week, with perhaps a mid-level
trough developing over the southern Plains at the end of the period
(Day 8/Tuesday). The evolution of the aforementioned upper-air
pattern will support multiple rounds of potential meaningful
rainfall at several locales east of the Rockies, dampening fuel
receptiveness to wildfire spread in the process. However, prolonged
warm and dry conditions are expected from portions of the Lower
Colorado River Basin into the Great Basin. Medium range guidance
agreement on stronger surface winds overlapping the expected lower
RH is not overly strong, so no Critical probabilities have been
delineated this outlook. However, the prolonged dry conditions,
along with the lack of appreciable rainfall accumulations, should
support the continued curing of fuels over portions of the Interior
West.
