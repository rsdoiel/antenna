Mesoscale Discussion 1228
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Areas affected...eastern Ohio...western Pennsylvania...far West
Virginia...far southwestern New York

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 401...

Valid 092051Z - 092145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 401
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe threat continues within WW401.

DISCUSSION...Several broken segments of multi-cell clusters continue
across WW401. A few instances of wind damage have been reported
across northern PA and southern OH. A few cells have initiated out
head of the main clusters but have struggle to maintain intensity.
Ahead of the line, temperatures continue to warm, with MLCAPE around
500 J/kg slowly advecting northward across New York state. As
forcing for ascent continues to increase with the approaching wave,
thunderstorm coverage will continue to increase. Damaging wind and
severe hail continue to be a possibility with stronger cells.

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 245 PM until
  1000 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase across the
region this afternoon and evening, with multiple rounds of storms
possible. Bowing line segments capable of damaging gusts are the
primary risk, but isolated hail may occur as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles east northeast
of Jamestown NY to 35 miles south southeast of Parkersburg WV. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline

## Hurricane Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 7

WTPZ42 KNHC 092032

Hurricane Barbara Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Since the last advisory Barbara has become a little less organized. 
Latest GOES satellite imagery depicts the system starting to ingest 
some drier air which has caused fragmented banding. However, a 
central dense overcast has remained over the tiny inner core. The 
satellite intensity estimates have decreased slightly from the 
previous advisory ranging from 50 to 65 kt. Using these estimates, 
the intensity is held at 65 kt, although this may be generous.

A mid-level ridge located over Mexico should continue to steer the 
system northwestward over the next couple of days. As Barbara begins 
to weaken into a shallow vortex and slow down, it will be steered by 
the low-level wind flow. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to 
the previous one, and close to the simple and corrected consensus.
 
Barbara likely has peaked as a short-lived hurricane. The 
environmental conditions will becoming increasingly hostile along 
the forecast track with the storm crossing into cooler SSTs and into 
a drier, more stable air mass. This will cause the system to 
steadily weaken, lose convective organization, and become post 
tropical by 36 h. The latest NHC forecast shows the system opening 
into a trough by 60 h and dissipating.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 6

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Cosme continues to intensify and is nearing hurricane strength.
Visible satellite images show that the convective bands have
consolidated near the center, and there is some evidence of a
partial inner core. A blend of the latest objective and subjective
satellite intensity estimates support increasing the initial
intensity to 60 kt. A partial ASCAT pass indicates that the
wind field of Cosme is quite compact, and the initial wind radii
have been updated based on that data.
 
Some additional strengthening is possible in the short term, and
Cosme could become a hurricane tonight while it remains in 
generally conducive environmental conditions. However, the 
combination of decreasing SSTs and intrusions of dry/stable air
should end the strengthening trend by early Tuesday and then cause a
quick weakening. Simulated satellite images from the GFS and ECMWF
models show deep convection vanishing by Wednesday, and based on
that guidance, the transition to a remnant low has been moved up to
48 hours. Dissipation is likely to occur in 3 to 4 days.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at 8 kt, and this general motion
should continue through tonight. After that time, a turn to the
north or north-northeast is expected as Cosme moves toward a
weakness left behind by Hurricane Barbara to its northeast.  The
NHC track forecast is in fair agreement with the consensus aids.

At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cosme was
located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 113.9 West. Cosme is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue through tonight. A turn
toward the north with a decease in forward speed is expected by
early Tuesday, followed by a faster north-northeast motion late
Tuesday through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast, and
Cosme could become a hurricane tonight. Rapid weakening is expected 
late Tuesday and Wednesday. Cosme will likely become a 
post-tropical low in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 092000Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
GULF COAST STATES INTO THE SOUTHEAST...PARTS OF THE TN/OH
VALLEYS...LOWER MI...AND THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorm development appears probable
today across parts of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, over Lower
Michigan, from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Southeast, and
over the southern High Plains.

...20Z Update...
The Slight Risk in the southern High Plains was expanded
southeastward and southwestward, given the potential for splitting
supercells along a surface boundary into this evening. Large to very
large hail will be possible with this activity. Additionally, storms
moving southeastward out of southeast NM could grow upscale across
this same corridor during the overnight hours, posing a risk of
scattered severe wind gusts. Farther east, the Slight Risk was
trimmed over parts of the Mid-South -- behind eastward-moving storms
ahead of the cold front. Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track.

..Weinman.. 06/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1127 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025/

...Southeast TX into the Southeast...
Morning observations and satellite/radar imagery reveals a complex
pattern across TX and Southeast as a result of extensive overnight
convection. Satellite imagery shows the vorticity maximum from the
overnight storms in TX is over the AR/LA vicinity, with the
associated outflow extending from southeast TX through south TX.
Overnight storms also developed over central MS and southern AL,
with the resulting MCV now in the central MS/AL border vicinity. All
of these features will likely provide the impetus for thunderstorm
development today, but the unfocused nature of the overall pattern
leads to larger-than-usual uncertain for Day 1. 

Current expectation is for redevelopment over MS behind the MCV over
southern LA/MS/AL as the MCV over AR/LA moves into the region later
this afternoon. Given the combination of buoyancy and shear, this
area appears to have the greater chance for severe than areas
farther west across TX, where capping could limit coverage, or
downstream across the GA/Carolinas where destabilization will likely
be more limited. Damaging gusts are the primary risk across the
entire region via both water-loaded downbursts and bowing line
segments. Some isolated hail and a brief tornado or two are also
possible.

...TN/OH Valleys...
Recent surface analysis places a surface low over the AR/TN/MO
border intersection, with a weak cold front extending northeastward
from this low to another low over western Lake Ontario. Moderate
low-level moisture (i.e. dewpoints around 62-64 deg F) exists ahead
of this front. General expectation is for thunderstorm development
along and ahead of this front as it moves eastward and downstream
airmass diurnally destabilizes. Two areas within this broader zone
that appear to have a relatively greater severe potential are across
middle TN, where the ongoing storms could become loosely organized
into a forward-propagating line, and across eastern OH/western PA,
where stronger shear and greater forcing for ascent could result in
bowing line segments.

...Lower MI...
Strong heating is anticipated across Lower MI today, resulting in a
deeply mixed boundary layer. Shortwave trough rotating through the
base of the larger upper low centered over WI is expected to move
into the region this afternoon, interacting with this deeply mixed
and destabilized boundary layer to support thunderstorm development.
Some stronger low/mid-level flow will accompany this shortwave as
well, and the overall setup appears favorable for line segments
capable of damaging gusts. Severe coverage is expected to be high
enough to merit upgrading to 15% wind probabilities across southern
Lower MI.

...Southern High Plains...
Low-level moisture will continue to advect northwestward into west
TX and eastern NM today, with mid to upper 60s dewpoints across west
TX and low to mid 60s dewpoints in eastern NM by this evening. This
moisture advection and resulting buoyancy will provide a favorable
environment for storms to persist as the move off the higher terrain
this evening. Upscale growth into a southeastward-progressing
convective line appears probable, with this line moving across
east-central/southeast NM and into west TX. Strong to severe gusts
are possible within this line.

Additionally, a few storms are possible along and north of the
modified outflow boundary this evening. Steep lapse rates, ample
low-level moisture, and a unidirectional mid to upper-level westerly
wind profile with increasing speed with height will support the
potential for large to very large hail with these storms.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Northwest and Great Basin...
Flow aloft will continue to increase over the Cascades and western
Great Basin D2/Tuesday. As the winds aloft increase, warm
temperatures and lee troughing will support gusty downslope winds of
15-25 mph through the afternoon. Continued drying of area fuels and
RH reaching below 20% should support several hours of Elevated
fire-weather conditions from the Cascades down to the lee of the
northern Sierras. An Elevated area has been added for the lee of the
Cascades where drier fuels and stronger sustained winds are likely
to overlap for several hours. 

Additionally, scattered thunderstorms are possible over parts of
southern OR and western ID late D2/Tuesday into D3/Wednesday. Some
wetting rainfall is expected, but lightning may still occur away
from the heavier cores. Some potential for dry lightning exists as
storms interact with drier fuels over the southern Cascades. However
with only minimal overlap and the potential for wetting rainfall
over area fuels, confidence in dry storm coverage remains too low
for IsodryT highlights at this time.

...Southwest...
Scattered thunderstorms are again expected across parts of the
Southwest and southern  Great Basin Tuesday. Increasing storm
coverage and deeper moisture suggest a wetter storm mode is likely
with the potential for wetting rainfall. However, an occasional
drier storm with lightning may occur on the periphery from
southwestern NM into eastern AZ where fuels could support some
ignition potential.

..Lyons.. 06/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will de-amplify while ejecting into the Atlantic,
while a mid-level ridge overspreads the central CONUS and a second,
low-amplitude mid-level trough impinges on the West Coast tomorrow
(Tuesday). Similar to Day 1, dry air will linger over the Southwest,
but with a weak surface wind field. Stronger flow aloft with the
West Coast trough will overspread the Cascades, promoting locally
dry and windy conditions amid drying fuels. Given the spatially
confined nature of these conditions, fire weather highlights have
been withheld.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE UPPER
MIDWEST...PARTS OF TEXAS...AND THE GREAT BASIN/NORTHERN ROCKIES...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible Wednesday over parts of
the Northwest and Intermountain West, the Corn Belt, and Texas.

...Northwest/Intermountain West...
Latest guidance continues to depict a low-amplitude shortwave trough
transitioning east-northeastward across the northern Great Basin on
Wednesday, reaching Wyoming Wednesday night. A belt of enhanced
mid-level westerlies will likely accompany this feature, with the
strongest winds aloft currently expected to be located over southern
Idaho and northern Utah around peak heating. Boundary-layer moisture
will remain modest, contributing to mainly weak buoyancy. Scattered
thunderstorms are likely Wednesday afternoon with a broad region of
at least low-probability severe wind/hail potential across parts of
Idaho/Utah into Montana/Wyoming.

...Upper Midwest/Corn Belt...
On the southern fringe of moderately strong low-amplitude
westerlies, a west/east-oriented baroclinic zone is expected to
strengthen by Wednesday afternoon as richer low-level moisture
advects northward toward the region. A related and somewhat confined
corridor of moderate surface-based buoyancy may develop south of the
front, but will quickly weaken in the cooler/drier stable air mass
to the north. Overall setup could support isolated severe hail/wind
within a confined corridor centered from Wednesday late afternoon
into evening.

...Southern/central Texas...
A low-confidence forecast persists with some severe-weather
potential as a weak slow-moving upper low drifts across Texas, with
other uncertainties related to Tuesday's convection and effective
boundary placement. Will maintain a low-probability severe risk
mainly across the southern to central parts of Texas where pockets
of greater destabilization, coincident with modest deep-layer shear,
may be realized.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1236 PM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHEAST
NEW MEXICO AND FAR WEST/SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
The most likely corridor for severe storms on Tuesday, primarily in
the form of large hail, is across far southeast New Mexico and the
Texas Trans-Pecos during the late afternoon through early evening.
Isolated severe thunderstorms are also possible on Tuesday into
Tuesday evening along parts of the East Coast, from southeast New
Mexico to south Louisiana, and in parts of the Northwest.

...Southeast NM and Far West/Southwest TX...
Strong heating is anticipated over the region Tuesday along the
western periphery of seasonably rich low-level moisture in vicinity
of a front and weak surface wave. Combined with steep mid-level
lapse rates, large buoyancy with MLCAPE of 2500-3000 J/kg is
expected. An upstream low-amplitude shortwave trough near/north of
the International Border will approach the region during the
afternoon. In combination with diurnal orographic ascent, scattered
to eventually widespread thunderstorm development is anticipated. A
narrow belt of moderate mid-level westerlies, centered on the
Trans-Pecos, should support a few supercells in the late afternoon.
Large hail will likely be the primary hazard. Some degree of upscale
growth may occur by evening toward the Rio Grande vicinity, with at
least some severe hail/wind persisting east-southeastward.

...South-central TX to south LA...
It still seems that a loosely-organized MCS may be ongoing in
central TX at 12Z Tuesday. Within a weakly forced and nebulous
large-scale pattern, guidance has a fair amount of spread with
subsequent evolution through the day Tuesday. It is plausible that
intensification may occur by midday along the residual outflow,
along with downstream development towards a quasi-stationary front
into LA. Deep-layer shear will be modest, especially outside of any
localized enhancement near the remnant MCV. Confidence remains too
low to warrant greater than level 1-MRGL risk probabilities at this
time, but isolated severe wind/hail remains possible.

...Mid/South Atlantic Coast...
A broad mid/upper trough will extend from eastern Ontario to the
OH/TN Valleys at 12Z Tuesday. The southern extent of this trough
will gradually dampen through the period with slowly rising
mid-level heights. A broad rain swath with embedded thunderstorms is
expected to be ongoing from the Mid-Atlantic northward, where
stronger deep-layer flow will exist. Diurnal destabilization appears
quite limited and locally strong gusts might occur along the
southern periphery of this morning activity.

Isolated thunderstorms are possible into the afternoon along parts
of the South Atlantic Coastal Plain. Despite ample boundary-layer
moisture/heating, poor mid-level lapse rates will limit updraft
intensity and overall convective coverage. Locally strong gusts
capable of wind damage will be possible with any sustained storms.
Coverage is likely to be less compared to recent days. 

...Northwest and Northern Rockies...
Low-amplitude mid/upper ridging will break down as a shortwave
trough progresses into northern CA/southwest OR by 12Z Wednesday. As
this occurs, mid to upper-level flow will become more westerly with
moderate speed shear across the northern Rockies. Despite weak
buoyancy, scattered high-based thunderstorms are expected. The
strongest of these may attain low-end supercell structure from
western to south-central MT during the late afternoon to early
evening. Across southern OR, strengthening large-scale ascent with
approach of the shortwave trough should support scattered late
afternoon to evening storms. High-based multicells to a couple brief
supercells are possible. Isolated, marginally severe wind/hail
events may occur in both regimes.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...17z Update Cascade Gaps...
Increasing westerly flow aloft is forecast to move over the Cascades
and western Columbia Basin later today and into tonight. As flow
aloft strengthens, westerly downslope winds and lee troughing will
encourage downslope wind gusts of 15-25 mph through the Cascade Gaps
and Gorge. These gusty wind may overlap with areas of moderate to
low RH (30-40%) through the afternoon. While live area fuels are not
overly dry, some localized fire-weather risk is possible this
afternoon into tonight. Winds will remain gusty overnight, though
increasing humidity and light rain chances should temper the threat.

...Southwest...
A backdoor cold front moving over eastern NM will help transport
moderate mid-level and surface moisture west into the higher
terrain. Weak ascent from a subtle southern stream trough under the
ridge and upslope flow should support isolated to scattered
thunderstorms this afternoon. Model profiles show dry sub-cloud
layers particularly over western/southwestern NM and southeastern
AZ, which should favor relatively poor precipitation efficiency.
While these storms are likely to be drier, the overlap of the best
storm coverage should remain over areas that have seen significant
rainfall over the last week. Still, occasional dry lightning strikes
are possible on the fringes of the deeper moisture with the drier
storms atop the more receptive fuels.

..Lyons.. 06/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will progress across the eastern U.S. while upper
ridging continues to build over the CONUS west of the Rockies today.
Scattered to widespread showers and thunderstorms, along with rich
low-level moisture, will overspread much of the CONUS east of the
Rockies, limiting major wildfire-spread concerns. West of the
Rockies, warm and dry conditions will become common, though the lack
of a stronger surface wind field should limit robust wildfire-spread
conditions. Dry northwesterly surface flow behind a cold front will
overspread the central and northern High Plains during the
afternoon, but the lack of more receptive fuels precludes fire
weather highlights this outlook.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1127 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 091630Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
OVER PORTIONS OF THE GULF COAST STATES INTO SOUTHEAST...OVER
PORTIONS OF THE TN/OH VALLEYS AND SOUTHERN LOWER MI...AND OVER THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorm development appears probable
today across parts of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, over Lower MI,
from lower Mississippi Valley into Southeast, and over the southern
High Plains.

...Southeast TX into the Southeast...
Morning observations and satellite/radar imagery reveals a complex
pattern across TX and Southeast as a result of extensive overnight
convection. Satellite imagery shows the vorticity maximum from the
overnight storms in TX is over the AR/LA vicinity, with the
associated outflow extending from southeast TX through south TX.
Overnight storms also developed over central MS and southern AL,
with the resulting MCV now in the central MS/AL border vicinity. All
of these features will likely provide the impetus for thunderstorm
development today, but the unfocused nature of the overall pattern
leads to larger-than-usual uncertain for Day 1. 

Current expectation is for redevelopment over MS behind the MCV over
southern LA/MS/AL as the MCV over AR/LA moves into the region later
this afternoon. Given the combination of buoyancy and shear, this
area appears to have the greater chance for severe than areas
farther west across TX, where capping could limit coverage, or
downstream across the GA/Carolinas where destabilization will likely
be more limited. Damaging gusts are the primary risk across the
entire region via both water-loaded downbursts and bowing line
segments. Some isolated hail and a brief tornado or two are also
possible.

...TN/OH Valleys...
Recent surface analysis places a surface low over the AR/TN/MO
border intersection, with a weak cold front extending northeastward
from this low to another low over western Lake Ontario. Moderate
low-level moisture (i.e. dewpoints around 62-64 deg F) exists ahead
of this front. General expectation is for thunderstorm development
along and ahead of this front as it moves eastward and downstream
airmass diurnally destabilizes. Two areas within this broader zone
that appear to have a relatively greater severe potential are across
middle TN, where the ongoing storms could become loosely organized
into a forward-propagating line, and across eastern OH/western PA,
where stronger shear and greater forcing for ascent could result in
bowing line segments.

...Lower MI...
Strong heating is anticipated across Lower MI today, resulting in a
deeply mixed boundary layer. Shortwave trough rotating through the
base of the larger upper low centered over WI is expected to move
into the region this afternoon, interacting with this deeply mixed
and destabilized boundary layer to support thunderstorm development.
Some stronger low/mid-level flow will accompany this shortwave as
well, and the overall setup appears favorable for line segments
capable of damaging gusts. Severe coverage is expected to be high
enough to merit upgrading to 15% wind probabilities across southern
Lower MI.

...Southern High Plains...
Low-level moisture will continue to advect northwestward into west
TX and eastern NM today, with mid to upper 60s dewpoints across west
TX and low to mid 60s dewpoints in eastern NM by this evening. This
moisture advection and resulting buoyancy will provide a favorable
environment for storms to persist as the move off the higher terrain
this evening. Upscale growth into a southeastward-progressing
convective line appears probable, with this line moving across
east-central/southeast NM and into west TX. Strong to severe gusts
are possible within this line.

Additionally, a few storms are possible along and north of the
modified outflow boundary this evening. Steep lapse rates, ample
low-level moisture, and a unidirectional mid to upper-level westerly
wind profile with increasing speed with height will support the
potential for large to very large hail with these storms.

  A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts up to 80-100 mph, and
  large to very large hail remain likely across parts of the
  southern Plains this evening and overnight. The greatest threat
  for significant severe winds should focus across north Texas and
  southern Oklahoma.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio,
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A watch
means that conditions are favorable for severe thunderstorms
over the next several hours. If a severe thunderstorm warning is
issued for your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in an 
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
OVER PORTIONS OF THE GULF COAST STATES...SOUTHEAST...TN/OH
VALLEYS...AND OVER NORTHEAST NM...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorm development appears probable
today, particularly across parts of the Ohio Valley into
Appalachians, and east of the lower Mississippi Valley into eastern
Gulf Coast states.

No changes have been made to the ongoing forecast.

...Southeast States...
An upper low is centered this morning over MN/WI, with broad
cyclonic flow across much of the eastern US.  Several ongoing
clusters of thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across from east
TX into GA, with a risk of occasional gusty winds.  A few hours of
sunshine may be sufficient for intensification of one or more of
these clusters, with damaging wind being the main concern.

...TN/OH Valleys...
A similar regime is present this morning along a cold front from
northwest OH into IL.  Scattered strong thunderstorms may develop
anywhere along the front from central PA into southeast MO.  Forcing
is weak so most storms will remain somewhat disorganized.  However,
the strongest storms will pose a risk of locally damaging wind
gusts.

...NM...
Ample low-level moisture has advected westward into
southern/east-central NM.  This combined with strong daytime heating
will encourage thunderstorm development over the mountains by mid
afternoon.  Storms will spread into the adjacent Plains by early
evening.  Mid level winds will be only marginally favorable for a
few organized/rotating cells capable of hail and gusty winds.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 121200Z - 171200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Guidance remains supportive of a more active pattern across the
northern High Plains to the Upper Midwest. GEFS-based ML guidance
from SPC and NSSL depict mesoscale areas of 15 percent
probabilities, centered on eastern MT to the Dakotas. While
predictability for a specific day remains too low, the signal exists
for increasing potential during the weekend to early next week.

The initial low-amplitude shortwave trough over WY/eastern MT at 12Z
Thursday is progged to dampen as it moves east into the Upper
Midwest. An area-of-interest is evident over western SD and the NE
Panhandle on D4/Thursday afternoon, but a favorable buoyancy/shear
combination is too spatially confined for a 15 percent highlight.

A broad swath of moderate to strong mid-level southwesterlies may
persist for multiple days across the Northwest, downstream of a
large-scale trough near the West Coast. At the same time, the
expansive buoyancy plume over the central states should increase
northwestward, building higher CAPE into the northern High Plains
this weekend. Still, poor predictability persists with the
spatiotemporal details of individual shortwave impulses that may
support daily severe threats on D6-8/Saturday-Monday.

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 5

TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Barbara has become a bit better organized over the past 6 hours 
with a large central dense overcast and an increasing area of 
cloud tops in the -75C to -85C range.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 46-68 kt.  
Based on the improved banding and cold cloud tops, as well as the 
persistence of this organization, the initial intensity is 
increased to 60 kt for this advisory.

There is some uncertainty in the initial position since there have 
been no recent available microwave passes, but the best motion 
estimate is west-northwestward, or 295 degrees at 10 kt.  The 
global models show a strong 500 mb ridge to the north of Barbara, 
which should help maintain Barbara on a general path toward the 
west-northwest for the next few days.  The GFS model continues 
to be the fastest and farthest left model.  The GFS appears to 
have a more realistic solution compared to the ECMWF, and was 
stronger at the initialization time.  The new NHC forecast is 
slightly faster and a bit to the left of the previous official 
forecast and is in fairly good agreement with an average of the 
simple and corrected consensus models.

Barbara only has about 12 more hours to strengthen before it starts 
moving into cooler waters.  This should be enough time for Barbara 
to strengthen to a hurricane.  The cooler water should cause 
weakening to begin tonight or on Tuesday.  The dynamical hurricane 
models and global models all show Barbara weakening below tropical 
storm strength by 48 hours, and the cyclone is likely to lose its 
convection and become a remnant low around that time.  The new NHC 
forecast shows a faster weakening and quicker dissipation than the 
previous official forecast since the dynamical guidance is now in 
good agreement on this scenario.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 4

TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Cosme has continued to gradually 
improve since the previous advisory, with sustained deep convection 
holding over the low-level center. A timely 09/0524Z ASCAT pass 
helped with the initial intensity and 34 kt wind radii estimates, 
with several wind barbs showing 40 to 45 knot winds. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 
knots and T2.5/35 knots respectively. Meanwhile, the objective 
Dvorak satellite estimates range from 40 to 50 knots. The initial 
intensity has been adjusted up to 45 knots with this advisory 
package, in line with the most recent ASCAT pass.

Cosme is moving toward west-northwest at 8 kt. This general motion 
is expected to continue during the next 24 hours to the south of a 
mid-level ridge, with a gradual slowing in forward speed. Tonight 
and Tuesday Barbara is forecast to erode the mid-level ridge to the 
north of Cosme, resulting in a further slowing in motion and a shift 
to the north. An increase in forward speed and a motion to the 
north-northeast is expected Tuesday night, with Cosme forecast to 
become a post-tropical remnant low on Wednesday. The latest track 
forecast is very close to that of the previous advisory and is 
generally a blend of the consensus guidance.

Environmental conditions continue to look conducive for 
strengthening of Cosme during the next 24 hours or so. Vertical wind 
shear will lighten up some while the system passes over 27/28C water 
with abundant deep layer moisture. The intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous advisory, bringing Cosme close to hurricane strength 
late today or tonight. Beyond 24 hours, vertical wind shear is 
forecast to increase and mid-level moisture is forecast to decrease, 
which should lead to a gradual weakening of Cosme. A more rapid 
weakening is then expected by Wednesday as the system moves over 
much cooler water, with Cosme expected to dissipate by 96 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1205
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Colorado and New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082050Z - 082245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development has been ongoing across the
Front Range in Colorado and across northeastern New Mexico. The air
mass across Colorado remains under the influence of MLCIN, with
temperatures cooling with northern extend behind the surface cold
front. Moisture is also somewhat limited, with dew points in the
upper 40s to 50s. A few instances of severe hail will be possible.

Across eastern New Mexico near the dryline, a gradient of more
appreciable MLCAPE 500-1500 j/kg is in place along with deep layer
shear around 30-45 kts. Temperatures are in the mid 70s to 80s amid
dew points in the 50s to upper 60s. This may support some instances
of severe wind and hail, with at least one supercell noted on radar.
Trends will be monitored for watch potential, but it appears
unlikely at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1204
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northern/central VA and MD

Concerning...Tornado Watch 392...

Valid 082031Z - 082200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 392 continues.

SUMMARY...A risk for tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will persist
into early evening across northern/central Virginia, and portions of
Maryland.

DISCUSSION...Isolated storms are ongoing closer to a surface
boundary across eastern VA, and further west across the higher
terrain of central VA. These storms will continue to shift east
across a moderately unstable airmass and within 30-40 kt effective
shear. A surface boundary extending from northern VA southeast into
southeast VA will continue to support a corridor of enhanced
low-level shear supporting storm rotation. A couple tornadoes and
damaging gusts will remain possible over the next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1203
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082030Z - 082230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat may increase through the
afternoon/early evening.

DISCUSSION...Supercells have developed across the Davis Mountains in
far western Texas this afternoon. The environment in this region is
characterized by MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg, steep lapse rates, and
deep layer shear around 40-45 kts. This will support potential for
supercells to produce some instances of large to very large hail and
severe winds. MLCIN does increase with eastward extent, which may
limit coverage/duration of this threat. This area will be monitored
for watch potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwestern and north-central
Texas...southwestern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 082017Z - 082215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail/tornado threat to increase through the
afternoon before a more significant wind threat emerges.

DISCUSSION...Supercell thunderstorms are ongoing across portions of
the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles as of this hour, with at least one
tornado reported in Cimarron/Dallam counties. Additional development
is ongoing west of Amarillo. It is likely some mix of supercell
clusters will advance south and eastward through time, with
potential for additional development to occur ahead of the dryline
in New Mexico.

Low-level shear improves with southward extent into Lubbock where
surface winds are backed southeasterly improving low-level curvature
of hodographs and streamwise vorticity. It is likely that as storms
develop and move southward, the tornado threat will increase through
time even with the shifting storm mode.

A sharp gradient of extreme MLCAPE exists along the Red River near
the Texas/Oklahoma border into north-central Texas amid steep low to
mid-level lapse rates. As upscale growth increases, the potential
will rapidly increase for destructive winds (80-100 mph). A Tornado
or PDS Severe Watch is likely needed to cover this potential.

  Western North Texas and Low Rolling Plains

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 400 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

...THIS IS A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION...

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and scattered significant gusts to 105
    mph likely
  Widespread large hail likely with isolated very large hail
    events to 5 inches in diameter possible
  A few tornadoes likely

SUMMARY...Increasing intense severe storm development is expected
through late afternoon into evening. This will include initial
supercells capable of very large hail with a tornado risk, but a
prominent potential for widespread damaging winds should evolve this
evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles north and south of a line from 10 miles northwest of
Lubbock TX to 40 miles southeast of Chickasha OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 3

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Barbara this 
afternoon, with cold cloud tops near -75 C. However, a dry slot in 
the eastern semi-circle looks to have slightly disrupted the 
convective organization. Subjective and objective intensity 
estimates range from 45-55 kt this cycle. Using a blend of satellite 
estimates and the latest imagery the intensity is held at 50 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Barbara is currently within a favorable environment with warm SSTs 
and low vertical wind shear. Strengthening is forecast over the next 
day or so, and Barbara is forecast to become a hurricane overnight. 
After 24 h, the system will be moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures below 26C and into a drier mid-level environment. These 
factors will cause the storm to weaken and eventually struggle to 
produce convection. Latest model IR simulated satellite imagery 
shows the system losing convection by 72 h.  This suggests that 
it will become a a post-tropical remnant low by that time and 
likely dissipate  by day 5 although that could occur sooner than 
currently forecast.
 
Barbara is moving west-northwestward at 295/10, steered by 
a mid-level ridge over Mexico, and this motion should continue over 
the next couple of days. The NHC forecast was nudged slightly 
rightward and lies just left of the the simple and corrected 
consensus aids.  Given the forecast track and wind radii, 
tropical-storm-force winds are not expected to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. By Tuesday, the track forecast becomes 
more complicated given the potential interaction between Barbara and 
Cosme. The GFS and ECMWF are on opposite ends of the guidance 
envelope.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 2

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection has been increasing near the center and in curved
bands on the western side of the circulation during the past
several hours. An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago showed peak
winds in the 35-40 kt range, and based on that data, the depression
has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Cosme with the initial
intensity set at 40 kt.
 
Cosme will likely continue to strengthen for the next day or two as
it remains in an environment of low to moderate wind shear, abundant
moisture, and over warm SSTs. The NHC intensity forecast shows a
peak of 60 kt at 24 and 36 hours, and it wouldn't be surprising if
Cosme becomes a hurricane during that time frame. By mid-week,
however, the storm is expected to move over progressively cooler
waters and into a drier airmass, which should cause the system to
begin weakening. Cosme is now forecast to become a remnant low in 3
days and dissipate in 4 days.

The storm is moving northwestward at 7 kt, and that general motion 
is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  After that 
time, the interaction with Barbara will likely result in an initial 
slow down and then turn to the northeast. There is a fair amount of 
spread in the guidance due to the complexity of this interaction.  
The NHC track forecast has been adjusted a little to the right of 
the previous one to account for the initial motion/position and to 
be in better agreement with the latest consensus aids.

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized in 
association with an area of low pressure located offshore of 
southwestern Mexico. A small, persistent area of deep convection has 
been observed in satellite images tonight, and recent scatterometer 
data confirm this has led to the formation of a well-defined, closed 
low-level circulation. Therefore, the NHC is starting advisories on 
Tropical Storm Barbara with an initial intensity of 40 kt based on 
the earlier scatterometer winds.

Barbara is currently within a moist and relatively low shear 
environment over warm waters. So, strengthening is expected during 
the next day or so, and this could occur quickly given recent 
satellite trends and the small size of the storm. The official NHC 
forecast shows Barbara becoming a hurricane in 24 h, which is 
supported by HAFS-A/B and the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA). The 
window for strengthening is brief, as Barbara is forecast to move 
over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment by 48 h. 
This should disrupt the convective structure of the storm and result 
in weakening. By day 5, the remnant low of Barbara is forecast to 
either dissipate or become absorbed by the circulation of EP91.

Barbara is moving west-northwestward (295/10 kt) on the south side 
of a mid-level ridge, and this motion should continue over the next 
couple of days. For this time period, the NHC forecast generally 
lies near or between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Given 
the forecast track and wind radii, tropical-storm-force winds 
are not expected to affect the southwestern coast of Mexico. By 
Tuesday, the track forecast becomes more complicated given the 
potential for binary interaction between Barbara and another 
disturbance (EP91) with a high chance of formation. Because of this, 
the long-range track forecast could be subject to larger future 
adjustments depending on the evolution of EP91.

MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was 
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 102.4 West. Barbara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. A turn 
toward the west at a slower forward speed is anticipated on Tuesday.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is 
forecast during the next day or so, and Barbara is forecast to 
become a hurricane on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with localized amounts
up to 6 inches, are possible across portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through Monday. This
rainfall may lead to areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
