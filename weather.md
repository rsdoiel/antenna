Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0731 AM CDT Thu Oct 17 2024

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a highly amplified yet progressive pattern will
persist through the period, as a strong, synoptic-scale ridge shifts
eastward over the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi/Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys.  Upstream, a strong trough now near the coastal Pacific
Northwest will dig southeastward across interior parts of the West
Coast States today into this evening, and much of the western Great
Basin/Intermountain regions overnight.  By 12Z, a 500-mb low should
form over eastern NV, along a trough extending from the northern
Rockies to the lower Colorado River Valley.  As that occurs, a
weaker, shortwave trough -- evident in moisture-channel imagery near
the NV/UT and CA/AZ borders, should eject northeastward over the
central Rockies and central/northern High Plains, while weakening. 
By the end of the period, broadly cyclonic flow will cover most of
the western CONUS.

Ahead of the strengthening main (Pacific Northwest) trough, height
falls and areas of DCVA/cooling aloft are forecast.  Those will
overlie a southeastward-surging low-level cold front across the
Intermountain region, and support isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorm potential over a vast swath of the West, either side of
the front.  Meager but sufficient low/midlevel moisture -- mostly
with distant/indirect origins in the subtropical gulfs either side
of northern Mexico -- will support this convection.  Strong gusts
may accompany some of the afternoon and early evening activity
along/ahead of the cold front across northern parts of NV/UT, amidst
strengthening deep shear.  However, overall moisture/buoyancy appear
too meager to outline an unconditional severe area at this time.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-10-17, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CDT Thu Oct 17 2024

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
As a surface low settles into the Southwest, strong southerly flow
will continue across the Central and Southern Plains. This low-level
flow will advect moisture northward which will eliminate most of the
fire weather concern across the Plains. 

Very strong mid-level flow will overspread the Southwest as a
compact upper-level cyclone slides east-southeast. Sustained winds
of 30+ mph are likely beneath the strongest mid-level flow. Fuels
across Arizona and New Mexico are not critically dry and therefore,
no fire weather concerns have been highlighted at this time. 

However, dry fuels are present across California where some Elevated
fire weather conditions are likely within the Central Valley,
Coastal Ranges of the central and northern portions of the state,
and in terrain favored areas of southern California. In addition to
the strong winds Friday afternoon, the Santa Ana winds will likely
strengthen again 06-12Z Saturday. This will occur as the LAX-TPH
gradient strengthens to near 10-12 mb as diurnal cooling, and high
pressure in the Great Basin strengthens the pressure gradient across
southern California.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1107 AM CDT Wed Oct 16 2024

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...Great Basin...
A weak upper trough and pockets of residual mid-level moisture will
result in scattered showers and thunderstorms across much of the
Great Basin today.  Model guidance suggests a weak mid-level speed
max moving across the Four Corners region into western CO.  Steep
low and mid level lapse rates could aid in locally gusty winds in
the strongest cells.  No organized severe storms are expected.

Other thunderstorms will occur beneath an upper trough affecting the
Pacific Northwest states.  Finally, a few thunderstorms are possible
in a warm/moist air mass present across south TX and south FL.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-10-15, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0459 PM CDT Tue Oct 15 2024

Valid 171200Z - 231200Z

A large-scale trough will amplify over the western CONUS on Days
3-4/Thursday-Friday, before evolving into a closed midlevel low over
the Four Corners region into Day 6/Saturday. Ahead of the trough,
strong deep-layer south-southwesterly flow will overspread the Great
Plains on Day 3/Thursday, while the surface pressure gradient
tightens between a deepening lee trough over the High Plains and
expansive surface anticyclone over the eastern CONUS.

...Day 3/Thursday - Northern/Central Plains...
The tightening pressure gradient and shallow boundary-layer mixing
into the strong deep-layer flow will favor an expansive area of
strong/gusty southerly surface winds across the Great Plains and
Upper/Middle MS Valley. While the degree of boundary-layer
heating/mixing and related RH reductions are uncertain (especially
with northward extent), confidence in at least 25-percent RH
overlapping the strong/gusty winds is high enough to introduce a
70-percent Critical area. 

...Day 4/Friday - Northern/Central California...
On the backside of the amplified large-scale trough, strong
deep-layer northerly flow will develop across California on Day
4/Friday -- where a relatively warm/dry air mass will be in place.
This will promote elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions.
