## Tropical Storm Bud Forecast Discussion Number 5

Tropical Storm Bud Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022024
800 AM PDT Thu Jul 25 2024

Since the time of the special advisory issued earlier this morning, 
the organization of Bud on satellite imagery has not changed much.  
The moderate easterly shear that had been affecting the cyclone 
appears to have diminished slightly.  This has allowed the 
low-level center to be located underneath the central convective 
area.  The latest subjective intensity estimate from TAFB is 45 kt, 
while some of the University of Wisconsin-CIMSS objective estimates 
have also been around 45 kt.  Given the 49-kt surface observation 
from Isla Clarion at 0930 UTC this morning, the initial intensity is 
held at 50 kt for this advisory.

There have not been any significant changes to the general synoptic 
steering pattern.  A low- to mid-level ridge located to the north 
of Bud will steer the cyclone generally westward at a similar 
forward speed for the next 24 h.  As the cyclone weakens and 
becomes shallower, it should turn towards the west-southwest and 
decelerate.  The guidance has shifted notably north and faster with 
this cycle.  The new NHC track forecast is adjusted about midway 
between the previous NHC forecast and the latest consensus track 
aids.

As for the intensity forecast, Bud should be traversing sea-surface 
temperatures of around 26.5-27C over the next day or two, which is 
slightly cooler than the 28C waters that Bud is over currently.  
The vertical wind shear should be relatively low over the next 
couple of days.  Bud will be gradually moving into a slightly drier 
airmass.  The latest dynamical and hurricane intensity models weaken 
Bud more quickly than the statistical intensity guidance, and the 
NHC forecast splits the difference and is close to the intensity 
consensus.  This new NHC intensity forecast is higher than the 
previous one and keeps Bud a tropical storm a bit longer.  Given 
that the global models show Bud becoming a remnant low rather 
quickly despite relatively favorable environmental conditions, the 
intensity forecast confidence is a bit lower than average during the 
first 48 h of the forecast.  After that time, confidence is higher 
that the cyclone will be significantly weakening.

0742 AM CDT Thu Jul 25 2024

Valid 251300Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to locally severe thunderstorms with wind gusts will be
possible today across Montana and the northern Rockies/Great Basin,
southern Arizona, and Carolinas/Mid-Atlantic States.

...Montana/Northern Rockies to Great Basin...
A prominent upper-level trough will spread eastward from British
Columbia toward Alberta/Saskatchewan, with strengthening cyclonic
westerlies overspreading the northern Rockies/Montana. Scattered
thunderstorm development is forecast to initiate off the higher
terrain this afternoon, and in advance of a cold front, across
central Montana, where a hot and deeply mixed boundary layer may
become characterized by modest instability. Forecast soundings are
suggestive of 40-60 F temperature-dew point spreads by peak heating.
A downward mixing of 30-40+ kt ambient southwesterly to westerly
flow in the 700-500 mb layer may contribute to severe-caliber wind
gusts in consolidating outflows, as convection spreads eastward into
this evening toward eastern Montana and possibly western North
Dakota.

Other high-based storms capable of severe-caliber wind gusts could
occur as far southwest as parts of the Great Basin later this
afternoon and evening, within an unstable air mass ahead of a front
across the northern Intermountain region.

...Arizona...
Lingering early day outflow/cloud cover via yesterday's relatively
active convection should generally abate by afternoon. As the
boundary layer diurnally warms and destabilizes, thunderstorms are
again likely to initiate across the Mogollon Rim and adjacent
mountains of southwest New Mexico this afternoon. Given the position
and movement of the mid-level high, somewhat stronger (around 15 kt)
northeasterly steering flow will remain focused across southeast
into adjacent portions of central Arizona. Localized severe-caliber
wind gusts and blowing dust will again be possible this afternoon
through early/mid-evening as storms progress south-southwestward
onto the desert floor.

...Carolinas/Mid-Atlantic States...
Cloud cover will likely remain prevalent regionally today with
showers/some thunderstorms ongoing this morning to the south of the
primary front that will be shifting south-southeastward across the
northern and central Appalachians. Near the southern periphery of
the larger-scale mid-level troughing, a belt of 30-40 kt
south-southwesterly flow in the 850-500 mb layer may enhance
convective development within a plume of seasonably high moisture
content. While lapse rates and overall buoyancy will be modest,
heavy precipitation loading and downward mixing of momentum may
contribute to a few strong downdrafts with the possibility of
locally damaging surface gusts/tree damage this afternoon.

...Middle/Upper Texas Coast and Southern Louisiana...
Extensive showers and some thunderstorms are ongoing along the Texas
coast early today. Influenced by a weak mid-level disturbance, some
guidance suggests that a strengthening of low-level winds/shear will
occur today. However, mid-level winds will remain weak, while the
aforementioned convection should considerably limit destabilization
inland. These factors seem likely to minimize the potential for
anything beyond a few very weak/transient mesocyclones.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CDT Thu Jul 25 2024

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level shortwave trough moves onshore to the California
coast and into Nevada tomorrow, isolated dry thunderstorms are
expected across northern Utah into southeastern Idaho and
southwestern Wyoming. Elevated fire-weather conditions are also
expected across portions of the Northwest, including northern
California into southwestern Oregon, western portions of the Upper
Snake River Region in Idaho, and far northern Montana. 

...Northern Utah into Southern Idaho and Southwestern Wyoming...
Isolated dry thunderstorms are expected as a mid-level trough and
associated jet streak approaches the California coast. Hot, dry
boundary-layer profiles, coupled with 35-40 kt mean wind speed
estimates for storm motions, will result in little wetting rainfall
occurring over receptive fuels. A mix of dry and wet thunderstorms
are possible further into Wyoming, but fuels in the region are less
receptive to ignitions. There may be a chance for isolated dry
thunderstorms in far southern Montana, but the threat appears to be
too localized to include a highlight area at this time. 

...Northwest... 
Elevated fire-weather conditions will persist across portions of
southern Oregon and into northwestern California with the
approaching trough. The strongest winds will likely be confined to
the Fremont mountains and Modoc Plateau. Portions of northern
Montana could also see elevated fire-weather conditions on Friday,
where prolonged dry and windy conditions will overlap with receptive
fuels as a mid-level jet extending from Saskatchewan into Montana
begins to exit the region and progress eastward. The most pronounced
region for elevated conditions is expected to be across portions of
the Snake River Plain and into the Upper Snake Region, where there
is significant overlap between 20-25 kt surface winds, < 15% RH, and
receptive fuels.

Mesoscale Discussion 1704
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0531 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Areas affected...Southern Arizona

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 559...

Valid 242231Z - 250000Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 559
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across WW 559, primarily for
severe wind gusts from thunderstorm outflow.

DISCUSSION...The severe thunderstorm threat continues for WW 559
across southern Arizona, where daytime heating has resulted in
surface temperatures rising into the 110s F. With surface dewpoints
in the lower-to-mid 60s F, MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/kg across
southwest portions of the watch area will continue to support
thunderstorm development in the short term. Proximity sounding
profiles show deeply mixed boundary layers with large saturation
deficits, and very-weak to weak deep layer shear, supporting the
threat for severe wind gusts from thunderstorm outflow. 

The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts is currently
confined to southern portions of the watch, where buoyancy is
maximized and thunderstorms are ongoing. This threat will continue
as storms move southwest towards the Mexican border, but should
diminish after dark.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-07-24, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

Fire weather concerns will focus in parts of the Great Basin and
northern Rockies late this week into the weekend. Thereafter, fire
weather concerns will become more localized given an amplifying
upper ridge in part of the western/central U.S. and a benign surface
pattern where fuels remain driest.

...Wind/RH Concerns...
While the main shortwave trough will exit Montana into the Canadian
Prairie, some moderately strong mid-level winds will linger across
Montana and Idaho. Farther south, the compact tropical disturbance
will move into the Great Basin. A few locations may see elevated
fire weather on Friday. The highest confidence is in Northeast
California into adjacent Nevada/Oregon as well as the Snake River
Plain and parts of northwest Montana.

On Saturday, the shortwave trough in the Great Basin will be losing
amplitude, but a enhanced mid-level winds will remain in the
southern Basin. Strong surface winds are possible during the
afternoon. Some area fuels will have been impacted by several days
of convection. However, latest ERC data suggest there are still dry
enough fuels to support fire spread. When coupled with the recent
lightning activity, some potential for holdover fires to increase in
activity is possible with the stronger winds/low RH expected.

For Sunday and beyond, the upper-level pattern will feature a
building ridge centered along the Divide. Dry conditions are
probable in many places within the West, but winds will generally be
lighter outside of terrain/mesoscale-enhanced areas. Predictability
of critical fire weather is too low for any highlights.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
With the approach of the weak disturbance, a few drier thunderstorms
are possible in parts of central/northern Nevada on Friday. These
storms will generally occur over areas that have had fuel
receptiveness decrease recently. Thunderstorm activity will shift
into eastern Idaho into western Wyoming on Saturday and possibly
Sunday. Fuels are drier in these areas, but moisture may be too
limited and storm coverage is somewhat in question this far in
advance.

With some very broad troughing over the Northwest, some isolated
thunderstorms could occur over some of the terrain features.
Coverage is likely too low for highlights and fuels may moderate
somewhat due to the cooler conditions under the influence of the
upper trough.

## Tropical Storm Bud Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Storm Bud Discussion Number   1

200 PM MST Wed Jul 24 2024
 
Satellite imagery indicates that the disturbance located several 
hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja 
California peninsula has become much better organized over the past 
12 hours or so.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimate 
from TAFB is T-2.0/30 kt, and a pair of recent ASCAT passes shows 
a well-defined cyclone with 35-kt winds.  Based on the ASCAT data 
and the improvement in convective organization observed on GOES-18 
satellite images, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Storm 
Bud.

Bud is currently moving to the west-northwest at 14 kt.  A mid-level 
ridge to the north of Bud will cause a gradual turn to the west over 
the next day.  On Friday, with Bud likely weakening, the cyclone 
should turn to the southwest and decelerate, following the low-level 
flow.

Bud is currently in an environment that appears favorable in terms 
of warm SSTs and a moderately moist environment, but there appears 
to be some easterly shear affecting the cyclone.  Therefore, no 
change in strength is expected during the next day or so,
although some slight intensification cannot be ruled out.  Beyond 
36 h, the cyclone should begin traversing decreasing sea surface 
temperatures, and move into an environment of drier air and 
increasing vertical wind shear.  Therefore, gradual weakening is 
forecast during that time.  The intensity forecast is near 
the middle of the guidance envelope and calls for the cyclone to 
become a remnant low on Friday, and dissipate on Saturday.

## SPC Jul 24, 2024 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

date: 2024-07-24, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 242000Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
WESTERN/CENTRAL NY INTO NORTHWESTERN PA...AND SOUTHERN ARIZONA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms may produce damaging wind gusts
across western/central New York and vicinity, the northern Rockies,
and across southern Arizona this afternoon/evening.

...20z Update...
The current D1 Outlook remains on track with no changes needed with
this update. 

Several clusters of thunderstorms are ongoing along a cold front
extending from the Great Lakes region northeastward into portions of
New York. In this region, daytime heating has yielded around
1000-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE with 30-40 kts of deep layer shear. In this
regime, some more organized cells have produced wind damage across
portions of New York and Pennsylvania. The threat for strong to
severe gusts will continue through the afternoon and evening,
shifting eastward with the front.

Farther west, two areas of potential continue with a Marginal Risk
across the Northern Rockies and a Slight Risk across southern
Arizona. Within these regions, damaging wind will be possible with
thunderstorm activity this afternoon. See MCD #1701 for more
information on the threat across southern Arizona.

..Thornton/Thompson.. 07/24/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024/

...Western/central NY and northwest PA this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel trough will progress eastward from the upper Great Lakes
toward NY as an associated surface cold front likewise moves
eastward into western NY and southeastward into OH/northwest PA
through this evening.  Surface heating is underway in a corridor
ahead of the cold front from northern OH into western NY where
boundary-layer dewpoints are in the mid-upper 60s with surface
temperatures warming into the lower 80s, and a band of convection
has already developed from Lake Erie to western Lake Ontario.  These
storms may persist into the afternoon while spreading eastward, with
additional development possible along convective outflow, a
pre-frontal confluence zone and/or local lake breeze boundaries. 
Midlevel lapse rates will remain modest (roughly 6.5 C/km), but the
low-level moisture/warming temperatures will drive MLCAPE in the
1000-1500 J/kg range.  Deep-layer vertical shear/hodograph length
will be on the lower margins for organized clusters/cells per local
VWPs now sampling 30-40 kt midlevel flow, while steepening low-level
lapse rates will support the potential for occasional wind damage
with strong thunderstorm outflow in the 50-60 mph range.

...Southern AZ this afternoon/evening...
Strong surface heating is underway near and south of the Rim, and
late afternoon temperatures will peak near or above 110 F across the
lower deserts into southern AZ.  Moisture will be sufficient for
thunderstorm development this afternoon along the Rim and the
mountains in southeast AZ, while northeasterly midlevel flow of
15-20 kt will steer outflows southwestward toward the lower deserts.
 MLCAPE will increase to the 1000-1500 J/kg with deep inverted-V
profiles favoring strong downdrafts and outflow winds of 60-75 mph
capable of producing wind damage and substantial blowing dust.  The
relatively greater severe threat will be with the stronger/deeper
convection driven by outflow mergers.

...Northern Rockies area this afternoon/evening...
A plume of mainly midlevel moisture with PW values of 0.75-1 inch
(per BOI and LKN 12z soundings) will persist around the northern
periphery of a midlevel high over the Great Basin, and southeast of
a midlevel trough approaching WA.  High-based thunderstorms are
expected in a few loosely organized clusters within this plume,
where deep inverted-V profiles will support the potential for a few
strong-severe outflow gusts 50-65 mph.

...Mid-Atlantic into NC this afternoon...
Modest surface heating within small cloud breaks and boundary-layer
dewpoints of 72-74 F will contribute MLCAPE approaching 1500 J/kg to
the east of the Blue Ridge, though midlevel lapse rates will remain
poor.  Still, the southern extent of 30-40 kt midlevel flow will
support a low-end wind damage threat with the stronger storm
clusters this afternoon.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-07-23, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0953 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The ongoing forecast remains on track. No changes were made. 

... Northern Rockies ...

Several hours of gusty winds will promote elevated-to-critical fire
weather conditions in and around the Cascade Gaps. A categorical
upgrade to Critical was contemplated with this forecast, but the
spatial extent of the area potentially achieving critical thresholds
is too small and the duration too short to attempt to highlight.
That said, the combination of wind, relative humidity, along with
the potential for new fire starts associated with isolated dry
thunderstorms, may result in an active fire weather day.

Elsewhere, no changes were made to the ongoing forecast.

..Marsh.. 07/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough over the Northwest will remain in place west of
a weakening upper ridge centered across the northern Rockies.
Stronger flow aloft will gradually overspread the Northwest and
northern Rockies through the week. Isolated dry thunderstorms and
gusty downslope winds will promote elevated fire-weather potential
today and tonight.

...Northwest and northern Rockies...
Lingering mid-level moisture ahead of the consolidating Pacific
trough will again support the risk for thunderstorms across the
Northwest and northern Rockies this afternoon and evening. While
weaker than previous days, subtle ascent and diurnal heating over
the terrain should allow for isolated storms to develop across parts
of the northern Great Basin and Northwest by early afternoon. Low
precipitation efficiency, owing to PWATs under 1 inch, and low
surface RH will support the risk for lightning with little to no
wetting rainfall. With area fuels still receptive to ignitions,
IsoDryT probabilities have been maintained.

West/southwest flow aloft is forecast to increase over the northern
Rockies and Cascade Gaps ahead of the trough. This may promote
several hours of gusty downslope winds across parts of eastern ID
and western MT. Model guidance shows surface winds of 15-25 mph
overlapping with RH values below 25%. This, along with the increase
in lightning and numerous ongoing fires, will support the potential
for elevated fire-weather conditions this afternoon.
