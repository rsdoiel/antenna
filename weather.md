Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CST Fri Feb 28 2025

Valid 031200Z - 081200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance suggests that an initially zonal, intense
mid/upper jet across the western into central mid-latitude Pacific
may undergo considerable amplification into and through this period.
It remains a bit unclear how emerging waves will impact the
downstream pattern by the middle to latter portion of next week. 

However, it still appears that one significant preceding short wave
trough, migrating inland of the Pacific coast by early Monday, will
progress into and across the southern Rockies, before accelerating
east-northeastward through mid week.  And guidance remains
suggestive that this will be accompanied by strong surface
cyclogenesis, perhaps most notably across portions of the east
central Great Plains toward the lower Great Lakes region late
Tuesday through Tuesday night.  This may include an evolving warm
sector with intensifying low-level and deep-layer shear (in the
presence of southerly to southwesterly flow strengthening to 50-100
kt in the 850 to 500 mb layer), coincident with an influx of
moistening and destabilizing boundary-layer air off the northwestern
Gulf.  

Spread typical at this extended time frame (day 5) lingers among the
various model output concerning the sub-synoptic, and even synoptic,
details across the southeastern Great Plains through Ohio Valley and
Southeast, which may considerably impact the severe weather risk
area and potential.  However, the medium-range guidance depicts an
environment at least conditionally supportive of an organized severe
weather event, including potential for a few strong tornadoes and
damaging straight line winds.

It is possible, but perhaps a bit more uncertain, that this could
continue across parts of the southern and middle Atlantic Seaboard
on Wednesday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
FAR SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A pronounced mid-level trough will overspread the Lower Colorado
River Basin as a broader upper trough amplifies along the East Coast
tomorrow (Saturday). Surface high pressure will dominate much of the
CONUS east of the Plains states. A surface low will develop over
southern Arizona by tomorrow afternoon, supporting 20+ mph sustained
southerly surface winds amid 10-15 percent RH by afternoon peak
heating, for several hours. Given the continued curing of fuels,
surface meteorological conditions should favor wildfire spread
potential, warranting the introduction of Critical highlights this
outlook.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible this evening mainly over
parts of eastern Louisiana and across Mississippi.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Scattered thunderstorms continue to be most prevalent over the
northern and central Gulf, near the offshore surface low. A few
lightning flashes were noted over parts of northern LA into MS, but
in general, this activity should continue to wane as winds veer with
the passing lead wave aloft.

Elsewhere, a few flashes with weak convection were noted earlier
over southwest OR beneath cool temperatures aloft and in association
with a now departing shortwave trough. A very low chance of thunder
may linger in this area within the residual midlevel moist plume
this evening.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 251200Z - 031200Z

Fire weather potential will remain limited across the country
through much of the upcoming work week, though some fire concerns
may emerge across the southern High Plains beginning D6/Friday and
into the following weekend. A broad northwesterly flow regime aloft
is expected to persist for much of the upcoming week amid
persistent, and unseasonably strong, ridging across the western
CONUS. This regime will continue to promote dry conditions from the
southern Great Basin into the Four Corners and southern/central
Plains. Additionally, a return to unseasonably warm temperatures is
anticipated, which will support gradual fuel drying and an expansion
of elevated (80+ percentile) ERC values out of far West Texas and
into the southern Plains/Southwest. The passage of weak upper
disturbances across the northern latitudes will promote widespread,
but light, rain/snow chances and an influx of cooler continental air
for northern portions of the country, but could augment regional
pressure gradient winds across the southern High Plains where fuels
should be most receptive. This potential appears most prominent
around D6/Friday when most solutions suggest southwest winds could
approach critical thresholds within a dry downslope flow regime,
though deterministic/ensemble spread remains high at this range. A
transition to a more progressive upper-air regime is anticipated
heading into early March, which could signal an increase in fire
weather potential for parts of the Southwest and Plains as more
robust surface cyclones become probable across the southern U.S.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected across the CONUS on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
After an upper-level trough moves of the eastern Florida coast,
generally quasi-zonal flow will prevail across the CONUS. Two
shortwaves, one in central/northern Rockies and the other in
Mid-Atlantic, will have little in terms of moisture to work with.
Thunderstorm potential with these features will be quite low. Very
isolated thunderstorm activity could linger into early Tuesday
morning in Florida, but the departing shortwave/surface low will not
synoptically favor coverage at or above 10%.

0117 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms should continue across portions of Louisiana and
immediate surrounding areas today. Additional isolated thunderstorms
may still occur in portions of Oregon/Washington. No severe weather
is expected.

...20Z Update...
The primary change made to the 20Z Day 1 Convective Outlook was to
trim western portions of the general thunder delineation over
Coastal TX. Low-level moisture advection and associated buoyancy is
translating east along the Gulf Coast in tandem with a mid-level
trough. As such, additional lightning flashes are most likely across
portions of LA into central/southern MS and adjacent waters. A few
lightning flashes still remain possible across portions of the
Pacific Northwest with the approach of a mid-level trough.

..Squitieri.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1012 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...TX/LA...
A prominent shortwave trough is tracking eastward across TX today,
providing lift and destabilization to parts of southeast TX and LA. 
Scattered thunderstorms have been occurring in this region through
the morning, but should slowly shift offshore by later this
afternoon as the upper system passes.  While small hail could occur
with the strongest onshore storms, no severe weather is anticipated.


...WA/OR...
Recent water vapor loop shows a strong shortwave trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest coast.  As this system approaches,
strengthening onshore flow and cold temperatures aloft will increase
the risk of at least isolated thunderstorms - mainly this evening.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A few thunderstorms are possible across South Florida and coastal
Oregon/Washington on Monday. No severe thunderstorms are expected.

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level shortwave trough will move into the Northwest
Monday afternoon/evening. A broad upper-level trough in the Gulf
will sharpen as it approaches South Florida Monday evening. A
nebulous surface low in the Gulf will accompany the upper trough.
Diffuse surface boundaries in the eastern Gulf and South Florida
will be the focus for thunderstorm activity.

...South Florida/Keys...
A cluster of thunderstorms appears likely to be ongoing early Monday
off the southwestern Florida coast and perhaps near the Keys. This
activity will likely be east of the surface cold front and driven by
weak low-level warm advection. Current forecast guidance suggests
the greatest buoyancy will remain primarily over the Keys. Given the
stronger southwesterly flow aloft, it is possible a stronger storm
or two could develop. However, deep-layer shear will be parallel to
this activity, mid-level height falls will be neutral until late in
the period, and low-level wind fields will be rather weak. The
overall potential for even marginally severe storms continues to be
low. As stronger forcing arrives late, additional activity is
possible along the surface front in western Florida. However, it is
not clear if storms would be surface based or if buoyancy would be
sufficient for a severe threat.

...Northwest...
Strong wind fields will be in place across the region as a surface
low deepens west of the Olympic Peninsula. A line of at least
shallow, forced convection will impact portions of coastal
Washington/Oregon. A few stronger convectively enhanced wind gusts
are possible among the already strong synoptic flow. These gusts are
most likely along the immediate coast. Given minimal buoyancy, it
appears coverage of these convective gusts will be too isolated to
warrant highlights.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1001 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

An Elevated risk area has been introduced for portions of far West
Texas and central to southern New Mexico. Morning surface
observations show very dry conditions in place (dewpoints in the
single digits to low teens) with a very dry residual mixed layer
above a shallow nocturnal inversion sampled in the 12z EPZ sounding.
Winds increasing to around 15 mph should coincide with RH minimums
in the low to mid teens per recent ensemble guidance, which has
trended towards higher probabilities of sustained elevated fire
weather conditions over a region with slowly increasing ERCs (which
currently sit at around the 80-90th percentile). Forecast concerns
regarding portions of WY and NE remain on track as outlined in the
previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
Warm and dry downslope winds are forecast in the lee of the
Sacramento and Sandia Manzano mountains of eastern New Mexico, with
winds up to 20 MPH and relative humidity values dropping below 15%.
Across portions of eastern Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle,
winds could reach as high as 25-30 MPH with relative humidity below
20%. However, current ERC fuels guidance across both regions
suggests there is little support for wildfire ignition and spread,
especially with some recent wetting rainfall across portions of
Wyoming and Nebraska in the last 5 days. Given the lack of
supportive fuels, no fire-weather highlights will be introduced at
this time.
