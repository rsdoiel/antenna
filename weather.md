Mesoscale Discussion 0438
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...Central/southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072047Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in convection may be sustained along the
deeper wind shift/cold front, but severe storms appear unlikely.

DISCUSSION...West of the pre-frontal convection, a recent increase
in updraft depth/intensity has occurred across central GA.  This
deepening convection appears to be along the deeper wind shift, with
a band of ascent impinging on residual moisture in the wake of
earlier convection.  However, the prior convection cooled surface
temperatures, lapse rates are poor, and vertical shear has
weakened/become more unidirectional with time, and shear vectors are
primarily parallel to the line orientation.  Thus, the storms are
expected to remain largely sub-severe, and an additional watch or
watch extension appears unnecessary.

Mesoscale Discussion 0437
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of NC SC and southern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134...

Valid 072035Z - 072130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat continues across WW134, primarily
with the band of storms moving over eastern NC and southern VA.
However, additional storms remain possible farther south.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar imagery shows an
organized linear cluster of thunderstorms ongoing from far
southeastern VA into eastern NC. Over the last 2 hours, several
reports of wind damage, and measured severe gusts have been reported
with the line segment across parts of VA and NC. This appears likely
to continue to the coast as the line segment moves east-northeast at
50 kt.

Farther south, lingering cloud cover has resulted in only isolated
weak convection and showers across parts of SC. Some recent CA
guidance suggests a few stronger cells may eventually emerge closer
to the coast where heating has been more pronounced. A damaging wind
gusts threat could evolve with any deeper connective cells that
become established in the next couple of hours as the primary cold
front continues to shift east.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Increasing mid-level westerly flow across the Intermountain West
will promote leeward cyclone development across the central High
Plains through D2/Tuesday. As a result, enhanced downslope winds are
expected from the west-northwest of 15-25 mph within a dry air mass
across portions of southeastern Wyoming, northeastern Colorado and
western Nebraska. Recent guidance from land management agencies
indicate some fuels are still in place for fire spread so elevated
highlights were introduced. Similarly dry southwest flow of 15-25
mph across portions of west Texas are expected but fuels dryness
remains subdued owing to recent widespread, wetting rains.

..Moore/Williams.. 04/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1213 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
The upper-air pattern will transition toward more zonal flow
tomorrow (Tuesday) as surface high pressure overspreads the eastern
U.S. and a surface cyclone develops over the central Plains.
Isallobaric flow from the cyclone, along with downslope flow, will
support Elevated-equivalent surface conditions along portions of the
central and southern High Plains Tuesday afternoon. Despite the
presence of such dry and breezy conditions, fuel receptiveness is
expected to be quite marginal given recent wetting rainfall,
precluding fire weather highlights this outlook.

Valid 072000Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THIS
EVENING FROM NORTH FLORIDA TO EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms are expected this afternoon across parts of
northern Florida and southeastern Georgia to the eastern Carolinas.

...North FL to eastern NC the remainder of the afternoon...
The earlier supercell structures have largely weakened across north
FL/southeast GA, though newer bowing segments have formed and are
moving across eastern NC with recent severe gusts of 60-64 mph. 
Forcing for ascent is modest well downstream of a positive-tilt
midlevel trough over the lower MS Valley, and the ongoing convection
is ahead of the surface cold front.  Sufficient buoyancy (MLCAPE of
500-1000 J/kg) and steep low-level lapse rates will help maintain
the ongoing storms for the remainder of the afternoon from north FL
to eastern NC.  Damaging gusts (60-70 mph) will be the main threat
with bowing segments with more north-south oriented segments in the
primarily unidirectional wind profiles, though a couple of tornadoes
remain possible before the severe threat diminishes this evening.

..Thompson.. 04/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1125 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025/

...Northern Florida and southern/eastern Georgia to Carolinas...
The region will be influenced by an upstream positive-tilt trough
with strong deep-layer flow extending into the warm sector across
the Southeast, where a moderately moist airmass resides beneath
relatively poor lapse rates aloft. Preceding a
northeastward-transitioning sub-synoptic low, a
northeast/southwest-oriented broken line/cluster of storms exists
across east-central Georgia to south-central/southwest Georgia and
the eastern Florida Panhandle as of midday. Multiple radar TDSs have
recently (mid/late morning) been observed in southwest Georgia and
the eastern Florida Panhandle within Tornado Watch 133.

A moist air mass exists ahead of these storms with near 70F
dewpoints across northern Florida into Georgia, and 60s F dewpoints
into the Carolinas coincident with ample heating/insolation
especially for coastal areas. Some additional strengthening of
already strong (45+ kt) southwesterly winds in the 1-3km AGL layer,
oriented largely parallel to the ongoing convective line, will
continue to support embedded supercells and bows capable of
tornadoes and damaging winds through the afternoon, with the overall
potential expected to diminish by around sunset.

Deeper convection is also expected to expand north/northeastward
along the front as it moves into the Carolina Piedmont. A linear
convective mode is expected with damaging gusts as the primary
severe risk. The strength of the low-level flow suggests some
tornado potential will also exist.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0212 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are possible across portions of the the Middle
Mississippi Valley and northern High Plains, though severe storms
are not expected.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
On Wednesday, an upper trough will dive southeastward from the
northern Plains into the mid MS/OH Valleys, as an upper high builds
over the West. High pressure will exist behind an exiting
northeastern trough, and ahead of the Plains trough. As such, this
system will interact with very limited moisture and instability.

A plume of low-level lapse rates/heating will develop late in the
day from KS into MO, toward an area of low pressure. This low will
travel east toward IN by 12Z Thursday, with a strong cold front
extending south into LA and MS by that time.

Though only weakly unstable, thunderstorms are expected over parts
of the mid MS Valley to the lower OH Valley. Forecast soundings
depict a few hundred J/kg MUCAPE, with relatively dry sub-cloud
layers and strong shear. While strong gusts cannot be ruled out with
some of the convection, the overall threat appears low.

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong storms may occur over far southern Florida and the
Keys late Tuesday and into the overnight hours, and from southeast
Montana to Black Hills.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A low-latitude shortwave trough will move east across the Gulf while
a front sinks south across far southern FL. Modest heating may yield
MUCAPE around 1000 J/kg over far southern FL, supporting daytime
storms near and north of the front. Midlevel temperatures/lapse
rates do not appear particularly favorable for hail. Ahead of the
upper wave, 850 mb flow will average 20-25 kt, with most of the
stronger winds above 500 mb. As such, severe gusts from
boundary-layer mixing appear unlikely. Small/non-severe hail or
locally strong gusts will be possible.

Overnight, as the upper trough and leading midlevel speed max
approach the FL Peninsula, a minimal increase in lift may result in
increased storm coverage near the Keys and from the FL Straits into
the Bahamas.

Elsewhere, afternoon and evening thunderstorms are likely from
southeast MT/northeast WY into western SD late. Here, very steep
lapse rates and a progressive/low-amplitude wave will favor storms
forming near the Billings vicinity with scattered cells producing
small/sub-severe hail and locally gusty winds.

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. Gusty southwest
winds across central Florida are still expected ahead of a cold
front through this afternoon across portions of the central and
southern Florida Peninsula. Several days of preceding dry and warm
conditions have allowed somewhat more receptive fuels for wildfire
spread.

..Moore/Williams.. 04/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1156 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify along the East Coast as upper
ridging builds in over the Southwest, supporting a cold front moving
offshore as surface lee troughing develops along the High Plains.
Across the Florida Peninsula, the passage of the cold front will
support 15 mph sustained westerly surface winds as RH drops to 35-45
percent during the afternoon. Elevated highlights have been
maintained in this region given the presence of fuels receptive to
wildfire spread.

Mesoscale Discussion 0433
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn through e cntrl GA...wrn and cntrl SC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071240Z - 071445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...At least low probabilities for an additional tornado or
two and/or locally damaging surface gusts continues in scattered
thunderstorm activity overspread the region through 10-11 AM EDT. 
It is still not clear that a severe weather watch is needed in the
near term, but trends will continue to be monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer instability, characterized by
CAPE near or above 1000 J/kg, still remains confined to a narrow
pre-frontal corridor across the western Florida Panhandle through
southwestern into southern portions of central GA.  However, some
cooling loft appears to be contributing to at least weak
destabilization north-northeastward toward the South Carolina
Piedmont.

The front, with a couple of weak waves along it, will continue a
slow eastward progression through mid to late morning, with the
Rapid Refresh indicating that a moderate south-southwesterly
low-level jet (in excess of 40 kt around 850 mb) will maintain
sizable, clockwise-curved low-level hodographs within the
instability axis.

Cloud cover spreading downstream of the stronger ongoing convective
development probably will slow boundary-layer destabilization, and
it is not certain that there will be a substantive further increase
in thunderstorm intensities in the near term.  However, the MCV,
which apparently recently contributed to a tornado south-southwest
of the Greater Atlanta area, continues east-northeastward toward the
South Carolina Piedmont, and it not clear that the downstream
environment will not support an additional relatively short-lived
tornado or two.  Farther south, in the corridor of better
instability, focused along the low-level jet axis near/north and
east of the Albany into Macon vicinities, there may also be
continuing potential for short-lived intensification of
meso-vortices embedded with the ongoing narrow band of convection.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Valid 071300Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
NORTH FLORIDA...SOUTHEAST GEORGIA...AND THE CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered storms, some severe, are possible today across parts of
northern Florida, southeast Georgia, and the Carolinas.

...Synopsis...
Positively titled upper troughing currently extends from Ontario
through central Mexico, with a shortwave trough embedded within this
larger trough from the Ozark Plateau through central Mexico. Strong
mid-level flow exists throughout the eastern periphery of the parent
troughing, with a jet max of 90+ kt at 500 mb extending from the
Mid-South into New England. 

Current surface pattern features a low near the northern TN/NC
border intersection, with another weaker low farther south near the
ATL vicinity. A modest cold front extends between these two lows,
becoming a bit more defined south of the second low due to outflow
augmentation from the ongoing storms. A warm front also extend
eastward from the northern low across southern VA. 

The southern shortwave trough is forecast to progress eastward
throughout the day, moving across the Lower MS Valley and Southeast
states before losing amplitude amid the more confluent flow across
the Carolinas. The primary surface low is expected to move
east-northeastward, with the cold front making steady eastward
progress. 

...North Florida/Southeast Georgia/Carolinas...
Airmass downstream of the ongoing convective line is currently
characterized by mostly mid 60s dewpoints, although some low 70s
exists across far southwest GA and the central FL Panhandle. This
low-level moisture is supporting modest buoyancy, despite poor lapse
rates. Some strengthening of the storms within the line has been
noted over the past hour as it interacts with a narrow corridor of
70s dewpoints across far southwest GA and the central FL Panhandle.
Bowing segments and embedded rotation has been observed briefly as
updraft intensity modulates. Given that these higher dewpoints exist
in a relatively narrow corridor, the threat for damaging gusts
and/or brief tornadoes is expected to remain short-lived this
morning.

Modest buoyancy is expected downstream of the cold front throughout
the day, with daytime heating helping to maintain this buoyancy
farther eastward into southeast GA and southern SC where lower
dewpoints are anticipated. In addition to this buoyancy, large-scale
forcing for ascent is expected to strengthen as well, both from the
approaching shortwave trough and favorable proximity within the
right entrance region of the strengthening mid-level flow. Moderate
to strong low-level southwesterly flow will persist throughout the
day.

All of these factors suggest the ongoing convective line should be
maintained as it moves eastward throughout the day, with some
additional strengthening and organization possible, particularly if
daytime heating does not overly mix the boundary layer. Deeper
convection is expected to expand northward along the front moves
into the Carolina Piedmont. A linear mode will likely be maintained,
with damaging gusts as the primary severe risk. The strength of the
low-level flow suggest some tornado potential exists as well.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Valid 101200Z - 151200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Days 4-5/Thursday-Friday...
A positively tilted large-scale trough will move slowly
east-southeastward across the Mid MS and OH Valleys on Day
4/Thursday. Ahead of the trough, partially modified Gulf moisture
will be returning ahead of a related front moving across the Lower
MS Valley. Thunderstorms are expected ahead of the front across
parts of the OH/TN Valleys, where weak buoyancy and strong midlevel
westerly flow will support an isolated severe-storm risk. However,
the limited low-level moisture and weak/veered low-level flow should
limit storm intensity. By Day 5/Friday, the midlevel trough will
take on a neutral tilt as it moves slowly eastward and amplifies
across the Appalachians. Preceding the trough, strong
south-southwesterly midlevel flow will overspread the partially
modified Gulf air mass over the coastal Mid-Atlantic -- where
isolated severe storms will be possible ahead of a related surface
front. Similar to Day 4/Thursday, the overall threat appears too
marginal for severe probabilities at this time.

...Days 7-8/Sunday-Monday...
A midlevel trough and strong west-southwesterly flow will overspread
the northern/central Plains on Day 7/Sunday, and continue across the
Midwest/Great Lakes on Day 8/Monday. In response, boundary-layer
moisture will return northward ahead of a related lee trough across
the southern and central Plains on Day 7/Sunday, though a strong EML
should limit thunderstorm potential. By Day 8/Monday, guidance
varies considerably on the evolution of the midlevel trough and
related warm sector, limiting confidence in overall severe-storm
potential.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 132
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1000 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern and Eastern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle
  Western and Northern Georgia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and evening from 1000 AM until
  600 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Severe storm potential, including a few supercells ahead
of a convective line, may increase into the afternoon across the
region, with the strongest storms posing a tornado risk aside from
damaging winds.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 25 miles north of Atlanta GA to 50
miles east of Mobile AL. For a complete depiction of the watch see
the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 131...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0428
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern AL...southwest/central GA...into
the western FL Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 132...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 132 continues.

SUMMARY...Several bands of strong to severe storms will remain
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes. Some local
extensions of WW132 may be needed, but the downstream threat appears
more limited.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar observations indicate a
band of convection across southeastern AL and west-central GA
continues to show embedded supercell and bowing structures capable
of damaging gusts and tornadoes. This should continue for a couple
more hours as storms approach the eastern edge of the Tornado Watch
132. Areal extensions of a few counties may be needed as storms
begin to outrun the watch. As storms continue farther east, a
gradual decrease in buoyancy should favor weakening into the evening
hours. Until then, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain
possible.

To the southwest, a second smaller band of convection across
southern AL will likely maintain intensity for a few more hours this
afternoon. A few more isolated cells have also developed farther
east within the warm sector across southwest GA and the northern FL
Panhandle. 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 40+ kt of effective shear
could support a continued severe threat into this evening. This
matches with some hi-res guidance that shows a gradual expansion of
strong storms into southwest GA and possibly northern FL. However,
forcing for ascent is some what nebulous and storm coverage has
remained more isolated thus far. With storms approaching the
southeast corner of WW132 in the next few hours, some consideration
may be given to a small downstream watch. However the extent of the
severe risk and need for any new watches is currently unclear.

0734 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern MS through cntrl AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 131...

Valid 061234Z - 061430Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 131 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection may continue to undergo further organization
and intensification through 9-10 AM CDT, accompanied by increasing
risk for strong surface gusts, and a continuing risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...At least a bit broader, lower/mid-tropospheric cyclonic
circulation appears to be evolving, perhaps including a surface
meso-low now migrating east-northeastward into/across the Demopolis
AL vicinity.  Latest Rapid Refresh now indicates a more prominent
south-southwesterly speed maximum associated with this feature,
including 50+ kt in the 850-700 mb layer.  Although moisture
characterized by mid 60s+ surface dew points across central Alabama,
between Montgomery and Birmingham still appear to supporting only
modest CAPE (around 500 J/kg sampled in 12Z BMX sounding), low-level
moisture advection and at least some boundary layer warming are
likely to contribute to further destabilization in advance of the
convection during the next few hours.  Inflow of this air mass may
be sufficient to support at least a gradual further intensification
of activity during the next few hours, accompanied by increasing
potential for strong surface gusts and a few tornadoes. 

Discrete thunderstorm development is also being maintained near/just
ahead of the southern flank of the evolving convective system, and
the occasional intensification of these cells, before merging into
the line, may also be accompanied by increasing potential for a
tornado near the Selma/Montgomery vicinities through mid morning.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southwest Alabama
  Northwest Georgia
  Far Southeast Mississippi

* Effective this Sunday morning from 245 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms continue to gradually move southeastward
across the Southeast States. Low-level wind fields remain strong,
supporting the potential for damaging gusts and line-embedded
tornadoes. Additionally, there is also some chance for a few storms
ahead of the main line. Environmental conditions suggest that any
persistent discrete storms could become supercellular and capable of
producing damaging gusts and tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 135 miles southwest of Birmingham AL
to 15 miles southeast of Rome GA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
