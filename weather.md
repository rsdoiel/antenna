Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1032 AM CST Wed Jan 10 2024

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 01/10/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CST Wed Jan 10 2024/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, mostly zonal flow aloft will remain in place over
much of the southern and central CONUS today ahead of a deepening
Pacific trough. The strong flow aloft will support the development a
weak lee low, late in the period, over parts of southern CO. Winds
should gradually increase through the afternoon and into the
evening, especially over parts of southern NM and west TX. A few
hours of low-end fire weather conditions are possible from the
Trans-Pecos into the Rio Grande Valley/South Texas, where low
humidity and gusty surface winds are possible. However, with area
fuel moisture near normal and the relatively limited overlap of dry
and breezy conditions, fire-weather concerns should remain
localized.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1012 AM CST Wed Jan 10 2024

Valid 101630Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

Relatively cold and stable conditions are in place across the CONUS
today, with the risk of thunderstorms rather low in most areas.

There will be some continued risk of lightning flashes along the
coast and coastal ranges of WA/OR through this evening as a strong
upper trough and associated jet max move inland today.  Strong
onshore flow, orographic lift, and very cold temperatures aloft
could also result in hail and gusty winds in the strongest cores,
but no severe storms are expected.

Other isolated lightning flashes are possible this afternoon and
evening from the Sierras of central CA eastward across parts of
NV/UT.  This activity will mostly be in the form of snow showers as
the aforementioned upper system approaches.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0647 AM CST Wed Jan 10 2024

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
A progressive mid/upper-level pattern will persist through the
period, as a series of shortwave to synoptic-scale troughs maintain
net cyclonic flow over most of the CONUS.  The lead synoptic trough
-- initially including a closed low over southern ON and extending
to the Carolinas -- is forecast to eject northeastward to QC and
Atlantic Canada through the period, while weakening somewhat.  An
upstream shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-channel imagery
over portions of WY/UT -- will move eastward across the central
Plains to mid Mississippi Valley through the period.  This
perturbation will have little or no convective consequence due to
its passage over unfavorably dry and stable, post-frontal air in low
levels. 

The most important feature, both for convective potential today and
the next few -- is a trough initially located over portions of the
Pacific Northwest, with a lobe northwestward past Vancouver Island. 
This feature should move southeastward through the period, crossing
OR and ID today, and extending from central WY to southern CA by 12Z
tomorrow.  Associated cooling aloft -- superimposed with a moist and
marginally but sufficiently buoyant marine layer -- will support
isolated lightning flashes with the best-organized (and still
relatively shallow) convective turrets near the Northwest coast. 
Steepening lapse rates inland, in the zone of large-scale DCVA/
ascent ahead of the mid/upper trough -- will overlie weak low/
middle-level moisture and frontogenetic forcing to support isolated
lightning potential with shallow, mostly snow-producing convection
from parts of the Sierra eastward over the Great Basin.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-01-09, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0248 PM CST Tue Jan 09 2024

Valid 111200Z - 171200Z

A strong upper-level trough will be in the process pivoting through
the Southwest/northern Mexico on Thursday before quickly ejecting
into the southern Plains by Friday morning. As this feature races
northeastward it will become a strong upper low in the Upper Midwest
with broadly cyclonic flow elsewhere across much of the
central/eastern CONUS during the weekend. The upper-level pattern
becomes a bit more uncertain into next week, though a trough in the
East and a ridge in the West is the current general theme in
forecast guidance. At the surface, a surface cyclone will deepen
rapidly as it moves from the southern Plains into the lower Great
Lakes region. Colder air will eventually filter into the Plains
during the weekend with another reinforcing shot early next week.
Low temperatures and precipitation should limit fire weather
concerns in most areas.

Dry and windy conditions are expected to occur in the Trans-Pecos on
Thursday. Though locally elevated fire weather appears probable,
limited fuel receptiveness should keep greater concerns from
developing despite the near-critical/critical meteorological
conditions. As the front moves southward on Friday, another
northwesterly flow regime will develop in the Rio Grande
Valley/South Texas. With the dry and windy conditions in the
preceding days, fine fuels appear that they will be dry enough to
support fire spread. Winds will be strongest in the morning into the
early afternoon before diminishing. Highlights have been added for
the few hours of expected elevated to near-critical fire weather.

## SPC Jan 9, 2024 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

date: 2024-01-09, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CST Tue Jan 09 2024

Valid 092000Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTH
FLORIDA INTO THE CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Tornadoes (some strong) and damaging wind remain possible through
the afternoon and into the early evening from parts of Florida into
the Carolinas.

...20Z Update...
An extensive QLCS is ongoing this afternoon from the Carolinas into
north FL, with embedded supercell structures occasionally noted
within the line. Attempts at discrete, prefrontal supercell
development have also been noted near and just off of the SC coast.
Very strong deep-layer shear will continue to support organized
convection wherever buoyancy can increase above negligible levels,
with damaging wind and line-embedded tornadoes being the primary
hazards. Extreme low-level shear (with 0-1 km SRH near or above 500
m2/s2) could still support a strong-tornado risk with any prefrontal
supercells that can mature across the Carolinas, or perhaps with any
persistent embedded supercell within the primary QLCS.  

The primary QLCS will likely persist until it reaches the Atlantic
coast, with some severe threat potentially spreading as far north as
southeast VA, and potentially into parts of east-central and south
FL into this evening. See WW 5, WW 6, WW 7, and the previous
discussion below for more information.

..Dean.. 01/09/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1004 AM CST Tue Jan 09 2024/

...Southeast states...
A deep upper low is over the mid MS valley today, with an associated
100+ knot mid-level jet max rotating across the TN Valley.  A line
of intense thunderstorms extends from northeast-southwest GA into
the FL panhandle and the eastern Gulf.  These storms will progress
rapidly eastward today across FL and the Carolinas, where very
strong southerly low-level winds will advect an increasingly moist
and marginally unstable air mass northward.

The convective line is currently well-ahead of the primary cold
front.  However, model guidance suggests that the front will
overtake the line through the afternoon, resulting in enhanced
forcing and likely contributing to thunderstorm intensification. 
Instability ahead of the line will be marginal, but extremely strong
wind speeds and shear (850mb wind speeds of 80-90 knots) suggest the
risk of widespread strong to damaging wind gusts in vicinity of the
squall line.  Also, numerous QLCS circulations and attendant risk of
tornadoes have been noted along the line this morning, and may at
least occasionally continue through the day in some corridors.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1253 PM CST Tue Jan 09 2024

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 01/09/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CST Tue Jan 09 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather conditions appear mostly quiescent through the forecast
period, as the potent upper-level cyclone over the central US
quickly moves to the east. Strong westerly flow aloft will remain
over the CONUS. However, surface winds will remain light in the dry,
but relatively cool post-frontal air mass. A few hours of low-end
fire weather conditions are possible from the Trans-Pecos into the
Rio Grand Valley/South Texas, where lingering low humidity and
occasional gusty surface winds are possible through the afternoon.
However, with area fuel moisture near normal and the relatively
limited overlap of dry and breezy conditions, fire-weather concerns
should remain localized.

Mesoscale Discussion 0029
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0912 AM CST Tue Jan 09 2024

Areas affected...Eastern Iowa...northwest Illinois...and far
southwest Wisconsin.

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 091512Z - 091815Z

SUMMARY...Moderate to heavy snow with rates of 1 to 2 inches per
hour are expected into the early afternoon. Strong winds will lead
to blowing, drifting, and reduced visibility.

DISCUSSION...A 987mb surface low currently southeast of St. Louis
this morning will continue to deepen through the day as it moves
north into Michigan and deepens below 980mb. Within the last hour,
snowfall rates have started to increase across eastern Iowa within
the deformation region of the cyclone. Expect this moderate to heavy
snow to shift eastward into northern Illinois and Wisconsin during
the day in response to the deepening/moving cyclone. Winds are
already around 20 mph with gusts to 30 mph but are expected to
strengthen further to around 25 mph with gusts to 40 mph this
afternoon as the pressure gradient tightens. Widespread blowing and
drifting snow is expected with localized blizzard conditions
possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0030
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0945 AM CST Tue Jan 09 2024

Areas affected...Portions of north FL...coastal/eastern GA...much of
SC...and extreme south-central NC

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 091545Z - 091745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Conditions are expected to become increasingly favorable
for tornadoes and severe/damaging winds over the next couple of
hours. Tornado Watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of convection extends from northeast GA
to the FL Panhandle along/near a surface cold front. A powerful
upper cyclone is centered over the mid MS Valley this morning, with
associated 60-80+ kt southerly low-level jet rapidly advecting
moisture northward ahead of the line. Various recent RAP/NAM
forecast soundings across north FL into coastal/eastern GA and much
of SC suggest that it will take at least 62-63F surface dewpoints
amid modest daytime heating to aid weak boundary-layer
destabilization and the potential for surface-based thunderstorms.
Latest surface observations indicate that sufficient low-level
moisture is already in place as far north as central GA/SC.

Current expectations are that this continued low-level warm/moist
advection will likely support a severe threat as far north as parts
of upstate SC and towards Charlotte NC. Area VWPs ahead of the
ongoing QLCS show low-level flow quickly strengthening to 60-70+ kt
above 1 km, with ample low-level shear available to support updraft
rotation and embedded tornadic circulations within the line.
Severe/damaging downdraft winds of 60-75 mph also appear likely
given the strength of the low-level flow. With the severe potential
likely to increase across this region over the next few hours,
Tornado Watch issuance is likely.

Mesoscale Discussion 0028
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0905 AM CST Tue Jan 09 2024

Areas affected...Portions of the FL Panhandle into north FL and
south-central GA

Concerning...Tornado Watch 4...

Valid 091505Z - 091630Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 4 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for embedded QLCS tornadoes and damaging winds
will continue this morning.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of thunderstorms, with occasional
embedded supercell structures, is ongoing this morning across parts
of the FL Panhandle into south/central GA. Multiple CC
minima/tornadic circulations have been observed with this line over
the past several hours. Modifying the 12Z TLH sounding for current
surface observations yields only weak MLCAPE. Still, rapid low-level
moisture advection is occurring ahead of the line, and even modest
daytime heating should allow for weak destabilization downstream.
Current expectations are for the tornado threat to continue eastward
across south-central GA and north FL, as area VWPs show extremely
strong low-level flow (1 km southerly winds in excess of 70 kt from
KTLH) and 0-1 km SRH approaching 600 m2/s2 that will easily support
embedded QLCS circulations. Straight-line severe/damaging winds
around 60-75 mph will also remain a threat with the line given the
strength of the low-level flow.

Day 3 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0712 AM CST Tue Jan 09 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY NIGHT
ACROSS PARTS OF EASTERN TEXAS...MUCH OF CENTRAL AND NORTHERN
LOUISIANA...SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND WESTERN MISSISSIPPI...

CORRECTED FOR FL THUNDERSTORM LINE.

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorm development is possible Thursday night across
parts of central and eastern Texas into the lower Mississippi
Valley, where storms may increasingly pose a risk for severe hail,
wind and tornadoes prior to daybreak Friday.

...Discussion...
To the east of persistent amplified mid/upper ridging within the
split flow across the mid-latitude eastern Pacific, one notable
short wave impulse of northern Canadian Arctic origins is forecast
to dig southeast of the Canadian Rockies, into the northern U.S.
intermountain region and Rockies by late Thursday night.  Downstream
of this perturbation, another short wave trough, of northern
mid-latitude Pacific origins, is forecast to dig through the
Southwestern international border area, before rapidly pivoting east
of the southern Rockies/northern Mexican Plateau through the
southern Great Plains by the end of the period.

As stronger mid/upper forcing for ascent associated with the lead
perturbation approaches the Ark-La-Tex vicinity, it still appears
that a surface low may begin to consolidate within deepening surface
troughing across the southern Great Plains into lower Mississippi
Valley.  Timing of the onset of more rapid deepening is becoming a
bit more unclear, but still seems probable prior to 12Z Friday. 
Once this occurs, a more substantive inland influx of low-level
moisture, off a still modifying boundary-layer over the northwestern
Gulf of Mexico, is expected to contribute to increasing near-surface
or surface-based destabilization.  This appears likely to be aided
by steepening lapse rates associated with mid-level cooling, in the
exit region of an intense jet streak (northwesterly to westerly at
100-120 kt around 500 mb).  

Coincident with strengthening southerly lower-level flow (in excess
of 50 kt) across the lower Mississippi Valley by 12Z Friday, rapidly
intensifying thunderstorms posing increasing severe weather 
potential is possible by late Thursday night, if not earlier.  The
mid/upper forcing for ascent may contribute to thunderstorm
initiation as early and far west as late Thursday evening near the
(roughly) I-35 corridor of central Texas.  This may gradually evolve
into an upscale growing and organizing cluster across eastern Texas
into western Louisiana and Arkansas, with an additional area of
downstream warm advection driven supercell development possible
closer to the Mississippi River, by the end of the period.

Mesoscale Discussion 0015
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0940 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Areas affected...East Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 081540Z - 081745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered elevated thunderstorms over east Texas may begin
to pose a risk of hail in the strongest cores.  Watch issuance seems
unlikely at this time, but trends are being monitored.

DISCUSSION...Recent radar/satellite loops show scattered showers and
thunderstorms slowly intensifying over parts of east TX.  This
activity is along the core of a strong southerly low-level jet, and
north of a surface warm front.  Parcels near the surface remain
stable.  But forecast soundings in this area show steep mid-level
lapse rates and weak-but-sufficient elevated CAPE for the risk of a
few robust updrafts.  Low-level/deep-layer shear is quite strong,
which would support at least transient supercell structures as well.
 So far, trends of this activity have remained below severe limits,
and model guidance suggests it may still be several hours before a
more focused severe threat develops.  Nevertheless, trends will be
closely monitored for an increasing risk.

Mesoscale Discussion 0014
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0927 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Areas affected...Northeast Kansas into southeast Nebraska

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 081527Z - 081830Z

SUMMARY...Rain will transition to heavy snow across northeast Kansas
and vicinity late this morning into the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Several observation sites across northeast Kansas have
switched from rain to snow in the last hour as the column cools from
increasing isentropic ascent across the region. Expect this to
continue for the remaining areas across northeast Kansas where rain
is still falling. This strong ascent will also lead to very heavy
snowfall rates in excess of 1 inch per hour. In addition, the
heavier snowfall rates will lift into southeast Nebraska by midday
with some snowfall rates approaching 2 inches per hour amid a deeper
DGZ and colder surface temperatures. Winds will increase to around
15 mph with gusts to 25 mph this afternoon which will lead to an
increase in blowing and drifting across the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 0013
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0739 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Areas affected...northwest KS...south-central NE

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 081339Z - 081745Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snowfall rates around 1 to 1.5 inches per hour are
possible through the morning.

DISCUSSION...A mesoscale band of heavier snowfall rates appears to
be developing across northwest KS on the northern periphery of a
warm conveyor belt located over the southern-central Great Plains. 
Frontogenetic forcing for ascent is forecast to continue to
strengthen during the morning across western KS and eventually into
southern NE by late morning.  The 12 UTC Dodge City raob showed a
moist profile and an above-freezing layer from the surface through
800 mb.  A surface front is draped southwest to northeast from far
southwestern KS north-northeast into northwest KS (i.e., located to
the northwest of Dodge City).  The colder airmass north of the front
will support snow as the precipitation type.  Model guidance
indicates upwards of 0.10 to 0.15 inches per hour liquid-equivalent
precipitation across northwest KS this morning.  As a result of
nearly 10:1 snow ratios, expecting 1 to 1.5 inches per hour (locally
heavier bursts are possible) as lift continues to strengthen during
the morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0011
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0527 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Areas affected...Southeast CO...Raton Mesa of northeast NM...far
western KS

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 081127Z - 081730Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snowfall rates around 1 inch per hour are expected
to begin between 13-15 UTC on a localized basis.  Surface gusts will
rapidly increase this morning (into the 35-60 mph range) and
coincide with more widespread 1 inch per hour snowfall rates.  These
conditions will lead to substantially reduced visibilities and
result in blizzard conditions beginning during the late morning
(15-18 UTC).

DISCUSSION...Water-vapor imagery shows a powerful mid-level
shortwave trough moving east across the Sangre de Cristos early this
morning.  Deep-layer forcing for ascent will continue to overspread
the central High Plains as the column saturates early this morning. 
Light to moderate snow will transition to localized heavy snow
(i.e., rates around 1 inch per hour) beginning in the 13-15 UTC
period according to the latest SREF and HREF model guidance.  Heavy
snowfall rates of around 1 inch per hour will become widespread
during the 15-18 UTC period as both upslope flow strengthens south
of the Arkansas River and deep-layer ascent associated with the
cyclone intensifies.

Low-level flow is forecast to intensify markedly during the morning
with 250 m AGL flow increasing from less than 10 kt to 50 kt while
contributing to very strong gusts and substantially reduced
visibilities.  The strengthening of surface gusts into the 35-60 mph
range is expected to coincide with the onset of more widespread 1
inch per hour snowfall rates and result in blizzard conditions
during the 15-18 UTC period.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0734 AM CST MON JAN 08 2024

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Gulf Coast later
today and tonight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Southern Louisiana
  Southern Mississippi
  Southeast Texas
  Southern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle

* HAZARDS...
  A few intense tornadoes
  Scattered damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Isolated large hail

* SUMMARY...
  Severe thunderstorms capable of strong wind gusts and tornadoes
  are expected across the Gulf Coast States this afternoon through
  early Tuesday morning. This includes the possibility of strong
  tornadoes and a significant nighttime severe weather risk for
  southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi into southern
  Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Areas affected...Portions of Southern New England

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 071716Z - 072015Z

SUMMARY...Moderate to heavy snow expected through the afternoon with
rain transitioning to snow near the coast.

DISCUSSION...Snow is intensifying across portions of southern New
England as the surface low intensifies over the Atlantic and
low-level wind fields strengthen. Snowfall rates of 1 to perhaps 2
inches per hour are expected through the afternoon before moving
offshore by this evening. Areas near the coast which have been
mostly rain thus far due to winds off the ocean will transition to
snow in the next few hours as winds shift more northerly as the
cyclone deepens/moves east. In addition, sustained winds around 15
mph with gusts of 25 to 30 mph may lead to some blowing and drifting
snow and additional visibility restrictions through the afternoon.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL GULF COAST OVERNIGHT MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of strong wind gusts and tornadoes are
expected from southeast Texas across the central Gulf Coast and from
Monday afternoon into early Tuesday morning. Greatest severe
potential is anticipated overnight from southeast Louisiana across
southern Mississippi and southern Alabama, and into the western
Florida Panhandle.

...Synopsis...
Shortwave trough currently extending from Great Basin through the
northern Baja Peninsula is forecast to move eastward today while
intensifying. By 12Z Monday morning this shortwave will likely have
matured into a mid-latitude cyclone centered over northeast NM, with
an extensive belt of strong mid-level flow throughout its southern
periphery. This cyclone is then expected to evolve eastward across
the TX Panhandle and OK throughout the day, with mid-level flow
strengthening considerably throughout its eastern periphery. By
Monday evening, 100+ kt at 500-mb will likely stretch from the
Edwards Plateau into the Ozark Plateau. Further strengthening of
this mid-level flow is anticipated overnight Monday as the cyclone
tracks a bit more northeastward, ending the period over western MO.
Intense low-level flow will accompany this cyclone as well, with a
large area of 50+ kt over the southern Plains early Monday. This
low-level jet will shift eastward throughout the day and overnight,
while gradually strengthening. By early Tuesday morning, 60+ kt
850-mb flow will cover much of the Southeast, with 70+ kt possible
from northern MS into middle TN and northern AL. 

Previous frontal intrusion (evidenced by the cold and dry conditions
over the southern Plains and Southeast Sunday) will limit the
northern extent of the moisture return and associated
severe-thunderstorm potential. General expectation is for secondary
surface cyclogenesis over central TX Monday morning, with the
primary low well to the north over the TX/OK Panhandles. This
secondary low (and associated warm front) should delineate the
northern extent of the severe potential as it gradually moves
eastward across central portions of east TX and into central LA
Monday afternoon and evening. This low is forecast to continue
eastward overnight Monday into early Tuesday, progressing across
central MS and AL. Severe thunderstorms are expected within the warm
sector ahead of this low, as well as along the associated cold front
as it surges eastward.

...North TX Early Monday...
As the strong mid-level flow associated with the cyclone moves into
southern Plains, a fast-moving line of showers and embedded
thunderstorms is expected to move across north TX early Monday
morning. Forecast soundings show very weak thermodynamics, limiting
overall updraft strength and duration. However, given the strong low
and upper level support, a narrow-line of forced convection may
become capable of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts as it moves
eastward.

...TX Coastal Plain/Southeast TX into southwest LA Monday Afternoon
and Evening...
Two rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across the
region Monday, with the first round likely beginning early Monday
afternoon as the warm sector moves into the region. Current guidance
suggests this warm sector will be characterized by temperatures in
the low 70s, dewpoints in the upper 60s, and moderate buoyancy.
However, given the prevalence of cloud cover and early period
showers, there is uncertainty regarding if temperatures can reach
the low 70s. If they do, some surface-based supercells capable of
all severe hazards, including tornadoes are possible. If
temperatures stay in the 60s, low-level stability would likely
inhibit surface-based storm development, mitigating the severe
potential. Consensus within the guidance has trended towards warmer
temperatures and tornado probabilities were increased across the
region as a result. A further increase in probabilities may be
needed in later outlooks if confidence in surface-based storms
increases.

Additional thunderstorm development is anticipated along the front
as it moves through, but the strength of these storms will be
predicated on coverage and strength of any warm sector development.
Strong wind gusts would be the primary severe risk with this
convective line.  

...Central Gulf Coast Overnight Monday into Tuesday Morning...
As the surface low continues eastward, a convective line is expected
to mature along the cold front as it encounters a moderately moist
and buoyant airmass and increasingly strong low-level flow. As the
line matures, it will likely transition from a more parallel
stratiform structure to a more organized leading-line, trailing
stratiform configuration. Robust low-level kinematics, characterized
by 50-60 kt just above the surface and 500+ m2/s2 of 0-3 km SRH,
suggest both significant-severe gusts and strong QLCS tornadoes are
possible.
