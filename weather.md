...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible this evening mainly over
parts of eastern Louisiana and across Mississippi.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Scattered thunderstorms continue to be most prevalent over the
northern and central Gulf, near the offshore surface low. A few
lightning flashes were noted over parts of northern LA into MS, but
in general, this activity should continue to wane as winds veer with
the passing lead wave aloft.

Elsewhere, a few flashes with weak convection were noted earlier
over southwest OR beneath cool temperatures aloft and in association
with a now departing shortwave trough. A very low chance of thunder
may linger in this area within the residual midlevel moist plume
this evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 251200Z - 031200Z

Fire weather potential will remain limited across the country
through much of the upcoming work week, though some fire concerns
may emerge across the southern High Plains beginning D6/Friday and
into the following weekend. A broad northwesterly flow regime aloft
is expected to persist for much of the upcoming week amid
persistent, and unseasonably strong, ridging across the western
CONUS. This regime will continue to promote dry conditions from the
southern Great Basin into the Four Corners and southern/central
Plains. Additionally, a return to unseasonably warm temperatures is
anticipated, which will support gradual fuel drying and an expansion
of elevated (80+ percentile) ERC values out of far West Texas and
into the southern Plains/Southwest. The passage of weak upper
disturbances across the northern latitudes will promote widespread,
but light, rain/snow chances and an influx of cooler continental air
for northern portions of the country, but could augment regional
pressure gradient winds across the southern High Plains where fuels
should be most receptive. This potential appears most prominent
around D6/Friday when most solutions suggest southwest winds could
approach critical thresholds within a dry downslope flow regime,
though deterministic/ensemble spread remains high at this range. A
transition to a more progressive upper-air regime is anticipated
heading into early March, which could signal an increase in fire
weather potential for parts of the Southwest and Plains as more
robust surface cyclones become probable across the southern U.S.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected across the CONUS on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
After an upper-level trough moves of the eastern Florida coast,
generally quasi-zonal flow will prevail across the CONUS. Two
shortwaves, one in central/northern Rockies and the other in
Mid-Atlantic, will have little in terms of moisture to work with.
Thunderstorm potential with these features will be quite low. Very
isolated thunderstorm activity could linger into early Tuesday
morning in Florida, but the departing shortwave/surface low will not
synoptically favor coverage at or above 10%.

0117 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms should continue across portions of Louisiana and
immediate surrounding areas today. Additional isolated thunderstorms
may still occur in portions of Oregon/Washington. No severe weather
is expected.

...20Z Update...
The primary change made to the 20Z Day 1 Convective Outlook was to
trim western portions of the general thunder delineation over
Coastal TX. Low-level moisture advection and associated buoyancy is
translating east along the Gulf Coast in tandem with a mid-level
trough. As such, additional lightning flashes are most likely across
portions of LA into central/southern MS and adjacent waters. A few
lightning flashes still remain possible across portions of the
Pacific Northwest with the approach of a mid-level trough.

..Squitieri.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1012 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...TX/LA...
A prominent shortwave trough is tracking eastward across TX today,
providing lift and destabilization to parts of southeast TX and LA. 
Scattered thunderstorms have been occurring in this region through
the morning, but should slowly shift offshore by later this
afternoon as the upper system passes.  While small hail could occur
with the strongest onshore storms, no severe weather is anticipated.


...WA/OR...
Recent water vapor loop shows a strong shortwave trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest coast.  As this system approaches,
strengthening onshore flow and cold temperatures aloft will increase
the risk of at least isolated thunderstorms - mainly this evening.

...Synopsis...
Strong surface winds are forecast on Monday across portions of the
Central and Northern Plains, reaching 25-30 MPH in the ensemble mean
over portions of Nebraska and South Dakota. However, relative
humidity values are forecast to remain at or above 20%, and ERC
fuels guidance suggests that fuels are not currently receptive to
wildfire ignition and spread at this time. Given these limiting
factors, no fire-weather highlights will be introduced into the
forecast.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A few thunderstorms are possible across South Florida and coastal
Oregon/Washington on Monday. No severe thunderstorms are expected.

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level shortwave trough will move into the Northwest
Monday afternoon/evening. A broad upper-level trough in the Gulf
will sharpen as it approaches South Florida Monday evening. A
nebulous surface low in the Gulf will accompany the upper trough.
Diffuse surface boundaries in the eastern Gulf and South Florida
will be the focus for thunderstorm activity.

...South Florida/Keys...
A cluster of thunderstorms appears likely to be ongoing early Monday
off the southwestern Florida coast and perhaps near the Keys. This
activity will likely be east of the surface cold front and driven by
weak low-level warm advection. Current forecast guidance suggests
the greatest buoyancy will remain primarily over the Keys. Given the
stronger southwesterly flow aloft, it is possible a stronger storm
or two could develop. However, deep-layer shear will be parallel to
this activity, mid-level height falls will be neutral until late in
the period, and low-level wind fields will be rather weak. The
overall potential for even marginally severe storms continues to be
low. As stronger forcing arrives late, additional activity is
possible along the surface front in western Florida. However, it is
not clear if storms would be surface based or if buoyancy would be
sufficient for a severe threat.

...Northwest...
Strong wind fields will be in place across the region as a surface
low deepens west of the Olympic Peninsula. A line of at least
shallow, forced convection will impact portions of coastal
Washington/Oregon. A few stronger convectively enhanced wind gusts
are possible among the already strong synoptic flow. These gusts are
most likely along the immediate coast. Given minimal buoyancy, it
appears coverage of these convective gusts will be too isolated to
warrant highlights.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1001 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

An Elevated risk area has been introduced for portions of far West
Texas and central to southern New Mexico. Morning surface
observations show very dry conditions in place (dewpoints in the
single digits to low teens) with a very dry residual mixed layer
above a shallow nocturnal inversion sampled in the 12z EPZ sounding.
Winds increasing to around 15 mph should coincide with RH minimums
in the low to mid teens per recent ensemble guidance, which has
trended towards higher probabilities of sustained elevated fire
weather conditions over a region with slowly increasing ERCs (which
currently sit at around the 80-90th percentile). Forecast concerns
regarding portions of WY and NE remain on track as outlined in the
previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
Warm and dry downslope winds are forecast in the lee of the
Sacramento and Sandia Manzano mountains of eastern New Mexico, with
winds up to 20 MPH and relative humidity values dropping below 15%.
Across portions of eastern Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle,
winds could reach as high as 25-30 MPH with relative humidity below
20%. However, current ERC fuels guidance across both regions
suggests there is little support for wildfire ignition and spread,
especially with some recent wetting rainfall across portions of
Wyoming and Nebraska in the last 5 days. Given the lack of
supportive fuels, no fire-weather highlights will be introduced at
this time.

0630 AM CST Sat Feb 22 2025

Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms remain possible from the middle and upper
Texas Coast toward the Sabine Valley late today and overnight. A few
storms could produce some small hail.

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of shortwave troughs
progressing through the southern stream, with the lead wave moving
through the Ozark Plateau and the second wave dropping through AZ
towards northern Mexico. The lead wave is forecast to continue
eastward, moving quickly through the TN Valley and central
Appalachians before moving off the Carolina coast. The second
shortwave is expected to pivot more eastward as it moves along the
US/Mexico border before continuing across the southern High Plains
and reaching central TX by early Sunday morning.

Farther northwest, a shortwave trough and attendant strong mid-level
flow will likely reach the Pacific Northwest coast late
tonight/early tomorrow. Some deeper convective cores are possible
within the frontal band preceding this shortwave, a few of which
could be deep enough to produce occasional lightning flashes. 

...Upper TX Coast into Southwest LA...
Recent surface analysis shows that the cold and dry airmass remains
firmly in place across the southern Plains, with surface ridging
anchored over AR maintaining offshore flow. This airmass is expected
to remain largely in place, with only modest modification throughout
the day. Much of the guidance keeps surface temperatures in the 40s
along the TX and LA coasts throughout the period. 

Low to mid-level southwesterly flow is expected to increase as the
second shortwave trough mentioned in the synopsis approaches the
region. Cold mid-level temperatures will accompany this shortwave as
well. As a result, despite persistent surface stability, some
elevated buoyancy is expected, with showers and embedded
thunderstorms anticipated from the early afternoon through Sunday
morning. The general expectation is for thunderstorm coverage to
maximize after 06Z Sunday as the shortwave moves through TX, with an
associated increase in large-scale ascent and decrease of the
mid-level temperatures. Fairly strong shear within the cloud-bearing
layer will overlap this modest thermodynamic environment, resulting
in the potential for a few strong, more persistent, and organized
updrafts embedded within the large precipitation shield. Some of
these storms may become strong enough to produce hail, but most
should be sub-severe (i.e. less than 1" in diameter), and the
overall severe coverage is still expected to be below 5%.

0350 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Valid 231200Z - 281200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Isolated showers and thunderstorms may occur over parts of the
western to central Gulf coast vicinity on Day 4/Sun in association
with a weakening upper shortwave trough moving across the region.

After a lull in precipitation potential around Days 5-6/Mon-Tue,
thunderstorm potential may increase late in the forecast period. An
upper ridge over the western U.S. will shift east across the Plains
on Day 7/Wed before a deepening trough ejects across the Rockies to
the MS Valley on Day 8/Thu. During this time, lee low development
over the southern Plains will result in strengthening southerly
low-level flow over the western Gulf. Increasing moisture return
ahead of the eastward developing low and attendant cold front will
likely result in thunderstorm development from the ArkLaTex to the
Mid-South vicinity on Day 8/Thu. While some severe potential could
become favorable in this pattern, uncertainty regarding northward
extent of moisture return, and timing of key features at this longer
time range, precludes severe probabilities at this time.

Areas affected...Northeastern Arkansas...Southeastern
Missouri...Western Tennessee...Western Kentucky...Southern Illinois

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 190001Z - 190300Z

SUMMARY...Snowfall rates will gradually increase across portions of
western Kentucky and western Tennessee through the evening. Rates
will decrease through time, though some moderate to heavy snowfall
rates up to 1"/hr will be possible in heavier bands.

DISCUSSION...Radar analysis shows the gradual shift of snowfall into
portions of western Kentucky and Tennessee this evening. Moderate to
heavy snowfall is ongoing across southeastern Missouri into southern
Illinois, where a persistent heavy band extends, driven by 700-850
mb frontogenesis and isentropic ascent. This enhancement will
gradually shift eastward through time, with potential for a few
heavier bands with occasional 1"/hr rates. HREF ensemble guidance
shows a down trend in rates overall through the evening, with a
transition to mostly light snow for portions of western Tennessee.
Confidence is highest in potential for better rates across
northwestern Kentucky into southern Illinois.

0748 AM CST Tue Feb 18 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern OK into northwest AR and
extreme southwest MO

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 181348Z - 181645Z

SUMMARY...Light to locally moderate freezing rain and/or sleet is
possible this morning. Increasing snow rates are possible by late
morning across northeast Oklahoma and vicinity.

DISCUSSION...Light precipitation is gradually increasing this
morning across parts of central/eastern OK, in response to warm
advection near/above 850 mb atop a southward-advancing arctic
airmass. The 12Z OUN sounding depicts saturation primarily below a
notable temperature inversion around 700 mb. In the short term,
given the relatively shallow saturated layer and lack of deeper
ascent above this layer, a period of freezing drizzle/light freezing
rain will be possible, with relatively efficient ice accretion in
areas where near-surface temperatures fall through the 20s F. 

With time, deeper/stronger ascent will result in locally heavier
precipitation rates later this morning. This may be accompanied by
an transition to sleet and snow (especially with northward extent),
due to continued near-surface cold advection and wet-bulb cooling of
the initially dry layer near 700 mb. Snow rates may begin to
increase by late morning across northeast OK and vicinity, with
locally heavy snow possible this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0110
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern Florida...Southeast Georgia...Eastern
Southern Carolina...Far Southern North Carolina

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13...

Valid 161348Z - 161545Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13
continues.

SUMMARY...A threat for damaging wind gusts will continue this
morning from parts of northern Florida northeastward into southeast
Georgia and the Carolinas.

DISCUSSION...The latest mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
to severe storms from the eastern Florida Panhandle northeastward
into the central Carolinas. Ahead of the line, surface dewpoints in
the 60s F are contributing to weak instability. The RAP has MUCAPE
less than 500 J/kg in most areas across the Atlantic coastal plains.
In spite of this, frontal forcing is strong near the line, which
will likely help the line to maintain strength over the next few
hours. With the strong low to mid-level flow in place, evident on
regional WSR-88D VWPs, the line is expected to continue to produce
isolated damaging gusts, especially along the parts that are more
organized. The wind-damage threat will likely persist into the mid
to late morning as the line moves through the Atlantic coastal
areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 0109
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern New York...Northern New England

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 161328Z - 161930Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snow will likely develop across parts of northern
New York and northern New England this morning. Further south into
parts of east-central New York and central New England, a mix of
snow, sleet and freezing rain will be possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level trough will quickly move through the
southern and central Appalachians this morning. A surface low will
deepen and move northeastward into the Northeast. Ahead of the
system, a band of strong warm-advection was located from New York
eastward into the southern New England, where widespread
precipitation is ongoing. The freezing line is currently located
from southern New York eastward into southern New England. A zone
(about 100 miles wide) of freezing rain and sleet is located to the
north of the freezing line. This freezing rain and sleet will spread
northward over the next few hours. A changeover to rain will occur
as the freezing line moves northward. In addition, areas that are
experiencing snow may changeover to freezing rain. Freezing rain
rates could exceed 0.05 inches per hour.

Further north into northern New England, surface temperatures are in
the teens and single digits. The cold air in the low to mid-levels
will make snow the primary precipitation type. As strong warm
advection and isentropic lift increase across the region, the
development of heavy snow will likely occur in many areas. Snowfall
rates could exceed 1 inch per hour.
