Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CST Tue Dec 05 2023

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Wednesday.

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will track eastward from the northeast Pacific
into the northwestern CONUS, as an attendant cold front moves ashore
over coastal Oregon and northwest California. Cold temperatures
aloft/steepening lapse rates atop adequate boundary-layer moisture
will yield sufficient buoyancy for embedded lightning flashes within
a larger swath of precipitation. This activity may persist from the
late afternoon into the overnight hours. Shallow/weak buoyancy
should generally limit strong/severe storm potential despite a
modest increase in low-level shear/hodograph curvature along
immediate coastal areas late in the period. 

Elsewhere, cool/stable surface conditions will limit thunderstorm
potential.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1055 AM CST Tue Dec 05 2023

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Fire weather concerns remain minimal today. See previous discussion
below.

..Bentley.. 12/05/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1120 PM CST Mon Dec 04 2023/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will shift eastward over the Divide today. At
the surface, high pressure will strengthen in the Plains as it moves
southeastward with time. Surface high pressure will also remain
within the Great Basin into the Western Slope. Fire weather concerns
throughout the CONUS should remain low given generally unreceptive
fuels and light winds. Some stronger offshore winds are likely in
southern California. These winds will peak this morning before
weakening through the day. Though fuels are not overly receptive and
the lowest RH will not phase well with the strongest winds, locally
elevated conditions would be possible where pockets of dry fuels
exits within the terrain.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0637 AM CST Tue Dec 05 2023

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm areas are not expected through early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, a progressive and fairly well-amplified
synoptic pattern will carry through the period, led by a strong
trough moving across the eastern CONUS, and ridging over the Rockies
and High Plains.  A strong shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-
channel imagery over portions of WI/IL/MO -- will move eastward
across the Appalachians tonight and through the larger-scale trough.
Smaller shortwaves will move from northwestern ON across the Upper
Great Lakes, and separately, southeastward rapidly from the northern
Plains to the Ozarks and portions of the Southeast.  Late this
afternoon into evening, enough cooling aloft and residual low-level
moisture will be in place to support around 100 J/kg MUCAPE ahead of
the leading perturbation, in a corridor from southern OH to eastern
TN.  However, forecast soundings suggest buoyancy will remain below
an optimal icing layer for lightning, though a rogue strike or two
cannot be ruled out. 

Otherwise, a long-fetch, warm-advection conveyor ahead of the next
Pacific trough will settle southward down the Northwest Coast,
reaching northwesternmost CA around the end of the period.  Lapse
rates in this plume should remain too weak to support areas of
thunderstorms.

0616 PM CST Mon Dec 04 2023

Valid 050100Z - 051200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast the rest of tonight.

...01z Update...

Midlevel speed max is translating quickly off the middle Atlantic
Coast early this evening. Large-scale ascent and associated buoyancy
have progressed well offshore and thunderstorms are no longer
forecast over the southern Appalachians.

Upstream across the Pacific Northwest, poor lapse rates within the
warm conveyor do not appear favorable for more than a rogue flash of
lightning within the deepest updrafts. For this reason have lowered
thunder probabilities to less than 10%.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2023-12-04, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0415 PM CST Mon Dec 04 2023

Valid 061200Z - 121200Z

Some increase in fire weather conditions is expected across the
southern High Plains late this week and into the weekend as a series
of mid-level shortwaves traverse the Central Rockies and Southwest.
This will lead to several days of lee troughing and strengthening
winds and downslope flow in the region. The driest and windiest
conditions are likely on Friday as the trough deepens and stronger
mid-level flow overspreads the region. Freeze cured fine fuels will
likely support some increase in initial attack, but ERC values near
seasonal norm should mitigate a greater threat for large fire.
Therefore, Elevated fire weather conditions are possible, but
Critical fire weather conditions remain unlikely and therefore, no
probabilities are warranted at this time. 

Some precipitation may fall in this region on Saturday which would
limit fuel receptiveness, but where fuels remain dry, especially
across Far West Texas and southern New Mexico, dry and breezy
conditions will continue to dry fuels which may eventually lead to
fire weather concerns in the region.
