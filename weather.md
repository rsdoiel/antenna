## Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 9

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Deep convection has increased significantly over the past several 
hours, but the center is located near the northeastern edge of the 
thunderstorms.  This asymmetric structure is due to 15-20 kt of 
northeasterly vertical wind shear.  The objective and subjective 
Dvorak estimates range from 35 to 55 kt, and based on that data, 
the initial intensity is held at 45 kt.  However, this estimate 
could be a little conservative based on recent satellite trends.

Gilma's motion has been somewhat erratic, but smoothing through the 
wobbles yields an initial motion estimate of 285/10 kt.  A high 
pressure ridge situated to the north of the storm should cause that 
motion to continue for another day or so.  However, after that 
time, a decrease in forward speed is expected as the ridge weakens 
and is replaced by a broad trough.  The models have trended south 
this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been nudged in that 
direction.

The ongoing northeasterly vertical wind shear is expected to 
decrease and become fairly low during the next few days.  This more 
conducive upper-level wind pattern combined with warm SSTs and high 
moisture should allow Gilma to steadily strengthen through the rest 
of the week.  Gilma is forecast to reach hurricane strength by 
Wednesday night and could reach its peak intensity a day later.  By 
the end of the week, the cyclone is expected to track over cooler 
waters and into a more stable airmass, which should induce a 
weakening trend.  The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PREDOMINANTLY OVER
PORTIONS OF CENTRAL MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm winds and large hail are possible today, mainly
over parts of Montana.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a rather blocky large-scale pattern will yield
very slow evolution of major features through the period.  A 500-mb
low that has just closed off over southern QC should move southward
over central NY through the period, with associated cyclonic flow
covering the full extent of the Appalachians and most of the CONUS
from the mid/upper Mississippi Valley eastward.  An anticyclone will
remain anchored over NM, west TX and vicinity, with attached ridging
moving slowly eastward over CO and the northern Plains.  This will
permit strengthening southwest flow aloft to spread out of the
northern Rockies and across most of MT through the period, ahead of
West Coast troughing.  An embedded, weak shortwave trough -- evident
in moisture-channel imagery over south-central WA and central OR--
should eject northeastward over the Canadian Rockies, 

The 11Z surface analysis showed a cold front offshore from New
England and the Mid-Atlantic, just offshore from the Carolinas, then
across southeastern GA, the eastern FL Panhandle, MS/AL shelf
waters, and coastal LA, becoming a warm front northwestward over
east and north TX to northeastern NM.  The Atlantic segment should
proceed farther offshore, and sag southward into portions of
northern FL and the north-central Gulf, while the western parts
stalls from north-central/northwest TX to northeastern NM.  Warm
frontogenesis over the north-central High Plains -- just east of a
lee trough -- should connect with the south-central High Plains
pre-existing frontal zone by late in the period. 

...Northern High Plains...
Widely scattered to scattered, high-based thunderstorms are expected
to form first over higher terrain of southeastern and south-central
MT during early/mid afternoon, then move northeastward into a
rapidly destabilizing and weakly capped (at most) boundary layer
over the adjoining High Plains.  Supercells with large hail and
isolated severe gusts, as well as small clusters with mainly severe
gusts and isolated hail, are possible. Activity should cross much of
central MT before becoming weaker and more isolated as it moves into
nocturnally stabilizing air this evening.

While the WA/OR shortwave trough and associated DCVA/UVV field are
progged to pass northwest of the area, it should tighten the height
gradient in mid/upper levels.  This will combine with low-level
southeasterlies to yield favorable deep shear for supercells. 
Progged effective-shear magnitudes vary highly across models and
from place to place within the same model (generally 30-55 kt)
depending on depth of the CAPE layer, which mostly is a function of
how vigorous and deep the mixing process is.  As per its bias, RAP-
rooted guidance (RAP, HRRR) appear to be mixing too much over
central MT, with most other HREF members and NAM showing more
realistic vertical thermodynamic profiles and greater overall
buoyancy.  Peak MLCAPE should reach 1000-1500 J/kg from northwestern
NE to east-central MT, decreasing westward to around 500-1000 J/kg
over west-central MT.  Higher CAPE values are possible over a
narrow, north-south corridor in the western Dakotas, but amidst
weaker deep-layer forcing and stronger capping near the mid/upper
ridge, inhibiting sustained and especially severe convective
potential.

...South-central High Plains...
Strong elevation-relative heating will support preferential removal
of MLCINH, followed by and related mid/late-afternoon thunderstorm
development, over the higher terrain of southern CO, on either side
of the San Luis Valley.  Activity should move eastward to east-
southeastward over deeper, well-mixed boundary layers characteristic
of the valley and the High Plains, while offering isolated severe
gusts and hail for a few hours before weakening in the evening. 
This close to the mid/upper anticyclone center, deep-later flow will
be weak, keeping shear weak and severe potential isolated and
disorganized.  However, steep lapse rates in a well-mixed boundary
layer may support severe gusts and perhaps hail from the most
vigorous, sustained cells and small clusters.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 AM CDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad southwesterly mid-level flow, and a progressive shortwave
trough moving through the northern Great Basin/Northwest U.S., will
bring sustained dry/windy conditions to portions of Nevada, Utah,
and Idaho on Wednesday. 

...Dry/Windy...
Deep boundary-layer mixing beneath broad southwesterly mid-level
flow, and a progressive shortwave trough moving from northern
Nevada/southern Oregon into Idaho and Montana, will be responsible
for elevated fire-weather conditions across the Great Basin on
Wednesday. High-resolution ensemble guidance suggests there may be a
narrow corridor of critical fire-weather conditions across Nevada,
where relative humidity values will drop into the single digits and
winds could get as high as 20-25 MPH. This area currently overlaps
with fuels that are not expected to be receptive to wildfire spread,
with ERC values around the 60th-65th annual percentiles. However,
with dry/windy conditions expected the preceding day, some
additional curing of fuels can be expected, and critical highlights
could be needed in subsequent updates. 

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms will be possible across
southwestern Montana, with additional dry thunderstorm development
likely across southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. However,
current fuels guidance suggests that both of these regions are
unlikely to be receptive to new ignitions and wildfire spread, with
ERC values below the 60th annual percentile for both regions.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0457 PM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Omega blocking over the central CONUS is forecast to remain through
the majority of the extended forecast period. On the western flank
of the block, mid-level troughing will persist over parts of the
West Coast into next weekend. Enhanced flow aloft, with several
embedded shortwave troughs will support periodic dry and breezy
conditions over parts of the Northwest and Great Basin. Toward the
end of the week, a strong upper low will move south along the coast
supporting an increase in thunderstorm potential, along with
continued dry and breezy conditions over the Great Basin. Elevated
to potentially critical fire-weather conditions are possible.

...Northwest and Great Basin...
Moderate southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to remain in place
over the western US through much of the week. With stronger flow
aloft overspreading a warm and dry air mass across parts of the
southern Northwest and Great Basin, dry and windy conditions are
possible through midweek. Elevated to critical fire-weather
conditions are possible over parts of NV, UT and into southern OR/ID
through D5/Friday. Confidence in stronger sustained winds
overlapping critical RH and dry fuels is somewhat limited currently,
though the approach of the upper low/trough is expected to support
potentially higher gusts over much of the Southwest D4/Thursday and
into the weekend.

Increasing monsoon moisture is also expected over parts of the
Western US beginning D4/Thursday. Medium-range guidance shows a
plume of 0.6 to 0.8 inch PWATs moving into the Pacific Northwest
ahead of the upper low. Some dry lightning will be possible with
isolated to widely scattered storms through D6/Saturday. Confidence
is highest that dry thunder probabilities could be needed over parts
of northern and central OR through the end of the work week.
However, the exact storm coverage and overlap with the best fuels
remains uncertain.

## Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 6

date: 2024-08-19, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

WTPZ42 KNHC 192041
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

ASCAT data valid at 1644 UTC showed that Gilma has strengthened 
slightly and its wind field has grown a little. While the tropical 
storm is still sheared, maximum winds measured by the ASCAT were 
between 40 and 45 kt, which after accounting for undersampling 
supports an intensity around 50 kt. An average of the most recent 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB also yields 50 kt, so that is the 
intensity estimate for this advisory. The maximum extent of 34 kt 
winds is estimated to be around 70 n mi based on the ASCAT data, 
mostly to the southwest in the deep convection.

Although the track forecast spread in the model guidance remains 
unusually high, not much change was made to the NHC forecast, except 
to show a slightly faster forward motion in 24-48 h. Otherwise, 
Gilma is still expected to slow down and turn west-northwestward 
within the next day as the ridge currently steering the storm is 
gradually eroded by a deep-layer trough off the U.S. west coast. 
There is still quite a bit of difference between the models in the 
forward speed of Gilma, so the NHC forecast closely follows the 
consensus throughout the forecast. 

Only small adjustments were made to the intensity forecast. Gilma 
should remain sheared for another day or so, limiting the potential 
for strengthening during that period.  After that, the shear should 
decrease and Gilma should strengthen.  Most models continue to 
indicate that Gilma will approach hurricane strength later this 
week. The NHC intensity forecast remains very close to the various 
intensity consensus aids.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Valid 192000Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...AND OVER WESTERN MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of the
northern and central High Plains, and over western Montana into
tonight. Large hail and severe gusts are the primary hazards.

...20Z Update...
Within the Slight Risk area over the central High Plains, 15-percent
wind probabilities were added over parts of eastern CO. Here, ample
diurnal heating/steepening low-level lapse rates has increased
confidence in a slightly greater concentration of severe wind gusts
-- especially with any clusters that evolve eastward into this
evening. For more details, reference MCD #1956 and Severe
Thunderstorm Watch #639. Farther north, the Slight Risk was expanded
slightly eastward into western ND, where filtered diurnal heating
and an eventual increase in the low-level jet should favor localized
upscale growth and a continued severe-wind risk into tonight. See
MCD #1958 for additional details.

From portions of the Northeast into the Mid-Atlantic, scattered
thunderstorms will continue tracking eastward along/ahead of a cold
front through the afternoon, posing a risk of locally damaging wind
gusts. The Marginal Risk was trimmed slightly behind the front in
the Northeast. For details, see MCDs #1955/1957.

..Weinman.. 08/19/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1117 AM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024/

...High Plains...
Moderately strong westerly mid-level winds are present today from MT
to CO, with several weak perturbations noted on water vapor imagery
within the flow.  Steep mid-level lapse rates and dewpoints in the
60s will lead to a narrow corridor of favorable CAPE later today for
strong/severe thunderstorm development.  Clusters of convection will
form over the mountains and foothills of CO/WY and spread eastward
into the higher instability axis.  Other areas of storms are
expected to develop over the Black Hills, and across parts of
eastern MT.  Large hail is the main concern with these storms,
although the risk of isolated damaging wind will also increase
during the late afternoon and evening as outflows congeal.

...Western MT...
12z model guidance continues to agree on the development of
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon over the mountains of western
MT.  This region will be on the eastern fringe of stronger flow
aloft, and where full sunshine will aid in destabilization and
steepening of low-level lapse rates.  As storms move off the higher
terrain, merging outflows may result in strong/damaging wind gusts
in the more organized storm clusters.  One mitigating factor for
severe in this region would be if the persistent cloud cover east of
the mountains limits destabilization.

...Southeast VA/Northeast NC...
Strong daytime heating is occurring today over parts of southeast VA
and northeast NC, where dewpoints in the upper 60s and 70s will
yield MLCAPE values around 2000 J/kg.  Scattered afternoon
thunderstorms are expected.  Low and mid-level winds are relatively
weak today, suggesting that storms will struggle to organize. 
However, given the extent of heating, a few cells may occasionally
pose a risk of gusty winds through the early evening.

...New England...
An upper trough is moving across the Northeast US today, with the
associated surface cold front tracking eastward across much of New
England this afternoon.  Scattered thunderstorms are expected along
the front.  Visible satellite imagery suggest considerable cloud
cover over this region, limiting daytime heating and suppressing
steeper low-level lapse rates.  This should lessen the overall
severe threat today.  Nevertheless, a few storms could produce gusty
winds and/or hail.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE
MONTANA/NORTH DAKOTA BORDER VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered to potentially scattered storms will be possible on
Wednesday across parts of the northern High Plains. Severe winds and
large hail could occur. Marginally severe storms will be possible
westward into central Montana and southward into the central High
Plains.

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will continue across portions of the Western
U.S. A mid-level shortwave trough is expected to lift northeastward
through the northern Rockies into the northern High Plains late
Wednesday afternoon into the evening. A surface low will deepen near
the Montana/North Dakota border with a lee trough extending into the
central High Plains.

...Montana into North Dakota...
Convection is likely to form within the higher terrain of southwest
Montana. Deep-layer shear will be strong, but buoyancy will be weak
to modest. Strong/severe wind gusts and isolated large hail are
possible. Greater uncertainty exists in the exact scenario for the
Montana/North Dakota border vicinity. With the surface low
deepening, a few storms could initiate during the
mid/late-afternoon. These storms would have a greater chance at
maintaining a supercellular mode. Severe wind gusts and large hail
would be the main hazards with this scenario. However, mid-level
heights will be mostly neutral through the day before modest falls
occur by early evening and low-level forcing will be limited as
well. A second possibility is for activity in Montana to move into
the border region during early/mid-evening. Severe winds would be
the primary hazard with what would likely be outflow-dominant
storms. Given the late timing of these storms, it is not certain how
much severe coverage there would be. The 15% severe probability area
will be maintained this cycle with guidance hopefully providing more
clarity in the coming days.

...Black Hills into central High Plains...
Isolated to widely scattered storms are possible within the lee
trough. Shear will be weaker with southern extent. A few severe
gusts and marginally severe hail could occur with the strongest
storms during the afternoon.

...Mid-Missouri Valley...
Some convection may be ongoing in eastern South Dakota into southern
Minnesota early in the period. Some outflow can be expected with
this activity. With the MCV, flow aloft will be enhanced into
eastern Nebraska. While a conditional threat for a strong/severe
storm exists, low/mid-level forcing will be weak and storm
initiation is far from certain.

## Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2024-08-19, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

000
WTPZ42 KNHC 191443
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Recent AMSR and SSMIS imagery indicate that Gilma's center is 
located near the northeast edge of its deep convection, with little 
deep convection present in its northeast quadrant. This is due, at 
least in part, to upper-level easterly winds that are causing some 
shear across the cyclone. A consensus of objective and subjective 
intensity estimates from SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS support an initial 
intensity of 45 kt for this advisory, which also agree well with 
earlier ASCAT data.

The aforementioned wind shear is expected to persist for at least 
another day or two, which should limit the potential for 
strengthening. After around 36 h, global models indicate the shear 
will begin to decrease, which should allow for more strengthening. 
The exact timing of this strengthening is still highly uncertain, 
with several global models suggesting it could begin near the 36 h 
mark, while the HWRF indicates it won't begin to strengthen until 
closer to 60 h. Regardless, there is a good chance that Gilma will 
become a hurricane at some point before the end of the week. No 
significant changes were made to the intensity forecast, which 
follows the HCCA and IVCN intensity models. 

The track forecast is also largely unchanged from the previous NHC 
advisory. Gilma is currently moving west near 12 kt. A ridge 
extending westward from the southwest United States should keep 
Gilma on a similar heading today. After that, the tropical storm 
may interact with another disturbance to its west, while a trough 
off the U.S. west coast will begin to erode the ridge slightly. All 
models indicate that Gilma will generally slow down and turn 
west-northwestward in response to these steering changes, but there 
is unusually high spread in the guidance on the exact track the 
cyclone will take. The NHC track forecast follows the consensus 
aids, but confidence in the specifics of the forecast is lower than 
normal due to the high model spread.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 AM CDT Sun Aug 18 2024

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE MIDDLE
ATLANTIC TO THE DEEP SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered wind damage will be possible from the Mid-Atlantic States
to the Deep South from mid-afternoon to early evening on Sunday.

...Middle Atlantic to Deep South...

Great Lakes/OH Valley upper trough will shift east today with a
19/00z position forecast along the spine of the Appalachians. Modest
500mb flow should extend within the base of the trough into the
Middle Atlantic. This flow regime will aid the organizational
potential of convection that evolves ahead of the primary synoptic
front. Latest model guidance suggests a weak surface low may develop
over northern VA/MD by late afternoon and this feature should track
into NJ during the overnight hours. While deep-layer flow is not
forecast to be exceptionally strong, 0-6km bulk shear will exceed
30kt within a warm-advection zone. Forecast soundings favor storm
rotation and a few supercells may ultimately evolve across this
region. In addition to damaging wind threat, some risk for hail and
perhaps a brief tornado can be expected.

Trailing front across the Deep South will not be particularly
convergent as it surges into GA-AL-MS. Pre-frontal boundary layer
will be adequately buoyant for robust updrafts and any storms that
evolve ahead of the wind shift will do so within an environment that
favors some organization. Convection will propagate southeast toward
the Gulf Coast as northwesterly flow deepens with trough passage.

...Rockies/Central Plains...

Water-vapor imagery depicts a well-defined short-wave trough topping
the Rockies ridge over western WY at this time. This feature will
track southeast across the central Plains this afternoon as a 500mb
speed max translates into the lower MO Valley. LLJ will respond to
this feature which should contribute to an extensive zone of
elevated convection early in the period. This activity will
propagate southeast along a sharp corridor of warm advection into
eastern KS, then into the lower MS Valley during the overnight
hours. Have increased severe probabilities to account for this
evolution. Primary concern is damaging winds.

...Interior West...

Isolated strong/locally severe thunderstorms will once again develop
across western UT and track north-northeast along the
western/northern periphery of the dominant anticyclone. Gusty winds
are possible with this diurnally enhanced activity.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0745 PM CDT Sat Aug 17 2024

Valid 180100Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG/JUST EAST OF
THE WASHINGTON/OREGON CASCADES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will spread across portions of
southwest Washington this evening. Hail/wind remain possible.
Isolated damaging gusts are also expected with convection across
portions of the southern Appalachians into the Ohio Valley.

...01z Update...

Notable short-wave trough is currently ejecting north across
northern CA into western OR. Water-vapor imagery also suggests a
lead disturbance may be associated with a fairly extensive cluster
of deep convection as it advances across northern OR into southwest
WA. Surface temperatures are holding in the lower 90s across lower
elevations of southern WA east of the Cascades. Latest diagnostic
data suggests a narrow corridor of higher instability extends
along/just east of the Cascades. While convection should
spread/develop north along the higher terrain, northeasterly
low-level flow should contribute to robust updrafts capable of
generating hail/wind.

Northwesterly flow is deepening across the southern Appalachians
early this evening as the upper trough progresses steadily east. A
broken band of organized convection is propagating southeast across
northwestern SC/northern GA through an axis of instability
characterized by 1500 MLCAPE. This activity may produce locally
damaging gusts for the next few hours, but otherwise will gradually
decrease in intensity as boundary layer cools this evening.

More isolated convection is observed across KY into the upper OH
Valley. This activity will also gradually wane in intensity as the
evening progresses and low-level lapse rates weaken. Until then, a
few gusts may be noted.
