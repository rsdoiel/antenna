Mesoscale Discussion 1038
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1013 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

Areas affected...northwest OK into adjacent southwest KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 281513Z - 281645Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated hail to around 1.75 inches diameter is possible
the next 1-2 hours across northwest Oklahoma into adjacent southwest
Kansas.

DISCUSSION...Elevated thunderstorms have developed this morning in
an area of low-level east/southeasterly flow beneath upper northwest
flow. Very steep midlevel lapse rates are supporting modest
instability. VWP data from KVNX shows elongated hodographs above 2-3
km amid deeper shear supporting transient supercells. This activity
will be capable of producing severe hail to near 1.75 inches over
the next 1-2 hours. With southward extent, overnight convection and
outflow has modified the airmass into parts of southwest and central
OK. The expectation is that this cluster of storms should gradually
decrease in intensity with southeast extent over the next couple of
hours. Trends will be monitored but watch issuance is not currently
expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1037
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0900 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

Areas affected...northeast Texas into western Louisiana

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 341...

Valid 281400Z - 281530Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 341
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong gusts of 45-65 mph remain possible with
east/southeast propagating bow over northeast Texas.

DISCUSSION...An organized and strong bow continues to shift
east/southeast across northeast TX along an instability gradient.
Recent radar data shows an outflow boundary associated with an area
of convection to the northeast of the bow surging southeast and
intersecting the bow near its apex. This may have a deleterious
impact on the organization of the bow over the next hour. The
strongest measured gust noted in the past 30-60 minutes was a 47 kt
gust at KTYR. Strong to severe gusts of 45 to 65 mph and isolated
hail remain possible in the near term. Trends will be monitored for
possible downstream watch issuance into parts of western/central LA.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 341
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
710 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast and east central Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 710 AM until NOON CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A storm cluster with embedded bowing segments and some
supercell structure will continue southeastward into east Texas
through late morning/midday.  These storms will pose a threat for
damaging winds up to 80 mph, and well as isolated large hail of 1-2
inches in diameter.  An isolated tornado or two may occur with
embedded circulations, as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 35
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles north of Tyler
TX to 15 miles east southeast of Lufkin TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 340...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
32035.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 340
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
440 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North central Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 440 AM until 1100 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely

SUMMARY...Clusters of storms, including embedded supercells, will
likely persist through at least mid morning while moving
south-southeastward toward the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and areas
farther south.  Swaths of damage with 60-80 mph winds will be
possible, especially on the west flank of embedded supercells. 
Large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter can also be expected with the
more intense storms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles north of Fort
Worth TX to 35 miles south of Corsicana TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CDT Tue May 28 2024

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH EARLY
TONIGHT FOR PARTS OF EAST...CENTRAL AND WEST TX...

...SUMMARY...
Corridors of severe wind of 60-80 mph and occasional very large hail
(in excess of 2 inches in diameter) can be expected with multiple
convective clusters across east/southeast Texas and far southwest
Louisiana through this afternoon, and from west into central Texas
later this afternoon into tonight.

...TX/southwest LA through tonight...
A complex situation is unfolding this morning across TX, with an
initial, severe MCS (that evolved from earlier/elevated convection)
surging southeastward from north central into east TX.  This MCS has
a history of measured 75-80 mph gusts and it will likely move along
the strong buoyancy gradient near and east of the Trinity River. 
The MCS will be maintained by a corridor of mid-upper 70s dewpoints
and extreme MLCAPE up to 4000 J/kg.  Deep-layer vertical shear is
strong enough to help maintain organization of the MCS, while the
extreme buoyancy/steep lapse rate environment will also favor a
continuation of strong downdrafts with the potential to produce
additional gusts of 75-80 mph into southeast TX this afternoon
(possibly including the Houston metro area).

Farther west, outflow from the ongoing convection may help focus
additional storm development this afternoon into west central and
central TX, or could serve as an effective eastern boundary to
storms that form and move east of the southern High Plains and
Trans-Pecos.  Expect a mix of supercells with very large hail (in
excess of 2 inches in diameter) and some upscale growth into
clusters/line segments with the potential to produce severe outflow
winds of 60-75 mph from later this afternoon into early tonight.

...Elsewhere...
A midlevel shortwave trough over MN this morning will progress
southeastward toward IL by this evening.  Ascent preceding the
midlevel trough, cool midlevel temperatures and lingering low-level
moisture could be sufficient for a few storms to produce marginally
severe hail and/or strong outflow gusts this afternoon/evening from
southern WI to northern IL/northwest IN.  Farther west, a midlevel
trough will move inland over WA/OR and the associated deep
baroclinic zone will approach the northern Rockies.  Moisture will
be limited in this zone, but some high-based convection could
produce isolated strong-severe outflow gusts late this
afternoon/evening.
