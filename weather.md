Mesoscale Discussion 1890
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025

Areas affected...south central North Dakota and adjacent north
central South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051940Z - 052145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorm activity, perhaps including the
evolution of a sustained supercell appears probable by 5-7 PM CDT,
if not earlier, before transitioning to an organizing, southeastward
propagating cluster into this evening.  A severe weather watch will
likely be needed, but timing remains uncertain.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a generally dissipating cluster of
thunderstorms spreading into the Red River Valley,
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection is being maintained across
much of the Dakotas, on the northern periphery of a plume of warm
and capping elevated mixed-layer air.  This includes temperatures as
warm as +10 to +12 C around 700 mb, as far northeast as southwestern
North Dakota through north central and northeastern South Dakota,
beneath which stronger boundary-layer warming and destabilization is
ongoing.

Around and north through east of the Bismarck ND vicinity, the
boundary-layer has been slower to modify in the wake of the
preceding convection, but forcing for ascent has been sufficient to
overcome inhibition and support renewed thunderstorm development. 
This has been gradually increasing near the nose of a 30 kt
southerly low-level jet, which may strengthen a bit further into
early evening.  Northward advection of warmer and more moist
boundary-layer air along this axis is likely to contribute to
substantive further boundary-layer destabilization, and, at some
point, a rapid intensification of thunderstorm activity.  

Once this occurs, in the presence of strong deep-layer shear beneath
30-40 kt westerly 500 mb flow, the environment appears conducive to
the evolution of a significant supercell with potential to produce
large hail and perhaps a couple of tornadoes, before growing growing
upscale into an organizing southeastward propagating cluster by this
evening.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 7

TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Tue Aug 05 2025
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a convective
curved band on the west side of the cyclone and a cluster of strong
thunderstorms with cold cloud tops of -70 Celsius just to the west 
of Henriette's surface circulation center.  The initial intensity is
held at 45 kt for this advisory and is based on a blend of the
TAFB and SAB subjective and CIMSS objective intensity estimates.
 
Little change in strength is expected during the next couple of 
days, although 5-kt fluctuations are possible, while Henriette 
moves  over slightly cooler water and through an increasingly 
inhibiting thermodynamic environment.  Toward the end of the week, 
the thermodynamic environment is expected to become even more
hostile while Henriette moves over the subtropical central
Pacific waters.  Therefore, some weakening of the cyclone is 
forecast through day 5.  The official intensity forecast is based 
on the IVCN intensity consensus model and the Decay-SHIPS 
statistical aid.
 
Henriette's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward,
or 295/13 kt, and a west-northwestward or westward motion should 
continue through day 4 while the cyclone is steered by a strong 
mid-level ridge stretching across the subtropical Central Pacific.  
Over the weekend, Henriette is expected to turn gradually 
northwestward in response to an amplifying mid- to 
upper-tropospheric trough approaching the Hawaiian Islands from the
Central North Pacific.  The NHC track forecast is based on the 
various consensus aids and is basically an update of the previous 
advisory.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0318 PM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025

Valid 071200Z - 131200Z

A mid-level trough will gradually progress across the northwestern
U.S. through the weekend, before ejecting into the Plains and zonal
flow becoming established west of the Rockies by early next week.
Multiple mid-level impulses are poised to pivot around the main
upper trough, promoting critically dry and windy conditions across
parts of the Interior West toward the end of this week, with
isolated dry thunderstorms possible each day through the weekend.

...Days 3-4 (Thursday-Friday) - Great Basin into the Rockies...
As multiple mid-level impulses continue to graze the Interior West,
15-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface wind should coincide with
5-15 percent RH Thursday and Friday. Fuels are receptive across the
entire region, and 40/70 percent highlights have been added where
confidence is highest in the aforementioned dry/windy conditions
overlapping for several hours each afternoon. Surface winds should
be strongest across the Great Basin on Thursday, where high-end
Critical conditions are possible as a 500 mb wind maximum glances by
to the north. 

...Days 3-6 (Thursday-Sunday) - Portions of the Southwest...
Toward the end of the week into the weekend, isolated thunderstorm
development is expected each afternoon to the immediate south and
east of the Four Corners region. Modest southwesterly 500 mb flow
pivoting around an upper ridge will encourage forward motion of any
thunderstorms that develop. Given the presence of a hot and dry
boundary layer across the Southwest, these storms should be
high-based, with at least a mix of wet/dry storms likely. Isolated
dry thunderstorm highlights have been added on Thursday-Sunday for
areas that have experienced minimal rainfall, and where fuels appear
to be highly susceptible to lightning-induced ignitions.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE DAKOTAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms with an accompanying risk for large
hail, severe wind gusts, and perhaps a couple of tornadoes will be
possible this afternoon through much of the evening across the
Dakotas.

...20z Update...
No changes were made to the D1 Convective Outlook. 

Air mass recovery trends continue to be monitored across the Dakotas
in the wake of morning convection. Breaks in the cloud cover have
led to heating across central/western South Dakota to the southern
North Dakota line. Warm moist air continues to spread northward
south of the differential heating boundary located across southern
ND into central SD. It appears that redevelopment/re-intensification
of thunderstorm activity is likely through the afternoon as further
destabilization continues. See MCD#1890 for more detailed
information on expected storm evolution through the afternoon.

..Thornton.. 08/05/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025/

...Northern Plains...
Visible-satellite/radar mosaic imagery late this morning shows a
cluster of sub-severe thunderstorms associated with a lead lobe of
mid-level ascent/MCV moving through the base of a larger-scale
trough centered over MT/Saskatchewan.  Deleterious effects of
widespread cloud cover over far northern SD into ND will likely
hinder appreciable destabilization through the early afternoon. 
However, earlier forecast thinking of a differential heating zone
becoming more focused along the ND-SD border to the east of a weak
cyclone will potentially become consequential for the severe risk
later this afternoon/evening.  

A reservoir of adequately rich low-level moisture with dewpoints in
the mid-upper 60s deg F will likely protrude northward into southern
ND as the airmass destabilizes this afternoon.  Cloud breaks will
contribute to moderate to strong buoyancy (1500-3500 J/kg MLCAPE) to
the south of more stable conditions likely being maintained
throughout the day near the Canadian border.  Forecast soundings
show enlarged low-level hodographs by mid-late afternoon and into
the evening with a 40-kt southerly LLJ centered on SD.  

Short-term model guidance indicates renewed storm development is
most likely east of the low along the differential heating zone with
this activity spreading east into more vorticity-rich air. 
Seasonably large uncertainty remains regarding this forecast during
the 22-02z period in which peak severe may occur.  Supercells
capable of all hazards will be possible before clusters evolve and
the propensity for cold pool coalescence becomes detrimental for the
supercell threat and wind becomes the primary hazard later this
evening.  Considerable uncertainty exists overnight on the potential
evolution of a cluster and an incipient wind threat into parts of
the MO Valley and Upper Midwest.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE NORTHERN
GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from late afternoon into
Thursday night across the northern Great Plains. Isolated very large
hail and significant severe wind gusts may occur.

...Northern Great Plains...
While mesoscale details at this timeframe are unclear, potential
exists for higher-end severe intensity and coverage on Thursday late
afternoon into the night. A shortwave trough will amplify across the
Northwest and northern Rockies, as a vigorous impulse digs
southeastward from coastal BC. Downstream, the elevated mixed layer
will expand across the Dakotas and MN. A lack of widespread
convective overturning on D2 will support seasonably rich
boundary-layer moisture advecting northwestward across the Dakotas
to eastern MT. This will yield large to potentially extreme buoyancy
by peak heating Thursday, centered on northern NE into southern ND.

Scattered thunderstorms will develop off the higher terrain of
southwest/south-central MT by late afternoon to early evening.
Storms will spread east-northeast and impinge on the pronounced
buoyancy plume during the evening/night, potentially sustaining an
intensifying MCS. Meanwhile, some guidance suggests separate
late-day storm development will occur along the strengthening
baroclinic zone in ND, with isolated storms possible southward along
a lee trough. This activity too could grow upscale, mainly in ND,
and progress towards the Red River Valley on Thursday night.
Significant severe appears most likely in the ND portion of the
level 2-SLGT risk. Very large hail is possible in initial
supercells, in addition to significant severe gusts during the
downstream cluster/MCS phase. 

...Upper Midwest...
Nebulous, low-probability severe potential is evident along the
northeast lobe of the expansive buoyancy plume over the central
states on Thursday into Thursday night. Minor MCVs from remnants of
D2 convection may focus localized corridors of diurnal storm
development from the IA/IL/WI border region to western Upper MI.
More probable convective development should occur Thursday night,
north-northeast of the southern High Plains to Lower MO Valley
low-level jet. Amid modest northwesterlies but weak lapse rates in
the mid levels, mainly strong to perhaps marginally severe
intensities are anticipated.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 PM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO
THE CENTRAL ROCKIES...

The main change made to the Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook update was to
expand isolated dry thunderstorm highlights into eastern Utah. Here,
sparse thunderstorm development is possible. However, fuels are
quite receptive to fire spread, so any lightning strikes that manage
to occur will have high ignition potential. Otherwise, the previous
forecast remains on track, with no other changes made.

..Squitieri.. 08/05/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025/

...Synopsis...
Similar to Day 1/Tuesday, enhanced west-southwesterly flow aloft
will remain in place across much of the Great Basin into the
northern/central Rockies -- between an expansive midlevel
anticyclone over the Southwest and an increasingly pronounced
large-scale trough over the Northwest. 

...Great Basin into the central Rockies...
The enhanced deep-layer west-southwesterly flow will overspread a
dry/deeply mixed boundary layer during the afternoon. As a result,
10-15 percent RH will develop amid 15-20 mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds. The greatest overlap of strong
winds and low RH is expected beneath the core of the stronger
deep-layer flow -- extending from east-central NV across
southern/central UT and northwest CO. Here, the combination of hot,
dry, and breezy conditions atop receptive fuels will favor another
day of critical fire-weather conditions. 

...Dry Thunderstorms - Southwest into the central Rockies...
A midlevel moisture plume will expand northeastward from the
Southwest into the central Rockies, supporting isolated diurnally
driven thunderstorms over the higher terrain during the afternoon.
Inverted-V soundings and 0.50-0.75 inch PW will favor mostly dry
storms, which will pose a risk of lightning-induced ignitions and
gusty/erratic outflow winds.

1224 PM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE
NORTH-CENTRAL STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
North-Central States on Wednesday into Wednesday night.

...North-Central States...
Low probability severe potential remains evident across the region
with multiple scenarios anticipated amid fairly nebulous large-scale
ascent. Initial threat should be in the southeastern lobe across the
Lower MO Valley vicinity with potential for an ongoing MCS. As
discussed in the SWODY1, considerable uncertainty exists overnight
with evolution of such an MCS but the overall signal is for a
weakening trend after 12Z. A distinct minority of guidance indicates
some potential for diurnal intensification with a remnant MCV.
Sporadic strong gusts capable of localized damage seems plausible in
the morning and perhaps into the afternoon.

Conditionally, the most favorable environment for severe should be
across the Black Hills vicinity and the NE Panhandle as convective
outflow from late D1 is pushed south into the central High Plains.
North of this outflow, a moderately supportive supercell environment
should exist. At least isolated thunderstorms should develop late
afternoon to early evening. But low-amplitude ridging between a
shortwave trough in the southern Canadian Prairies and a minor
trough in the Northwest should modulate overall coverage. Isolated
large hail and severe gusts should be anticipated into late evening.

Downstream low-level warm theta-e advection should be centered over
the Mid-MO to Upper MS Valleys on Wednesday night where a few
marginally severe storms are possible. A few strong storms may also
occur across northern MN during the afternoon, owing to trailing
influence of the southern Canadian Prairies wave. Scattered storm
coverage should be confined along the international border, but
modest mid-level lapse rates should temper convective vigor.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS MUCH OF
NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms associated with a threat for severe gusts and large
hail will be possible across parts of the Dakotas today into this
evening.

...Northern Plains...
Warm-air advection showers and thunderstorms are ongoing this
morning across the western Dakotas, where the western edge of the
low-level jet overlaps the eastern edge of the steep mid-level lapse
rates. These storms will likely continue northeastward this morning,
perhaps even expanding in coverage, as the low-level jet persists
and large-scale ascent attendant to an approaching shortwave trough
strengthens. Occasionally strong updrafts could produce hail and a
damaging gust or two. 

Cloud cover and outflow associated with these storms could result in
an effective warm front extending from a weak low over western SD
eastward across central and eastern SD. The exact location and
sharpness of this front remain uncertain. Given that the shortwave
trough will likely remain well west of the region, low-level
convergence near this boundary as well as the surface low should
both be areas where convective initiation is most likely this
afternoon. Ample buoyancy and vertical shear will be in place for
supercells with the initial development, with large hail and
damaging gusts as the primary risks. Stronger low to mid-level flow
may be in place across eastern SD, contributing to greater low-level
shear and relatively higher tornado potential. Primary concern
across eastern SD is whether or not the warmer low to mid-level
temperatures inhibit the development of mature updrafts.

One other scenario that seems plausible is for storms on southern
periphery the ongoing cluster to become increasingly surface based
as they move eastward/northeastward with time. Given current trends
and recent guidance, this would most likely occur along the eastern
ND/SD border after 20Z. As previously mentioned, hail is possible
within this cluster throughout the day, but the transition to a more
surface-based character could introduce the threat for stronger
gusts as well.

A strengthening low-level jet coupled with persistent mid-level
westerlies support the potential for upscale growth in a
east-southeastward progressing MCS. Damaging gusts will be possible
with this MCS, particularly over SD, but increasing low-level
stability should result in a gradually diminishing severe potential

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025

Valid 081200Z - 131200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Friday/Day 4 to Sunday/Day 6...
On Friday, a mid-level trough and an associated speed max is
forecast to move into the northern Plains. At the surface, a moist
airmass will be in place over much of the northern Plains, where
surface dewpoints are likely to be in the lower to mid 70s F. As
surface temperatures warm during the day, moderate to strong
instability is expected to develop. Along the northwestern edge of
this unstable airmass, thunderstorms should form in parts of central
and eastern North Dakota. Convective coverage is forecast to expand
southward into South Dakota during the evening. Moderate to strong
deep-layer shear associated with the speed max will be favorable for
a severe threat during the afternoon and evening. Supercells with
large hail, severe wind gusts and a tornado threat will be possible.


On Saturday, the mid-level trough and associated cold front are
forecast to move eastward into the upper Mississippi and mid
Missouri Valleys. Thunderstorms are forecast to be ongoing along and
near the front during the morning, with additional thunderstorm
development taking place further southeast in the afternoon.
Moderate instability and deep-layer shear is forecast across much of
the region, suggesting that a severe threat will again be possible.
There is some uncertainty as to how much the airmass will be
negatively affected by the morning convection. Also, model forecasts
suggest that the greatest convective potential will be during the
overnight period on Saturday. For this reason, will not add a threat
area for Saturday at this time.

On Sunday, a mid-level trough is forecast to move across the
north-central U.S., being positioned from the northern Plains to the
central Rockies by afternoon. A moderately unstable airmass is
forecast further to the east, from the upper Mississippi Valley
southward into the mid Missouri Valley. An isolated severe threat
will be possible Sunday afternoon along and near the instability
axis. However, the mid-level trough is forecast to remain well to
the west of the instability axis, which should limit large-scale
ascent over the unstable airmass, helping to keep any severe threat
isolated.

...Monday/Day 7 and Tuesday/Day 8...
A low-amplitude mid-level trough is forecast to move into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Monday, and into the western Great Lakes on
Tuesday. Further southwest, a mid-level low is forecast across the
central Plains. Thunderstorms will be possible on Monday and Tuesday
afternoon, along the northern edge of a moist airmass from the
central Plains northeastward to the Great Lakes. Model forecasts
suggest that deep-layer shear will be relatively weak. Although
convective coverage and any associated severe threat will likely
remain isolated, a few marginally severe storms could occur in areas
that heat up the most.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-08-05, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPZ43 KNHC 050842
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Mon Aug 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette has degraded some since the 
previous advisory, with cloud tops warming and the curved band 
structure becoming more fragmented.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 3.0/45 kt, while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged from 37 to 46 kt 
during the past several hours.  Meanwhile, a timely 05/0545Z Metop-C 
ASCAT pass showed several 40-45 kt wind barbs, assisting with 
determining the initial intensity as well as the extent of the 
tropical-storm-force wind radii.  The initial intensity for this 
advisory has been held at 45 kt.

The cyclone is moving west-northwest, or 290 degrees, at 13 knots.  
This general motion is expected to continue during the next day or 
so, as Henriette moves along the southern edge of a subtropical 
ridge to the north.  Between 36 and 72 hours, a slight turn toward 
the west is forecast as the ridge strengthens north of the cyclone.  
Beyond 72 hours, a turn back toward the west-northwest or northwest 
is anticipated as an amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii 
erodes the western extent of the subtropical ridge steering the 
cyclone.  The official track forecast closely follows a blend of 
the latest HCCA/TVCE/FSSE consensus guidance, and is very close to 
the track from the previous advisory.

Henriette appears to have a brief window for further intensification 
over the next 12 to 18 hours, as sea surface temperatures hover 
between 26 and 26.5C, mid-level moisture remains sufficient, and 
vertical wind shear stays light.  Little change in strength is 
expected then through 36 hours as the cyclone moves over slightly 
cooler water but close to the 26C isotherm, while shear remains 
light and the mid-levels remain moist. Beyond 36 hours, the cyclone 
is expected to move over progressively cooler waters, with mid-level 
moisture decreasing, and these conditions should lead to gradual 
weakening. The official forecast maintains Henriette as a tropical 
cyclone through 120 hours, however, it would not be surprising if it 
transitions into a post-tropical low prior to day 5. The intensity 
forecast is most closely aligned with the FSSE, which is near the 
middle of the intensity guidance envelope.

Mesoscale Discussion 1886
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...northeast WY...southeast MT...and western SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A few supercells may develop with a threat of severe
hail/wind downstream of the Big Horn Mountains and along the
western/southern slopes of the Black Hills. While overall
coverage/intensity should be less compared to farther south in the
central High Plains, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is possible
in the next couple hours.

DISCUSSION...Initial high-based, low-topped thunderstorms have
formed along the lee of the Big Horn Mountains, with a separate arc
of congested CU along the west to south flank of the Black Hills.
Much of the region between and ahead of these regimes is
characterized by upper 40s to mid 50s surface dew points with large
temperature/dew point spreads. This is yielding more modest buoyancy
relative to eastern CO and southwest NE. Still, moderate deep-layer
shear should support a few high-based supercells across southwest SD
into the northeast WY/far southeast MT vicinity by early evening. A
mix of sporadic severe hail and wind appears possible. Expected
coverage/intensity appears marginally supportive of Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1885
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...Central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042035Z - 042230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms are expected to develop through the
afternoon within the higher terrain. These will spread
north/northeast and produce severe winds and isolated large hail. A
watch is possible for parts of central/eastern Montana.

DISCUSSION...Beneath a plume of cirrus overspreading the northern
Rockies, thunderstorms are beginning to initiate and deepen within
southwest into central Montana this afternoon. Additional cumulus
development is also noted along the weak surface trough. Greater
surface heating and moisture farther east has allowed MLCIN to erode
away from the terrain. It may take another 1-2 hours for MLCIN near
the terrain to erode. Over the remainder of the afternoon, scattered
thunderstorms will likely develop and move north and east. Moisture
will have some tendency to mix out where surface heating occurs, but
should support 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE. Shear is currently weak within
the region per VAD and 18Z TFX sounding data. However, this should
improve as the compact mid-level jet moves through the northern
Rockies this evening. Some supercell structures along with linear
segments will be possible. The main hazard will be severe wind gusts
given the large temperature-dewpoint spreads. Isolated large hail
may also occur, especially with supercells.

Mesoscale Discussion 1884
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...the central High Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 042007Z - 042200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated supercells capable of very large hail, severe
gusts, and a brief tornado or two are possible across parts of the
central High Plains. A single or pair of Severe Thunderstorm Watches
will likely be needed.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered high-based CU/CBs have been noted from
the Laramie Mountains to Pikes Peak, with isolated development along
the South Platte and AR Valleys in eastern CO. Much of this initial
activity is occurring where surface dew point depressions of 35-45 F
are common. This suggests convection may struggle to rapidly
intensify, but should gradually strengthen into early evening.
Farther east, the western extent of low to mid 60s surface dewpoints
exists across far eastern CO, yielding much more ample MLCAPE. Most
guidance suggests at least one storm should become sustained in
southeast CO over the AR Valley and could be a longer-lasting
supercell given the environment. Otherwise, the higher-based
convection to the west and northwest will probably consist of
outflow-dominated supercell structures with a mix of sporadic large
hail and severe gusts.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 3

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 04 2025
 
Conventional satellite imagery shows that the cyclone has become 
better organized, during the past several hours.  A curved band has
developed over the west side of the cyclone, and deep convection is
developing over the surface center.  A 1336 UTC ESA Soil Moisture
Ocean Salinity (SMOS) overpass indicated 34-40 kt winds in the
north quadrant of the cyclone, and a 1746 UTC ASCAT-B pass
revealed 38 kt winds in the same region.  ADT/AiDT and ATMS
sounder objective satellite intensity estimates yield 34 kts, while
the subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB support 35 kt.
Based on these data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical
Storm Henriette with the initial intensity set at 40 kt.
 
The intensity forecast philosophy is unchanged from the previous one 
with gradual strengthening expected during the next couple of days.  
By mid-period, Henriette should slowly weaken and then level off 
with little change in strength as it traverses cooler oceanic 
surface temperatures and moves into a drier, more stable surrounding 
environment.  The NHC intensity forecast has been lowered a bit to 
agree more with the Decay-SHIPS, the IVCN intensity consensus model, 
and the GFS and ECMWF deterministic models.  
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or 295/13 
kt.  The global models indicate that a strong mid- to 
upper-tropospheric ridge anchored to the north of the cyclone should 
continue to steer Henriette in this general direction through 96 
hours.  Around day 5, a gradual turn toward the northwest is 
expected in response to a mid-latitude mid-level trough moving 
toward the Hawaiian Islands from the north-central Pacific.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1138 AM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO THE
CENTRAL ROCKIES...

A minor expansion of the area delineating potential for isolated dry
thunderstorms was made into parts of far northern Nevada and central
Oregon. Some potential for scattered dry thunderstorms exists within
this region, though confined to areas where fuels appear more
marginally receptive to dry lightning ignitions.

The balance of the previous forecast generally remains on track.
Breezy northwest winds across portions of northwest California may
result in brief/localized elevated conditions. Otherwise, see the
discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 08/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025/

...Synopsis...
Along the northwestern periphery of a large-scale ridge extending
from the Southwest into the northern Plains, a compact/robust
midlevel trough will advance east-northeastward from the Northwest
into the northern Rockies during the day. 

...Great Basin into the central Rockies...
Between the large-scale ridge and midlevel trough, a belt of
moderate deep-layer west-southwesterly flow will overspread the
Great Basin into the central Rockies through the afternoon. Here,
deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft will favor
widespread single-digit RH and 15-25 mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds. These dry/windy conditions will
lead to critical fire-weather conditions across much of UT and
adjacent states, given very receptive fuels. 

...Dry Thunderstorms - Intermountain West/Northern Rockies...
Strong/focused forcing for ascent accompanying the midlevel trough
will aid in thunderstorm development across much of the
Intermountain West and northern Rockies throughout the day. Along
the southern periphery of deeper midlevel moisture across parts of
the Northwest into the northern Rockies, isolated high-based
thunderstorms are expected in an air mass characterized by 0.60-0.75
inch PW and inverted-V soundings. This will promote mostly dry
thunderstorms with a risk of lightning-induced ignitions and
strong-severe outflow winds. Reference the SPC Day 1 Convective
Outlook for information on the severe risk.

## Tropical Depression Eight-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

date: 2025-08-04, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>193 
WTPZ43 KNHC 040850
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure
well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula have become better
organized during the past 12 hours. Additionally, an overnight ASCAT
pass showed a well-defined circulation with peak winds near 30 kt.
Given the improved convective organization and well-defined
circulation, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Depression
Eight-E. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt, based on a blend of
the ASCAT pass and Dvorak current intensity estimates from both
TAFB and SAB.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 300/13 kt, along the southern
side of a strong subtropical ridge. This ridge is forecast to remain
in place through the 5-day period, steering the system generally
west-northwestward for the entire forecast. A slightly more westward
motion is possible by day 4 as the cyclone becomes more shallow and
is steered within the low- to mid-level flow. The updated track
forecast is close to the consensus aids.
 
The system is forecast to steadily strengthen during the next couple 
of days as it moves over warm waters and through a moist, low-shear 
environment. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Monday 
and could approach hurricane strength between 36 and 60 hours. After 
that time, a gradual weakening trend is anticipated as the cyclone 
moves over sea surface temperatures below 26 degrees C and begins to 
entrain drier mid-level air within a more stable environment. 
Simulated satellite imagery from the global models supports this 
scenario, showing a reduction in deep convection as the system 
continues west-northwestward into the central Pacific basin. The 
forecast is slightly above the intensity guidance through 60 hours, 
then is in good agreement with the consensus aids thereafter.

0349 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...western KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032049Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will track
south/southeast across western Kansas through early evening. Large
hail and strong gusts are possible with the strongest storms.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
along the strong moisture gradient across northwest KS. Steep
midlevel lapse rates near 8 C/km are aiding in moderate to strong
destabilization with MLCAPE values near 2000-2500 J/kg. While
vertical shear is somewhat modest across northwest KS, these storms
will encounter stronger effective shear magnitudes greater than 30
kt as they track south. These storms will also move into the more
moist boundary layer. As a result, additional convection or
intensification is possible with time and southward extent. The
favorable thermodynamic and kinematic environment will support
isolated large hail. Additionally, some guidance suggests clustering
could occur toward evening. If this scenario occurs, damaging wind
potential could increase as well.  Trends will be monitored for
possible watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1878
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast NM into the OK/TX Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032036Z - 032230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms will develop southeast from
northeast New Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles the next
few hours. A few instances of large hail and strong/severe gusts are
possible.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing this afternoon
within low-level convergence/upslope. Strong heating has allowed
temperatures to climb into the low to mid 80s F behind morning
convection and outflow. South/southeasterly low-level winds have
maintained mid-60s F dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates.
This is fostering moderate destabilization, with 1000-2000 J/kg
MLCAPE noted in 20z mesoanalysis. Vertically veering winds profiles,
with increasing northwesterly flow aloft is contributing to fairly
robust shear, with effective shear magnitudes greater than 40 kts
apparent in regional VWP and mesoanalysis data. This environment
will support organized cells capable of producing large hail and
strong/severe gusts. Convective coverage remains uncertain, but
could increase with southward extent toward evening. This area is
being monitored for possible severe thunderstorm watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1877
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...Southwestern into parts of eastern Oregon

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 031944Z - 032145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will be capable of
strong to severe wind gusts and mainly small hail. A watch is not
expected this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus towers continue to deepen along and east of the
Cascades in southwest Oregon. This is in response to an approaching
shortwave trough. While these thunderstorms have been slow to move
off of the terrain thus far, continued heating in southern/eastern
Oregon will likely erode remaining MLCIN within the next 1-2 hours.
Additional storm development is likely through the afternoon as
well. With elevated convection associated with a small-scale
perturbation moving through northeast Oregon, development within the
Blue Mountains is less certain. However, additional heating during
the afternoon may still be sufficient for this to occur. Steep low
and mid-level lapse rates and 20-25 kts of shear (which will
marginally improve to near 30 kts with time) will result in
marginally organized storms capable of severe wind gusts.
Thermodynamic profiles will be conducive to mainly small hail, but
isolated hail near 1 inch could occur in the most intense storms.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gil Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
500 AM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Cool waters combined with a drier and more stable environment have 
taken their toll on Gil. The system has been devoid of deep 
convection overnight, with only an exposed swirl of low- to 
mid-level clouds remaining. The initial intensity is lowered to 45 
kt, based on a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS. Given the cool 
waters, dry and stable air, and strengthening west-southwesterly 
shear, no new organized convection is expected. Therefore, this will 
be the final advisory on the system as it has become post-tropical. 
Gil is expected to dissipate around midweek as it opens into a 
trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

The initial motion is estimated at 285/16 kt. The system is being 
steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to its north, and this general 
motion is expected to continue into tonight. A gradual decrease in 
forward speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward 
the west as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level 
flow. The updated track forecast remains close to the previous 
advisory and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance 
envelope.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at

## Tropical Storm Gil Forecast Discussion Number 13

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 02 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows the convection north of the low-level 
circulation quickly diminishing as Gil continues west-northwestward 
over progressively cooler waters and into a more stable environment. 
A timely ASCAT pass revealed peak winds of around 45 kt in the 
northern semicircle. Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB range from 3.0/45 kt to 3.5/55 kt, which are 
slightly higher than objective satellite estimates. Based on a blend 
of these data and the ASCAT pass, the initial intensity is set at 50 
kt.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 290/16 kt. Gil is being steered
by a mid-level ridge to its north, and this general motion is
expected to continue Sunday. A gradual decrease in forward
speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward the west
as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level flow. 
The updated track forecast remains close to the previous advisory 
and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance envelope.
 
Continued movement over progressively cooler waters, intrusion of 
dry mid-level air, and the onset of increasing west-southwesterly 
shear should accelerate Gil’s weakening trend. Simulated satellite 
imagery from global models continues to suggest that Gil will lose 
its deep convection and become post-tropical late Sunday, or in 
about 24 hours. The system is then forecast to gradually spin down 
and dissipate within a few days, likely by day 4, as it opens into 
a trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

Day 2 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0304 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

CORRECTED FOR FLIPPED LINE IN NORTHEAST

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms with severe gusts and hail will be possible
on Monday from parts of the northern Rockies into the Dakotas and
central High Plains.

...Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move northeastward across the
Pacific Northwest on Monday. At the surface, a cold front will
advance eastward into the northern Rockies, as upslope easterly flow
remains over the northern High Plains. As surface temperatures warm,
thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon near the
front, and in the higher terrain of the northern Rockies. These
storms will likely increase in coverage by early evening, moving
eastward into the northern High Plains. Surface dewpoints across
much central and eastern Montana are forecast to be in the upper 40s
and lower 50s F, which will contribute to the development of weak
instability by afternoon. Near the forecast pocket of instability,
forecast soundings suggest that 0-6 km shear will be in the 30 to 40
knot range. This, combined with steep low to mid-level lapse rates
near 8 C/km, will likely support an localized severe threat. The
stronger rotating cells could produce hail. Isolated severe gusts
will also be possible, mainly with short line segments that have
some organization.

...Central and Northern Plains...
A mid-level ridge will remain over the central Rockies on Monday, as
a trough remains nearly stationary across northern Minnesota. At the
surface, a north-to-south corridor of low-level moisture with
dewpoints in the 60s F, will be in place from central Kansas
northward into the eastern Dakotas. Moderate instability is forecast
to develop along the western edge of this moist airmass, from
western Nebraska into southwestern and central South Dakota. As
destabilization takes place during the day, isolated thunderstorm
development will be possible, mainly in areas where low-level
convergence becomes maximized. Across much of the region, 0-6 km
shear is forecast to be in the 35 to 45 knot range. This will
support an isolated threat for severe gusts. Hail will also be
possible in the central High Plains, where mid-level lapse rates are
forecast to be steep.
