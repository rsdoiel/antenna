Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0741 AM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN NEW
MEXICO INTO THE TX PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible later this afternoon into
the evening across portions of the southern High Plains. Hail and
wind are the primary concerns. Locally damaging winds may accompany
convection that develops from the lower Great Lakes into eastern
Texas.

...Synopsis...
Upper troughing that currently extends across much of the western
and central CONUS is forecast to remain in place throughout the day.
Western periphery of expansive subtropical ridging will remain over
the East Coast as well. Despite little change in the large-scale
upper pattern, multiple shortwave troughs progressing within these
larger features will contribute to convectively active day, with
thunderstorms anticipated from the southern Great Basin and
Southwest into the High Plains as well as from Lower MI into
east/southeast TX. Numerous thunderstorms are anticipated from the
northern Rockies into the northern Plains, and the Southeast and
Florida as well.

...Southern Rockies into the southern High Plains...
The showers and isolated thunderstorm ongoing across the region are
expected to continue northeastward while weakening over the next
several hours. Much of this region is currently under a cool and dry
post-frontal regime, but southerly flow should return this
afternoon, contributing to quick airmass modification ahead of a
shortwave trough moving across the Southwest states. Showers and
thunderstorms are anticipated ahead of this shortwave from the Four
Corners eastward into the southern High Plains. The strongest storms
are expected during the late afternoon/early evening across
east-central NM, where the leading edge of the better low-level
moisture return interacts with storms moving off the higher terrain
of central NM ahead of the approaching shortwave trough. 

Enhanced mid-level flow will extend through this region as well,
resulting in environmental conditions supportive of supercells.
Large hail is favored initially, but high cloud bases and strong
outflow will likely result in a transition to a more linear/bowing
mode tonight. Despite nocturnal cooling and resultant low-level
stabilization, some strong gusts are still possible as these storms
continue into the western TX Panhandle this evening and tonight. A
low-probability tornado threat exists as these storms move towards
the TX Panhandle, where better low-level moisture and stronger
southeasterly winds are possible. However, the anticipated linear
storm mode and stabilizing nocturnal cooling should keep the tornado
threat low.

...Lower MI southward through the OH Valley and Ozarks into East
TX...
A weakening cold front currently extends from northern Lower MI into
central TX. Much of this front is expected to make modest
eastward/southeastward progress throughout the day, before becoming
increasingly stationary tonight. A moist airmass precedes this
front, and afternoon dewpoints from the mid 60s to low 70s will
support moderate buoyancy and scattered to numerous thunderstorms.
Moderate 0-6 km (i.e. 30-35 kt) shear suggests a few robust storms
could evolve that would pose at least some risk for gusty winds.
Greatest risk for damaging winds will be during the afternoon when
buoyancy is maximized.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 AM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Another active day characterized by an ongoing MCS and remnant
downstream MCVs is anticipated on D4/Saturday, with a broad belt of
mainly damaging wind potential evident. Seasonably strong mid-level
westerlies are expected to remain coincident with rich low-level
moisture. Ample buoyancy should diurnally develop south of
pre-existing outflows. This multi-day pattern finally breaks down
into D5/Sunday with amplification of a large-scale trough from the
southern Prairie Provinces into the Upper Midwest. Mesoscale-focused
severe potential may linger into at least D5/Sunday over the
southern High Plains to the TX/OK Red River Valley and from the
central Gulf to south Atlantic Coasts.

Otherwise, low-probability severe potential could begin in a portion
of the northern Great Plains on D4/Saturday, in association with the
amplifying trough. This should subsequently shift eastward and
likely broaden across the Great Lakes into the Northeast through
early next week. Overall instability appears modest until a
potential increase later when stronger flow fields overlap richer
low-level moisture. Daily severe probabilities appear to be sub-15
percent at this range, with a relative maximum in the
D6-7/Monday-Tuesday timeframe over the Northeast. Current timing of
this trough exiting New England by around D8/Wednesday suggests a
relative minimum across the CONUS then.

Mesoscale Discussion 1094
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...North-central Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 359...

Valid 032044Z - 032145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 359 continues.

SUMMARY...The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts,
large hail, and a tornado or two will exist in north-central
Missouri in WW 359.

DISCUSSION...A mature QLCS recently impacted the Kansas City metro
and vicinity and is continuing eastward through WW 359. A
consolidated bow echo is present at the northern extent of the line
(currently approaching Linn County), with a more outflow-dominated
signature present with southward extent. Both areas should continue
to pose a threat for severe wind gusts over the next couple of
hours. Periods of stronger low-level rotation were observed
recently, and some re-intensification is possible given locally
stronger low-level shear. Some semi-discrete cells have also formed
in a convergent zone ahead of the QLCS, which will pose a locally
greater threat for large hail in the short term.

Mesoscale Discussion 1093
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern IL and northwest IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032039Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe potential will increase over the next couple of
hours. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 359 may be needed
late this afternoon across parts of eastern IA into northwest IL.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery has slowly occurred across eastern IA
into northwest IL in the wake of morning convection. Temperatures
have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, and dewpoints from 66-72
F are contributing to increasing MLCAPE. With time, vertical shear
is expected to remain favorable for organized convection as the QLCS
across northern MO track east/northeast with time and additional
convection develops along a cold front oriented across eastern IA.
Damaging gusts will be the main hazard with this activity. However,
the VWP at KDVN shows some enlargement of the low-level hodograph,
due in part to a 30-40 kt 850 mb southwesterly low-level jet over
the region, which is also supporting 0-1 km SRH around 100-150
m2/s2. As such, a tornado or two also could occur in addition to
strong gusts. A downstream watch may be needed in the next couple
hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1092
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0313 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...central OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360...

Valid 032013Z - 032215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360
continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential may be increasing across central OK.

DISCUSSION...Strong cells have developed just west of the I-35
corridor in central OK. These cells show rotation aloft and the VWP
from KTLX shows an increasing low-level hodograph with 0-1 SRH near
150 m2/s2. Backed surface winds are also noted in surface
observations, along with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F.
This is contributing to strong instability and further storm
organization and intensification is possible over the next couple of
hours as these storms track northeast across central OK and the
greater OKC Metro area, and a brief tornado or two could occur with
these developing supercells. Additionally, as storms across
southwest OK move into this environment, some tornado and damaging
risk will be possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 359
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM CDT Tue Jun 3 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Far Eastern Kansas
  West-Central into Northeastern Missouri

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...An organizing band of storms will likely move northeast
across the Watch along and north of modified outflow.  Moist low
levels and moderately strong low-level shear across the Watch will
support a risk for a couple of tornadoes.  A threat for damaging
gusts will probably accompany the stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 55 statute miles
east and west of a line from 20 miles east northeast of Kirksville
MO to 45 miles south southeast of Olathe KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0315 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

A broad upper-level trough over the western CONUS on D3/Thursday
will shift east into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley region by
D5/Saturday. Meanwhile, an upper-level ridge will build across the
West. Medium range guidance suggests potential for a series of
on-shoring mid-level troughs and/or cutoff lows thereafter, coupled
with a surge of subtropical moisture, into portions of the western
Great Basin, northern California, and the Pacific Northwest. This
may increase the potential for isolated dry thunderstorms across
this region by D6/Sunday and beyond, but limited predictability in
the evolution of these conditions precludes introducing any
highlights at this time. 

In addition, the amplifying ridge will promote a general
warming/drying trend across most areas of the West, acting to
increase fuel receptivity. However, generally weak winds beneath the

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Valid 032000Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ROM PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from the southern Great
Plains to the Midwest. Damaging winds and large hail are the primary
concerns.

...20z Update...

...Northern Missouri...
The primary forecast update pertains to the organizing/intensifying
convective line entering western MO (as of 19 UTC). Downstream of
this line, satellite trends show dissipating cirrus with increasing
low/mid-level cumulus associated with a northward advection of
low-level moisture and increasing diurnal heating. Consequently, it
is becoming increasingly probable that downstream destabilization
will be sufficient and timely enough to maintain the strengthening
line as it moves into northern MO and perhaps into southeast IA
later this evening. Recent CAM guidance appears to be capturing this
trend well and show a consistent severe wind signal through this
corridor. Recent VWP observations from KEAX show sufficient
low-level shear within the recovering air mass (driven by
strengthening low-level warm advection) to support a threat of
embedded circulations/brief tornadoes within the line. As such, 5%
tornado probabilities have been introduced. 

...Southern Plains...
Thunderstorm coverage is beginning to increase from southern KS into
central OK/northern TX as temperatures warm into the mid 80s with
eroding inhibition. This trend is expected to continue as a cold
front continues to push east into a moist/unstable air mass. The
KTLX VWP continues to sample sufficient deep-layer shear for
organized convection, including the potential for a supercell or two
ahead of the primary convective line. While severe hail/wind will be
possible with pre-line discrete cells, the primary severe risk will
likely manifest with the developing convective line later this
afternoon and evening.

..Moore.. 06/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1127 AM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025/

...Central/Southern Plains into the Midwest...
Water-vapor imagery late this morning shows a mid-level shortwave
trough over the central Great Plains, embedded within larger upper
troughing centered over MT/WY and the Dakotas that extends over much
of the north-central U.S.  A cold front extends from the western
Great Lakes southwestward to a weak low near the OK/KS/TX Panhandle
region.  An extensive area of showers and thunderstorms exists from
KS eastward into the mid MS Valley near the frontal zone.  

A low-predictability forecast scenario regarding specific details of
storm evolution is expected this afternoon into the evening.  A
relatively weak capping inversion was sampled by the 12 UTC Norman,
OK and Fort Worth/Midland, TX raobs (9 to 10 deg C at 700 mb) over
the southern Great Plains.  Heating in wake of morning convection
and related cloud debris will promote a very unstable boundary layer
by early to mid afternoon.  Expecting a diurnal increase in
low-level moisture coincident with the evapotranspiration cycle and 
lowest 100-mb mean mixing ratios increasing from 14-15 to 16-17 g/kg
(translated to surface dewpoints rising from 68-70 to 72-76 deg F). 
Forecast soundings show 2500-3500 J/kg MLCAPE from southwest MO into
central TX.  The 12 UTC model run of the NAM appears to be an
unrealistic outlier solution showing enhanced low-level shear across
OK during the afternoon.  As convective inhibition erodes across the
southern Great Plains east of a dryline/cold front and south of
reinforced outflow draped across southern KS into northern MO,
expecting scattered to numerous thunderstorms to develop during the
afternoon into the evening period.  Severe gusts and large hail
appear to be the primary severe hazards.  Strong to occasionally
severe thunderstorms should continue along the front as it moves
into TX Hill Country tonight.  An elongated corridor of low-tornado
potential will be maintained this outlook update from the southern
Great Plains northeastward through the lower MO Valley and into the
western Great Lakes.  A belt of 40-kt 2 km southwesterly flow will
be maintained across western into northern MO and spatially
overlapping outflow in the lower MO Valley.  Limited heating will
temper the overall buoyancy across the northern half of MO into IA,
likely tempering the overall severe risk.  Additionally, with the
line-parallel orientation of the deep-layer shear across this
region, the expectation is for a predominantly linear storm mode,
with occasional bowing segments capable of producing damaging gusts.

..Karstens.. 06/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will continue across the CONUS on Wednesday. A
shortwave trough will move through parts of the Southwest. At the
surface, a stalled boundary will be situated within the southern
Great Basin.

Another day of limited fire weather concerns is expected. Winds will
be weak across much of the West. The shortwave trough will likely
enhance surface winds in southeastern Arizona and southwest New
Mexico. However, with precipitation occurring on previous days, it
is not likely to significantly increase fire weather concerns. Near
the stalled boundary, mid-level moisture will promote scattered
thunderstorms primarily in the Four Corners region. Again, these
areas will have been impacted by recent precipitation and lightning
ignition potential appears low.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS AND CENTRAL/SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on Thursday into
Thursday night from parts of the southern High Plains towards the
Ozark Plateau.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level pattern featuring a large-scale positively tilted trough
centered over the western CONUS will become more zonal through the
period Thursday. A weak mid-level shortwave trough and associated
jet streak will shift east from the Southwest into the
southern/central Plains. This will result in some weak lee troughing
across the southern Plains during the day Thursday. A dryline will
extend along the New Mexico/Texas border and remain mostly
stationary through the period. A frontal zone is forecast to extend
east from this dryline across the central/southern Plains. The
location of this frontal zone remains uncertain right now and is
somewhat related to Day 2 convection, particularly across Oklahoma
and the Texas Panhandle. Regardless of the location, these 2
features, the dryline and front, will serve as the focus for severe
storm development on Thursday. 

...Central/southern High Plains into the central Plains and
Ozarks...
Thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the period
across the Texas Panhandle vicinity and perhaps along the Red River.
As the low-level jet weakens by late morning, expect this convection
to weaken. The intensity of this convection Thursday morning will
likely have a significant impact on frontal location and the
location of the greatest severe weather threat on Thursday. 12Z
guidance shows recovery only as far north as southern Oklahoma with
other guidance showing recovery into southern Kansas. Regardless of
where this boundary settles, moderate to strong instability will
develop south and west of this boundary where low 70s dewpoints are
expected. Storms will likely develop Thursday afternoon along the
dryline from eastern Colorado into West Texas and the Texas
Panhandle. Sufficient flow will likely exist along this zone for
supercells with weaker instability likely limiting storm intensity
across eastern Colorado. 

Eventually, expect storms from the High Plains to congeal into a MCS
which will likely focus along the frontal zone as it moves
east-northeast. This cluster and the associated severe wind threat
will likely persist through the evening and could persist into the
early morning hours on Friday into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks.

...Northeast...
Weak to moderate instability is forecast to develop ahead of a cold
front across the Northeast on Thursday with inhibition likely eroded
by mid day. Effective shear is only forecast around 20 to 30 knots
which may be sufficient for some multicell clusters. The moderate
instability coupled with potential for at least some storm
organization may result in isolated large hail/damaging wind gusts.

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE SOUTHWEST
TO THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS AND EASTERN MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe hail and wind are possible from mid-afternoon
Wednesday through early morning Thursday in parts of the Southwest.
Isolated damaging winds and marginally severe hail may occur across
the eastern Midwest from mid-afternoon to evening.

...Synopsis...
A broad, positively tilted trough will dominate much of the weather
pattern across the CONUS on Wednesday with a base across the
Southwest and a trough axis extending toward the northern Plains.
Multiple shortwaves will be embedded within this flow which may
result in focused regions of thunderstorms on Wednesday. At the
surface, a stalled front will extend from the Great Lakes to Far
West Texas. This front will be a focus for storm development
Wednesday afternoon/evening. 

...Eastern Midwest...
Showers and thunderstorms will likely be ongoing along a frontal
zone from the Ozarks to the western Great Lakes Wednesday morning.
Convergence will be weak through the day as the front/composite
outflow slowly shifts east through the period. Weak to potentially
moderate instability will develop ahead of the front as temperatures
warm into the upper 70s to low 80s with dewpoints in the 60s.
Overall forcing will be weak with rising heights aloft and weakening
convergence along the frontal zone. Moderate shear will be present
through much of the day, but it will be oriented parallel to the
frontal zone which is less favorable for sustained severe storms. An
environment featuring weak to moderate instability and moderate
deep-layer shear will support some isolated large hail and damaging
wind gusts. However, a more organized threat does not appear likely.


...Southwest into Southern High Plains... 
A weak mid-level shortwave trough and associated jet streak will
move east across the Southwest on Wednesday. Ahead of this feature,
low-level flow will veer and bring low-level moisture northwestward
across eastern New Mexico. Weak to potentially moderate instability
will develop by mid-day with thunderstorms likely initially over the
higher terrain and eventually shifting east. Moderate shear will
support the potential for a few supercells capable of large hail and
severe wind gusts. These storms may be somewhat on the smaller side
given the weaker buoyancy. However, there is a conditional risk for
one or two larger/stronger supercells to persist into the evening
across the Texas Panhandle if moisture/instability can recover ahead
of the storms moving out of New Mexico. 

Strong shear will be present across southeast New Mexico into Far
West Texas beneath the mid-level jet streak. If sufficient
instability can develop far enough west into the higher terrain, a
few supercells are possible with a primary threat for large hail.

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will persist across the northern tier states
today. A cutoff low off the southern California coast will move into
the lower Colorado Valley by Wednesday morning. High surface
pressure will remain in the Northwest/northern Rockies while a
surface boundary will stall within parts of the central/southern
Great Basin.

Overall fire weather concerns across the CONUS will be minimal
today. Some dry and breezy conditions are possible from northern
California into the northern/central Great Basin. Winds will
generally be too light to warrant highlights. Some stronger winds
are possible in eastern Utah/western Colorado, but recent
precipitation has had some impact on fuels. Locally elevated fire
weather may occur where winds are locally stronger, however.
Thunderstorms will occur in the Southwest, but PW values will be
high and precipitation has occurred over last few days, decreasing
fuel receptiveness.

Mesoscale Discussion 1078
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...the Texas Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353...

Valid 022048Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next 1 to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed outflow boundary has developed and is
emanating from storms across the western Texas Panhandle. This
outflow has mostly outrun the storms thus far. However, it is
quickly moving toward more favorable instability across the central
and eastern Panhandle. In fact, a boundary is apparent on the AMA
0.5 degree base reflectivity east of the radar which likely
represents the edge of the low 70s dewpoints across the eastern
Panhandle. 

As these boundaries collide, expect strong updrafts which should
strengthen the cold pool and severe wind gusts within the line. The
greatest threat for isolated 80-90 mph wind gusts this
afternoon/evening likely exists from this boundary collision
northeastward. This region has the most favorable diurnal timing and
the expectation for storm intensification as this line moves towards
the greater instability.

Mesoscale Discussion 1077
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado northeastward through
southwestern MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022047Z - 022245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon and
evening along a cold front across much of central Nebraska and
adjacent areas. Severe wind gusts and large hail will be the main
threats.

DISCUSSION...A Cu field is developing this afternoon across central
Nebraska to the south of a slowly sagging cold front. Very large
instability is present with temperatures rising into the upper 80s
and low 90s F across the region. Continued boundary-layer mixing
should erode any remaining inhibition, supporting convection
initiating in the next couple of hours. A number of factors should
contribute to quickly amalgamating storms, including widespread
initiation, largely line-parallel (and relatively modest) bulk shear
vectors, and ML LCLs between 1500-2000 m AGL. Large hail will be
possible with the strongest cores, particularly early in individual
storms' lifecycles, with a transition to a more widespread wind
threat likely during the evening. A tornado or two cannot be ruled
out amidst possibly complex storm interactions and/or stronger
updrafts interacting with locally enhanced surface vertical
vorticity near the front. A watch is possible this afternoon to
address these threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 1076
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Portions of West Texas and the Trans Pecos into
southeast New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022021Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are possible
this afternoon and into this evening.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across the Trans
Pecos and into West Texas with 1500 to 2000 J/kg MLCAPE. Some
convection has formed along the higher terrain from southeast New
Mexico to the Davis Mountains in Texas. A belt of slightly stronger
mid-level flow will overspread this region through the late
afternoon and into the evening, with RAP forecast soundings
indicating 35 to 40 knots of effective shear where southerly or
southeasterly flow remains by 23Z to 00Z. Therefore, a few
supercells are possible with a threat for large hail and severe wind
gusts. 

Large-scale forcing is mostly moving away from the region, so storm
coverage will likely remain isolated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1075
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado and western Kansas into far
southwest Nebraska.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 021947Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected this afternoon with a primary
threat of severe wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...A gradient of instability exists across the central
High Plains with dewpoints in the 40s near the Front Range and in
the upper 60s across southwest Kansas. SPC mesoanalysis shows a
weakly unstable, but uncapped environment across southeast Colorado
where cold air associated with the upper low has started to move
east of the terrain. As heating continues and temperatures continue
to cool aloft, expect an uncapped environment across much of eastern
Colorado and western Kansas. In addition, ascent will increase as
the trough advances east. 

Therefore, expect a gradual increase in convective coverage across
northeast New Mexico and eastern Colorado this afternoon.
Eventually, these storms should become more intense as they move
toward greater instability. Some large hail is possible initially,
however, severe wind gusts will be preferred. Very steep lapse rates
will support the potential for some significant severe wind gusts of
80-90 mph this evening (in western Kansas), particularly where any
bowing line segments can develop. 

A watch will likely be needed later this afternoon for the threat
from these storms, and storms which will likely move into southwest
Kansas from watch 353.

Mesoscale Discussion 1074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into
western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 021914Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon, posing
a threat primarily for severe wind gusts and large hail.

DISCUSSION...Congested Cu are present in visible satellite imagery
across southeastern Wyoming, especially along the higher terrain in
advance of a slowly-southward-sagging cold front. A surface low is
developing in northeastern Colorado, promoting backing southeasterly
low-level flow and some moisture advection into the area. Limited
upper-level cloudiness has supported temperatures rising into the
mid-/upper-70s across the area, likely yielding minimal convective
inhibition in the short term.

As the cold front continues to move southward and a mid-level wave
impinges on the region, scattered thunderstorm development appears
likely in the next couple hours. 12z HREF guidance depicts multiple
stronger updrafts developing off the Laramie Mountains and moving
east into a well-mixed and unstable airmass. Amidst modest bulk
shear values (~30-35 kts) and relatively straight shear profiles,
some splitting supercells and mixed-mode storms are possible. The
primary threats should be large hail and local severe wind gusts
with the stronger cores, especially as they mature in the Nebraska
Panhandle.

Additional thunderstorms are expected in western Nebraska and points
eastward as storms erupt along the cold front later this
afternoon/evening. Trends will continue to be monitored in that
region for possible MCD/watch issuance there.

0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central into southeast Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352...

Valid 012037Z - 012200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk of large hail and severe wind gusts continues
across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352.

DISCUSSION...A couple semi-discrete supercells continue to track
southeastward along the stationary boundary from central into
southeast TX -- along the east/southeastern periphery of around 2500
J/kg MLCAPE. While these storms are generally becoming removed from
this stronger instability, they will still pose a risk of isolated
large hail and locally severe gusts in the near term. To their
northwest, fresh updrafts are evolving along the stationary boundary
near Waco TX. Given that these evolving storms will track
southeastward through the strongest instability amid 40 kt of
effective shear, gradual intensification into semi-discrete
supercells is also possible -- posing a risk of large to very large
hail and severe wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central North Carolina and far
northern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011913Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue
developing/advancing eastward across western/central NC and far
northern SC through the afternoon. The strongest storms will be
capable of producing locally damaging wind gusts and marginally
severe hail. The severe threat is expected to remain too isolated
for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Along the southern periphery of a large-scale trough
over the Northeast, VWP data and earlier 12Z soundings sampled a
belt of 40-50 kt midlevel westerly flow across NC. Here,
differential heating along a weak E/W-oriented surface boundary is
supporting isolated to widely scattered showers, which should
continue to deepening into thunderstorms -- given sufficient (albeit
weak) surface-based instability. The moderate/strong westerly flow
aloft is yielding elongated/mostly straight hodographs (around 40 kt
of effective shear), which could promote localized convective
organization into small clusters capable of locally damaging wind
gusts and perhaps marginally severe hail. Current thinking is that
the overall severe threat will remain too isolated for a watch,
though convective trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1062
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...central Colorado and north-central New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011853Z - 012130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to develop through the
afternoon. Instability will support at least some potential for hail
and gusty thunderstorm outflows. However, the lack of stronger
deep-layer shear should limit the overall severe threat to being
more transient in nature. A watch is not likely.

DISCUSSION...Terrain-driven low-level convergence has resulted in
the development of convection across the higher terrain of central
Colorado and north-central New Mexico. To the east of the higher
terrain, surface dewpoints in the 50s coupled with diurnal heating
has resulted in a corridor of MUCAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg, with
the higher values tied to higher surface moisture. Despite
sufficient instability for storm maintenance, deep-layer shear is
weak, with effective-layer shear generally less than 20 knots should
limit the ability for updraft organization. The result should be
updrafts initially tied to the terrain, where low-level convergence
will force ascent. Isolated hail and perhaps a strong wind gust or
two may be possible with these terrain-driven storms.

With time, aggregate cold pools may move off the terrain and into
the high-elevation plains adjacent to the mountains allowing for
additional thunderstorm development. Here, continued heating will
allow most-unstable CAPE to continue to increase until convective
cloud debris overspreads the area reducing insolation. However,
MUCAPE around 2000-2500 J/kg will remain possible. Forecast
soundings indicated that some increase in effective-layer shear, but
still generally below 30 knots. This may allow for some
conglomeration of updrafts and at least transient multi-cell
clusters capable of producing large hail and a strong wind gust or
two.

Given the anticipated isolated/transient nature of any organized
severe threat (should it develop) a watch is not anticipated.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 352
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
140 PM CDT Sun Jun 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central and East Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 140 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercell development are expected
this afternoon as a moist environment heats and destabilizes. Large
hail is expected with the most intense storms, with wind damage also
possible as these storms generally spread southeastward through
early/mid-evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles north of
Stephenville TX to 75 miles south southeast of Huntsville TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.
