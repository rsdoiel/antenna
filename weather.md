...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms posing a risk for gusty
winds and perhaps a tornado may occur across parts of coastal North
Carolina this evening/tonight.

...Coastal Carolinas...
A pronounced upper trough will continue eastward today from the
OH/TN Valleys and Midwest towards the southern Mid-Atlantic. As this
occurs, a weak surface/coastal low will develop in response across
the eastern Carolinas this afternoon/evening and adjacent coastal
waters tonight. Most guidance suggests this surface low will remain
very near/along the immediate coast, or just offshore. Recent RAP
runs are a notable exception, showing a slightly more inland track.
Regardless, sufficient low-level moisture and related weak
boundary-layer instability should be present by this evening across
parts of coastal NC and the Outer Banks. Any surface-based
convection that can be sustained tonight in the favorably sheared
environment may pose an isolated threat for strong to severe wind
gusts, and perhaps a tornado. Greater severe potential remains
evident just offshore and over the Gulf Stream, but there still
appears to be enough severe potential over land to maintain the
Marginal Risk with this update.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CST Thu Nov 14 2024

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
...New England...
Post-frontal offshore flow will return across the New England coast
on Friday. Relative humidity reductions to around 30-40 percent will
be possible with northwesterly breezes around 10-15 mph. Given
drought conditions and very little recent rainfall, Elevated fire
weather concerns will be likely with fuels in the region remaining
receptive to fire spread. 

...Southern Arizona and Western New Mexico...
A deepening trough will bring increasing westerly flow aloft and
strong southwesterly surface winds across portions of Arizona and
New Mexico. Relative humidity reductions to around 10-15 percent
will overlap sustained winds around 15-20 mph. Portions of
southeastern Arizona and western New Mexico have seen less recent
rain/snowfall, with potential for some drying of fine fuels
possible. Overall, ERCs are largely at or below the 50th percentile.

0647 PM CST Wed Nov 13 2024

Valid 140100Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL GULF COAST AND ALONG PARTS OF THE WEST COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, associated with a marginal threat for
tornadoes and wind damage, will be possible across the central Gulf
Coast this evening. Isolated severe gusts will also be possible
along parts of the West Coast.

...Central Gulf Coast...
A mid-level trough, evident on water vapor imagery, is moving into
the Ark-La-Tex. Further to the east, a lead shortwave trough is
moving through the central Gulf Coast states, where a moist airmass
is in place. Surface dewpoints across the central Gulf Coast region
range from the mid 70s F near the coast to the mid 60s F over much
of southwestern Alabama. Scattered thunderstorms are ongoing near
the moist axis. The stronger cells are expected to move
northeastward across far southern Mississippi and into southwest
Alabama this evening. RAP forecasts soundings in far southwest
Alabama at 03Z have MLCAPE near 750 J/kg, 0-6 km shear in the 35 to
40 knot range, and some directional shear in the low to mid-levels.
This should be sufficient for a marginal severe threat this evening.
A potential for isolated severe gusts may exist with semi-organized
line segments. A marginal tornado threat will also be possible with
the more discrete rotating cells.

...West Coast...
A mid-level trough is evident on water vapor imagery over southwest
Oregon and northern California. Mid-level moisture associated with
the trough, large-scale ascent and steep lapse rates are
contributing to thunderstorm potential along the coast of northern
California, Oregon and Washington. Some of the storms may become
strong enough to mix low-level winds of about 35 to 40 knots down to
the surface. A few gusts could approach severe limits this evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CST Wed Nov 13 2024

Valid 151200Z - 211200Z

Fire weather concerns are anticipated across parts of the country
through the extended period - particularly across portions of the
Northeast and southern California coast where active wildfires have
been noted over the past several days. Long-range ensemble guidance
depicts an active upper-level regime through the middle of next
week, characterized by the passage of highly amplified upper waves
across the country. Widespread precipitation chances will accompany
these waves with recent ensemble guidance suggesting most locations
will see at least some chance for wetting precipitation over the
next week. Two exceptions to this are the New England region and
southern CA/lower CO River Valley where rain chances are minimal
during the D3-8 period. Despite seasonal temperatures, continued
rain shortfalls should promote drying fuels. 

...D3/Fri to Sun/D5 - New England...
The passage of a cold front late D2/Thursday into D3/Friday will
establish an offshore flow regime along the New England coast. Cool,
but dry, continental air filtering into the region should promote
diurnal RH reductions into the 30-40% range (though possibly as low
as 25% for some locations). Although winds are not expected to be
overly strong given a gradually weakening pressure gradient,
somewhat breezy conditions coupled with the drying trend and
receptive fuels will promote fire concerns for the late week and
into the weekend. 

...D3/Fri - Arizona/New Mexico...
An amplifying upper trough across the West Coast will support
widespread pressure falls across the greater Four Corners with an
attendant mass response across AZ and NM. Latest deterministic and
ensemble guidance show strong signals for 15-25% RH and 20-30 mph
southwest winds across eastern AZ into west/southwest NM where
10-hour fuels remain dry after several days of limited rainfall.
While ERCs remain somewhat low (generally below the 60th
percentile), drying of fine fuels through the remainder of the week
should support a fire concern. 

...D7/Tue to D8/Wed - Southern California...
Long-range ensemble guidance has begun to show a signal for an
offshore flow event during the early/middle part of the upcoming
work week. Both the GEFS and ECENS show reasonably good agreement in
an unseasonably strong (1040-1045 mb) surface high building across
the northern Great Basin/northern Rockies in the wake of a strong
upper trough. This signal suggests that offshore pressure gradients
may be sufficiently strong to support critical wind speeds off the
terrain of the southern CA coast. Given antecedent receptive fuels
(as evident by ongoing large fires) and the anticipated downslope
warming/drying, critical fire weather conditions appear possible
during the D7/Tue to D8/Wed period.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 122000Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may impact parts of the
Texas South Plains and Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle vicinity into far
southwestern Kansas this evening, possibly accompanied by some risk
for hail and gusty winds.

...20Z Update...
The primary change to this outlook was to expand Marginal Risk
probabilities northward into portions of far southwestern KS. Here,
guidance consensus depicts 700-1000 J/kg MUCAPE amid elongated
hodographs, which may support an instance or two of marginally
severe hail with the more persistent, discrete updrafts that can
form. Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 11/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1024 AM CST Tue Nov 12 2024/

...Southern High Plains...
An upper-level trough over the eastern Great Basin/Four Corners at
midday will continue eastward toward the south-central High Plains
tonight. Gradual lee-side cyclogenesis will occur particularly late
today into tonight, with a sharpening southern High Plains
dryline/lee trough, with an eastward-moving Pacific cold front that
will overtake the dryline/lee trough from west-to-east tonight.
Modest-caliber low-level moisture return will occur
north-northwestward across the southern High Plains, with surface
dewpoints tending to remain limited to the upper 40s/lower 50s F
into this evening.

It still appears likely that deep convective potential across
northwest Texas and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles will remain
limited through peak heating, owing to the moisture limitations and
a persistent capping inversion. Isolated thunderstorm development
will become more probable after sunset as lift associated with a
strengthening low-level jet increases, and as the surface cold front
overtakes the lee trough.

While MUCAPE is expected to remain rather weak (generally 500-1000
J/kg or less), strong deep-layer shear will support organized
updrafts with any sustained convection. Isolated hail appears to be
the main threat, as thunderstorms should have a tendency to remain
slightly elevated. But, some chance for strong/gusty winds may also
exist. The window for severe hail should remain small in space and
time this evening, as convection will likely grow upscale fairly
quickly. Even so, small hail may occur farther north/east into parts
of Kansas and Oklahoma overnight into early Wednesday morning.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 PM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not currently expected on
Thursday.

...Synopsis...
A negatively titled shortwave trough is forecast to extend from the
Upper Midwest into the southern Appalachians early Thursday morning.
This trough is expected to lose amplitude as it continues eastward
while also developing a closed mid-level circulation. This resulting
cyclone will then likely progress across the Upper OH Valley and
into the Mid-Atlantic by early Friday. In response to this
evolution, surface cyclogenesis is anticipated off the Carolina
coast, or perhaps just inland over the coastal Carolinas.

Farther west, the overall upper pattern will amplify as ridging
builds across the Plains and troughing deepens along the West Coast.

...Central/Northeast Gulf Coast vicinity...
Showers and thunderstorms will likely be ongoing over the central
Gulf Coast early Thursday morning, as a cold front pushes eastward
through moist and modestly buoyant warm sector in place across the
region. Northern extent of this warm sector is expected to become
increasingly confined throughout the day with the cooler, more
continental airmass over the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic remaining
place. A strong storm or two is possible within this warm sector,
particularly Thursday morning from southwest/southern AL into the
western FL Panhandle, but limited buoyancy and weakening shear
should keep any severe threat isolated, precluding the need for any
severe probabilities with this outlook.

...Coastal Carolinas...
Uncertainty regarding the strength and location of the surface low
expected to deepen over the region late Thursday night/early Friday
morning limits the confidence on how far inland any favorable
low-level moisture/buoyancy would penetrate. Current guidance
suggests there could be a confined area along the warm front near
the northern NC Coast where there is enough overlap between modest
buoyancy and strong shear to support some severe potential. Given
the limited spatial extent of this region and the general
uncertainty regarding the overall pattern, no severe probabilities
were introduced with this outlook. However, a small area maybe
needed in future outlooks if forecast confidence increases.

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/CENTRAL GULF COAST REGION...AND COASTAL PORTIONS
OF PACIFIC NORTHWEST...

...SUMMARY...
A marginal tornado/wind threat is apparent on Wednesday afternoon
into Wednesday night across a part of the central Gulf Coast States.
Thunderstorms with strong to locally severe gusts are also possible
near the immediate coasts of Washington, Oregon, and northern
California.

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough is forecast to move from the Plains through the
MS Valley on Wednesday, becoming more negatively tilted as it does.
An occluded surface low associated with this system will begin the
period over the mid MO Valley before moving eastward across IA and
reaching the northern IL early Thursday morning. More consequently
for the severe-weather potential, a secondary triple-point low is
expected to progress eastward across the northern portion of the
Southeast states, along the northern edge of an eastward-evolving
warm sector. Cold front associated with this low will gradually move
eastward across the Southeast states during the day.

Farther west, an upper-level trough is forecast to progress farther
inland across the western CONUS, as an embedded shortwave trough
moves across northern CA into the interior Northwest/northern Great
Basin.

...Lower Mississippi Valley/Central Gulf Coast...
General expectation is for a triple-point surface low to evolve over
the Mid-South vicinity through the early afternoon as low-level
moisture continues to advect northward across the central Gulf Coast
region. Dewpoints in the upper 60s/low 70s are anticipated ahead of
this low and associated cold front. The airmass is expected to
destabilize amid this low-level moisture, but overall buoyancy will
still be modest given the lack of steep lapse rates. The combination
of destabilization and increasing ascent is forecast to result in
thunderstorm development across the warm sector, but along and ahead
of the eastward-progressing cold front. 

The stronger shear will likely be displaced north of the stronger
buoyancy, but enough shear is expected across the warm sector to
support organized storms if updrafts can persist and deepen. This
evolution could support a few marginal supercells and/or stronger
clusters during the afternoon and evening, with a threat of locally
damaging winds and possibly a tornado or two.

Elevated storms will also be possible through the day/evening to the
north of the richer surface moisture. While effective shear will be
sufficient for a few strong elevated storms, the severe potential
with northward extent will tend to be limited by weak midlevel lapse
rates and generally marginal buoyancy.

...WA/OR/Northern CA coasts...  
Cold mid-level temperatures (i.e. -24 to -28 deg C at 500 mb)
associated with the upper trough are expected to spread eastward
throughout the day. These cold mid-level temperatures and associated
steep mid-level lapse rates will contribute to modest buoyancy along
the coastal portions of the Pacific Northwest. Highest storm
coverage is anticipated over the northern CA coast vicinity from the
late morning into the early afternoon along as the frontal band
moves through, but persistent forcing for ascent within this
modestly buoyant airmass is expected to result in more cellular
storms throughout the remainder of the afternoon and evening. A more
linear mode is anticipated within the frontal band, with a few
convectively enhanced gusts possible. Low-topped cellular activity
is anticipated in the wake of the frontal band, with a few instances
of small hail, and potentially even a brief tornado, possible.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0910 AM CST Tue Nov 12 2024

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The Elevated area in the Northeast was expanded southward based on
current observations (winds gusting 20-45 mph, RH of 40-60%) and the
latest high-resolution forecast guidance. RH and temperatures will
be close to elevated criteria, but wind gusts of 25-50 mph and near
to record setting high fire danger will create elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions in the outlook area. 

The Elevated area in southern California remains on track. Overnight
RH recovery was moderate to excellent with north-northwest wind
gusts of 25-60 mph early this morning. The strongest winds will
struggle to overlap with elevated/critical RH, but elevated fire

...Synopsis...
...Southern California...
A weak cold front will move across southern California through the
morning. Behind this frontal passage, gusty northwest winds
will be enhanced near favored downslope terrain features across
Santa Barbra and Ventura Counties. Relative humidity will hover
around elevated thresholds. Relative humidity will decrease,
especially at mid/upper slopes, below critical relative humidity
thresholds with poor overnight recovery tonight into D2/Wednesday
morning. However, winds are expected to weaken below thresholds
during this period. An Elevated delineation was maintained with this
outlook.

...New England...
Gusty northwesterly flow will overlap relative humidity reductions
to 35-40 percent across New England this afternoon. Though relative
humidity will be marginal, recent fire activity has shown fuels in
this region are receptive to fire spread with drought conditions and
very little recent rainfall. An Elevated delineation was included to
cover this threat, given the potential for strong and gusty winds.
