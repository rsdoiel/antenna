## How To Tighten a Chainsaw Chain

date: 2024-10-15, from: Family Handyman Blog

<p>Proper chain tension is key to optimal chainsaw cutting and safety. While it may seem intimidating at first, tightening the chain on a chainsaw is actually quite simple once you know the steps. I used to avoid using my chainsaw because I didn't feel confident tightening the chain. But after receiving some helpful advice from a neighbor, it quickly became just another maintenance task I could easily tackle.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-Tighten-a-Chainsaw-Chain_Graphic.jpg"alt="" /><figcaption>AVIRAL GUPTA/FAMILY HANDYMAN</figcaption><p>In this guide, we'll provide you with a comprehensive, step-by-step process for tightening a chainsaw chain, with expert tips from Bob Cain from Bob's Small Engine Repair and Jason Smith from Westfield Equipment Service.</p>
<h2>How Tight Should a Chainsaw Chain Be?</h2>
<p>A chainsaw chain should be tight but not too tight. When properly tightened, the chain should pull away from the guide about 3/16-inch. It should also move freely across the bar without falling off. "As you tighten it, stop and pull the chain. It shouldn't come down very far off the bar," Cain says.</p>
<h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
<p>To avoid burns, wait until the chainsaw has cooled before attempting to tighten the chain. Always engage the brake and wear gloves when tightening and check for proper tightness before using the saw.</p>
<h2>When to Call a Pro</h2>
<p>Smith recommends taking your chainsaw to a professional "anytime it's not cutting as it should." He says this includes if the saw is cutting sideways, smokes more than usual or produces more saw dust than wood chips. "It may be time to swap the chain, and it's best to bring it to a pro," he adds. If you're unsure of how to tighten a chainsaw chain and do not feel confident in your ability, bring it to a pro for tightening.</p>
