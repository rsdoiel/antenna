## What To Do If Your Lawn Mower Won’t Start

date: 2024-09-20, from: Family Handyman Blog

<p>Lawn maintenance can be a bit of drudgery. Add in a lawn mower that won't start, and it's a downright drag. But if you're in that situation, temper your frustration for a second because it might be something as simple as bad gas or a clogged carburetor or filter.</p>
<p>If it is a straightforward problem, here are the steps to diagnose it. And in the future, follow these lawn mower <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/you-need-to-winterize-your-lawn-mower-heres-how/" rel="noopener noreferrer">winterizing</a> and <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/fall-spring-lawn-mower-maintenance/" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintenance</a> steps to prolong the life of your mower and prevent breakdowns.</p>
<h2>When Should You Call a Pro?</h2>
<p>Anytime you don't feel comfortable with your safety, or after you've gone through these steps and it's still not working, it might be time to call a pro. "It's important to understand that lawn mowers are heavy pieces of machinery with sharp blades, and you should never push yourself beyond your skill set and ability or you could end up getting hurt," says Angie Hicks, co-founder of <a href="https://www.angi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angi</a>.</p>
