## Wired’s un-paywalling of stories built on public data is a reminder of its role in the information ecosystem

date: 2025-03-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The federal government does a lot of things. It lifts millions of seniors out of poverty! It forecasts avalanches! It invades foreign countries based on dubious intelligence! It determines what time it is! And when it&#8217;s got a spare moment, it protects the Constitution — or at least one copy of it. If you set...

## New York Times bundles give European publishers a subscription boost

date: 2025-03-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The “Trump bump” isn’t just for news publishers in the United States. Last fall, four European news publishers sweetened their subscription deals by offering complimentary access to The New York Times, with the idea that their readers might want more expansive U.S. election coverage. Premium subscribers to news outlets like El País (Spain), Politiken (Denmark),...

## A pipeline company is suing Greenpeace for $300 million. A pay-to-play newspaper is accused of tainting the jury pool

date: 2025-03-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Last fall residents of Mandan, North Dakota woke up to an unfamiliar newspaper at their doorsteps. The broadsheet Central ND News, printed on newsprint, had columns, standard-sized articles, and headlines. But there was an odd theme to its stories. Many referenced events that had happened nearly a decade earlier, when protestors had swarmed the rural...

## PRIME: In the Mountains of Nepal

date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

The sound of rain bouncing off the metallic wings overtakes the sound of the jet engine. Instead of city lights and the Santa Monica Mountains, the Himalayas rise up around the plane, dwarfing my perception of altitude.

## PRIME: Stewarding the 19th Century

date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

Above and beyond publishing journal articles, credentialing young people and producing spectacles on the court, the field and the gridiron, the job of a university is to keep the books.&#160;

## PRIME: Beyond the Bargain

“I was born in the greatest place on Earth.”

Pacific Palisades is filled with spots to view the ocean sunset, but Leo Rochman’s favorite is a cul-de-sac at the bottom of the hill in the bluffs overlooking the coast.
