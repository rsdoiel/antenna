## Album Review: Lady Gaga’s ‘MAYHEM’ brings the magic with danceable tunes, quirky lyrics

Lady Gaga is back in frenetic but fantastic form with her electrifying new LP.
The 14-time Grammy winner released her latest album, &#8220;MAYHEM,&#8221; on Friday. The 14-track project arrives as the singer-songwriter&#8217;s seventh solo studio album, almost five years after 2020&#8217;s &#8220;Chromatica.&#8221; In the intervening time, Gaga&#8217;s musical output has included the remix project &#8220;Dawn Of Chromatica,&#8221; a Grammy-winning collaboration album with Tony Bennett, work on the soundtracks of the films &#8220;Top Gun: Maverick&#8221; and &#8220;Joker: Folie &#224; Deux&#8221; and her 2024 release &#8220;Harlequin.&#8221; Now back with a more traditional album rollout to accompany &#8220;MAYHEM,&#8221; Gaga has unleashed a 53-minute body of work that is undoubtedly her finest record in more than a decade &#8211; an artistic achievement made possible by returning to the avant-garde dance tracks and unconventional lyrics that made her a superstar.
