## ‘One timeline after the other was not met’ – UCLA’s $213 million project is failing

date: 2025-05-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

<em>This post was updated at 11:16 p.m.</em>
UCLA has spent at least $213 million on the Ascend Finance Transformation project, and yet, seven years after the project’s launch, it has few concrete accomplishments.&#160;&#160;
“I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve actually seen a live screen for Ascend,” said Reem Hanna-Harwell, a former member of the project’s steering committee.&#160;
The initial reported budget for the project was $120 million, but, according to a presentation given during the May 2024 Ascend 2.0 quarterly town hall, the estimated total cost was projected to be roughly $286 million.&#160;
The university declined to answer exactly how much money has been spent on the project since its official start date in April 2018.&#160;
The Ascend project involves a transformation of UCLA’s financial system – moving from the current mainframe system to Oracle Cloud, modernizing the chart of accounts and upgrading all business applications which contribute data to the central finance, research and budget systems, according to the 2021 project charter.

Amy Mainzer didn’t plan on studying asteroids when she graduated from her doctoral program in 2003.
But now, Mainzer – who received her doctorate of astronomy from UCLA – is building a telescope that will be sent to space to detect asteroids before they hit Earth’s surface.

## Caltech Wildlife: Fox Squirrels

date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

Among the mammals of Caltech, they’re arguably the happiest and freest. While <em>Homo sapiens</em> are burdened with homework and deadlines, and coyotes stick to moonlit hours to avoid the crowd, the fox squirrels roam wherever their paws take them. Stroll across campus and you&rsquo;re guaranteed to spot one: foraging randomly in the grass (no, they don’t remember where they bury their nuts), lounging on a branch, or chasing a friend in spirals around tree trunks, like a dazzling ribbon in the hand of a gymnast. Even if you don’t see one, just look up: the treetops are decorated with their nests, ready for year-round breeding.

## Every Game Shown in the March Nintendo Direct and How Excited I Am

date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

Remakes don’t usually excite me as the core mechanics and plot are usually the same as the original, just with better graphics. Unless a remake is practically an entirely new game—think <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> remake I don’t have any interest in buying it as it’s incredibly likely that one could emulate the original <em>Dragon Quest I</em> and <em>II</em> with little issue. That seems to be the case here and with other remakes announced. It looks pretty, though.

## How Peru Changed Me: A Bridge Between Two Worlds

date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

Hello everyone, my name is Camilla Fezzi, and you probably know me, always running around, without any free time, and I am kind of recognizable because of my Italian (fashion style) 😜. I’m a freshman at Caltech, with the goal of double majoring in biology and chemistry and dreaming, one day, of becoming a doctor and researcher in the oncology/neuroscience field. But before I am any of those things, I am Italian—a daughter, a sister, a friend. I grew up beneath the Verona sun, in a place where the dinner table is sacred and where family is the compass that guides everything. I have always known warmth—of home-cooked meals, of laughter echoing through ancient streets, of a mother’s arms around my shoulders. I know what it is to feel safe, to take fresh water and a doctor’s appointment for granted.

## More Funding Cuts and Uncertainty at NSF

date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

According to the lawsuit, a reduction in the NSF indirect cost rate to 15% would result in an “annual loss of approximately $14.8 million to Caltech’s planned research budget.” An awarded grant consists of direct costs, which fund the research itself, and indirect costs, an added percentage that covers overhead such as infrastructure and administration. Caltech currently has 210 active awards and subawards from NSF. In Fiscal Year 2024, the Institute spent over $93 million on NSF-supported research, including nearly $22 million in indirect costs.

## NASA Faces 47% Budget Cut—Here’s How You Can Fight Back

## The Magical Campus of Caltech

date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

If you stroll past the Olive Walk on a sunny Pasadena day, you might see something magical in the air. Is it the scent of freshly pranked upperclassmen? The echo of the Fleming cannon? Or perhaps it’s just the spirit of Caltech’s brand of wizardry—a house system that would make even J.K. Rowling jealous. At Caltech, the hallowed tradition of “houses” isn’t just about where you sleep; it’s about forging family, engineering pranks, and unleashing a level of creativity that would make even Dumbledore drop his lemon drop.

## Unions Like UAW Must Shift Their Focus to Defend America’s Scientific Future

date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

It is no secret that America’s leadership in science and technology was not born by accident—it was built through public investment, public partnerships with academia, and government sanction of private sector monopoly. From the Apollo program to the Human Genome Project, from the internet to the transistor, the United States once treated research and development (R&amp;D) as a cornerstone of national security and economic strength. For some time the facade has been quietly crumbling away, but last week’s FY2026 Discretionary Budget Request rocked the foundations of that legacy hard enough to bring down its edifice.

## Vive la Fête: A Revolutionary Blacker Interhouse

date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

Last Saturday, the delicious scent of crème brûlée and chocolate croissants wafted through the alleys of Blacker Hovse. Moles hurried around the Hovse, tidying up their courtyard and dining hall for their annual Interhovse. The theme? The French Revolution. After months of preparation—with input from what felt like the entire Hovse—a production worthy of that era’s dynamism and ingenuity came together marvelously, complete with a panoply of renegade constructions and toothsome dishes.

## What If? The Disney Influence in My (and Probably Everyone’s) Life

date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

As I lean over my desk, slumped between piles of textbooks and scrawled notes, the weight of my schoolwork drags down my mind. The pressure to excel academically and carve out a niche in the competitive university environment sometimes becomes overwhelming. Yet amidst the chaos of deadlines and exams, an old song unexpectedly pierces the drudgery. The rich, sweeping sounds of &ldquo;Belle&rdquo; from Beauty and the Beast sweep me, in the blink of an eye, from the chill of my dorm room to one of wonder and magic. In an instant, I am no longer a struggling student trying to find her place, but a capable, independent young woman, venturing out into the world&rsquo;s possibilities. The burden of academic intensity and the pressure to conform to societal norms melt away, replaced by a sense of empowerment, joy, and pure fantasy.
