## Caroline Sierk’s ‘To Be’ uncovers what it means to be a filmmaker, actor in LA

date: 2025-04-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

A one-of-a-kind friendship and a motivating mantra are the inspiration behind Caroline Sierk&#8217;s directorial debut.
After the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television decided she was not to be a part of its department when she first applied in 2024, third-year political science student Sierk took it upon herself to make her own short film, titled &#8220;To Be.&#8221; Set in a romanticized 1965 Los Angeles, the movie follows college student Jack Adler, who chooses to look beyond his world of academics as he goes off into the city of stars and meets a fellow dreamer, Diana.
