The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation’s dedicated climate coverage now consistently receives more views than the rest of the newsroom’s coverage, head climate editors say....

## To preserve their work — and drafts of history — journalists take archiving into their own hands

date: 2024-07-31, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

When news sites shut down, those sites&#8217; owners often don&#8217;t prioritize the preservation of the content. MTV pulled down MTV News in June. After Deadspin was sold, many of its archives temporarily disappeared. This week, Flaming Hydra reported that The Awl&#8217;s archives are gone. And those examples are just from the past couple of months;...

date: 2024-07-31, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Fun fact: Local news network TAPinto and Nieman Lab share a birthday (month)! We were both founded in October 2008, in a moment of trepidation and excitement about possibilities for news on the internet.

## Most Americans follow local political news — but few are satisfied with the coverage they get, a Pew report finds

date: 2024-07-29, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Do most Americans want news about local government and politics? Do they follow news on this topic? And are they satisfied with the local political coverage they have? Those are three of the key questions a new report from the Pew-Knight Initiative, released last week, sought to answer. (The extreme CliffsNotes is “yes,” “yes,” and,...

date: 2024-07-29, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

During the past 30 years of South Africa’s democratic government, it’s hard to overstate the contribution and impact of investigative journalism. This is perhaps most evident in its role not just in exposing state misconduct at the highest levels, but in ensuring those responsible have faced real, significant consequences. Muckraking journalists were instrumental in exposing former President...
