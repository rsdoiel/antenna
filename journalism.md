## “If it’s good for the company now, work with them”: The Atlantic CEO on signing a deal with OpenAI

date: 2024-06-05, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Shortly before The Atlantic announced &#8220;a product and content&#8221; partnership with OpenAI, the magazine published a piece by The Information CEO and founder Jessica Lessin that argued &#8220;media companies are making a huge mistake with AI.&#8221; &#8220;For as long as I have reported on internet companies, I have watched news leaders try to bend their...

## Does curiosity make you read more hard news? How about anxiety?

date: 2024-06-04, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Why do people read the news? To journalists, that may sound like a stupid question. We read news because it&#8217;s critical to democracy! Because it&#8217;s the fascinating narrative of human existence! Because it&#8217;s a daily heroic tale of reporters uncovering corruption, malfeasance, and grift! But to normies, it&#8217;s sometimes a real puzzle. News is an...

## We always thought The Epoch Times was sketchy, but this is really something

date: 2024-06-04, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The Department of Justice has charged the CFO of The Epoch Times — the shadowy, pro-Trump, conspiracy-embracing, billboard-loving, and weirdly successful media company — with conspiring to launder at least $67 million in illegally obtained funds. (If you&#8217;d hoped to attend The Epoch Times School of Journalism, you might want to make other plans.) The CFO,...

## For most news outlets, Trump’s conviction was front-page news. What about local chains?

date: 2024-06-03, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

On Friday, May 31, front pages around the world blasted the historic news that a former president of the United States and current leading presidential candidate had, for the first time, become a felon. Not all front pages, though. The Seattle Times&#8217; Jeong Park quickly noticed that several Gannett newspapers (and at least one McClatchy...

## What’s in a byline? For Hoodline’s AI-generated local news, everything — and nothing

date: 2024-06-03, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

When Hoodline, a company that runs hyperlocal news sites for cities across the country, first launched, it sounded promising. The site’s approach to combining data with granular, on-the-ground reporting got the attention of my former Nieman Lab colleagues back in 2015, when it was focused on San Francisco. We wrote about it again in 2018,...
