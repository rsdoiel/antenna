## UC Regent Jay Sures required to pay legal fees for pro-Palestine UCLA student

date: 2025-08-15, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

A court ruled Thursday that UC Regent Jay Sures must pay $150,624 of graduate student Dylan Kupsh’s legal fees after Sures unsuccessfully attempted to file a restraining order against him.&#160;
Kupsh – along with around 50 other pro-Palestine protesters – demonstrated outside Sures’ Brentwood home in February, calling him &#8220;responsible for protecting UC investments in genocide and weapons manufacturing.” Lawyers representing Sures initially alleged that Kupsh was a “ringleader” among the protesters, but were unable to prove the claim in court.

If you were looking for a single journalistic catchphrase, you could do worse than “follow the money.” Investigating and documenting the flow of cash and other resources is almost always a worthwhile pursuit for someone trying to get to the bottom of things. Molly White, an independent journalist, software engineer, and one of the sharpest...

Justine Farrell, the chair of the marketing department at the University of San Diego’s Knauss School of Business, continued her testimony Wednesday.
She said that, based on impression data from Cision, Klein’s media appearances – including him speaking about his administrative leave on Fox News multiple times – created “substantial media attention” around the situation, while the email announcing his leave which was sent to Anderson School of Management students did not.

## It just got easier to make an archival copy of that website you’re digging into

date: 2025-08-13, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

It&#8217;s a tough time to be interested in archiving the web — arguably the most transient medium for news since the birth of radio. On Monday, Reddit announced it would begin blocking the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine from crawling the site to make an archival copy. Wayback is the closest thing we have — as...

In the most remote parts of Alaska, staying in touch can involve a bit more effort than sending a text. Cell service is spotty, highways are nonexistent, and the postal service remains a vital lifeline, delivering supplies and mail by plane. But for anyone who wants to broadcast a different kind of message — a...

## Why the 2025 election was the “most poorly covered election in modern Canadian history”

date: 2025-08-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In the first federal election since news was banned on Meta platforms, Canadians lost out, a new report finds. The 2025 federal election was likely the &#8220;most poorly covered election in modern Canadian history&#8221; due to the erosion of local news and Facebook&#8217;s news ban, according to the Ottawa-based nonpartisan think tank Public Policy Forum...

She said that while she believed Klein&#8217;s email response was racially insensitive and reflected “poor judgment,” it did not ultimately affect the sender of the email&#8217;s ability to learn.

## Can nonprofit news mix with local TV? A Pennsylvania partnership aims to find out
