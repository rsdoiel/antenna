About 100 million students come to the United States annually, with around 3,500 international students enrolling in CSUN to achieve their goals and dreams. Nevertheless, the government recognizes international students...

## Publishers find the AI era not all that lucrative

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

&#8220;The AI era,&#8221; Sara Fischer writes in Axios, &#8220;is proving lucrative for media publishers looking to offset a slowdown in ads and subscription fatigue.&#8221; My prediction for 2025 is that this will not be true for most news organizations, because they&#8217;ll find that no technology companies are interested in paying for their content. While in...

## All eyes are on Brazil

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Last November, Brazil&#8217;s first lady was involved in an unusual altercation during the G-20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro. During a panel about disinformation, Janja Lula da Silva was defending tougher social media regulation when she heard a loud noise in the background. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s Elon Musk,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of you&#8230;fuck...

## Embrace the barbell

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

We live in a time of media fragmentation and hyperpolarization. This year&#8217;s presidential election raised further questions about traditional media&#8217;s relevance. And it seems increasingly clear that people are gravitating to extremes in the types of content they consume — whether scrolling short-form posts or listening to hours-long podcasts. We must meet them there. When...

## We stop excusing the lack of accessibility in news

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

As we stumble into 2025, the conversation around accessibility in journalism is more relevant than ever. As news organizations try to engage wider and more diverse communities, accessible content isn&#8217;t just a moral imperative — it&#8217;s also a practical one. Yet many newsrooms still overlook even the most basic accessibility elements of publishing, even though...

## Media’s acquiescence to Trump will fail

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

You&#8217;ve seen them yank endorsements, sand down headlines, play both sides, and bend the knee at Mar-a-Lago. There&#8217;s a movement in media c-suites to get right with Donald Trump, or at least to be a little less antagonistic. It&#8217;s going to fail, and it&#8217;s going to fail badly. News organizations had established something of a...

## The media surrenders to Trump 2.0

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The warning signs were there before the election. In October, The Washington Post announced it would no longer endorse political candidates. The Los Angeles Times followed suit. These weren&#8217;t principled stands for neutrality. They were previews of how mainstream media outlets plan to handle Trump&#8217;s second term: with kid gloves and bothsidesism that would make...

## Prepare for the unthinkable

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In addition to working on journalism, elections, and democracy this year, I&#8217;ve been navigating a pediatric cancer diagnosis and treatment for my three-year-old. All of this has given me a newfound appreciation for what it takes to live in a constant existential crisis. While journalists don&#8217;t know exactly the speed at which harm may be...

## Declaring platform independence

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The last few years have been plagued by the collapse of discoverability on the internet, which have helped fuel the destruction of many media companies&#8217; already fragile business models. AI slop, AI-powered bots, and tech companies&#8217; obsession with shoving AI into every part of their platforms have made the internet noisy and hard to navigate....

## Investing in the disability beat

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

To create an accurate record of history, news organizations in 2025 must become serious about the disability beat by understanding and actively resisting ableism. That&#8217;s more crucial than ever with an incoming president whose rhetoric falls in line with fascist logics and beliefs and whose appointees for various health positions ramp up chances for misinformation...

## AI revolutionizes access to multilingual content

Is artificial intelligence ready to transform my content into other languages with cultural precision? The answer is that it&#8217;s almost there, and by 2025, it will reach its full potential, making now the perfect time to develop a multilingual and multicultural strategy. Artificial intelligence enables our content to be translated not just into another language,...

## Data and context makes a comeback

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Do you ever visit a friend&#8217;s house and find yourself surprised at how different their Netflix queue looks than yours? Or worry about the breaking down of a shared reality amid an increasingly fractured media landscape? As more of our digital experiences become mediated by personalization algorithms and fandoms built around individual content creators, I...

## News jumps off the page

Meow Wolf announced one million visitors to its Santa Fe exhibit just nine months after opening. In 2023, nearly 18 million people visited the Walt Disney World Resort.

## How do we cover “people like me”?

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

If the media wants to survive, it must work on trust and represent people fairly. If 2024 was a year of enormous media challenge in this &#8220;unique year for democracy&#8221; — with half of the world&#8217;s population voting for their elected representatives — then 2025 needs to be a year for deep reflection and real...

## The longform renaissance

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

If I&#8217;m going to predict the future, I find it useful to return to the past. As a kid, I wanted to be a journalist because I dreamed of seeing the world, meeting people who were different from me, and telling their stories. I suspect many of us were drawn to journalism for similar reasons:...

## Publishers reckon with dark patterns

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

A significant amount of media attention and scholarship has focused on mis- and disinformation in news, centering both the platforms that allow news organizations to share misinformation as well as the news organizations that have published misinformation — whether about public health, the elections, or disaster relief. The attention on this kind of deception is...

## More newsrooms will partner with student journalists

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

As a lifelong journalist, it&#8217;s been disheartening to watch the election and its aftermath. Like many readers, I&#8217;ve always believed that if you just show the audience the truth or if you uncover wrongdoing, people will act and demand change. But I&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks questioning my vocation. The divided news ecosystem originated...

## Double down on journalistic independence

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Threats to journalistic independence are appearing at increasing rates worldwide, including in established democracies — a situation which, frankly, deserves more attention than it often receives. These threats have now crossed a new threshold here in the United States. As Maria Ressa, a Center for News, Technology &#038; Innovation board member, reminded us in her...

## Journalism educators unite

date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In 2025, journalism education will face another challenging year. With declining student enrollment in journalism and mass communication programs, increasing workloads on educators, and curriculum challenges with depth and breadth of covering the basics of newsgathering while providing the latest skillsets, journalism education has its work cut out for itself. As the news industry continues...
