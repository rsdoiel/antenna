## UCLA football fails to earn its stripes in road loss to Penn State

date: 2024-10-05, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

<em>This post was updated Oct. 5 at 9:40 p.m.</em>
A switch seems to flip in the Bruin locker room at halftime.
In fact, the team&#8217;s season could be defined by a cycle of two clashing stories.&#160;
One half almost silences naysayers, the other forces the crowd to seek the nearest exit – consistency has been a fleeting ghost.&#160;
This time, with a dreamy first half and nightmarish second, UCLA football (1-4, 0-3 Big Ten) was bowled over by No.

## Second Take: The declining popularity of girl groups in Western music harms sonic diversity

date: 2024-10-05, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

Contemporary pop hits have sounded hollower without the regular inclusion of girl groups in the Western musical landscape.
Even as this summer featured the explosion in popularity of several female artists from Sabrina Carpenter to Chappell Roan &#8211; while others such as Charli xcx experienced a resurgence in mainstream attention &#8211; the music industry&#8217;s ever-evolving ecosystem remains strangely absent of female groups.
