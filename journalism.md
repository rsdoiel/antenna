date: 2025-08-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In the first federal election since news was banned on Meta platforms, Canadians lost out, a new report finds. The 2025 federal election was likely the &#8220;most poorly covered election in modern Canadian history&#8221; due to the erosion of local news and Facebook&#8217;s news ban, according to the Ottawa-based nonpartisan think tank Public Policy Forum...

Asmara Carbado, a former investigative attorney for UCLA&#8217;s Discrimination Prevention Office, testified about the office’s preliminary assessment into Klein’s email.
She said that while she believed Klein&#8217;s email response was racially insensitive and reflected “poor judgment,” it did not ultimately affect the sender of the email&#8217;s ability to learn.
