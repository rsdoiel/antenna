## Golden Gophers burrow Bruins’ lead with last-minute touchdown in Rose Bowl loss

date: 2024-10-13, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

Ethan Garbers wasn’t scheduled to start an hour before Saturday’s kickoff.&#160;
But on the Bruins’ first drive, the redshirt senior quarterback took the field.&#160;
And on UCLA’s final drive –&#160;with 27 seconds left on the clock – Garbers was the team’s last hope.&#160;
However, the seasoned signal-caller was depleted of his magic tricks by the fourth quarter.&#160;
With seven seconds to play, Garbers tossed deep into the night –&#160;and right into the hands of defensive back Koi Perich –&#160;for his third interception of the game.&#160;
As UCLA football (1-5, 0-4 Big Ten) lived and died by its veteran quarterback, Minnesota (4-3, 2-2) emerged victorious 21-17 at the Rose Bowl on Saturday night.&#160;
“This is a tough loss, so this one’s going to sting a little bit,” said coach DeShaun Foster.
