## UCLA Center for Liberal Arts and Free Institutions celebrates the humanities

date: 2023-10-11, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

For one UCLA center, 2023 is not the year of &#8220;The Eras Tour&#8221; or the &#8220;Barbie&#8221; movie.
It is the 400th anniversary of the First Folio, a first-edition copy of William Shakespeare’s plays, which resides in UCLA’s Clark Library, according to Daniel Lowenstein, a professor of law emeritus.

## Modernized classic returns 20 years later in ‘The Exorcist: Believer’

date: 2023-10-11, from: PCC Courier (PCC Student Newspaper)

Although “Exorcist: Believer” will never take the place of the original “Exorcist”, it is a very close second. The acting was top notch, the effects were spectacular, and the story behind how the possession came to be was fantastic. The director of this film, David Gordon Green, has quite a good amount of experience in the horror world. He was also the director of the reboot of “Halloween” in 2018, “Halloween Kills” in 2021, and “Halloween Ends” in 2022. While it was definitely a slight ...
