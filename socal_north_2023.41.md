## We Do Our Homework: Caltech Graduate Students and Postdocs Should Form a Union

date: 2023-09-04, from: Caltech Letters (a student blog)

<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2023-09-04-we-do-our-homework/cover.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="c-content__image-caption"></p>
<p class="c-content__image-credit">Courtesy of C/GPU</p>

<p><em>Viewpoint articles are a vehicle for members of the Caltech community to express their opinions on issues surrounding the interface of science and society. The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of Caltech or the editorial board of Caltech Letters. Please see <a href="https://caltechletters.org/disclaimer/" target="_blank">our disclaimer</a>.</em></p>

<p><span class="first-letter">S</span>cience is a labor of love—love of discovery, and love of pushing the limits of current human knowledge and ability. As graduate student and postdoctoral workers at Caltech, we nourish our cell culture lines on weekends, stay up all night observing through telescopes, spend hours welding devices, and travel long distances to study our world. We care deeply about our science, and we want the best environment in which to do that science.</p>

<p>Some aspects of our environment support our ability to do strong science, such as access to cutting-edge technologies, brilliant colleagues, and compelling classes and seminars. Other factors hinder or harm that ability, particularly for colleagues disadvantaged by our current system: for example, wages that fall short of the cost-of-living year-after-year, unexpected changes or cuts to our health insurance, unsafe laboratory environments, and a history of institutional failures to address <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/ott-harassment-investigation" target="_blank">mistreatment by faculty</a>. To address these issues and create the best environment in which to do our science, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars across the Institute are in support of forming a union (<a href="https://caltechgpu.org/" target="_blank">known as Caltech Graduate Researchers and Postdocs United, or C/GPU</a>). Unionization will allow us to collectively bargain for better working conditions and codify them in an enforceable contract.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, administrators leading Caltech are actively opposed to graduate students and postdoctoral scholars forming a union. In an email to graduate students in May 2023, Dean of Graduate Studies David Chan <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXukjDK-flgHf3GVaG3XydVXx1--mu0N/view" target="_blank">bluntly wrote</a>, “As Institute leadership, we believe that unionizing is not in the best interest of our students or community”. Provost David Tirrell  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iLUWlNWjYpTkfTCwK82BtoEVvIfYBkx6/view" target="_blank">expressed a similar sentiment</a>, writing in March that unionization would alter the “direct” and “collaborative” relationship between administrators and students.</p>

<p>Why is Caltech against us unionizing? A union will better position us to negotiate for the best conditions to do our science by challenging the current power dynamic where Caltech administrators unilaterally control all aspects of our working conditions. Case-in-point: year after year, the Graduate Student Council has presented Caltech with data-driven, explicit, well-formulated requests for stipend increases that meet the rising costs of living. Each time, Caltech has given marginal increases. Then, after the public debut of Caltech Grads and Postdocs United in December 2022, Caltech announced a sudden $5,000 increase in the graduate student stipend. In a message to faculty, Provost Tirrell explained that this stipend increase would be funded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fKYRA3hDGrXhHxv6AK8Qd_F8x75NCVaf/view" target="_blank">without impacting research budgets</a>. Despite years of pleading from the Graduate Student Council, it took the specter of a union and a possible shift in power to finally persuade Caltech to increase stipends, and prove that they could do so without burdening lab funds. It is no wonder that on May 10th, 2023 the Caltech Graduate Student Council <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ax-s1AXrfOIom9NmvfHTAdtgDRpJIQrh/view" target="_blank">released a statement</a> of support for C/GPU!</p>

<p>Caltech administrators have repeatedly sent graduate students and postdoctoral scholars a link to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OkiteVPXrsV45FCRvB5bHt51zpEwVGvw/view" target="_blank">website</a> which provides supposedly unbiased “facts about, and resources for, current discussions about the potential Caltech graduate student and postdoctoral scholar unionization.” We were dismayed that much of the information in Caltech’s “Know the Facts” page lacks evidence, and worse, some of the “facts” are blatantly misleading. For example, they provide an example where “if only 100 out of 500 eligible people vote, 51 voters would determine the outcome for all 500 people in the bargaining unit, as well as future graduate students and postdocs”, which would suggest that graduate student and postdoctoral scholar union elections often have low (20%) participation. Twenty percent participation is far lower than any graduate student worker and postdoctoral scholar union election in recent history. Examples include <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/31-RC-308858" target="_blank">USC</a>, <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-RC-309139" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins</a>, and <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/01-RC-305762" target="_blank">Yale</a>, where union elections saw participation by 60%, 67%, and 63% of the voting body, respectively, with over 90% voting in favor in all three elections.</p>

<p>In fact, much of the language on Caltech’s webpage is similar to anti-union webpages at other universities. Several of these institutions have hired top-dollar law firms to prevent graduate students from unionizing; Duke University <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/punching-in-grad-student-unions-face-duke-university-challenge-28" target="_blank">famously funded</a> a legal campaign to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/05/23/nlrb-revisit-ruling-that-granted-graduate-students-right-organize-employees/" target="_blank">challenge the law</a> that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/23/are-they-students-or-are-they-employees-nlrb-rules-that-graduate-students-are-employees/" target="_blank">graduate students are workers</a> with the right to unionize. Curiously, large sections of the Caltech administration’s webpage are identical to a page about graduate student unionization <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XOYyqEnLOyVh5WOJQ_Bpm68RsOSCAioK/view" target="_blank">published by Duke</a>. Caltech graduate students and postdocs have taken the time to research, fact-check, and write <a href="https://caltechgpu.org/be-informed/" target="_blank">critical clarifications</a> to Caltech’s “Know the Facts” webpage.</p>

<p>Graduate student and postdoctoral workers drive the research and discovery happening at Caltech. We put all of our intellect (and most of our waking hours) into the generation, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of critical scientific advances. We do this work because we love science and discovery, but at the same time many of us struggle to pay for rent, healthcare, childcare, and international scholar visa and legal fees. Some of us deal with unsupportive or abusive advisors, and work in research settings with very real health hazards. Unionization can address these challenges and enhance our ability to do the scientific work that we love.</p>

<p>The undersigned graduate student workers and postdoctoral scholars have collectively contributed over a century of research and teaching years at Caltech. We have seen the  serious hardships many fellow researchers have faced while trying to do their science at Caltech. We came here to work with and learn from Caltech’s world-class faculty, and we believe that a union will allow us to achieve more together. Many faculty, having once been junior researchers themselves, have expressed support for graduate students and postdocs unionizing at Caltech. We advocate not only for ourselves, but for all of our colleagues, especially those in more vulnerable positions. With a union, we will have the ability to bargain for long-overdue improvements and protections, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Formal grievance procedures and third-party arbitration that puts students and survivors first, similar to mechanisms that the <a href="https://thetech.com/2022/02/03/unionize-students-first" target="_blank">graduate student union at MIT</a> is fighting for and the <a href="https://uaw5810.org/2022/10/03/major-victory-on-workplace-bullying-and-abuse/" target="_blank">unions at UC have won</a></li>
  <li>Protections and rights for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/protests-uc-san-diego-agrees-not-fire-chinese-postdoc-raised-concerns-rcna43737" target="_blank">international students and scholars</a></li>
  <li>Written, contractual stipend increases that reflect cost of living every year for graduate students and postdocs</li>
  <li>Guaranteed funding to transition away from toxic lab environments, <a href="https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/contract" target="_blank">conditions that Columbia</a> academic workers recently won in their contract</li>
  <li>Affordable health insurance and child care</li>
</ul>

<p>We have done our homework and made the decision that forming a union is necessary to ensure that we and future scholars at Caltech are best positioned to make discoveries that can positively change our world.</p>

And although she moved out for years-long stretches, she still lives in the huge South Central house she was raised in, purchased by her parents in 1954, which she describes as “looking like a big ship.” </p><p>Although living in the home can be bittersweet now that her folks are gone, she has special memories of eating family meals looking out of the big picture windows of the breakfast room into the backyard at her father’s lush garden, which she says was “like being in a professional nursery.” </p><!-- more --><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1098" data-orig-width="1925"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s640x960/70760c0dc4eecc18fd3ad60478eeff3efb3bd2ac.png" data-orig-height="1098" data-orig-width="1925" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s75x75_c1/27009e32ffeaa102fa1709e705c8de95842d0f05.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s100x200/dd054da6dfdc5c693eec016fdf810309dd471ed6.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s250x400/c7dc9ba6c54404df7cd854825a979cc3e214a405.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s400x600/1f7a9719f695c9641317185cac36eeedcc91d063.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s500x750/a744b792f1a1593042cfa4ac6c7523d3dc922a3b.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s540x810/50d63c5969e1ce8f38479549041c72566879bdec.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s640x960/70760c0dc4eecc18fd3ad60478eeff3efb3bd2ac.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s1280x1920/4d665c4e82fe41e741d9188c4e602f71e4b39f09.png 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4ab46aba11fd4db2e4b86304750089/e140b1a244c9b1e0-a6/s2048x3072/e2d7e4a897752714013c7142dadfd211f575f2e5.png 1925w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><i>The Drinkard Family Home. </i></p></blockquote><p>Juliet’s family home was built in 1910, like many of the other houses in the neighborhood.  She describes her parents trying to modernize the house, painting the dark wood white, removing the coffered ceilings and some of the built-ins.  Juliet tried to convince her parents not to make these renovations.  She says that “Even at 11, I liked looking at older buildings,” both her own house and those of her relatives.  Juliet especially likes the opportunities that participating in Conservancy events offers to get inside of homes and other buildings that she wouldn’t otherwise have access to. </p><p>Her parents both moved to Los Angeles from the south, her mother from Louisiana her father from Alabama.  Her father and his brother lived with their uncle, who “bought a tiny house on a street called “Success” in Compton,” notes Juliet.  Her parents met through an uncle on her mother’s side; they dated for a year and got married, spending their honeymoon night at the Clark Hotel on Central Avenue.  Juliet describes the special experience of being able to visit the Clark Hotel in the 1980s.  </p><p>Juliet’s commitment to historic preservation intensified when she started working in downtown Los Angeles in the 1970s.  “I went over to see the Bunker Hill area, and learned that the Victorian-era homes had been bulldozed.  I felt sick.  That area should have been preserved… something should have been done,” she says, adding “It’s important – that’s a part of the history of Los Angeles.” </p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1517" data-orig-width="2084"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s640x960/5c60bfc9f4e6bb94edd3e27155a9532e4267795f.jpg" data-orig-height="1517" data-orig-width="2084" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s75x75_c1/bca5a14dbbf5e22382bb898d1e3f2c162020c071.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s100x200/fdca08a257a654efb7666183008a56ef624a1e00.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s250x400/08e51bfa50b6a34f40ed0f73a37a3ec96a11bfc2.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s400x600/f4c23b2ef1599a01461c7bb3dad2219517f29542.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s500x750/c65ddb565f495b9bc1d7321e29fd4841a18c051d.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s540x810/40903bc4cd56e317a8fbc273945572f0c1a8e0b5.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s640x960/5c60bfc9f4e6bb94edd3e27155a9532e4267795f.jpg 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s1280x1920/a5545076b85ace097e3c57d3c3bbd3e4cbbf89fb.jpg 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s2048x3072/fda34ac8dcbbee1af8d86fcf95729fb2169cc7be.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1322" data-orig-width="1270"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s640x960/3c1913cc2a3e612a9c13b7fe848fd7f6d16c9b27.png" data-orig-height="1322" data-orig-width="1270" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s75x75_c1/550332e4d6399589b0d262f89f746ed218d6f4da.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s100x200/d74d5d957378294039ecd366365ae03267bd81be.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s250x400/75fc645f827f7bd87fd9e0355fdb38a5a1ea20b6.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s400x600/8f16d428dbffe2829ac9c76ac61e58adf8d47467.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s500x750/fe4b143b64d799c051658bf2c302419cfc7d9e38.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s540x810/92145b65aeb3d6ec6a23d5933a3d58209993e41f.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s640x960/3c1913cc2a3e612a9c13b7fe848fd7f6d16c9b27.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s1280x1920/caf4be6d1b09c6cba49aeb82b625c149bac49ee3.png 1270w" sizes="(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px"/></figure></div><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><i>Newspaper clippings of 1969&rsquo;s &ldquo;Negro History Week&rdquo; where 16-year-old Juliet was named Queen.</i></p></blockquote><p>With her passion for Los Angeles history, it was inevitable that Juliet would find her way to the Los Angeles Conservancy as a member and volunteer (her first assignment was the 2014 special tour We Heart Garden Apartments).  She supports the organization “to make a difference in preserving Los Angeles’ history.”  She loves to explore Los Angeles, and take friends and visitors to many places around town, with a special affection for historic locations.  She observes, “there’s so much to do and see in our own hometown!”   </p><p>One of Juliet’s favorite historic places to visit is Frank Lloyd Wright’s Hollyhock House.  She went to visit three times in a 7-year period before Covid.  She said every time she went, she saw something different, and just loved standing in the space and looking around to get the feeling of the place. </p><p>Two of her other favorite historic locations in L.A. are Union Station and the Farmers Market, both formative places in her childhood that she still loves to visit. She describes going to the Farmers Market in the early 1960s as an 11 year old.  Her mother “worked for a lady whose apartment overlooked the Farmers Market,” and one time her mom gave her five dollars and let her explore the shops on her own.  She remembers how exciting that was. “I bought a little box of pastel chalks for $4.95,” which she says she still has to this day. </p><p>She describes going to Union Station frequently with her parents when she was young, “starting in the 1950s; relatives were always coming and going.”  As a child, she would look through the window at the Fred Harvey restaurant – she wanted to go in but never did.  It was a real pleasure for her to volunteer when the L.A. Conservancy held an event to celebrate the grand opening of the Imperial Western Brewing Company in 2018, in the former Fred Harvey restaurant space, which had sat empty for decades.  She says, “My dream came true.  Over 60 years later, I’m walking through the door, sitting and eating inside.” </p><p><i><b>Our sincere thanks to Juliet for sharing so many wonderful memories and family photos.</b></i></p>

These community anchors have long been one of the focal points of the Conservancy’s work, from responding to threats of demolition to providing technical assistance. We saved the original McDonald’s from demolition in the ‘90s, brought funding for the rehabilitation of the Formosa Cafe’s Pacific Electric Red Car, and rallied to designate Norms on La Cienega, Tom Bergin’s on Fairfax, and Otomisan Japanese Restaurant in Boyle Heights as Historic-Cultural Monuments (HCM). In late 2019, we proudly launched a Legacy Business initiative to raise awareness about and support for these important places in L.A. County. </p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we understood the immediate threat and unthinkable challenges facing longtime business owners. Thanks to Wells Fargo, we’ve been able to expand our legacy business initiative to include a grant program. This grant provides $5,000 to ten (10) eligible small businesses that have operated and contributed to their community’s history and/or identity for at least 20 years and have less than 25 full-time employees. </p><p>So far, the response has been overwhelming. Nearly 400 owners applied for the first round of grants, making the task of choosing just five winners almost seem impossible. Please join our Legacy Business Network and follow us on social media to learn more about our winners and to stay up-to-date on Round 2 of the L.A.

## Dungeons & Dragons & Batteries: Rethinking our approach to science outreach

date: 2023-01-17, from: Caltech Letters (a student blog)

<p><em>Viewpoint articles are a vehicle for members of the Caltech community to express their opinions on issues surrounding the interface of science and society.

Please see <a href="https://caltechletters.org/disclaimer/" target="_blank">our disclaimer</a>.</em></p>

<p><span class="first-letter">E</span>very Friday, I run a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure at my local game shop. It’s one of my favorite ways to meet people outside of Caltech. Armed with bags of dice in every color imaginable, I guide players through zany high-fantasy tales and lay out puzzles for our team of intrepid heroes to solve.</p>

<p>But tonight’s D&amp;D session isn’t your standard lair-crawling, monster-slashing module. Tonight, I’m running an adventure that doubles as science outreach. I still have plenty of classic D&amp;D hijinks planned, but as a battery chemist, I’ve put my own spin on the story. I’ve written different types of real-world batteries into the game mechanics, and I’ve plotted a tale that will show my players how those batteries work as they use a battery-powered device to defeat this week’s villain. As people start to join my table, introducing themselves or chatting about their characters, I’m excited to see how they’ll approach the science-themed adventure I’ve laid out.</p>

<hr />

<p>My battery-based D&amp;D module was developed with the assistance of the <a href="https://stemap.org/" target="_blank">STEM Ambassador Program</a> (STEMAP), an outreach training program that helps scientists design their own community engagement activities. I had a little experience leading community outreach, though mainly through programs developed by someone else. STEMAP taught me to design my own outreach program, and their approach surprised me in its difference from the work I’d done previously.</p>

<p>STEMAP prioritizes building trust between scientists and the community, instead of a strict focus on teaching science. Rather than reaching out to conventional places of learning like schools, libraries, or museums, STEMAP encouraged us to look for places where science outreach doesn’t usually happen, like game stores or tattoo parlors, <a href="https://stemap.org/engagement-activities/" target="_blank">among others</a>. Looking beyond the obvious venues allowed us to reach people who don’t, or can’t, engage with science in those spaces. And instead of showing up with a demonstration already planned out or with activity kits already in hand, we spent time talking to leaders and representatives of the focal group—the group we wanted to work with—about the best way to present scientific material before we even began planning our program.</p>

<p class="c-content__image-caption">STEMAP's approach encourages science outreach in less conventional places, like tattoo parlors or breweries.</p>
<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by Jennah Colborn for Caltech Letters</p>

<p>This relationship-centered model seems simple, but it fosters an empathic approach to outreach that seems to be lacking in the modern scientific community. Too often, scientists fall into the trap of the “<a href="https://smallpondscience.com/2020/01/18/the-deficit-model-of-science-communication/" target="_blank">deficit model</a>”: the belief or assumption that skepticism of science stems from a lack of scientific understanding, and that we do outreach to teach science to people who lack scientific knowledge. But that approach devalues the sociocultural factors that influence attitudes toward science, ignores what people might already know about the topic from their own lived experiences, and erases the group’s agency in deciding how and why they want to learn more. The deficit model alienates people whose <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/society/how-western-science-is-finally-catching-up-to-indigenous-knowledge/" target="_blank">science knowledge</a> draws from experiences outside of formal education, who have historically been <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-racism-in-healthcare-has-led-to-vaccine-hesitancy" target="_blank">undervalued</a> by scientific institutions, or whose attitudes toward science stem from deeply held <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2021-4-fall/feature/nimby-threat-renewable-energy" target="_blank">values</a> and beliefs that are challenged by scientific advances. In contrast, a more empathic, value sharing approach <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/69/4/305/5369893" target="_blank">increases</a> public interest in science and improves scientists’ connections to their communities.</p>

<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2023-01-17-dungeons-dragons-outreach/models.png" alt="" /></div>
<p class="c-content__image-caption">The deficit model sees scientific outreach as a didactic practice, providing scientific knowledge where it was previously lacking. The relationship-centered model recognizes and draws on the lived experiences and existing knowledge of community members.</p>
<p class="c-content__image-credit"></p>

<p>So how can we, as scientists, build authentic and trustworthy relationships with the communities we want to reach? Below are a few considerations that we can implement at any stage of the engagement process.</p>

<p><strong>Get to know your audience.</strong> When communicating our science, trainees are encouraged to “consider your audience,” usually to get us to think about our audience’s education level. Dig deeper. Consider your audience’s interests, the tools and resources they have (or need), and the knowledge or skills they might already have acquired outside the school system. Use those interests, tools, and knowledge to build common ground.</p>

<p><strong>Talk to community leaders.</strong> Build your outreach and engagement programs in collaboration with people who already know your audience. Ask what the group wants to learn. Listen to, and learn from, how they already engage with science. Spend time in the space you’ll be occupying. Resist the urge to guess (or to assume you already know) what your audience cares about or how they want to engage with the material.</p>

<p><strong>Be your full self.</strong> Engage with your own community, whether that community is built around shared identities, interests, or values. That shared connection can be as deep or as frivolous as you want it to be, but bonding over something important to both you and your focal group builds trust and invites the public to see you as more than just your lab coat. Building that trust is just as worthy and important of a goal as sharing the science, and it will open doors to more effective and long-lasting relationships with our communities.</p>

<p>I encountered a powerful example of these principles in action at a conference in the summer of 2022. I met a researcher from South Africa who was working with rural and tribal groups to find more climate-friendly alternatives to coal mining. Her efforts weren’t focused on educating those groups on climate change though; as she explained, they already knew a lot about the effects of climate change on agriculture from their own lived experiences. They understood the science of climate change through a different lens, and they knew that closing coal mines would help fight both climate change and mining-related illness. But closing the mines would destroy the economies of their mining towns. Rather than hammering home the negative impacts of coal mining on the environment, her work focused on building trust and open conversations with the residents of those towns to ensure that alternatives to the coal mines would meet their economic and public health needs.</p>

<p>These principles can be applied just as easily in less politically charged situations, like classroom outreach or my battery D&amp;D adventure. Though the stakes are much lower, there are clear parallels in how our focal groups respond when given the freedom and agency to direct their own engagement with a topic. When we approach outreach with empathy and openness, we build stronger, more trustworthy relationships with the communities we want to reach.</p>

<hr />

<p>As our party of heroes defeats their last imaginary foe, I look out across the table at the smiling faces of a team that were strangers to each other, and to me, not three hours before. Even if they don’t remember a single thing about batteries, I’ve taken the first steps towards building an outreach relationship based on trust and mutual interest. I’ve shown that I’m more than just a scientist, and that I see them as more than just people who don’t know about batteries. Building trust through shared values might not be a typical focus during outreach, but I’m hopeful that by prioritizing those relationships, we can grow lasting, authentic, and impactful educational partnerships.</p>

Development Director Liz Leshin recently checked in with her. </p><p><b>LL: How did you learn about the L.A. Conservancy, and what compelled you to join?</b></p><p>SK: A few years ago, a friend and I were talking about Downtown LA and all the stunning buildings there, the theaters in particular, and she told me that her father-in-law (Herb Silverman) is a docent for the Conservancy-led tours. That was my initial introduction to the Conservancy.</p><!-- more --><p>I’ve also been exploring downtown a lot and recently started an Instagram account dedicated to Los Angeles Terrazzo (<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.instagram.com/losangelesterrazzo/" target="_blank">@losangelesterrazzo</a>), and when I post about the amazing terrazzo I find, I try to research the building and area, and nearly every time, I am led to the Conservancy website. It was probably my obsession with the old theaters, and the possibility of exploring inside of them that led me to join the Conservancy</p><p><b>LL: You participated in the Conservancy&rsquo;s Community Leadership Boot Camp this year; what did you get out of the experience</b>?</p><p>SK: I LOVED my Boot Camp experience! I learned so much – it’s hard to even encapsulate. I learned about all the amazing resources and research tools available. I know the process of landmarking a building and what it takes to do that. I know what city agencies control what, and I know that the Vista Hermosa neighborhood has way too many uncapped oil wells. I made friends too! Most importantly, I learned about what I can do as a citizen of Los Angeles to make my voice heard and help advocate to raise awareness of historic spaces.</p><p><b>LL: Which neighborhood do you live in?  And what do you think makes it distinct?</b></p><p>SK: I live in Eagle Rock. I love it for the community feel and I love the location - this unique little pocket between the rest of LA and Pasadena. It’s got two lovely main streets in Colorado Blvd and Eagle Rock Blvd that are filled with really special independent retail shops and restaurants that really seem to support each other. Of course we have our literal Eagle Rock.</p><p><b>LL: You also became a member of the Last Remaining Seats committee.  What attracted you to that, and what is your favorite part of LRS?</b></p><p>SK: Last Remaining Seats is such a special and magical series. I work in the music industry, but I LOVE film and old theaters – the glamour they hold, the golden age of cinema, and this is such a great merger of that.</p><p>I met Lia, the Conservancy&rsquo;s volunteer coordinator at the in-person Boot Camp meeting, and when we started chatting about the volunteer opportunities I learned that I could volunteer on this committee, so I did! It was great timing, and I can’t wait for the next season. I’ll be at every screening, and part of the appeal for me was really just being able to be inside these lovely spaces. A film I suggested will hopefully be shown, and I’m really excited for the entire potential slate, TBA!</p><p><b>LL: What case would you make to others for joining and supporting the L.A. Conservancy?</b></p><p>SK: If you love your city, it’s important to take an active role in its upkeep. No matter the cause, one voice CAN make a difference. It can be something as small as writing a letter. Los Angeles is unique, magical, diverse and HUGE. There is a lot of work to be done, and it’s so important to protect these spaces and neighborhoods. The saying “if these walls could talk” really could define preservation in Los Angeles, and I feel like the Conservancy is really working hard to make sure that the future of LA also includes the past, and they can’t do it without us! </p>
