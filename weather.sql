Recent microwave \nimagery revealed a decent curved band wrapping around the western \nand northern portions of the core.  Subjective and objective \nsatellite intensity estimates range from 39-51 kt and the initial \nintensity is held at 45 kt, closest to the SAB T3.0/45 kt value.\n \nThe storm continues to move slowly east-northeastward.  Models \ngenerally agree on this motion, which should continue for the next \nday or so.  By Tuesday evening, Pilar is forecast to stall near the \ncoast of El Salvador with the core of the storm offshore.  By \nWednesday the storm is expected to turn west-southwestward, away \nfrom the coastline, in the flow of a building ridge over the western \nCaribbean and Central America.  The latest NHC track forecast is \nshifted slightly north of the previous prediction, largely due to \nthe northward shift in the initial position.\n \nModerate east-southeasterly shear appears to be affecting Pilar.  \nHowever, most of the model guidance indicates that the storm should \nsteadily strengthen for the next day or so over the warm waters and \nin a moist airmass.  After 36 h, the deep-layer shear should \nincrease which will likely induce a weakening trend. By days 3-5, \nthe shear is expected to abate somewhat.  Once again, the long-range \nofficial intensity forecast has been increased slightly and is close \nto the various consensus aids.\n \n \nKey Messages:\n \n1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding,\nalong with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, near the Pacific\ncoast of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica\nthrough Wednesday.\n \n2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning early Tuesday\nalong portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and\nNicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. Interests\nelsewhere along the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and Nicaragua should\nmonitor the progress of this system as additional watches or\nwarnings could be needed later tonight.\n \n3.

The majority of\nthe CONUS will be relatively cold/dry, with the only buoyant warm\nsector confined to the FL peninsula (and just off the southeast\nAtlantic coast tonight).  The ongoing convection between Fort Meyers\nand Sarasota could persist through the afternoon while spreading\neast-northeastward along the warm front.  There will be sufficient\nvertical shear/hodograph length for a weakly rotating storm within\nthe cluster, but poor midlevel lapse rates and modest low-level\nflow/shear suggest that severe storms are unlikely.\n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-15 19:51:57','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-10-30 23:31:41','saved');

Pilar is\nmoving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion\nis expected to continue through early Wednesday.  On the forecast\ntrack, Pilar could be near the coast of El Salvador or Nicaragua\nTuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the system is\nexpected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to move\nwest-southwestward away from land on Thursday.\n \nMaximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Further strengthening is expected during the next day or so,\nand Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday.  Weakening is\nexpected to begin on Wednesday and continue through Thursday.\n \nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)\nfrom the center.\n \nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).\n \n \nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nKey messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone\nDiscussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC\nand on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml\n \nRAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to\n10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of Central\nAmerica from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through Wednesday.\nThis rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with\nmudslides in areas of higher terrain.\n \nSURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting\nthe Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.\n \nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical\nStorm Watch area early Tuesday.\n \n \nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.\n \n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n \n</pre>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-10-30 23:40:34','"~Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones"','',NULL,'2023-10-30 23:47:07','read');

Pilar is \nmoving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h). Pilar is \nforecast to move little tonight into early Wednesday. On the \nforecast track, Pilar could move a little closer to the coast of El \nSalvador or Nicaragua tonight through early Wednesday, though the \ncore of the system is expected to remain offshore. The storm is \nforecast to begin moving west-southwestward away from land by \nThursday.\n \nMaximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. \nSome slight strengthening is possible over the next day or so before \ngradual weakening likely begins on Thursday.\n \nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)\nfrom the center.\n \nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).\n \n \nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nKey messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone\nDiscussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC\nand on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml\n \nRAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5\nto 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of\nCentral America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras,\nwestern Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through Wednesday.  This\nrainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides\nin areas of higher terrain.\n \nSURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting\nthe Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.\n \nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical\nStorm Watch area during the next day or so.\n \n \nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.\n \n$$\nForecaster Kelly\n \n</pre>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-10-31 20:34:15','Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones','',NULL,'2023-10-31 22:27:09','read');

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDEP4+shtml/312035.shtml','Tropical Storm Pilar Forecast Discussion Number 13',replace('<pre>\n\n000\nWTPZ44 KNHC 312035\nTCDEP4\n \nTropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  13\nNWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023\n400 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023\n \nSatellite imagery shows that Pilar''s center remains exposed on the \nsoutheast side of the main convective plume. Earlier AMSR2 and \nSSMI/S microwave imagery depicts some partial banding features \nwithin the northern semi-circle. Scatterometer ASCAT-B and -C passes \nthis afternoon shows satellite derived winds are around 40 to 45 \nknots. These values are in good agreement with the latest Dvorak \nsatellite intensity estimates from both TAFB and SAB, T/3.0 or 45 \nknots. Therefore, given the combination of data this the \ninitial intensity remains at 45 kt for this advisory.\n \nPilar is moving slowly east-northeastward or 060/3 kt. The storm is \nforecast to move very little tonight as the steering currents over \nthe far eastern Pacific collapse. A mid-level ridge is then forecast \nto build to the north and northeast of Pilar, which should cause the \nstorm to begin moving west-southwestward. As the mid-level ridge \ncontinues to build westward, Pilar will be steered on a \nwest-southwestward to westward motion along the southern side of the \nridge. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to the previous \nadvisory and lies near the latest consensus aids. The threat of \ntropical-storm-force winds should begin to diminish as Pilar starts \nmoving westward, but the risk of heavy rain and flash-flooding is \nexpected to continue over portions of Central America over the next \ncouple of days.\n \nSome slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so as \nthe storm is located over warm sea surface temperatures and moderate \nvertical wind shear. In about 2 to 3 days vertical wind shear is \nforecast to weaken, but dry air from a gap wind event from the Gulf \nof Tehuantepec may limit intensification.  Towards the end of the \nperiod, the environmental conditions may become a little more \nconducive and the official forecast depicts strengthening once \nagain. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the corrected HCCA \nconsensus aids.\n \nKey Messages:\n \n1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding, \nalong with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast \nof Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern \nHonduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through \nWednesday.\n \n2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the\nPacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, where a\nTropical Storm Watch remains in effect.\n \n3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific\ncoast of Central America during the next few days.

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDEP4+shtml/011446.shtml','Tropical Storm Pilar Forecast Discussion Number 16',replace('<pre>\n\n000\nWTPZ44 KNHC 011446\nTCDEP4\n \nTropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  16\nNWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023\n1000 AM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023\n \nDeep convection has continued to burst over the western portion of \nPilar''s circulation this morning.  However, the cloud tops have been \nwarming during the past couple of hours, and recent visible imagery \nstill indicates that the low-level circulation is located near the \neastern edge of the convection.  The initial intensity is again held \nat 50 kt, which is a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak T- and \nCI-numbers from TAFB and SAB.\n \nRecent satellite fixes show that Pilar is now moving westward or\n270 degrees at 6 kt. A much faster westward to west-southwestward\nmotion is expected during the next few days as a narrow mid-level\nridge builds across southern Mexico.  The dynamical model guidance\ncontinues to trend toward a faster solution, and the NHC track\nforecast has again been sped up from the previous advisory.  The\nnew forecast track lies between the previous interpolated forecast\nand the latest HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.\n \nThe moderate shear that has been plaguing Pilar is expected to\ncontinue for another day or so.  Although the shear may decrease\nsomewhat after that time, the storm is likely to encounter a drier\nand more stable airmass from an ongoing Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind\nevent.  In addition, Pilar is expected to pass over an area of\nslightly cooler upwelled waters to the south and southwest of the\nGulf of Tehuantepec.  As a result of these unfavorable conditions,\nmost of the dynamical model guidance shows gradual weakening\nduring the next few days, and the NHC intensity forecast follows\nsuit.  It should be noted that simulated satellite imagery from the\nGFS suggests that Pilar could struggle to maintain organized deep\nconvection by the weekend.  The NHC forecast maintains Pilar as a\ntropical cyclone for the entire 5-day period, but it is possible\nthat the system degenerates into a remnant low or trough before the\nend of the period.  There is still a fair amount of uncertainty in \nthe longer range status and intensity of the system.\n \n \nKey Messages:\n \n1. Additional heavy rainfall from Pilar will produce flash and urban\nflooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the\nPacific coast of Central America from southern El Salvador, across\nsouthern Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica\nthrough today.\n \n2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the\nPacific coast of El Salvador where a Tropical Storm Watch remains\nin effect.\n \n3.

A basal shortwave trough was\napparent in moisture-channel imagery from Lower MI across southern\nIL to the KS/OK border vicinity.  By 00Z, this perturbation is\nexpected to elongate further and pivot to northern NY, PA, WV, parts\nof KY/TN, and AR.  By 12Z tomorrow, the trough should be over or\njust offshore of the coast from New England to northeastern NC,\narching inland to the TRI area. \n\nAt the surface, 11Z analysis showed two primary fronts:\n1.  A warm to quasistationary boundary extended from a low near Cape\nSan Blas southeastward across central FL to a weak low near XMR,\nthen northeastward approximately along the western part of the Gulf\nStream past the NC Outer Banks.  This boundary should drift\nnorthward over land through much of the day, potentially reaching\nnorth-central FL before being overtaken by the next front.\n2.  An Arctic cold front was drawn from the San Blas low\nnortheastward to another low between HKY-AVL, and southwestward\nacross the central Gulf.  This front will move offshore of all the\nAtlantic Coast by 00Z, except central FL.  By 12Z, the cold front\nshould clear the entire FL Peninsula and Keys. \n\n...FL Peninsula...\nWidely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are expected to move\nroughly eastward across the area, both from the Gulf on either side\nof the southern front, and from development over land along and\nsouth of that boundary.  Isolated damaging to severe gusts are\npossible -- mainly near and south of the southern front where\nsurface-based inflow is expected.  A tornado also may occur in the\nsame regime -- especially closer to the Atlantic Coast where more\npotential exists for storm-scale interaction with sea-breeze and/or\nfavorably aligned outflow boundaries.  \n\nFor this outlook cycle, unconditional severe probability bins\noverall are kept at marginal categorical level, but appear\nnonuniform within that.  Overall, they would appear somewhat greater\nto the east and lower to the west, if continuous/heatmap-style\ncoloring were available.  Activity over the central and especially\neastern parts of the peninsula -- along and south of the southern\nthen combined front -- will have access to a richly moist boundary\nlayer with the longest time frame for diurnal destabilization of the\ninflow layer.  Somewhat muted diabatic heating through cloud cover\nwill slow the pace of destabilization, but still yield favorably\nuninhibited buoyancy.  With surface dewpoints in the upper 60s to\nlow 70s F, that heating should offset weak low/middle-level lapse\nrates enough to yield MLCAPE generally in the 1000-1500 J/kg range. \n\n\nWith little change in either heights or height gradient aloft, mid/\nupper-level winds and deep shear should remain favorable through the\nday, albeit with some decrease as winds veer near the surface. \nSupercell and bowing/clustered modes are possible within the band(s)\nof convection.  However, the veering will lead to gradual shrinking/\nstraightening of hodographs during the period of daytime\ndestabilization (offsetting factors).  This will make tornado\npotential conditional on more storm- to local-scale effects. \nActivity should weaken with southward extent this evening as the\ncombined boundary moves into a nocturnally stabilizing airmass, with\nstill more veering of near-surface flow.\n\n..Edwards/Dean.. 01/16/2024\n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-16 12:40:56','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-11-01 16:22:11','saved');

A subtle/embedded speed max over the northern\nGulf of Mexico will move over north FL this afternoon, and this will\nhelp focus thunderstorm development through the day across central\nFL, both along and south of the cold front.  Midlevel lapse rates\nwill not be steep, but some cloud breaks north of ongoing convection\nand boundary-layer dewpoints in the low 70s will contribute to\nMLCAPE near 1000 J/kg ahead of the cold front, and somewhat larger\nbuoyancy along the southern fringes of the ongoing convection in\ncentral FL.  \n\nThe storms west of Tampa have shown some increase in intensity along\nthe front, and additional storm development is possible along the\nsouthern periphery of the ongoing storms across central FL. \nDeep-layer vertical shear/hodograph length will be sufficient for\nsome organized/rotating storms, while low-level hodograph\ncurvature/SRH will remain relatively larger through early afternoon\nand begin to decrease by mid-late afternoon as low-level flow veers.\n The net result will be the potential for line segments or\nsupercells capable of producing isolated wind damage.  A brief\ntornado or two will also be possible, focused a little more toward\nthe Atlantic coast where low-level shear will be modestly stronger\nthrough more of the afternoon.\n\n..Thompson/Moore.. 01/16/2024\n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-16 16:04:57','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-11-01 16:22:11','saved');

A recent burst of convection has obscured the\ncenter on visible satellite imagery.  Satellite intensity estimates\nhave trended downward this cycle, with 45 kt from TAFB and SAB\nand a range of 33-49 kt from various objective estimates.  The\ninitial intensity has been lowered to 45 kt based on these values.\n \nPilar is accelerating westward with an estimated motion of 270/9\nkt.  This general motion with an increase in forward speed is\nforecast for the next few days as the storm is steered along the\nsouth side of a mid-level ridge.  The model guidance has\naccelerated again from the previous advisory.  The latest forecast\ntrack is a blend of the prior prediction and the latest simple and\ncorrected consensus aids.\n \nModerate deep-layer vertical wind shear is expected to persist for\nat least another 24 hours.  While the shear decreases beyond a day,\nPilar will likely encounter a drier, more stable airmass associated\nwith a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event.  These environmental\nconditions, along with cooler, upwelled ocean waters should result\nin a gradual weaken trend as indicated by the majority of the\ndynamical intensity guidance.  The official intensity forecast\nreflects this scenario and is closest to the simple model consensus. \nThere remains the possibility that Pilar could weaken sooner and \nbecome a post-tropical cyclone or open into a trough.  However, the \nofficial forecast conservatively maintains a 5-day forecast for now.\n \n \nKey Messages:\n \n1. Additional heavy rainfall from Pilar will produce flash and urban\nflooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the\nPacific coast of Central America from southern El Salvador, across\nsouthern Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica\nthrough today.\n \n2. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific\ncoast of Central America during the next day or two.  These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.\n \n \nFORECAST POSITIONS AND MAX WINDS\n \nINIT  01/2100Z 12.4N  91.7W   45 KT  50 MPH\n 12H  02/0600Z 12.0N  93.4W   45 KT  50 MPH\n 24H  02/1800Z 11.1N  96.2W   40 KT  45 MPH\n 36H  03/0600Z 10.2N  99.4W   40 KT  45 MPH\n 48H  03/1800Z  9.5N 102.4W   35 KT  40 MPH\n 60H  04/0600Z  9.3N 105.1W   35 KT  40 MPH\n 72H  04/1800Z  9.4N 107.8W   35 KT  40 MPH\n 96H  05/1800Z 10.0N 111.7W   30 KT  35 MPH\n120H  06/1800Z 10.9N 115.0W   30 KT  35 MPH\n \n$$\nForecaster Bucci\n \n\n</pre>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-01 20:41:30','Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones','',NULL,'2023-11-02 00:10:14','read');

There have been a few microwave passes this \nmorning, which depict the overall pulsing nature of the convective \nstructure of Pilar. The satellite intensity estimates have decreased \nslightly this cycle. Given the nature of the pulsing convective \npattern, the initial intensity leans toward the Dvorak CI-numbers, \nwhich were 3.0 and 2.5 from TAFB and SAB, respectively.  This \nsupports keeping the initial intensity steady at 45 kt, but this \ncould be a little generous.\n \nPilar continues to accelerate westward this morning at an estimated \nmotion of 260/13 kt. A strengthening mid-level ridge is building to \nthe north and northeast of Pilar, which will steer the system \nwest-southwestward the next few days. A shortwave trough is forecast \nto move in from the northwest and weaken the mid-level ridge late \nthis weekend. This will result in Pilar slowing down and turning \nwest to west-northwest early next week. The model guidance is \nin fairly good agreement with this scenario, with the main \ndifference among the models being along-track with the forward \nspeed of Pilar. The NHC forecast is slightly faster than the \nprevious, and lies between the simple and corrected consensus aids.\n \nThe near term intensity forecast is a little tricky given the \npulsing convective nature of Pilar and the interaction with strong \nlow-level northerly winds associated with an ongoing Gulf of \nTehuantepec gap wind event. The gap wind flow could introduce some \ndrier air into Pilar''s circulation, which may briefly disrupt its \nconvective organization. Later this weekend, the system is forecast \nto move over warm sea surface temperatures with weak to moderate \nvertical wind shear. There is some spread in the intensity guidance \nbetween 36-72h with some of the hurricane regional models showing \nstrengthening, while some of the global models show little change in \nintensity. Given the favorable parameters and the guidance trends, \nthe NHC intensity forecast is slightly higher than the previous at \nthese time ranges, but still below the HWRF, HAFS-A and HCCA \ncorrected consensus. Towards the end of the forecast period, Pilar \nwill encounter a less favorable environment with increasing \nsouthwesterly shear and drier air. Given the small size of Pilar, \nintensity fluctuations are possible throughout the forecast period. \n\n \nFORECAST POSITIONS AND MAX WINDS\n \nINIT  02/1500Z 11.9N  95.2W   45 KT  50 MPH\n 12H  03/0000Z 11.2N  97.7W   45 KT  50 MPH\n 24H  03/1200Z 10.5N 100.9W   40 KT  45 MPH\n 36H  04/0000Z 10.1N 104.0W   40 KT  45 MPH\n 48H  04/1200Z 10.2N 106.8W   45 KT  50 MPH\n 60H  05/0000Z 10.5N 109.2W   45 KT  50 MPH\n 72H  05/1200Z 10.9N 111.3W   45 KT  50 MPH\n 96H  06/1200Z 11.9N 114.5W   40 KT  45 MPH\n120H  07/1200Z 13.1N 117.3W   35 KT  40 MPH\n \n$$\nForecaster Kelly\n \n</pre>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-02 14:37:27','Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones','',NULL,'2023-11-02 20:20:00','read');

Thunderstorm potential will remain\nlimited to locations along/south of a front forecast to be in place\nover the FL Peninsula, where greater low-level moisture will reside.\nAs the upper trough progresses eastward through the day, a weak\nsurface reflection should develop from the northeastern Gulf of\nMexico to the coastal western Atlantic. The cold front should also\nmove southeastward across the FL Peninsula through the period.\n\nStrong (50-60 kt) mid-level west-southwesterly flow associated with\nthe upper cyclone will be present over much of FL. Similar values of\ndeep-layer shear would typically support organized severe\nthunderstorm potential. However, in this case forecast thermodynamic\nprofiles across central/south FL will likely hinder updraft\nintensity, as poor mid-level lapse rates and warm temperatures aloft\nlimit the degree of instability that can develop. In addition,\nenhanced low/mid-level flow will be largely parallel to the surface\nfront, limiting low-level convergence/ascent. While there may be\nsome potential for strong/gusty winds with any convection that\ndevelops and can remain south of the front, the undercutting nature\nof the boundary suggests that overall severe potential will probably\nremain too low/sparse for highlights.\n\n..Gleason.. 01/15/2024\n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day2otlk.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-15 17:32:40','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-11-02 20:20:01','saved');

Although deep-layer shear is diagnosed in the SHIPS \nmodel as being low, global model analyses suggest that stronger \nmid-level southwesterly shear is occurring beneath the outflow \nlevel.  Therefore, some gradual weakening is likely over the next \nday or so.  After 24 hours, deeper-layer shear begins to increase to \nthe east of a trough, which should cause Pilar to weaken faster \nthrough midweek.  The cyclone is forecast to lose organized \nconvection and degenerate into a remnant low in about 2 days, and \nthen dissipate into a trough by day 4.\n \nPilar has slowed down and turned west-northwestward with an initial\nmotion of 285/7 kt in response to a mid-level trough extending \nsouthwest of the Baja California peninsula.  The storm is forecast \nto turn toward the northwest in about 24 hours as it approaches the \ntrough, and continue on that heading until it dissipates in about 4 \ndays.  The NHC track forecast is close to the previous prediction \nand lies between the HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.\n \n \nFORECAST POSITIONS AND MAX WINDS\n \nINIT  05/1500Z 10.8N 112.8W   45 KT  50 MPH\n 12H  06/0000Z 11.3N 113.7W   40 KT  45 MPH\n 24H  06/1200Z 12.1N 114.7W   40 KT  45 MPH\n 36H  07/0000Z 13.1N 115.7W   35 KT  40 MPH\n 48H  07/1200Z 14.6N 116.9W   30 KT  35 MPH...POST-TROP/REMNT LOW\n 60H  08/0000Z 16.0N 118.1W   25 KT  30 MPH...POST-TROP/REMNT LOW\n 72H  08/1200Z 17.3N 119.3W   25 KT  30 MPH...POST-TROP/REMNT LOW\n 96H  09/1200Z...DISSIPATED\n \n$$\nForecaster Berg\n \n</pre>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-05 14:36:54','Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones','',NULL,'2023-11-05 18:01:22','read');

Subjective Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are now\ndown to 2.0/30 kt and 2.5/35 kt, respectively, and objective\nestimates have fallen to between 35-40 kt.  Based on these data,\nPilar''s initial intensity is lowered to 35 kt.  Strengthening\nwesterly to southwesterly shear is already taking its toll on\nPilar, and atmospheric conditions are only expected to become more\nhostile over the next few days.  The NHC intensity forecast is near\nthe low end of the guidance, most closely following the SHIPS,\nLGEM, and GFS solutions, and shows Pilar becoming a remnant low by\n36 hours.  Since the storm remains over warm waters around 29\ndegrees Celsius, the forecast allows for the possibility of\nconvective redevelopment near the center tonight or on Monday.  But\nif this does not occur, Pilar could become post-tropical as early\nas tonight.  The remnant low is forecast to dissipate in about 3\ndays.\n \nWith the center becoming more apparent earlier this morning, it''s\nclear that a westward motion has continued (now estimated to be\n275/9 kt).  The dynamical models are not handling Pilar''s current\nmotion well at all since nearly all of them show an immediate\nnorthwestward turn, and as a result, the NHC track forecast is\nalong the left side of the guidance envelope and leans toward the\nshallow Trajectory and Beta model (TABS), especially in the short\nterm.  This new prediction is significantly west of the previous\nforecast due to the adjusted initial position, and accounting for\nPilar''s recent motion.\n \n \nFORECAST POSITIONS AND MAX WINDS\n \nINIT  05/2100Z 10.6N 114.3W   35 KT  40 MPH\n 12H  06/0600Z 11.1N 115.3W   35 KT  40 MPH\n 24H  06/1800Z 11.7N 116.2W   30 KT  35 MPH\n 36H  07/0600Z 12.5N 117.2W   25 KT  30 MPH...POST-TROP/REMNT LOW\n 48H  07/1800Z 13.7N 118.3W   25 KT  30 MPH...POST-TROP/REMNT LOW\n 60H  08/0600Z 15.0N 119.3W   20 KT  25 MPH...POST-TROP/REMNT LOW\n 72H  08/1800Z...DISSIPATED\n \n$$\nForecaster Berg\n \n</pre>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-05 20:33:30','Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones','',NULL,'2023-11-05 20:59:54','read');

Downstream\nof this perturbation, another short wave trough, of northern\nmid-latitude Pacific origins, is forecast to dig through the\nSouthwestern international border area, before rapidly pivoting east\nof the southern Rockies/northern Mexican Plateau through the\nsouthern Great Plains by the end of the period.\n\nAs stronger mid/upper forcing for ascent associated with the lead\nperturbation approaches the Ark-La-Tex vicinity, it still appears\nthat a surface low may begin to consolidate within deepening surface\ntroughing across the southern Great Plains into lower Mississippi\nValley.  Timing of the onset of more rapid deepening is becoming a\nbit more unclear, but still seems probable prior to 12Z Friday. \nOnce this occurs, a more substantive inland influx of low-level\nmoisture, off a still modifying boundary-layer over the northwestern\nGulf of Mexico, is expected to contribute to increasing near-surface\nor surface-based destabilization.  This appears likely to be aided\nby steepening lapse rates associated with mid-level cooling, in the\nexit region of an intense jet streak (northwesterly to westerly at\n100-120 kt around 500 mb).  \n\nCoincident with strengthening southerly lower-level flow (in excess\nof 50 kt) across the lower Mississippi Valley by 12Z Friday, rapidly\nintensifying thunderstorms posing increasing severe weather \npotential is possible by late Thursday night, if not earlier.  The\nmid/upper forcing for ascent may contribute to thunderstorm\ninitiation as early and far west as late Thursday evening near the\n(roughly) I-35 corridor of central Texas.  This may gradually evolve\ninto an upscale growing and organizing cluster across eastern Texas\ninto western Louisiana and Arkansas, with an additional area of\ndownstream warm advection driven supercell development possible\ncloser to the Mississippi River, by the end of the period.\n\n..Kerr.. 01/09/2024\n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day3otlk.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-09 13:13:56','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-11-10 17:02:28','read');

A moist airmass is\nforecast to advect northward into the central Gulf Coast ahead of\nthe approaching trough. Increasing low-level flow across the western\nGulf of Mexico Monday will make conditions favorable for MCS\ndevelopment. The MCS will likely move eastward across the northern\nGulf of Mexico on Tuesday. Surface dewpoints could reach the lower\nto mid 60s F across the central Gulf Coast just ahead of the trough\nduring the day. The northern part of the MCS could first affect\nsoutheastern Louisiana on Tuesday, and then move across far southern\nMississippi, far southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle Tuesday\nnight. Wednesday, thunderstorms may develop across parts of the\nFlorida Peninsula. Although a severe weather threat can not be ruled\nout, the models have some variance concerning the quality of\nlow-level moisture ahead of the system. If the more aggressive\nsolutions pan out, then a marginal tornado threat would be possible\non Tuesday across the central Gulf Coast. The current thinking is\nthat the higher quality low-level moisture and more significant part\nof the MCS will remain offshore, keeping any severe threat over the\nwater.\n\n...Thursday/Day 7 and Friday/Day 8...\nAn upper-level trough is forecast to develop across the central U.S.\non Thursday, and move into the eastern U.S. on Friday. The shortwave\ntrough in the Southeast is forecast to move eastward into the\nwestern Atlantic. In the wake of this system, instability is\nforecast to be limited across the Gulf Coast states and along the\nAtlantic Seaboard, minimizing any potential for thunderstorm\ndevelopment.\n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-10 14:50:12','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-11-10 17:02:28','read');

This activity is associated with\na surface cyclone currently analyzed along the southern New England\ncoast. The cyclone should continue to gradually deepen throughout\nthe morning due to differential cyclonic vorticity advection (ahead\nof a mid-level shortwave trough) and low-level coastal baroclinity\nas it moves east-northeastward. 12z GYX/CAR soundings exhibited\nstrong veering in the lowest ~3 km AGL, indicative of widespread\nlow-level warm-air advection. Temperatures aloft in the lowest 3 km\nAGL are nearly isothermal and below freezing, except nearer to the\ncoast where surface temperatures rising into the 40s F are observed.\nFarther inland, the continued northward moisture flux atop colder\nsurface conditions could contribute to periods of heavy snowfall\n(1-1.5 inches per hour) for the next few hours.\n\n..Flournoy.. 11/22/2023\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...CAR...GYX...\n\nLAT...LON   44307029 44606929 45106840 45656787 46916786 47196816\n            47096881 46596959 45767021 45257067 44887117 44427133\n            44177094 44307029 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md2286.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-22 14:51:03','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-11-22 16:43:09','read');

Eventual watch issuance is possible, though timing\nis uncertain.\n\nDISCUSSION...Convection is gradually increasing across parts of\nsoutheast TX within a low-level warm-advection regime, with recent\nsatellite and radar trends indicating an increase in storm intensity\nsouthwest of Galveston Bay. Mid/upper 60s F dewpoints are gradually\nstreaming northward across the region, though widespread cloudiness\nand increasing precipitation will continue to limit heating and\ndestabilization through the afternoon. \n\nThe timing and extent of surface-based supercell development this\nafternoon remain uncertain, and may continue to be limited by weak\nlow-level lapse rates and buoyancy. However, it remains possible\nthat consolidation of the stronger ongoing elevated convection may\nresult in transient supercell development, and there is also some\npotential for a supercell or two to develop offshore and move inland\nlater this afternoon. Favorable low-level and deep-layer shear (as\nnoted on the TIAH/THOU VWPs) will support a conditional tornado risk\nif any mature supercells can evolve with time. Tornado watch\nissuance is possible sometime this afternoon, if observational\ntrends begin to support imminent supercell potential.\n\n..Dean/Thompson.. 11/30/2023\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...LCH...HGX...CRP...\n\nLAT...LON   28639647 29129651 29409613 29869520 30139443 29829409\n            29559411 29319446 29099484 28849533 28689568 28549599\n            28439619 28369631 28639647 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md2290.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-30 19:56:02','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-11-30 18:23:02','read');

While much of this convection is well displaced from\na narrow plume of surface-based buoyancy stretching from the TX Gulf\ncoast into central TX, MUCAPE across northeast TX has steadily\nincreased to around 1000 J/kg amid warming/moistening within the\n925-850 mb layer. Observed storm motions and a lack of apparent\nlow-level mesocyclones further suggest that this convection is\nrooted above the surface, but elongated hodographs above 2 km\n(featuring effective bulk shear values near 40 knots), should\nsupport storm organization with an attendant risk of isolated large\nhail. Cooling cloud top temperatures and an uptick in lightning\ncounts over the past 15-30 minutes suggest convection is beginning\nto realize this environment, so an increasing hail threat seems\nprobable (though clustered storm modes may inhibit the overall\nthreat). Recent hi-res guidance, including HRRR-based SCRAMM\nsolutions and WOFS ensemble output, appears to have picked up on\nthis trend and shows increasing potential for isolated hail across\nnortheast TX over the next several hours. While the signal for\nsevere winds is comparatively weaker, a few damaging gusts will be\npossible. Regardless, the overall severe threat should remain too\nlimited to warrant watch issuance.\n\n..Moore/Thompson.. 11/30/2023\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...SHV...TSA...HGX...FWD...OUN...\n\nLAT...LON   31409742 31779765 32809746 33529748 33949761 34369566\n            34179495 33879449 33059425 32399443 31749489 31529539\n            31409742 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md2291.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-30 20:00:04','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-11-30 18:51:32','read');

This convection has struggled to organize beyond sporadic\nattempts at lower-end/transient mid-level rotation. The overall\nthermodynamic environment, which has been the primary mitigating\nfactor to severe weather thus far, might become slightly more\nconducive to generating a surface-based supercell as temperatures\nhave warmed into the upper 60s near/just south of this activity\nalong the immediate coast. This should gradually translate east\nthrough the rest of the evening into southwest LA, improving upon\nthe nil instability sampled in the 00Z LCH sounding. While the\nlow-level wind profile has been in the process of strengthening over\nthe past few hours, resulting in increasingly enlarged hodographs,\nconfidence remains low that sustained supercell development will\noccur as depicted in the 23Z RRFS compared to the negligible signal\nin the 00Z WoFS.\n\n..Grams/Smith.. 12/01/2023\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...LCH...HGX...\n\nLAT...LON   30249413 30369376 30349328 30249298 30089289 29909290\n            29769299 29739308 29679349 29599407 29549447 29649457\n            29699457 30249413 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md2294.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-12-01 01:00:07','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-12-01 01:17:41','read');

Surface observations show cool air over\nland with gusty northeast winds, and this will likely maintain a\ndecoupled boundary layer which should mitigate tornado and damaging\ngust potential in the near term.\n\nLater today, gradual warming is expected as the warm front shifts\nnorth along the coast. As winds veer to east and then southeast, a\nwarmer and more unstable air mass will then support a risk of brief\ntornadoes and damaging gusts, as shear will remain strong along the\nwarm front.

Aloft, a mid-level low\nis stacked back to the southwest with very cold air being funneled\nin by strong northwesterly flow across the High Plains into the\nCentral Plains. Areas of moderate to heavy snow have been ongoing\nacross eastern Nebraska and eastern South Dakota, with a transition\nto accumulating ice/freezing rain to the northeast. \n\nDue to the strength of the surface low, background flow has\nincreased with the strong mass response with surface winds sustained\nat 25-30 mph gusting as high as 40-50 mph. Blizzard conditions have\nbeen observed across central South Dakota with visibility around 1/4\nmi and sustained winds at 20-30 mph gusting up to 50 mph. As the\nsurface low shifts back westward through the evening, strengthening\nmid-level flow around 40-50 kts will overspread portions of the\nDakotas into western Nebraska. Warm air overspreading eastern North\nDakota into northeastern South Dakota will lead to a transition from\nsnow to freezing rain with potential for ice accumulations. The\nincreased upper-level support  across the Dakotas into far northern\nNebraska will aid in formation of snow bands capable of 1"+/hr rates\nalong with potential for blowing snow and reduced visibility below\n1/4 mi with continued strong surface winds. These conditions will\ncontinue to spread westward as the low shifts west through the late\nevening and overnight.\n\n..Thornton/Hart.. 12/25/2023\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...FGF...FSD...ABR...BIS...LBF...UNR...\n\nLAT...LON   42480106 43430210 43880217 44520205 45310195 45890125\n            46919946 47049925 47499717 46689638 46029630 44159761\n            43679792 43159838 42649882 42239942 42209951 42160028\n            42480106 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md2346.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-12-25 22:29:03','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2023-12-25 22:37:07','read');

This\nactivity is along the core of a strong southerly low-level jet, and\nnorth of a surface warm front.  Parcels near the surface remain\nstable.  But forecast soundings in this area show steep mid-level\nlapse rates and weak-but-sufficient elevated CAPE for the risk of a\nfew robust updrafts.

Tornado Watch issuance is likely.\n\nDISCUSSION...A broken line of convection extends from northeast GA\nto the FL Panhandle along/near a surface cold front. A powerful\nupper cyclone is centered over the mid MS Valley this morning, with\nassociated 60-80+ kt southerly low-level jet rapidly advecting\nmoisture northward ahead of the line. Various recent RAP/NAM\nforecast soundings across north FL into coastal/eastern GA and much\nof SC suggest that it will take at least 62-63F surface dewpoints\namid modest daytime heating to aid weak boundary-layer\ndestabilization and the potential for surface-based thunderstorms.\nLatest surface observations indicate that sufficient low-level\nmoisture is already in place as far north as central GA/SC.\n\nCurrent expectations are that this continued low-level warm/moist\nadvection will likely support a severe threat as far north as parts\nof upstate SC and towards Charlotte NC. Area VWPs ahead of the\nongoing QLCS show low-level flow quickly strengthening to 60-70+ kt\nabove 1 km, with ample low-level shear available to support updraft\nrotation and embedded tornadic circulations within the line.\nSevere/damaging downdraft winds of 60-75 mph also appear likely\ngiven the strength of the low-level flow. With the severe potential\nlikely to increase across this region over the next few hours,\nTornado Watch issuance is likely.\n\n..Gleason/Hart.. 01/09/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...CHS...CAE...GSP...JAX...\n\nLAT...LON   29908244 31848219 32578194 33248219 34118244 35028094\n            34778040 33478014 32807960 32018073 30918133 29738123\n            29458216 29908244 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0030.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-09 16:21:02','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-09 16:28:32','read');

Multiple CC\nminima/tornadic circulations have been observed with this line over\nthe past several hours. Modifying the 12Z TLH sounding for current\nsurface observations yields only weak MLCAPE. Still, rapid low-level\nmoisture advection is occurring ahead of the line, and even modest\ndaytime heating should allow for weak destabilization downstream.\nCurrent expectations are for the tornado threat to continue eastward\nacross south-central GA and north FL, as area VWPs show extremely\nstrong low-level flow (1 km southerly winds in excess of 70 kt from\nKTLH) and 0-1 km SRH approaching 600 m2/s2 that will easily support\nembedded QLCS circulations. Straight-line severe/damaging winds\naround 60-75 mph will also remain a threat with the line given the\nstrength of the low-level flow.\n\n..Gleason.. 01/09/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...JAX...FFC...TAE...\n\nLAT...LON   29718528 31998449 32288331 32058257 31408249 30198264\n            29758290 29588342 29908397 29858433 29608471 29528499\n            29598526 29718528 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0028.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-09 16:21:02','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-09 16:28:32','read');

Heavy snow will be most likely in\ncentral Nebraska over the next couple of hours, becoming\nincreasingly likely in southeast Nebraska in the 00-03Z period.\n\nDISCUSSION...A pronounced mid-level trough is ejecting into the\nPlains states, with a 120+ kt 300 mb jet streak overspreading the\nsouthern Plains. This places the central Plains in the left-exit\nregion of the upper-jet (per 21Z mesoanalysis), resulting in plenty\nof divergence aloft. The low-level mass response has been for the\nsurface low to intensify across the southern Plains. This supports\nan increase in surface-925 mb cold air advection beneath increasing\nintense 850-700 mb warm-air advection over central and eastern NE,\nwhere 700 mb frontogenesis is also now underway. Moderate snow has\nrecently begun to fall in central Nebraska per surface observations,\nwith snowfall rates expected to only increase with time as dynamic\nlift increases and the dendritic growth zone continues to saturate.\n\nLater this afternoon, the anticipated heavier snow bands may produce\nsnowfall rates up to 1-2 inches/hour, where reduced visibility will\nalso become a concern. Latest high-resolution model guidance\nconsensus suggests that the heaviest snow should begin in the next\ncouple of hours, and peak in intensity somewhere in the 00-03Z\nperiod, especially over southeastern NE.\n\n..Squitieri.. 01/11/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...OAX...TOP...GID...LBF...\n\nLAT...LON   42230081 42039872 41419693 40749594 40189559 39849594\n            39749687 39739796 40089884 40609979 41350089 42230081 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0045.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-11 22:37:03','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-11 22:45:01','read');

Freezing\nrain remains probable through the Willamette Valley.\n\nDISCUSSION...Bands of moderate to heavy precipitation continue to\noverspread the Pacific Northwest ahead of an approaching mid-level\nwave. So far, much of this activity has been driven by warm\nadvection in the 850-700 mb layer, but some uptick in precip\ncoverage and intensity appears likely as lift associated with the\nvorticity maximum and attendant mid-level jet overspreads the\nregion. The 18z SLE sounding sampled a deep saturated layer from the\nsurface to around 450 mb with a somewhat shallow (~100 mb deep) 1-2\nC warm nose centered at about 850 mb/3 kft. More recent KRTX CC\nimagery indicates that this warm nose remains in place. Locations\nabove roughly 3 kft should continue to see moderate to heavy\nsnowfall through the mid/late afternoon with snowfall rates between\n1-2 in/hour possible. The shallow sub-freezing layer below ~3 kft\nwill support a continuation of freezing rain for some locations -\nprimarily through the Willamette Valley. However, localized\nfluctuations in the shallow warm layer may promote variation in\nprecipitation types between freezing rain, snow, and sleet.\n\n..Moore.. 01/13/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...PDT...MFR...SEW...PQR...\n\nLAT...LON   44192375 44442423 44642418 46032410 46212399 46392363\n            46352107 46182067 45762021 45001991 44212004 43732038\n            43532087 43462157 43772338 44192375 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0061.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-13 22:29:02','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-13 22:35:32','read');

Visibility reductions between 1/4 to 1 mile have been\nobserved with the passage of these bands and are primarily being\ndriven by bursts of moderate to heavy snow with 25-35 mph wind\ngusts. The 12 UTC PIT sounding likely sampled the convective\nenvironment most accurately with nearly dry adiabatic lapse rates\nfrom the surface to ~750 mb, which appears to be represented well by\nrecent 0-3 km lapse rate analyses. The plume of 8+ C/km low-level\nlapse rates is forecast to spread to the northeast into the New\nEngland region through the day in tandem with the cooler mid-level\ntemperatures associated with the primary trough axis. Low-level\ninstability should be bolstered by modest diurnal heating between\ncloud breaks through the afternoon, and a weak influx of moisture\nmay support occasional lightning flashes, though sustained,\nlightning-producing convection is not necessarily anticipated.\nNonetheless, the combination of improving low-level thermodynamics,\nfocused ascent along the front, and 30-40 mph winds within the\nboundary layer should maintain the snow squall potential well into\nthe afternoon.\n\n..Moore.. 01/14/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...GYX...BOX...BTV...OKX...ALY...PHI...BGM...\n\nLAT...LON   40817558 41267567 42257496 44237351 44587283 44747124\n            44797089 44607048 44146998 43776984 43257045 42577077\n            41467167 41237225 41187286 40497484 40817558 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0063.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-14 17:46:03','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-14 19:32:26','saved');

This  still appears associated with an area of enhanced\nmid/upper forcing for ascent, which might be maintained through the\n20-22Z time frame while overspreading portions of middle through\neastern Tennessee.  Thereafter, frontogenetic forcing is forecast to\ngenerally weaken across the Tennessee Valley through southern\nAppalachians vicinity, yielding diminishing precipitation rates. \nUntil then, it appears that the area of enhanced lift will include\nupward vertical motion maximized within the favorably cold mid-level\nlayer (centered around or above 600 mb) for large dendritic ice\ncrystal growth.  It appears this may remain strong enough to support\ncontinuing potential for occasional heavy snow rates up to around 1\ninch per hour, where lower/mid tropospheric profiles are maintained\nat or below freezing (roughly north of the 0 C isotherm at 859 mb).\n\n..Kerr.. 01/15/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...MRX...OHX...HUN...\n\nLAT...LON   34978743 35118584 35718402 36408364 36298463 36048579\n            35848708 34978743 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0069.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-15 19:51:03','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-15 20:00:19','saved');

Isentropic ascent over a 925-850 mb frontal\nzone is forecast to persist through early afternoon as a\nlow-amplitude wave, currently over the southern Plains, migrates\neast. Recent sleet LSRs and forecast soundings suggest that a mix of\nsnow and sleet will be more likely where surface temperatures are in\nthe low 20s or lower. Areas where temperatures are in the mid-20s or\nhigher should have too shallow/warm of a sub-freezing layer to\nsupport much re-freezing of hydrometeors, making a sleet/freezing\nrain mix more probable. Forecast guidance suggests that\nprecipitation intensity may gradually wane heading into the\nmid-afternoon hours, but a zone of impactful wintry precipitation\nappears probable prior to this occurring.\n\n..Moore.. 01/15/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...BMX...HUN...MEG...JAN...LZK...SHV...\n\nLAT...LON   32389370 32969267 34238987 34948780 34978610 34718575\n            34368570 33158810 32298989 31939125 31739213 31609304\n            31669354 31849381 32109389 32389370 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0068.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-15 19:51:03','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-15 20:00:19','saved');

Multiple waves of light to\nlocally moderate precipitation are ongoing and will continue to\nspread northeastward in conjunction with the surface low. While\ninterior portions of the Northeast will likely continue to see snow\n(with generally light to moderate rates) this morning, low-level\nwarm advection will support a transition from snow to sleet across\nparts of southern New England, with freezing rain persisting over\nportions of the Mid Atlantic region.\n\nAs the low deepens offshore, a modest uptick in precipitation\nintensity will be possible through the morning. While rates will\nlikely remain light to locally moderate, antecedent cold conditions\n(with temperatures initially in the 20s F) may result in relatively\nefficient ice accretion in areas that transition to freezing rain.\nPockets of moderate sleet/snow will also be possible into parts of\nsouthern New England. Low-level warm advection will support a\ngradual transition to rain along the Mid Atlantic and southern New\nEngland coasts, but subfreezing temperatures may persist inland\nthrough the morning.\n\n..Dean.. 01/16/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...GYX...BOX...OKX...ALY...PHI...LWX...\n\nLAT...LON   39497504 38747620 38747652 39137660 39727603 41187450\n            42147322 42607220 42787134 42627089 42347101 41377217\n            40937321 40307434 39497504 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0073.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-16 16:18:06','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-16 15:53:55','saved');

Watch issuance is\nnot anticipated.\n\nDISCUSSION...A band of convection focused along a cold front is\nslowly approaching the FL west coast per recent radar/satellite\nimagery. GOES IR and lightning trends show a few intensifying\nupdrafts within the line, denoted by concentrated lightning clusters\nand cooling cloud top temperatures. This trend should continue as\nthe line moves onshore where temperatures are warming into the\nlow/mid 70s and MLCAPE values are slowly increasing to 1000-1500\nJ/kg. VWP observations from KTBW show 0-6 km BWD values around 50-60\nknots, but deep-layer shear vectors are largely oriented along the\nboundary with weak line-normal deep-layer shear. This may limit the\noverall organization/intensity of the line, but may support stronger\nembedded segments capable of damaging winds. This kinematic regime\nis not overly favorable for line-embedded tornadoes, but a brief\ntornado appears possible if a portion of the line can become more\noriented from southeast to northwest. Confidence in this scenario is\nlow at this time given recent storm trends, and a damaging wind risk\nappears more probable. Regardless, the overall severe threat appears\ntoo limited to warrant watch issuance.\n\n..Moore/Thompson.. 01/16/2024\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...MLB...TBW...JAX...\n\nLAT...LON   28268276 28578263 28918271 29598115 29228100 28878081\n            28458073 28238066 28158070 27668245 27638262 27658273\n            27868287 28028286 28268276 \n\n</pre>\n<a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0074.html">Read more</a>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-16 16:18:03','NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks','',NULL,'2024-01-16 16:35:10','saved');
