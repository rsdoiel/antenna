<h2>The Antenna</h2>
A proof of concept for personal news aggregation pages.
</div>
<h1 id="antenna">Antenna</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding signal in the noise of the Internet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an aggregation of feed content from around the net. It
demonstates how you could build a personal aggregation page easily with
just a few tools and not rely so much on large corporations for keeping
up to date.</p>
<h2 id="tools-to-build-this-aggregation">Tools to build this
aggregation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pandoc 3</li>
<li>SQLite 3</li>
<li>GNU Make</li>
<li>skimmer &gt;= 0.06</li>
<li>Git + GitHub (to host your personal aggregation site)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-moving-parts">The moving parts</h2>
<p><a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/skimmer">skimmer</a> is used to
collect data from RSS, Atom and JSON feeds that are listed in a urls
file. The data collected gets stored in an SQLite 3 database.</p>
<p>The SQLite 3 database can be managed with simple SQL statements
execute from the command line, a script (e.g. Bash or Python) or in this
case a <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>. The scripts responsiblility is
to automatically identify the feed items to be “saved” for generating
this static website.</p>
<p>The skimmer programs comes with a companion program called
<strong>skim2md</strong> which will read all the saved items in a feeds
database and render them in Markdown and HTML. This file is easy to then
process with Pandoc into a full webpage.</p>
<p>Pandoc is responsable for rendering Markdown to HTML5 via a template
called <a href="front_page.tmpl">front_page.tmpl</a></p>
<p>The <strong>make</strong> command is used to run the Makefile and
build the pages. You can then use your favorite web server to share them
or just open them directly in your favorite web browser.</p>
<pre><code>make clean
make</code></pre>
<p>Each aggregation page is populated by it’s own urls list which builds
the skimmer database used to geneate the page.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="socal_north.urls">SoCal North</a> URLs</li>
<li><a href="weather.urls">Weather</a> URLs</li>
