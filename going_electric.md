On New Year’s Eve, nearly the entire island – 90% – lost electricity, leaving over 1.3 million customers in the dark during holiday celebrations. Power was restored on January 1, but the blackout underscored an urgent need for reliable energy solutions.</p>



<p>In a move to help bolster Puerto Rico’s grid resilience, Convergent Energy and Power secured a conditional commitment from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office for a massive solar and battery storage initiative <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-subsidiaries-convergent-energy-and-power-inc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in December</a>.
