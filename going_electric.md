<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/tern-quick-haul-taiwan-header.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>



<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of October 2024. We’re still enjoying the tail end of some great summer pricing as e-bike companies push to move their inventory! Just like the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/"> ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has been a year of impressive e-bike sales. So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>
