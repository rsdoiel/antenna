## All the best EV rebate and cash back deals we could find for March 2025 [Updated]

date: 2025-03-16, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/big_MONEY_MAIN.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t selling, but that just exposes them as industry noobs.
