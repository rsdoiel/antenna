date: 2025-04-21, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dodge_big-deal.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t selling, but that just exposes them for the industry noobs that they are.
