## All the best EV (and PHEV) rebate deals we could find for February 2025

date: 2025-02-14, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/dodge_charger_EVs.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t selling, but that just exposes them as auto industry noobs. A rebate is a powerful finance tool that helps dealers overcome obstacles like negative equity, poor credit, down payment requirements, and interest rate objections – and, ultimately, get a deal done.</p>



<p>If you’re dealing with any of the above, pay attention: these plug-in cars could get you behind the wheel of a new ride sooner than you think!</p>

date: 2025-02-10, from: Electrek Feed
