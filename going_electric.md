## Heybike Mars 3.0 review: A 30 MPH full-suspension e-bike for just $1,199?!

date: 2025-08-07, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/heybike-mars-3-e-bike-header.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>Heybike has just announced the <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/06/heybike-launches-two-new-full-suspension-e-bikes-at-crazy-low-prices/">launch of its new X-Series</a>, with the Mars 3.0 and Ranger S 3.0 Pro comprising the first two big new models. Or maybe not so “big”, as they’re actually kinda compact-sized, at least for full-suspension e-bikes. They’re both 20″ wheel folding e-bikes, and they pack in a lot of performance into comfortable rides. I’ve been testing both, and today we’re jumping in with both feet to check out how well the Mars 3.0 rides.</p>
