Since it was first unveiled, I’ve followed Gravity’s development closely, itching to get behind the wheel of a full-fledged production version to test drive – and that day has finally come, my friends. Last week, I took a trip to Lucid’s design studio, where I had my most intimate encounter with the Gravity SUV to date, including a brief but informative test drive around the Bay Area. There, I also learned that the official range of the Lucid Gravity is an impressive 450 miles. Check out images and a video of my experience below.</p>
