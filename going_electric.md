<p>It happened to occur while I was in the middle of filming a review of a Velotric Breeze 1 electric bike. With the rare opportunity of catching a moment like that on camera, it turned into a chance for me to take a second look at what I did right as well as what I might have done wrong to wind up in that situation. </p>



<p>And why keep that kind of analysis to myself? Come along with me while I Monday morning quarterback myself.</p>
