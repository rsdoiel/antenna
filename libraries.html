      <h1>What Does It Mean to Be First-Gen?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>The term “first-generation college student” was first introduced by the TRIO community in the late 1970s and has since been widely recognized within higher education. Today, approximately 8.2 million undergraduates, or 54 percent of all students, identify as first-generation. Most colleges and universities define first-gen students as those “whose parents or guardians did not complete a baccalaureate degree,” in line with the federal TRIO definition.</p>

      <h1>The sunset is on the horizon for Metadata Manager. What's next?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>TL;DR. Metadata Manager will be retired at the end of 2025. Over the past four years, we have been developing a new helper tool to replace it, and that tool has now reached a stage of maturity that means we will be able to switch off Metadata Manager by the end of the year.</p>
<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
<p>In 2021, we <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/30vzx-r5x16">said</a> that we would be retiring the deprecated <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/metadata-manager/">Metadata Manager</a> as soon as we can offer members a suitable replacement for registering their journal content. So this news has been a long time coming - Metadata Manager has been very challenging for us to support, and we have found it impossible to develop additional features. However, we did not want to take the final step of switching off the interface until we were able to offer a suitable replacement for members who rely on manual helper tools to register their journal content.</p>
<p>That replacement, our new <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/record-registration-form/">record registration form</a>, has now been used by many members for over a year to register their journal content. The feedback so far has been positive, and we have been able to add functionality to the tool at a pace that we are happy with.</p>
<p>In July 2025, we contacted those members who are still using Metadata Manager to let them know that the tool will no longer be available after December 2025. So if you are affected by this news, you were probably already aware of it. But we wanted to go into a little more detail on the sunsetting of Metadata Manager, why we are doing it, and what’s next for Crossref’s content registration helper tools.</p>
<h2>What has happened since 2021?</h2>
<p>We have been developing the record registration form ever since that announcement in 2021. It began its life as a helper tool for registering grant records, but we knew we wanted to expand it to cover journal articles and other record types as soon as we could.</p>
<p>To see whether the concept behind the grants form could be applied to journal content, we first built an initial prototype and tested it with a number of Crossref ambassadors and volunteers. We wanted to ensure that the tool was intuitive to use, and to understand what functionality it would need to support for it to be truly useful to our members. Following some iteration on the invaluable feedback we received from our testers, we finally released the tool to production in September 2024 and began encouraging members to use it for their real-life article deposits.</p>
<p>We have been continuously adding new functionality since then, from additional fields for registering richer metadata to a feature that allows members to edit their articles’ metadata without having to re-enter everything into the form.</p>
<p>Now, about two months from the target date for retiring Metadata Manager, the record registration form is used by members to register about 200 articles per day, while Metadata Manager still sees about double that volume of submissions. So we have some way left to go.</p>
<h2>Why is now the right time to retire Metadata Manager?</h2>
<p>2025 has been a year of addressing technical debt for Crossref. My colleague Sara wrote about this co-ordinated push towards modernising our system in her post about our <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/wd6rx-vpq73">cloud migration</a> in the summer.</p>
<p>Having the long-awaited replacement for Metadata Manager in place will allow us to free up the resources that have been tied up for years by troubleshooting Metadata Manager, in terms of both technology and user support, so that we can focus on projects and initiatives that align with our longer-term <a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/">strategy</a>.</p>
<h2>How will we avoid the new tool developing the same problems as Metadata Manager?</h2>
<p>As stated above, Metadata Manager has caused us many issues and headaches in different ways - but we have also learned a lot from dealing with these problems. As Bryan Vickery <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/1a52b-7pf27">wrote in 2020</a>, Metadata Manager is “not flexible enough to easily add other record types, like books/book chapters, or to include any changes we may make to our input schema.” To address this, we built the record registration form in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvq2e-q8t24">schema-driven way</a>, which makes it adaptable to any future schema changes. It also means that we can spin up prototypes of new forms for additional record types quite quickly.</p>
<p>So while Metadata Manager was custom-built in a way that could only ever work for journal content, the record registration form already supports two record types and will support more in future. This is key for our goal of building a complete <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">research nexus</a>, which extends far beyond journal content, and even beyond “content” as such (did someone say <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">grants</a>?).</p>
<h2>What happens next?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Metadata Manager will no longer be available from January 2026.</li>
<li>Starting next year, if you attempt to access Metadata Manager at <a href="https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/">https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/</a>, you will be redirected to a deprecation note on <a href="https://www.crossref.org/deprecated/">https://www.crossref.org/deprecated/</a> which will link out to the new tool.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What options do I have for registering my journal content going forward?</h2>
<p>If your organisation still uses Metadata Manager to register metadata for your journal articles, now is a good time to begin familiarising yourself with the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/choose-content-registration-method/">alternatives</a> available to you from 2026 forward - these include, but are not limited to, the new record registration form.</p>
<h3>If your journal has an ISSN</h3>
<p>We recommend you begin using the record registration form as soon as possible. Simply go to <a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records">https://manage.crossref.org/records</a> and sign in with your Crossref account credentials to register a journal article. You can also see a list of all the journal article records you have previously registered using our manual helper tools at <a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records/edit">https://manage.crossref.org/records/edit</a> and edit their metadata using the form.</p>
<p>To help you make the switch from Metadata Manager, we will be hosting an interactive webinar on 13 November about how to transition to the new tool. <a href="https://crossref.zoom.us/webinar/register/7317600554084/WN_WF1Ykk-4SKeih4ucpTeesA">Register here</a> or look out for the recording, which will be shared in our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/archive/">events archive</a>.</p>
<h3>If your journal does not have an ISSN</h3>
<p>The record registration form currently only supports ISSNs as journal identifiers. Title-level and volume/issue-level DOIs, which are at the core of how Metadata Manager handles journal metadata, have been the cause for some of the problems we have had over the years with that particular tool. Also, Crossref DOIs have always been intended primarily as citation identifiers, and entire journals/volumes/issues are very rarely cited. For that reason, we built the Record Registration Form such that it doesn’t support registering or using journal-level DOIs.</p>
<p>With that being said, if you do not (yet) have an ISSN for your journal for whatever reason, you can use our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/web-deposit-form/">web deposit form</a> to register your articles with journal DOI. If you do obtain an ISSN for your title later on, you can then simply begin using the record registration form from that point onward.</p>
<h2>How will the new tool continue to be developed?</h2>
<p>We will continue to work with our members and community to develop additional functionalities for the journal article form. Currently we are working on allowing <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-practices/best-practices/relationships/">relationships metadata</a> to be registered using the form.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is for the record registration form to become the one-stop shop for members who manually register and update their metadata. To this end, we are working on expanding the tool to cover additional record types - we have recently developed a prototype for registering books and chapters, and we will be looking to test this in the coming months with volunteers who are currently registering their book metadata via other avenues such as the web deposit form.</p>
<p>If you would like to support these efforts, or you have begun using the new tool and would like to share your feedback, come join the discussion in our <a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/feedback-on-new-helper-tool/1721">community forum</a>.</p>

      <h1>Announcing changes to REST API rate limits</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>Our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/">REST API</a> makes all of the metadata we hold publicly available. It receives the majority of our API traffic, with around 1 billion hits per month. It’s one of the key ways that we fulfil our mission to make research objects easy to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse. From 1 December 2025, we will be revising the rate limits for the public and polite pools of the REST API to ensure that we can maintain a stable and reliable system, and that metadata is freely available to everyone.</p>
<p>We haven’t changed the rate limits since the REST API was launched in 2013. In the past five years, the number of requests to the REST API has tripled and the number of metadata records has increased by a third, from 120 million to around 180 million. This means an increase in the resources needed to run it, and we’ve seen periods of instability where we haven’t been able to keep the API available for all users. We have decided that it is the right time to revisit rate limits to check that they’re in line with what our technology can provide and what our community needs. As a result, we will apply the following for the public and polite pools:</p>
<p>Public pool:</p>
<p>Request typeRate limitConcurrency limitSingle record51List of records (queries, filters, etc.)11</p>
<p>Polite pool:</p>
<p>Request typeRate limitConcurrency limitSingle DOI record103List of records (queries, filters, etc.)33</p>
<p>The rate limit is the number of total requests that can be made per second. The concurrency limit is how many requests can be running at the same time. This means that for longer-running requests you may need to wait for previous requests to finish before you can make a new one.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of single records requests:</p>

</ul>
<p>The second case here will be directed to the polite pool because an email is included using the ‘mailto’ parameter. And here are examples of requests that return lists of records:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?filter=from-created-date:2025-10-21T16:20,until-created-date:2025-10-21T17:00">https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?filter=from-created-date:2025-10-21T16:20,until-created-date:2025-10-21T17:00</a></li>
<li><a href="https://api.crossref.org/v1/members/13/works&amp;mailto=my@email.com">https://api.crossref.org/v1/members/13/works&amp;mailto=my@email.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?query.bibliographic=linear+dichroism&amp;mailto=my@email.com">https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?query.bibliographic=linear+dichroism&amp;mailto=my@email.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second and third examples here will use the polite pool.</p>
<p>Our guiding principle in making these changes is to keep all of the metadata available to everyone, all of the time. These changes to rate limits won’t restrict current users from accessing the metadata they want to retrieve, but it will make it easier for us to maintain the system now and in the future.</p>
<h2>Which use cases do we support?</h2>
<p>Our metadata has a broad range of applications. If you’re someone who uses the REST API, we’re glad that you are part of our community! Our mission includes making it easier to find, reuse, and assess scholarly research outputs. By using metadata, you’re helping us to fulfil that goal.</p>
<p>The main uses of the REST API fit into several categories. The new rate limits will continue to support these, among many others:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have some metadata, what is the DOI?</li>
<li>I have a DOI, what is its metadata?</li>
<li>I want all of the metadata, just give me everything.</li>
<li>Research on a specific topic or subset of metadata, often refreshing the results every few weeks or months.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rate limits can encourage responsible usage. The majority of API users make requests at a low rate and will not need to make any changes, however a few send spikes of large numbers of requests in a short space of time, sometimes making it difficult for others to access the service. These can be smoothed out by lower rate limits. Complex requests that search across large numbers of items put more pressure on our systems than requests for a single content item, so we have decided to set different rate limits for different types of request.</p>
<h2>Who will be affected?</h2>
<p>We estimate that the changes might affect around 40 users per week across the public and polite pools, and this is only for some of their requests. In all of the cases we’ve seen, the rate of requests could be slowed down and users would still be able to get the same results. In other words, the aim of these changes is to make the load on the API more predictable, not to reduce the total number of requests or amount of metadata transferred. No changes are being made to the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/">Metadata Plus</a> service or other APIs, such as the XML API and OAI-PMH endpoint.</p>
<h2>Do I need to change how I use the API?</h2>
<p>If you’re reading this, thank you! It’s clear that you want to be a considerate user of our services. Almost all users can continue to use the REST API in exactly the same way, you won’t need to change anything. Here is some general advice that will help you make the most of the service and ensure that you won’t encounter issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a mailto parameter. This gives you access to the polite pool meaning higher rate limits and meaning we can get in touch with you if needed. We’ll only use your address to contact you about your API requests.</li>
<li>Check the HTTP response status for your requests. This is always good practice and can help you identify malformed requests and where you reach rate limits.</li>
<li>Cache results to avoid repeatedly making the same requests. Most records don’t change on a regular basis. How often you update the cache will depend on what you are interested in, but most metadata fields rarely change.</li>
<li>If you are making a very high volume of requests or have very complex analysis to carry out, consider downloading the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/learning/public-data-file/">public data file</a> which is made available once a year and contains all of our metadata. You can update it with recent additions using the REST API.</li>
<li>If you are relying on our metadata in a production service, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/">Metadata Plus</a> can provide more stability, support, and access to monthly snapshots of our entire database.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have more <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-the-crossref-rest-api/">tips and tricks</a> for the REST API in our documentation. If you have questions, please join the conversation on our Community Forum.</p>

      <p>Publishers have led themselves into a mess by focusing on rising submissions as a positive indicator of journal performance. The time has come to close the floodgates and require that authors demonstrate their commitment to quality science before we let them in the door.</p>

      <h1>Celebrating Noyam Journals’ Metadata Award</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://noyam.org/">Noyam Journals</a>, based in Accra, Ghana, was recently recognised for the completeness of its metadata through the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-metadata-awards/">Crossref Metadata Award</a>, part of our 25th anniversary celebrations. Noyam was one of six publishers worldwide to receive the award and stood out as a leader among members of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">Global Equitable Membership</a> (GEM) Program.</p>
<p>The GEM Program supports publishers and organisations in low- and middle-income countries to participate in the global scholarly community by reducing barriers to membership and services.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, at our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/reflections-from-crossref-accra-2025-strengthening-open-science-and-partnerships-in-ghana/">Crossref Accra event</a>, representatives from Noyam spoke about how registering metadata with Crossref has expanded their readership worldwide. They also encouraged other publishers and institutions in Africa to utilise Crossref’s infrastructure to enhance the visibility and impact of their work.</p>
<p>Following their award, we spoke with Naa Kai Amanor-Mfoafo from Noyam Journals about their approach to metadata quality. She shares her reflections in the Q&amp;A below.</p>
<h2>What motivates your team to work towards high-quality metadata?</h2>
<p>Our commitment towards high-quality metadata stems from our organisational goal to promote the dissemination of usable knowledge by publishing innovative and high-quality research content. Over the last five years, registering our metadata with Crossref has strengtheed authors’ trust as their institutions can verify quality through tools like Crossmark. For instance, many institutions use the Crossmark feature on our published articles to access the latest information about a scholarly article, including updates, corrections, or retractions.</p>
<h2>Do you have a strategy for complete metadata?</h2>
<p>We prioritise inclusion of ORCID IDs, Abstracts, and References as these increase visibility of our articles. We also include Affiliations, Licenses, and Crossmark, and we use Similarity Check to help ensure research integrity.</p>
<p>As part of our team structure, we have a dedicated staff member responsible for ensuring that every article is assigned a Crossref DOI on the same day it is published online. Our in-house system supports this process, allowing us to capture and register all the key metadata efficiently.</p>
<h2>What impact of good metadata can you see on your organisation?</h2>
<p>Good metadata has made a real difference for our organisation. It has helped increase the visibility and discoverability of our journal articles, making it easier for researchers and readers around the world to find and cite our work. We’ve noticed more engagement with our publications since improving our metadata, which encourages us to keep strengthening the quality of the information we register.</p>
<h2>Have you encountered any challenges in curating or improving your metadata, and how did you address those?</h2>
<p>One major challenge we’ve faced is discovering errors in previously uploaded metadata, and we haven’t yet established a systematic process for correcting them. We’re currently working to improve our workflow to help ensure the correctness of our metadata to follow Crossref’s recommended best practices.</p>
<h2>Have your efforts around metadata led to real benefits for your community?</h2>
<p>Our authors appreciate the fact that their ORCID profiles are automatically updated with their published articles once they are assigned DOIs from Crossref. They are, of course, also enjoying increased visibility of our published articles globally.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead, how are you planning to build on your metadata quality?</h2>
<p>We need to stay informed about developments at Crossref. Once in a while, we visit the Crossref website or participate in a webinar to stay informed. For example, a few months ago, we got to know that a new record registration form had been initiated for metadata uploads through the documentation section on the Crossref website.</p>
<p>We advise others who are new to Crossref to focus on consistency. Ensure your organisational system includes staff dedicated to keeping your metadata up to date. Secondly, feel free to seek technical support from the Crossref team when the need arises.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>Each new change in scholarly communication promises to make research fairer, faster, more transparent. Yet, in many cases, researchers, especially from under resourced countries or from countries where English is not the first language, face added pressure to catch up, rather than to move forward.</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>Although generative AI literacy frameworks can be quite varied, all suggest that users bring a critical eye to what LLMs produce. Instructors must internalize this critical lens on AI outputs in order to convey that same inherent skepticism to their students. With this healthy skepticism in mind, it is key to understand when and how generative AI can enrich teaching and learning.</p>

      <h1>Federal Funding Cuts and Research Universities</h1>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>Today, we are sharing a new resource tracking the costs of the administration’s actions on the people who make the research enterprise possible. As universities adjust their budgets to reflect these new realities, we are seeing what is likely the first wave of layoffs and program cuts. These cuts have immediate consequences for both university staff, faculty, and students and on local economies. The loss of the human expertise required to conduct and administer research, and reduced opportunities for new researchers to enter their chosen fields, will have downstream effects on scientific discovery and scholarship for years to come.</p>

      <h1>Mitigating Aggressive Crawler Traffic in the Age of Generative AI: A Collaborative Approach from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>The rise of aggressive, adaptive, and evasive web crawlers is a significant challenge for libraries and archives, causing service disruptions and overwhelming institutional resources. This article details the experiences of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University Libraries in combating an unprecedented flood of crawler traffic. It describes the escalating mitigation efforts, from traditional client blocking to the implementation of more advanced techniques such as request throttling, regional traffic prioritization, novel facet-based bot detection, commercial Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and ultimately, in-browser client verification with Cloudflare Turnstile. The article highlights the adaptive nature of these crawlers, the limitations of isolated institutional responses, and the critical lessons learned from mitigation efforts, including the issues introduced by residential proxy networks and the extreme scale of the traffic. Our experiences demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-layered defense strategy that includes both commercial and library-specific solutions, such as facet-based bot detection. The article emphasizes the importance of community-wide collaboration, proposing future directions such as formalized knowledge sharing and the ongoing development of best practices to collectively address this evolving threat to open access and the stability of digital library services.</p>

      <h1>Liberation of LMS-siloed Instructional Data</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>This paper presents an initiative to extract and repurpose instructional content from a series of Blackboard course shells associated with IMLS-funded boot camp events conducted in June of 2021, 2022, and 2023. These events, facilitated by ten faculty members and attended by 68 fellows, generated valuable educational materials currently confined within proprietary learning management system environments. The objective of this project is to enable broader access and reuse of these resources by migrating them to a non-siloed, static website independent of the original Blackboard infrastructure. We describe our methodology for acquiring and validating the data exports, outline the auditing procedures implemented to ensure content completeness and integrity, and discuss the challenges encountered throughout the process. Finally, we report on the current status of this ongoing effort and its implications for future dissemination and reuse of educational materials.</p>

      <h1>Extracting A Large Corpus from the Internet Archive, A Case Study</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>The Internet Archive was founded on May 10, 1996, in San Francisco, CA. Since its inception, the archive has amassed an enormous corpus of content, including over 866 billion web pages, more than 42.5 million print materials, 13 million videos, and 14 million audio files. It is relatively easy to upload content to the Internet Archive. It is also easy to download individual objects by visiting their pages and clicking on specific links. However, downloading a large collection, such as thousands or even tens of thousands of items, is not as easy. This article outlines how The University of Kentucky Libraries downloaded over 86 thousand previously uploaded newspaper issues from the Internet Archive for local use. The process leveraged ChatGPT to automate the process of generating Python scripts that accessed the Internet Archive via its API (Application Programming Interface).</p>

      <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping digital preservation and access in libraries, but their limitations (hallucinations, opacity, and resource demands) remain significant.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising mitigation strategy by grounding LLM outputs used in specific digital collections. This article compares the performance of WARC-GPTs default RAG implementation with unfiltered WARC files from Archi Io ve-It against a custom-built RAG solution utilizing optimization strategies in both modelling and data (WARC) preprocessing. Tested on a collection of thousands of archived pages from the Bob’s Burgers fan wiki, the study analyzes trade-offs in preprocessing, embedding strategies, retrieval accuracy, and system responsiveness. Findings suggest that while WARC-GPT lowers barriers to experimentation, custom RAG pipelines offer substantial improvements for institutions with the technical capacity to implement them, especially in terms of data quality, efficiency, and trustworthiness.</p>

      <h1>Building and Deploying the Digital Humanities Quarterly Recommender System</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>Since 2007, <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> has published over 750 scholarly articles, constituting a significant repository of scholarship within the digital humanities. As the journal’s corpus of articles continues to grow, it is no longer possible for readers to manually navigate the title and abstract of every article in order to stay apprised of relevant work or conduct literature reviews. To address this, we have implemented a recommender system for the <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> corpus, generating recommendations of related articles that appear below each article on the journal’s website with the goal of improving discoverability. These recommendations are generated via three different methods: a keyword-based approach based on a controlled vocabulary of topics assigned to articles by editors; a TF-IDF approach applied to full article text; and a deep learning approach using the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence’s SPECTER2 model applied to article titles and abstracts. In this article, we detail our process of creating this recommender system, from the article pre-processing pipeline to the front-end implementation of the recommendations on the <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> website [ <a href="#note1">1</a>]. All of the code for our recommender system is publicly available in the <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> GitHub repository [ <a href="#note2">2</a>].</p>

      <h1>What it Means to be a Repository: Real, Trustworthy, or Mature?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>Archivists occasionally describe digital repositories as being &quot;not real,&quot; suggesting that their technical digital preservation infrastructure is inadequate to the task of digital preservation. This article discusses the concept of digital repositories, highlighting the distinction between digital repository technical infrastructure and institutions collecting digital materials, and what it means to be a &quot;real&quot; digital repository. It argues that the Open Archival Information System Reference Model and notions of Trustworthy Digital Repositories are inadequate for determining the &quot;realness&quot; of a digital repository and advocates using maturity models as a framework for discussing repository capability.</p>

      <h1>From Notes to Networks: Using Obsidian to Teach Metadata and Linked Data</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>In this article, we describe a novel use of the note-taking software Obsidian as a method for users without formal training in metadata creation to develop culturally relevant data literacies across two digital archiving projects. We explain how Obsidian’s built-in use of linked data provides an open-source, flexible, and potentially scalable way for users to creatively interact with digitized materials, navigate and create metadata, and model relationships between digital objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate how Obsidian’s local and offline hosting features can be leveraged to include team members with low or unreliable internet access.</p>

      <h1>New tool to report on completeness of open research information globally</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p><em>Wednesday 22nd October 2025</em>—Crossref, the open scholarly infrastructure nonprofit, today releases an enhanced dashboard showing metadata coverage and individual organisations’ contributions to documenting the process and outputs of scientific research in the open. The tool helps research-performing, funding, and publishing organisations identify gaps in open research information, and provides supporting evidence for movements like the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/">Barcelona Declaration for Open Research Information</a>, which encourages more substantial commitment to stewarding and enriching the scholarly record through open metadata.</p>
<p>Crossref’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep">Participation Reports</a> now offer expanded features and provide full coverage of all members and all resource types registered with Crossref DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)—over 175 million records representing a significant share of global research production from organisations in 163 countries. Each of Crossref’s 23,000 members has a dashboard to visualise their metadata contributions, display coverage of key information for scholarly works, and get actionable feedback via a gap report that specifies records that need enrichment, all helping to make more transparent the work that goes into creating and curating the scholarly record.</p>
<p>For any Crossref member—whether journal publisher, research funder, university, or museum—coverage of up to 11 key elements is public and visible to everyone, including: references, abstracts, ORCID iDs, affiliation strings, ROR IDs, Open Funder Registry IDs, funding award numbers, text-mining URLs, licence URLs, Similarity Check URLs (for text-based plagiarism checking) and the presence of a Crossmark policy, indicating the organisation’s commitment to declare corrections and retractions. These metadata elements provide greater context and visibility for research objects such as journal articles and preprints, grants and awards, books and book chapters, standards, datasets, conference papers and various ‘other’ content such as scholarly blogs, images, and even physical museum artefacts.</p>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6373-1199">Mochammad Tanzil Multazam</a>, Library Director of Universitas Muhammadiyah Sidoarjo, and Secretary of the Supervisory Board of Relawan Jurnals, says, “As a sponsoring organisation for several thousand small publishers across Indonesia, we support Crossref members to register complete metadata for their works. Despite time and resource constraints, this new actionable open report on key metadata elements will help drive improvements in the information they share for their publications. This has wide-reaching implications for the visibility of that research and trust among the community, and therefore has the potential to support Indonesian scholarship in the global context.”</p>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0008-8562-7748">Lena Stoll</a>, Program Lead at Crossref, explains, “We are happy to have extended participation reports to cover more diverse record types, including grants, datasets, dissertations, and more, and to make it easier for our members to act on their ongoing improvements to enrich their records and build towards the vision of an open and more complete Research Nexus.”</p>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8249-1752">Ludo Waltman</a>, Scientific Director and Professor of Quantitative Science Studies at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University, comments, “As a representative of the researcher and metascience communities, this data is of great importance for us to analyse the trends and effects of global research activity. Crossref is one of the main driving forces in open infrastructure, and its commitment to supporting metadata completeness through this open reporting dashboard is a significant step for the open research information movement.”</p>
