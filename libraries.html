<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: SciELO in Perspective</p>

Post — Classification as Colonization: The Hidden Politics of Library
Catalogs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-25, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>

what cataloging has always been: a battlefield where meaning is
contested and conquered.

beneficial to all. Empathetic leadership is an art form to convey to
your team that you value them as individuals, all while maintaining a
keen focus on the organization’s success.
