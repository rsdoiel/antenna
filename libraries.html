(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>Publishers have led themselves into a mess by focusing on rising submissions as a positive indicator of journal performance. The time has come to close the floodgates and require that authors demonstrate their commitment to quality science before we let them in the door.</p>

      <h1>Celebrating Noyam Journals’ Metadata Award</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://noyam.org/">Noyam Journals</a>, based in Accra, Ghana, was recently recognised for the completeness of its metadata through the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-metadata-awards/">Crossref Metadata Award</a>, part of our 25th anniversary celebrations. Noyam was one of six publishers worldwide to receive the award and stood out as a leader among members of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">Global Equitable Membership</a> (GEM) Program.</p>
<p>The GEM Program supports publishers and organisations in low- and middle-income countries to participate in the global scholarly community by reducing barriers to membership and services.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, at our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/reflections-from-crossref-accra-2025-strengthening-open-science-and-partnerships-in-ghana/">Crossref Accra event</a>, representatives from Noyam spoke about how registering metadata with Crossref has expanded their readership worldwide. They also encouraged other publishers and institutions in Africa to utilise Crossref’s infrastructure to enhance the visibility and impact of their work.</p>
<p>Following their award, we spoke with Naa Kai Amanor-Mfoafo from Noyam Journals about their approach to metadata quality. She shares her reflections in the Q&amp;A below.</p>
<h2>What motivates your team to work towards high-quality metadata?</h2>
<p>Our commitment towards high-quality metadata stems from our organisational goal to promote the dissemination of usable knowledge by publishing innovative and high-quality research content. Over the last five years, registering our metadata with Crossref has strengtheed authors’ trust as their institutions can verify quality through tools like Crossmark. For instance, many institutions use the Crossmark feature on our published articles to access the latest information about a scholarly article, including updates, corrections, or retractions.</p>
<h2>Do you have a strategy for complete metadata?</h2>
<p>We prioritise inclusion of ORCID IDs, Abstracts, and References as these increase visibility of our articles. We also include Affiliations, Licenses, and Crossmark, and we use Similarity Check to help ensure research integrity.</p>
<p>As part of our team structure, we have a dedicated staff member responsible for ensuring that every article is assigned a Crossref DOI on the same day it is published online. Our in-house system supports this process, allowing us to capture and register all the key metadata efficiently.</p>
<h2>What impact of good metadata can you see on your organisation?</h2>
<p>Good metadata has made a real difference for our organisation. It has helped increase the visibility and discoverability of our journal articles, making it easier for researchers and readers around the world to find and cite our work. We’ve noticed more engagement with our publications since improving our metadata, which encourages us to keep strengthening the quality of the information we register.</p>
<h2>Have you encountered any challenges in curating or improving your metadata, and how did you address those?</h2>
<p>One major challenge we’ve faced is discovering errors in previously uploaded metadata, and we haven’t yet established a systematic process for correcting them. We’re currently working to improve our workflow to help ensure the correctness of our metadata to follow Crossref’s recommended best practices.</p>
<h2>Have your efforts around metadata led to real benefits for your community?</h2>
<p>Our authors appreciate the fact that their ORCID profiles are automatically updated with their published articles once they are assigned DOIs from Crossref. They are, of course, also enjoying increased visibility of our published articles globally.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead, how are you planning to build on your metadata quality?</h2>
<p>We need to stay informed about developments at Crossref. Once in a while, we visit the Crossref website or participate in a webinar to stay informed. For example, a few months ago, we got to know that a new record registration form had been initiated for metadata uploads through the documentation section on the Crossref website.</p>
<p>We advise others who are new to Crossref to focus on consistency. Ensure your organisational system includes staff dedicated to keeping your metadata up to date. Secondly, feel free to seek technical support from the Crossref team when the need arises.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Each new change in scholarly communication promises to make research fairer, faster, more transparent. Yet, in many cases, researchers, especially from under resourced countries or from countries where English is not the first language, face added pressure to catch up, rather than to move forward.</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>Although generative AI literacy frameworks can be quite varied, all suggest that users bring a critical eye to what LLMs produce. Instructors must internalize this critical lens on AI outputs in order to convey that same inherent skepticism to their students. With this healthy skepticism in mind, it is key to understand when and how generative AI can enrich teaching and learning.</p>

      <h1>Federal Funding Cuts and Research Universities</h1>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>Today, we are sharing a new resource tracking the costs of the administration’s actions on the people who make the research enterprise possible. As universities adjust their budgets to reflect these new realities, we are seeing what is likely the first wave of layoffs and program cuts. These cuts have immediate consequences for both university staff, faculty, and students and on local economies. The loss of the human expertise required to conduct and administer research, and reduced opportunities for new researchers to enter their chosen fields, will have downstream effects on scientific discovery and scholarship for years to come.</p>

      <h1>Mitigating Aggressive Crawler Traffic in the Age of Generative AI: A Collaborative Approach from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>The rise of aggressive, adaptive, and evasive web crawlers is a significant challenge for libraries and archives, causing service disruptions and overwhelming institutional resources. This article details the experiences of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University Libraries in combating an unprecedented flood of crawler traffic. It describes the escalating mitigation efforts, from traditional client blocking to the implementation of more advanced techniques such as request throttling, regional traffic prioritization, novel facet-based bot detection, commercial Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and ultimately, in-browser client verification with Cloudflare Turnstile. The article highlights the adaptive nature of these crawlers, the limitations of isolated institutional responses, and the critical lessons learned from mitigation efforts, including the issues introduced by residential proxy networks and the extreme scale of the traffic. Our experiences demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-layered defense strategy that includes both commercial and library-specific solutions, such as facet-based bot detection. The article emphasizes the importance of community-wide collaboration, proposing future directions such as formalized knowledge sharing and the ongoing development of best practices to collectively address this evolving threat to open access and the stability of digital library services.</p>

      <h1>Liberation of LMS-siloed Instructional Data</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>This paper presents an initiative to extract and repurpose instructional content from a series of Blackboard course shells associated with IMLS-funded boot camp events conducted in June of 2021, 2022, and 2023. These events, facilitated by ten faculty members and attended by 68 fellows, generated valuable educational materials currently confined within proprietary learning management system environments. The objective of this project is to enable broader access and reuse of these resources by migrating them to a non-siloed, static website independent of the original Blackboard infrastructure. We describe our methodology for acquiring and validating the data exports, outline the auditing procedures implemented to ensure content completeness and integrity, and discuss the challenges encountered throughout the process. Finally, we report on the current status of this ongoing effort and its implications for future dissemination and reuse of educational materials.</p>

      <h1>Extracting A Large Corpus from the Internet Archive, A Case Study</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>The Internet Archive was founded on May 10, 1996, in San Francisco, CA. Since its inception, the archive has amassed an enormous corpus of content, including over 866 billion web pages, more than 42.5 million print materials, 13 million videos, and 14 million audio files. It is relatively easy to upload content to the Internet Archive. It is also easy to download individual objects by visiting their pages and clicking on specific links. However, downloading a large collection, such as thousands or even tens of thousands of items, is not as easy. This article outlines how The University of Kentucky Libraries downloaded over 86 thousand previously uploaded newspaper issues from the Internet Archive for local use. The process leveraged ChatGPT to automate the process of generating Python scripts that accessed the Internet Archive via its API (Application Programming Interface).</p>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising mitigation strategy by grounding LLM outputs used in specific digital collections. This article compares the performance of WARC-GPTs default RAG implementation with unfiltered WARC files from Archi Io ve-It against a custom-built RAG solution utilizing optimization strategies in both modelling and data (WARC) preprocessing. Tested on a collection of thousands of archived pages from the Bob’s Burgers fan wiki, the study analyzes trade-offs in preprocessing, embedding strategies, retrieval accuracy, and system responsiveness. Findings suggest that while WARC-GPT lowers barriers to experimentation, custom RAG pipelines offer substantial improvements for institutions with the technical capacity to implement them, especially in terms of data quality, efficiency, and trustworthiness.</p>

      <h1>Building and Deploying the Digital Humanities Quarterly Recommender System</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>Since 2007, <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> has published over 750 scholarly articles, constituting a significant repository of scholarship within the digital humanities. As the journal’s corpus of articles continues to grow, it is no longer possible for readers to manually navigate the title and abstract of every article in order to stay apprised of relevant work or conduct literature reviews. To address this, we have implemented a recommender system for the <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> corpus, generating recommendations of related articles that appear below each article on the journal’s website with the goal of improving discoverability. These recommendations are generated via three different methods: a keyword-based approach based on a controlled vocabulary of topics assigned to articles by editors; a TF-IDF approach applied to full article text; and a deep learning approach using the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence’s SPECTER2 model applied to article titles and abstracts. In this article, we detail our process of creating this recommender system, from the article pre-processing pipeline to the front-end implementation of the recommendations on the <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> website [ <a href="#note1">1</a>]. All of the code for our recommender system is publicly available in the <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> GitHub repository [ <a href="#note2">2</a>].</p>

      <h1>What it Means to be a Repository: Real, Trustworthy, or Mature?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>Archivists occasionally describe digital repositories as being &quot;not real,&quot; suggesting that their technical digital preservation infrastructure is inadequate to the task of digital preservation. This article discusses the concept of digital repositories, highlighting the distinction between digital repository technical infrastructure and institutions collecting digital materials, and what it means to be a &quot;real&quot; digital repository. It argues that the Open Archival Information System Reference Model and notions of Trustworthy Digital Repositories are inadequate for determining the &quot;realness&quot; of a digital repository and advocates using maturity models as a framework for discussing repository capability.</p>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>In this article, we describe a novel use of the note-taking software Obsidian as a method for users without formal training in metadata creation to develop culturally relevant data literacies across two digital archiving projects. We explain how Obsidian’s built-in use of linked data provides an open-source, flexible, and potentially scalable way for users to creatively interact with digitized materials, navigate and create metadata, and model relationships between digital objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate how Obsidian’s local and offline hosting features can be leveraged to include team members with low or unreliable internet access.</p>

      <h1>New tool to report on completeness of open research information globally</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p><em>Wednesday 22nd October 2025</em>—Crossref, the open scholarly infrastructure nonprofit, today releases an enhanced dashboard showing metadata coverage and individual organisations’ contributions to documenting the process and outputs of scientific research in the open. The tool helps research-performing, funding, and publishing organisations identify gaps in open research information, and provides supporting evidence for movements like the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/">Barcelona Declaration for Open Research Information</a>, which encourages more substantial commitment to stewarding and enriching the scholarly record through open metadata.</p>
<p>Crossref’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep">Participation Reports</a> now offer expanded features and provide full coverage of all members and all resource types registered with Crossref DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)—over 175 million records representing a significant share of global research production from organisations in 163 countries. Each of Crossref’s 23,000 members has a dashboard to visualise their metadata contributions, display coverage of key information for scholarly works, and get actionable feedback via a gap report that specifies records that need enrichment, all helping to make more transparent the work that goes into creating and curating the scholarly record.</p>
<p>For any Crossref member—whether journal publisher, research funder, university, or museum—coverage of up to 11 key elements is public and visible to everyone, including: references, abstracts, ORCID iDs, affiliation strings, ROR IDs, Open Funder Registry IDs, funding award numbers, text-mining URLs, licence URLs, Similarity Check URLs (for text-based plagiarism checking) and the presence of a Crossmark policy, indicating the organisation’s commitment to declare corrections and retractions. These metadata elements provide greater context and visibility for research objects such as journal articles and preprints, grants and awards, books and book chapters, standards, datasets, conference papers and various ‘other’ content such as scholarly blogs, images, and even physical museum artefacts.</p>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6373-1199">Mochammad Tanzil Multazam</a>, Library Director of Universitas Muhammadiyah Sidoarjo, and Secretary of the Supervisory Board of Relawan Jurnals, says, “As a sponsoring organisation for several thousand small publishers across Indonesia, we support Crossref members to register complete metadata for their works. Despite time and resource constraints, this new actionable open report on key metadata elements will help drive improvements in the information they share for their publications. This has wide-reaching implications for the visibility of that research and trust among the community, and therefore has the potential to support Indonesian scholarship in the global context.”</p>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0008-8562-7748">Lena Stoll</a>, Program Lead at Crossref, explains, “We are happy to have extended participation reports to cover more diverse record types, including grants, datasets, dissertations, and more, and to make it easier for our members to act on their ongoing improvements to enrich their records and build towards the vision of an open and more complete Research Nexus.”</p>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8249-1752">Ludo Waltman</a>, Scientific Director and Professor of Quantitative Science Studies at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University, comments, “As a representative of the researcher and metascience communities, this data is of great importance for us to analyse the trends and effects of global research activity. Crossref is one of the main driving forces in open infrastructure, and its commitment to supporting metadata completeness through this open reporting dashboard is a significant step for the open research information movement.”</p>

<p>Welcome back to our series of case studies of research funders using the Grant Linking System. In this interview, I talk with Cátia Laranjeira, PTCRIS Program Manager at FCCN|FCT, Portugal’s main public funding agency, about the agency’s approach to metadata, persistent identifiers, Open Science and Open Infrastructure.
With a holistic approach to the management, production and access to information on science, FCCN|FCT’s decision to implement the Grant Linking System within their processes was not simply a technical upgrade, but a coordinated effort to continue building a strong culture of openness. With the mantra “register once, reuse always”, FCCN|FCT efforts to embrace open funding metadata was only logical.</p>
<h3>Could you introduce your organisation?</h3>
<p>We are FCCN, the digital services of the FCT, the Foundation for Science and Technology, which is the main public funding agency in Portugal. FCT supports research and innovation in Portugal through multiple funding instruments targeting researchers, projects, institutions and international partnerships. FCCN is focused on providing digital services to the scientific and academic community in Portugal.</p>
<p>I am the manager of a program called <a href="http://www.ptcris.pt">PTCRIS</a>, part of the FCCN, within the ‘Scientific Knowledge’ pillar of the unit. PTCRIS is a broad program, whose main goal is to fulfill the mantra ‘register once, reuse always’. We aim to develop an integrated ecosystem of scientific information, so all the projects we run have this main goal and that’s what we work towards. We develop infrastructure and added-value services, such as the <a href="https://www.cienciavitae.pt/">scientific curriculum vitae management platform</a> and an indicator system that exposes information of all the funding that supports research and innovation in Portugal.</p>
<h3>What motivated you to join Crossref?</h3>
<p>We had already adopted ORCID and we also developed a national PID, connected to the citizen card additional to ORCIDs. In 2015 we adopted the <a href="https://isni.org/page/what-is-isni/">ISNI</a> and we also had DOIs for research outputs. So we were clearly missing one piece, which was metadata for funding.
At the same time we started developing a national infrastructure on science and technology funding, to have an aggregated and holistic view of the funding that is distributed in Portugal.</p>
<p>Before that the information was scattered across different databases and websites from many different funders, so we organised and aggregated this information into a platform called <a href="https://www.fccn.pt/en/atualidade/portal-sciproj-o-novo-servico-da-fct-para-a-pesquisa-do-financiamento-cientifico-em-portugal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SciPROJ</a>, which brings together all the information on scientific funding in one place, with quick and flexible access. But we didn’t have persistent identifiers for grants, and this was at the same time that Crossref started to build the Grant Linking System, so we were actually one of the first organisations to join, and in 2023 we had a pilot, where we registered 6000 grants, and we have been registering funding metadata ever since.</p>
<h3>Can you tell us about your experience using the Grant Linking System?</h3>
<p>The beginning of the pilot was the most critical stage of the process; some effort was needed to map our data models to the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/grants-schema/">Crossref grant metadata schema</a>. FCCN wasn’t in a bad position to do this since we already had all that information in a registry and it was well organised, we just had to map them to make sure that the information we had could be shared following the Crossref metadata schema and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-practices/">best practices</a>.
It has been two years since the pilot, which puts us in phase 2 of the implementation of the system. During the pilot we concentrated on registering both historical and current grants’ metadata, in the current phase, we are focusing on current grants’ metadata.</p>
<h3>What do you find useful about registering grant metadata with Crossref?</h3>
<p><strong>Although this is the very beginning of this journey, we envision a world where we have the ability to link grants to any other object and entity that comprises the ecosystem: people that execute that funding, projects, institutions, outputs.</strong> Outputs are something particularly important to us, like for many other funders, because we want to be able to monitor the impact of our funding and that is something that is always at the back of our mind.</p>
<p>We are actually developing more and more services that aim to show how these links can be very useful to retrieve information from the system. For example, we are developing an indicator system that is focusing on the funding but also on the outputs and the links between the two. We are also monitoring OA trends, to see how FCT funding is contributing to Open Science initiatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, our <a href="https://www.fct.pt/en/sobre/estudos-e-planeamento-estrategico/politicas-de-ciencia-aberta/acesso-aberto-a-publicacoes-cientificas/">OA policy was recently launched</a> but we currently don’t have any system that allows us to track policy compliance. We are working towards that, but to achieve this <strong>it is absolutely fundamental that grants are linked to the outputs through metadata.</strong></p>
<h3>What are your hopes for the GLS and greater transparency in funding metadata in general?</h3>
<p>The interconnectivity and interoperability of entities and objects, which is something that the field of scientific information management has always wanted to do, but that it’s very difficult to do. There have been attempts in the past to achieve this using information from the acknowledgement sections of publications, but this is fairly inefficient and there needs to be more structure to it. <strong>A critical piece of this puzzle would be to influence publishers, manuscript submission platforms to facilitate the systematic sharing of grant IDs and grant metadata by design.</strong> I think this is something that is still missing and that I would like to see happening soon.</p>
<h3>Has anything surprised you while implementing the Grant Linking System?</h3>
<p>Something that we have seen that was surprising was that researchers, who in general are not that concerned about PIDs, when it came to grant IDs, they would ask us proactively what the Crossref grant ID for their award was! It was very refreshing to see that we didn’t need to do any advertising to socialize Crossref grant IDs among our grant holders. I think that tells you about the high level of awareness there is within our community of the importance of the Crossref grant ID, using it and putting it in the acknowledgment section of their publications.</p>
<h3>Based on your experience, what would be your advice for colleagues from other research funders?</h3>
<p>I would say go for it! The more the merrier! This is like any other similar information system – <strong>it only works if there are enough people using it</strong>, registering grants metadata that facilitate the links between objects.</p>
<p>It is a very easy process to get into. Once you map the metadata schema to your own data it’s not a technically difficult thing to do. For us it’s an automated process that runs very smoothly, from grant registration to communicating this information to grant holders. We can see this in action in this example: the grantee published <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14020298">an article</a> that acknowledges their funding through <a href="https://sciproj.ptcris.pt/157479UID">Crossref’s grants IDs</a> or funding received being acknowledged in the <a href="https://www.citab.utad.pt/the-centre/welcome-to-citab">website of a Research Center</a>.</p>
<h3>If you could change something about the GLS or how the grant metadata you register is used, what would it be?</h3>
<p>I would love to have access to a visualization of grants’ metadata, how many outputs are linked to, and how they relate to other objects and entities. That would really give us a clearer understanding of the impact that our funding is having.
We’d also love to see better integration between Crossref and ORCID for grants—just like it works for publications. Ideally, when a grant is registered and linked to a researcher, they’d be notified and could easily add it to their ORCID record. This would allow the information to flow seamlessly into their national CV via <strong>PTCRISsync</strong>, ensuring consistency and reducing manual work.</p>

<p>We are grateful to Cátia Laranjeira and FCT|FCCN for sharing their perspective and long-standing experience in this space. Their experience highlights the role that funding metadata plays in an interconnected and complete research and funding ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Integração de metadados de financiamento pela FCCN|FCT para reforçar a interoperabilidade da informação sobre a atividade científica</h3>
<p>Bem-vindo(a) de volta à nossa série de estudos de caso sobre instituições financiadoras de investigação que utilizam o Grant Linking System. Nesta entrevista, conversamos com Cátia Laranjeira, gestora do programa PTCRIS na FCCN|FCT, a principal agência pública de financiamento à ciência em Portugal, sobre a abordagem da instituição aos metadados, identificadores persistentes, Ciência Aberta e Infraestruturas Abertas.</p>
<p>Com uma abordagem holística à gestão, produção e acesso à informação científica, a decisão da FCCN|FCT de integrar o Grant Linking System nos seus processos não representou apenas uma evolução técnica, mas sim um esforço coordenado para consolidar uma forte cultura de abertura. Sob o lema “registar uma vez, reutilizar sempre”, a adoção de metadados abertos de financiamento pela FCCN|FCT foi um passo natural e coerente com essa visão.</p>
<h3>Poderia apresentar a sua organização?</h3>
<p>A FCCN é a unidade de serviços digitais da FCT — Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, a principal agência pública de financiamento à ciência em Portugal. A FCT apoia a investigação e a inovação através de diversos instrumentos de financiamento dirigidos a investigadores, projetos, instituições e parcerias internacionais. A FCCN dedica-se a disponibilizar serviços digitais à comunidade científica e académica portuguesa.</p>
<p>Na FCCN|FCT, sou gestora do PTCRIS, um programa integrado no pilar do Conhecimento Científico. O PTCRIS é um programa abrangente que tem como objetivo central concretizar o princípio “registar uma vez, reutilizar sempre”. Trabalhamos para desenvolver um ecossistema integrado de informação científica, e todos os projetos que conduzimos convergem nesse propósito. Desenvolvemos infraestruturas e serviços de valor acrescentado, como a plataforma de gestão do currículo científico <a href="https://www.cienciavitae.pt/">CIÊNCIAVITAE</a> e um sistema de indicadores que disponibiliza informação sobre todos os financiamentos que apoiam a investigação e a inovação em Portugal.</p>
<h3>O que motivou a adesão à Crossref?</h3>
<p>A FCCN tinha já adotado o ORCID e desenvolvido um identificador nacional persistente (PID), ligado ao cartão de cidadão, como complemento aos ORCIDs. Em 2015, adotámos o <a href="https://isni.org/page/what-is-isni/">ISNI</a> e também tínhamos DOIs para a produção científica. Ficava claramente em falta um elemento: os metadados de financiamento.</p>
<p>Ao mesmo tempo, iniciámos o desenvolvimento de uma infraestrutura nacional de financiamentos de ciência e tecnologia, com o objetivo de ter uma visão agregada e holística do financiamento que suporta a investigação e inovação em Portugal.</p>
<p>Antes disso, a informação estava dispersa por diferentes bases de dados e websites de múltiplos financiadores. Organizámos e agregámos esta informação numa plataforma chamada <a href="https://www.fccn.pt/en/atualidade/portal-sciproj-o-novo-servico-da-fct-para-a-pesquisa-do-financiamento-cientifico-em-portugal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SciPROJ</a>, que reúne toda a informação sobre financiamentos científicos num único local, com acesso rápido e flexível. No entanto, ainda não existiam identificadores persistentes para os financiamentos, coincidindo com o momento em que a Crossref começou a desenvolver o Grant Linking System. Fomos, assim, uma das primeiras organizações a aderir. Em 2023, realizámos um piloto com 6.000 financiamentos registados, e desde então temos vindo a registar continuamente os metadados de financiamento.</p>
<h3>Pode falar-nos sobre a sua experiência com o Grant Linking System?</h3>
<p>A FCCN iniciou a utilização do Grant Linking System com um piloto, que constituiu a fase mais crítica do processo. Foi necessário algum esforço para mapear os nossos modelos de dados para o <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/grants-schema/">esquema de metadados de financiamentos da Crossref</a>. A FCCN estava, no entanto, bem posicionada para isso, uma vez que já dispunha de toda a informação num registo organizado; o passo necessário foi apenas assegurar que esta informação pudesse ser partilhada de acordo com o esquema de metadados da Crossref e as <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-pra">melhores práticas</a>.</p>
<p>Já passaram dois anos desde o piloto, o que nos coloca na fase 2 de implementação do sistema. Durante o piloto, focámo-nos no registo de metadados de financiamentos históricos e atuais; na fase atual, estamos focados no registo de metadados de financiamentos atuais.</p>
<h3>O que considera útil no registo de metadados de financiamento na Crossref?</h3>
<p><strong>Embora este seja ainda o início deste percurso, a FCCN idealiza um ecossistema em que seja possível ligar financiamentos a qualquer outro objeto ou entidade do sistema científico — projetos, pessoas que executam esses financiamentos, instituições onde são executados e produções científicas que dele resultam.</strong> Estes últimos são particularmente importantes para nós, como para muitos outros financiadores, pois queremos monitorizar o impacto do financiamento — uma preocupação que está sempre presente no nosso trabalho.</p>
<p>Estamos, de facto, a desenvolver serviços que demonstram o valor dessas ligações para a recuperação de informação no sistema. Um exemplo é o sistema de indicadores em desenvolvimento, que se centra nos financiamentos, nas produções científicas e nas relações entre ambos. Estamos também a acompanhar as tendências de Ciência Aberta, para perceber de que forma o financiamento da FCT está a contribuir para as iniciativas de Open Science.</p>
<p>Além disso, a <a href="https://www.fct.pt/en/sobre/estudos-e-planeamento-estrategico/politicas-de-ciencia-aberta/acesso-aberto-a-publicacoes-cientificas/">política de Acesso Aberto da FCT</a> foi recentemente lançada, mas ainda não dispomos de um sistema que permita monitorizar a conformidade com essa política. Estamos a trabalhar nesse sentido, mas para o concretizar é <strong>absolutamente essencial que consigamos associar inequivocamente os financiamentos às produções científicas através de metadados.</strong></p>
<h3>Quais são as suas expectativas para o GLS e para uma maior transparência dos metadados de financiamento em geral?</h3>
<p>A interconectividade e interoperabilidade entre entidades e objetos é algo que a área da gestão de informação científica sempre procurou alcançar — embora seja um objetivo difícil de concretizar. No passado, houve várias tentativas nesse sentido, recorrendo à informação presente nas secções de agradecimentos das publicações, mas esse método revelou-se pouco eficiente e carece de uma estrutura mais sistemática.</p>
<p><strong>Uma peça essencial deste puzzle seria influenciar as editoras e as plataformas de submissão de manuscritos a facilitarem a partilha sistemática de identificadores e metadados de financiamento.</strong> Este é um elemento que ainda falta concretizar, mas que gostaríamos de ver implementado em breve.</p>
<h3>Algo o surpreendeu durante a implementação do Grant Linking System?</h3>
<p>Algo que nos surpreendeu durante a implementação do Grant Linking System foi a reação dos investigadores. Normalmente, os investigadores não demonstram grande preocupação com identificadores persistentes (PIDs), mas, neste caso, começaram a procurar ativamente o identificador Crossref do seu financiamento! Foi muito positivo perceber que não foi necessário fazer qualquer esforço de divulgação para promover o uso dos Grant IDs da Crossref entre os beneficiários dos financiamentos. Isso mostra o nível de consciência existente na comunidade científica sobre a importância destes identificadores — usá-los e incluí-los na secção de agradecimentos das publicações.</p>
<h3>Com base na sua experiência, qual seria o seu conselho para colegas de outros financiadores de investigação?</h3>
<p>Com base na nossa experiência, o conselho para outros financiadores seria simples: avancem! Quanto mais, melhor! Este tipo de sistema de informação só é verdadeiramente eficaz quando há muitas entidades a utilizá-lo, a registar metadados de financiamento e a criar ligações entre objetos.</p>
<p>É também um processo simples de implementar. Uma vez feito o mapeamento entre o esquema de metadados e os dados internos da instituição, não há grandes desafios técnicos. No nosso caso, o processo é totalmente automatizado e flui de forma eficiente, desde o registo do financiamento até à comunicação dessa informação aos beneficiários. É possível ver isso em prática em vários exemplos — desde <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14020298">artigos</a> que reconhecem o financiamento através dos <a href="https://sciproj.ptcris.pt/157479UID">Grant IDs da Crossref</a> até ao reconhecimento do apoio financeiro nos <a href="https://www.citab.utad.pt/the-centre/welcome-to-citab">sites dos centros de investigação</a>.</p>
<h3>​​Se pudesse alterar algo no GLS ou na forma como os metadados dos subsídios que regista são utilizados, o que seria?</h3>
<p>Se pudéssemos mudar algo no Grant Linking System ou na forma como os metadados de financiamento são utilizados, gostaríamos de ter acesso a uma visualização interativa que mostrasse quantas produções científicas estão ligadas a cada financiamento e como esses se relacionam com outras entidades e objetos. Isso permitiria compreender de forma muito mais clara o impacto real dos financiamentos.</p>
<p>Gostaríamos também de ver uma melhor integração entre a Crossref e o ORCID no que respeita aos financiamentos — tal como já acontece com as publicações. Idealmente, quando um financiamento fosse registado e associado a um investigador, este seria notificado e poderia adicioná-lo facilmente ao seu registo ORCID. Assim, a informação fluiria automaticamente para o currículo nacional via <strong>PTCRISsync</strong>, garantindo consistência e reduzindo o trabalho manual.</p>
<hr>
<p>Agradecemos à Cátia Laranjeira e à FCT|FCCN por partilharem a sua perspetiva e longa experiência neste domínio. A sua experiência destaca o papel que os metadados de financiamento desempenham num ecossistema de investigação e financiamento interligado e completo.</p>
