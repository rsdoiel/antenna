id="our-annual-open-call-for-expressions-of-interest-to-join-our-board">Our
annual open call for expressions of interest to join our board</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The Crossref Nominating Committee invites expressions of interest to
join the Board of Directors of Crossref for the term starting in January
2026. The committee will gather responses from those interested and
create the slate of candidates that our membership will vote on in an
election in September.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Expressions of interest will be due Monday, June 9th,
2025</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is an exciting time to join the board, as we have a number of
active projects underway. Our focus is on how our community and metadata
can contribute to ensuring the integrity of the scholarly record. We are
redesigning our content system to better serve the changing needs of our
community. We’re broadening our metadata record to capture richer
funding and institutional affiliations. New board members will be part
of on-going discussions about how to make our fees simpler and more
equitable. Additionally, we envision a future where the scholarly record
prioritizes relationships between research outputs to build a holistic
research nexus. The board helps guide this work.
</p>
<h3 id="about-our-board-elections">
About our board elections
</h3>
<p>
The board is elected through the “one member, one vote” policy wherein
every member organization of Crossref has a single vote to elect
representatives to the Crossref board. Board terms are for three years,
and this year, there are five seats open for election.
</p>
<p>
The board maintains a balance of seats, with eight seats for smaller
members and eight seats for larger members (based on total revenue to
Crossref). This is an effort to ensure that the scholarly community’s
diversity of experiences and perspectives is represented in decisions
made at Crossref.
</p>
<p>
This year, we will elect four of the larger member seats (membership
tiers $3,900 and above) and one of the smaller member seats (membership
tiers $1,650 and below). You don’t need to specify which seat you are
applying for; we will provide that information to the nominating
committee.
</p>
<p>
The online election will open in September, with results announced at
the annual meeting scheduled for October 22nd. New members will begin
their term in January 2026.
</p>
<h3 id="about-the-nominating-committee">
About the Nominating Committee
</h3>
<p>
The Nominating Committee reviews the expressions of interest and selects
a slate of candidates for election. The slate put forward will exceed
the total number of open seats. The committee considers the statements
of interest, organizational size, geography, and experience.

Board roles and responsibilities
</h3>
<p>
Crossref’s services provide a central infrastructure for scholarly
communications. Crossref’s board helps shape the future of our services
and by extension, impacts the broader scholarly ecosystem. We are
looking for board members to contribute their experience and
perspective.
</p>
<p>
The role of the board at Crossref is to provide strategic and financial
oversight of the organization, as well as guidance to the Executive
Director and the staff leadership team, with the key responsibilities
being:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Setting the strategic direction for the organization;
</li>
<li>
Providing financial oversight; and
</li>
<li>
Approving new policies and services.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The board represents of our membership base and guides the staff
leadership team on trends affecting scholarly communications.
</p>
<p>
The work of the board takes place in board meetings and board
committees. The board sets strategic directions for the organization
while also providing oversight into policy changes and implementation.
Board members join four meetings each year that typically take place in
January, March, July, and November. The July meeting is in-person and
may take place in a variety of international locations; travel support
is provided when needed. January, March, and November board meetings are
held virtually, and all committee meetings take place virtually. Each
board member should sit on at least one Crossref committee. Care is
taken to accommodate the wide range of time zones in which our board
members live.
</p>
<p>
While the expressions of interest are specific to an individual, the
seat that is elected to the board belongs to the member organization.
The primary board member also names an alternate who may attend meetings
in the event that the primary board member is unable to. There is no
personal financial obligation to sit on the board. The member
organization must remain in good standing.
</p>
<p>
Board members are expected to be comfortable assuming the
responsibilities listed above and to prepare and participate in board
meeting discussions.
</p>
<h3 id="who-can-apply-to-join-the-board">

of amendments to Crossref membership terms and bylaws</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-11, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In its March 2025 meeting, the Crossref board unanimously voted to
update both the Crossref bylaws and the Crossref membership terms to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Provide more clarity and alignment between our bylaws and membership
terms, where they had become out of sync over the years.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Reflect previous board motions and bring both documents up-to-date with
current processes for suspending and revoking membership, and reviewing
those decisions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Work towards being more explicit about what “Member Practices” should
look like in terms of preserving the integrity of the scholarly record.

</li>
</ul>

Changes to the membership terms
</h3>
<p>
The membership terms will be updated on 11th July to be clearer on,
among other things, the importance of accurate metadata, using DOI links
everywhere, the all-important reference linking obligation, and the
process for suspending and revoking/terminating membership. It also
introduces the new concept of
“<a href="https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/member-practices">Member
Practices</a>”, which a dedicated community committee will propose for
board approval. More information about this will follow soon.
</p>
<p>
You can find the specific changes below, or take a look at

marked-up PDF</a> showing the changes between the current (from June
2022) terms and the revised (July 2025) terms.

Changes to the bylaws
</h3>
<p>
Our bylaws have needed updating for a while, but since these seldom
change, we’ve saved up a few changes, also to bring them in line with
the revised membership terms.
</p>
<p>
We’ve now modernised the language, ensured that the bylaws match what’s
in the membership terms, and we’ve added in motions that have been
agreed by the board but not updated in the bylaws over the last few
years. We’ve also updated the bylaws in line with the new membership
revocation process in the new July 2025 membership terms. The new bylaws
also allow for a new group of members to be created to help Crossref
define Member Practices.
