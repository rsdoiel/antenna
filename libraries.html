id="update-on-the-resourcing-crossref-for-future-sustainability-research">Update
on the Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability research</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
We’re in year two of the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">Resourcing
Crossref for Future Sustainability</a> (RCFS) research. This report
provides an update on progress to date, specifically on research we’ve
conducted to better understand the impact of our fees and possible
changes.
</p>
<p>
Crossref is in a good financial position with our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/fees/">current fees</a>, which haven’t
increased in 20 years. This project is seeking to future-proof our fees
by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Making fees more equitable
</li>
<li>
Simplifying our complex fee schedule
</li>
<li>
Rebalancing revenue sources
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In order to review all aspects of our fees, we’ve planned five projects
to look into specific aspects of our current fees that may need to
change to achieve the goals above. This is an update on the research and
discussions that have been underway with our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/">Membership
&amp; Fees Committee</a> and our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#officers">Board</a>,
and what we’ve learned so far in each of these areas.
</p>
<h2 id="goal-1-more-equitable-fees">
Goal 1: More equitable fees.
</h2>
<p>
To ensure our fees going into the future are more equitable, we’re
carrying out two parallel projects: evaluation of the lowest membership
tier, and the review of the basis for deciding the membership tiers and
distribution of membership across them.
</p>
<h3 id="project-1-evaluate-the-lowest-membership-tier-and-propose-a-more-equitable-pricing-structure">
Project 1: Evaluate the lowest membership tier and propose a more
equitable pricing structure.
</h3>
<p>
All Crossref members pay an annual membership fee. These fees are
tiered, and different members pay a different fee depending on the
annual publishing revenue that their organisation receives (or
publishing expenses if they don’t receive any publishing revenue).
</p>
<p>
We entered into this project recognising that we have too many
membership tiers and the definition we use to size members is not
consistent and can be confusing (e.g. different basis for funders than
other organisations, and both are different still from subscribers to
our Metadata Plus service). The idea of the membership tiers was to use
publishing revenue as a proxy for “ability to pay”. We really want to
develop proposals for a more equitable pricing structure. However we
don’t know enough about our members’ capacity to pay to be able to model
an alternative approach.
</p>
<p>
Our current lowest fee tier is $275 (USD) for any organisation with
annual publishing revenue (or publishing expenses where the organisation
doesn’t receive publishing revenue) of $0 to $1 million, and this is the
tier where we focus our attention in our first project of the RCFS
program. The difference between an organisation with revenue or expenses
of US$0, and an organisation with revenue or expenses of US$1 million,
is huge. Hardly any new members have joined in any other tier in the
past several years. Of the 21,000 active members, more than 20,000 fall
into the US$275 tier - either directly (as an independent member) or
indirectly (through a sponsor, where their fees would be lower). A fee
structure that would fit better with the realities of our community
might entail breaking our current $275 fee tier down into two or more
more granular tiers.
</p>
<p>
At the moment, the majority of Crossref’s revenues come from the bottom
membership tiers; 65% of membership revenues come from organisations in
the $275 tier. We also know that many of those members (86%) are paying
more in membership dues than in content registration, whereas other
members have the inverse relationship between annual dues and content
registration. Overall, the members in the $275 tier contributed 34% of
Crossref’s revenue last year, and the members in the &gt;$50mln tier –
contributed 29%.
</p>
<h3 id="members-survey">
Members’ survey
</h3>
<p>
Between April and May this year, we surveyed all independent members in
the $275 tier. We asked questions about their operating size, how
they’re funded, and how Crossref’s fees affect them. At the time of the
survey, there were 8,027 members in this category. We received 1,054
responses; with a 13% response rate and broad representation globally,
we are confident in the sample size. One-third of respondents said they
were part of a larger organisation (such as a department or a library in
a research institution).
</p>
<p>
Chart 1: Organisation revenue or funding The majority of respondents in
this category (65%) have annual revenue or expense of less than 100,000
USD; with 48% operating with less than 10,000 USD.

<p>
Chart 2: Sources of funding When asked about the sources of funding (as
an indicator of how stable these organisations might be and how readily
accessible their funding is) the most frequent answer was public or
government funding, and then article processing charges. If
organisations relied on two sources of funding, the most common
combination was public funding and article processing charges, and it
was relatively rare for these organisations to have multiple sources of
funding.

</figure>
</div>
<p>
The majority (61%) of respondents spend less than 5% of their expenses
on Crossref fees. However, we have also learnt that for some
volunteer-run publications, Crossref fees might be some of the only
expenses they incur. Interestingly, the percentage of expenses spent on
Crossref is fairly consistently spread across the continents.
</p>
<h3 id="project-2-review-the-basis-and-distribution-of-membership-tiers">
Project 2: Review the basis and distribution of membership tiers
</h3>
<p>
This project examines options for how we define the capacity to pay, how
members are distributed across tiers, and the right levels of member
fees.
</p>
<p>
There are currently a range of prices for our annual fees, based on an
organisation’s ability to pay. We have used the metric of annual
publishing expense or revenue as an indicator of that ability, but in
some cases it doesn’t apply. As per our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/#fee-principles">fee
principles</a>, we have not differentiated between organisation types.
Nonprofit and commercial entities pay the same price (caveat: research
funders still have a separate fee schedule, but that was intended to be
temporary).
</p>
<p>
We conducted a review of other annual fee models to benchmark our
approach against six like-minded organisations working in the context of
scholarly communications and infrastructure. We looked at whether these
organisations based their fees on one more more of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Volume: e.g., research output, # of journals
</li>
<li>
Budget: e.g., total annual revenue or expenses
</li>
<li>
Relevant budget: e.g. publishing revenue
</li>
<li>
Organisation type: e.g. variance in fee based on publisher, institution,
or funder
</li>
<li>
Country-level economic data: e.g., discounting based on World Bank
classification, discounting based on purchasing power calculation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are three consistent themes among our peers: the total annual
revenue and volume levels are the most common basis for membership fees
among other organisations, and almost all offer discounted fees to
accommodate country-based economic circumstances, utilising World Bank’s
data (this is currently achieved at Crossref via the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM program</a>, which we have
full intention of incorporating into our future fees whatever other
decisions we might take). Only one other organisation uses publishing
revenue or expenses as a basis for annual fees, while the potentially
more transparent and less ambiguous data point of the total revenue
factors in three other annual fee models.
</p>
<p>
For subscribers to our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/fees/#metadata-plus-subscriber-fees">Metadata
Plus service</a>, the fee tier is selected based on whichever is the
higher between their total annual revenue (including earned and
fundraised, e.g. grants) or annual operating expenses (including staff
and non-staff, e.g. occupancy, equipment, licences etc.). At present, we
have limited understanding of the budgets of our members and how this
may compare to their publishing revenues or expenses. We are looking to
learn more about this as part of our annual membership data checking
process, where we email all our members to ask them to confirm contact
details for their organisation and the staff involved in managing their
Crossref account. This year, we’re also asking all members about their
organisation’s annual operating budget (or planned annual expenses) to
help inform our discussions. In our case, the volume of outputs (in this
case the number of items and associated metadata registered with
Crossref) is recognised by the registration fees mechanism.

<p>
To help us inform how our fees can be more equitable, it’s important to
invite voices of organisations that may currently be unable to join us -
due to fees or technical barriers. We hope that learning more about
their circumstances will help us make sure that we improve accessibility
of Crossref membership to all organisations that publish scholarly and
professional works. We commissioned Accucoms to carry out a consultation
on our behalf.
</p>
<p>
So far, from a handful of interviews with publishers from Nigeria, DRC,
Canada and USA, we’ve learnt that while virtually all offer open access
to their publications, the majority has no publishing income, and where
the income is derived via APCs it’s modest and only applicable in rare
circumstances. Through institutional funding and/or grants, these
organisations have modest operational budgets, yet our respondents
lacked clarity over the particulars. In terms of participation in
professional networks and international publishing organisations, only
one of the organisations we interviewed participates in DOAJ, and
another is a member of OASPA, in both cases their participation is free.
Among the interviewees, two organisations were interested in Crossref
membership in the past but encountered technical barriers to joining.
</p>
<p>
With only five interviews to date,
<a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7879005/673ef7e88ae5" target="_blank">the
consultation is still open</a> and we’re keen to hear from more
organisations that are not Crossref members but have considered our
membership at some point.

Projects 3 &amp; 4: Review volume and backfile discounts for Content
Registration
</h3>
<p>
Along with our membership fees, our members also pay usage-based
registration fees for records (scholarly works and grants) they register
with us. Different content types render different costs for our members,
and the fees are subject to discounts related to the age of publication
and volume of registrations. Records for items older than two years have
a lower fee associated with them, to help incentivise registration of
such “backfile” materials with great gains for the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">Research
Nexus</a>. There are also discounts related to the volume of
transactions – which again depend on the content types.
</p>
<p>
These discounts are intended to encourage certain behaviours,
specifically encouraging members to register older records in large
quantities to better complete the scholarly record. Not all content
types have backfile or volume discounts, and the rate of discount
varies. This creates quite a complex system of fees. To the extent that
the discount is successful in encouraging this behaviour, we want to
preserve it, but in many cases these discounts see little to no
activity.
</p>
<p>
Following the discussions of the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/">Membership
and Fees Committee</a>, chaired by Vincas Grigas, Vilnius University, we
are preparing to consult with the small number of members who currently
receive volume discounts to discuss what the impact would be if we
removed them.
</p>
<p>
We plan to identify and preserve the well-used backfile discounts, which
encourage registration of old content, such as books, journal articles,
grants. However, there are types of discounts that are hardly ever used
and we are considering removing these to simplify the fees. This work
will focus on the technical implications of removing some of the
underused backfile discounts from the billing code and consulting with
members to understand any impact .

Project 5: Reflect increase in metadata usage and perceived shift of

</h3>
<p>
All Crossref metadata is made freely and openly available to everyone.
However, some organisations may be looking for a service level agreement
in delivery of the metadata, plus more regular snapshots and priority
service/rate limits. For those organisations, we have an optional
Metadata Plus service.
</p>
<p>
The final project is looking at the fees for this service. We are
interested in making sure that Crossref metadata is available and used
by the community where it can contribute to their objectives – related
to discovery, analysis, integrity, and more. The optional paid service
we offer aims to support the external tools that facilitate business and
scholarly processes for the community. We are heartened to see that the
appetite for the use of metadata seems to be growing, and the value of
open research information is increasingly and widely recognised. We want
to ensure that the users of metadata contribute proportionally to the
maintenance of the records created and curated by our members.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
At this point, most projects generate a lot of questions and the work is
underway to deliver answers related to capacity to pay, discounts as
well as available metadata usage, and barriers faced by organisations in
our community.
</p>
<p>
What we have found so far is that two of our goals – simplification and
equity – are often at odds with each other, and this is especially true
with the $275 tier.
</p>
<p>
We welcome comments, suggestions and questions.
