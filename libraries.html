      <h1>Reduction of Grant DOI registration fees: a boost for the Research Nexus</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>We are pleased to announce that—effective 1st January 2026—we have made two changes to grant record registration fees that aim to accelerate adoption of Crossref’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant Linking System (GLS)</a> and provide a two-year window of opportunity to increase the number and availability of open persistent grant identifiers and boost the matching of relationships with research objects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/gls/gls-benefits.png" alt="High-level benefits of the Crossref Grant Linking System (GLS)"></p>
<p>Launched in 2019 with close input from several funders and other infrastructure organisations, the GLS primarily offers the ability to create and steward Crossref Grant DOIs, along with several benefits such as dedicated grant/award metadata like funding type, value, contributors, and projects, as well as hosted landing pages, tools to create and update metadata, and of course both member-asserted and Crossref-automatic matching of relationships within the global corpus of 180 million other research objects. Essentially, we need to identify what research objects are produced as a result of the award, and these objects could be articles, preprints, data, code, blogs, posters, and more.</p>
<p>This connected network is what we call the Research Nexus, essential for exploring research activity in general, as well as evaluating reach and return on funding and other support like use of facilities/equipment.</p>
<h3>A fee reduction and a two-year fee waiver pilot</h3>
<p>Following a review by our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/">Membership &amp; Fees Committee</a>, the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#board-members">Board</a> met in December and passed two related motions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Current-Year (CY) grant registration fee has been cut in half to match other record types</strong>: The board approved the adjustment of the Current-Year (CY) grant registration fee down from <span class="math inline">\(2.00 to \)</span>1.00 USD, effective 1st January 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Back-Year (BY) grant registration fee is waived through 2027</strong>: The board approved a time-limited fee waiver as a pilot for Back-Year (BY) grant registration fees, bringing that per-record fee down from <span class="math inline">\(0.30 to \)</span>0.00 for 2026 and 2027.</li>
</ol>
<p>We aim to boost registration of Back-Year (BY) records and accelerate the growth of the Research Nexus with millions more grant&lt;-&gt;output matches. During the course of the two-year pilot, the Membership &amp; Fees Committee and our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">fee project work</a> that started in 2023 and also <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10">brought in other fee reductions</a>, will consider more adjustments across BY registration fees for the benefit of members beyond just funders and beyond just grants.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#motions">Board motions are publicly available</a> and we encourage questions from the community about our governance processes and the decisions on our members’ behalf; <a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org">email us via feedback@crossref.org</a> anytime, or <a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/strategy/">post on the forum</a>.</p>
<h3>Supercharging the Grant Linking System</h3>
<p>Leading up to the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">GLS</a> launch in 2019, we worked with a group of funders and metadata experts to inform the design and implementation of the new service, including a funder governance and fees working group. That was seven years ago, and our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders/">Funder Advisory Group</a> now includes nearly 100 funding community representatives the GLS has grown to almost 50 funder members that have registered more than 185,000 open grant metadata records. But they are mostly research councils and agencies or charities from Europe and North America, and we know that for a truly comprehensive and interconnected Research Nexus, more needs to be done to include organisations from all parts of the world. The other key driver is simply to boost more metadata connections; the more grant metadata we gather, the better we can match it to all kinds of research outputs, and this metadata directly feeds thousands of services available in our community, from Dimensions and Scopus, to OA.Report and OpenAlex, as well as funders’ own analytics tools. See our <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/607z6-1nh09">recent report about the latest dataset</a> and of course use <a href="htps://api.crossref.org">api.crossref.org</a> directly.</p>
<p>Relatedly, we just added a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/x7d4h-x3r11">new Grant DOI field</a> to our schema for all record types, to give our members a precise and accurate way of capturing funding metadata for all research outputs. With the new lower CY registration fee and a pilot waiver of BY fees for grant records, we hope to boost the creation of more Grant DOIs by more funders from more parts of the world—so that others also see and can build on the momentum and reuse the data in their own tools and services. <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/news/20251023_community_roundtable/">All actors need to play their role</a>, and Crossref’s part is in running the global linking infrastructure at scale, connecting research objects and making them openly available while ensuring that the barriers for the registration, use and reuse of metadata remain as low as possible.</p>
<p>We feel we’re at a tipping point that only needs a small nudge to truly scale the Grant Linking System.</p>
<p>By waiving BY fees entirely for two years, we’re hoping to see members fill in historical data and create more comprehensive grant&lt;-&gt;outcome connections. There is often a long period of time between funding being awarded, and the resulting research objects being generated and communicated. That is why historical grant metadata is so important; we think that there will be many funding outcome relationships and insights just waiting to be uncovered!</p>
<h3>Why give funders a fee break and not others?</h3>
<p>We’re not ruling out this kind of fee incentive in future for other members and other object types, but that needs more analysis (which we plan to do) and right now, the relatively small number of grant records, combined with a growing need for this kind of metadata, means the changes are small enough to have almost no impact on Crossref’s healthy financial position.</p>
<p>This decision is consistent with the goals of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability (RCFS)</a> to review our fees to make sure they are equitable and clear, while ensuring Crossref retains a sustainable business model. Our fees can encourage or discourage the community to participate in Crossref. The RCFS project has also resulted in the creation of a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/j2bgz-v7h50/">lower membership fee tier</a> for the very lowest-resourced members, and the tidying up of <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10">things like outlier volume discounts</a>.</p>
<p>The BY fee waiver is positioned as a pilot to allow us to measure its impact over the next two years and feed into the Membership &amp; Fees Committee and RCFS project. We will evaluate the pilot results (i.e. does it indeed supercharge funding metadata connections and adoption?) and consider additional adjustments to other BY registration fees and whether such fee incentives might be extended to other members.</p>
<p>We encourage all funders to take advantage of these reduced rates to contribute to the Research Nexus and help us build a more complete picture of the relationship between research funding and outcomes.</p>
<p>Take a look at the recent case studies from early GLS adopters <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/n9n69-y5b75">FWF</a> (Austria), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69">NWO</a> (The Netherlands), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/9gjfp-5p698">FCCN|FCT</a> (Portugal), and <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/c1dh8-qn968">Wellcome/EuropePMC</a>, reach out to them or us with any questions, or peruse the <a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/crossref-services/grant-linking-system/">GLS community forum</a>!</p>

      <h1>The best way of acknowledging research funding in the metadata: Crossref Grant ID</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>We are very pleased to kick off the New Year with another important schema update and the news that a Grant DOI field is now supported for all record types. This means that Crossref members can explicitly include the Crossref Grant IDs as part of their DOI metadata records for publications and any other output type, accurately linking research outputs to the funding that made it possible, all through metadata. We hope that our members will leverage this to respond to recent calls for <a href="https://council.science/statements/isc-position-on-research-funding-transparency/">stronger funding transparency</a> and best practices for <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/discussion-document/declaring-funding-sources-research">reporting funding sources in research outputs</a>.</p>
<p>Funding information is very important for the research community. As explored by <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2025/12/11/open-funder-metadata-is-essential-for-true-research-transparency/">some key European funder representatives</a>, providing mechanisms to clearly link funding with its outputs is essential for the community to have a full picture of the research endeavour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When funders systematically register grants with persistent identifiers and make this information openly available, they create a foundation that publishers and infrastructure providers such as repositories can reliably build upon when depositing output metadata.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Hans de Jonge, Katharina Rieck and Zoé Ancion</p>
<p>Up until now, if a Crossref member wanted to include a Crossref Grant ID to unambiguously identify the output funding source, they would need to use other available fields, such as for an award number. While it was an important step towards increasing transparency and is heavily used for reporting and impact assessment, being an unstructured field, it was prone to errors, and of course, funders’ internal award identifiers are not unique, persistent, or necessarily open. This limited our ability to create unambiguous relationships with the Crossref Grant DOIs registered by our now ~50 funder members. As the new field becomes increasingly populated by our members, this rich metadata will pave the way for capturing and representing the funding relationships in a more accurate and complete way and fulfilling one of our commitments at the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/news/20251023_community_roundtable/">recent funding metadata workshop with the Barcelona Declaration.</a></p>
<p><strong>The Crossref Grant ID field in the schema is a clear signal of the growing demand for these persistent Grant IDs (Crossref DOIs), and the relationships these help us create.</strong> Those connections can in turn enable streamlined reporting for the grantees, as well as compliance tracking and programme evaluation for funders.</p>
<p>As part of our work to enable the research nexus, Crossref has been proactively identifying funding information and prototyping metadata enrichment processes <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/">through matching projects</a>, ensuring that as many <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/607z6-1nh09">relationships as possible are established and made discoverable</a>. With this schema update, we aim to lower barriers and encourage more members to register output-funding relationships at source. This will facilitate the links that make the research nexus a connected, interoperable, and an important source of information that ensures a transparent and trustworthy research process.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage all Crossref members to start incorporating Grant DOIs when available into your metadata submissions.</strong> By taking advantage of this new field, you’ll help build a more complete and transparent record of research funding, making it easier for the community to understand and trace the impact of funded research.</p>
<p>When collecting funding information for your publication, please consider asking the authors for the Grant DOI (Crossref Grant ID) as well as the funder’s details (such as their name and identifier). Here’s how the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Scientific and Technical Information’s (OSTI-DOE) grant <a href="https://doi.org/10.46936/aps-182101/60010611">https://doi.org/10.46936/aps-182101/60010611</a> can be included in the metadata for related works, from datasets, to preprints, conference proceedings, journal articles, and more:</p>
<pre><code class="language-JS">&lt;assertion name=&quot;fundgroup&quot;&gt;
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;ror&quot;&gt;https://ror.org/04qxsr837&lt;/assertion&gt;
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;grant_doi&quot;&gt;10.46936/aps-182101/60010611&lt;/assertion&gt;
 &lt;/assertion&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, a grant <a href="https://doi.org/10.3030/732489">https://doi.org/10.3030/732489</a> from European Union H2020-EU.2.1.1. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP, would be represented in related work’s metadata as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-JS">&lt;assertion name=&quot;fundgroup&quot;&gt;
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;funder_name”&gt;H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;funder_identifier”&gt;10.13039/100010669&lt;/assertion&gt;
 &lt;/assertion&gt;
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;grant_doi&quot;&gt;10.3030/732489&lt;/assertion&gt;
&lt;/assertion&gt;

</code></pre>
