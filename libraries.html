the Future of Higher Education: Cultivating Global Citizens and
Embracing Transnational Education</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>
Efforts to expand educational accessibility and foster global
collaboration are on the rise. Realizing the full potential of
Transnational Education (TNE) requires an examination of the regulatory
