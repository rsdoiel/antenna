<h2 id="supporting-membership-through-the-sponsor-program">Supporting
Membership through the Sponsor Program</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-18, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Sponsors make Crossref membership accessible to organizations that would
otherwise face barriers to joining us. They also provide support to
facilitate participation, which increases the amount and diversity of
metadata in the global Research Nexus. This in turn improves
discoverability and transparency of scholarship behind the works.
</p>
<h3 id="growing-number-of-sponsors">
Growing number of sponsors
</h3>
<p>
Our first sponsors joined in 2008, but the program started to grow
rapidly between 2012-2014, with the addition of sponsors in South Korea,
Tükiye, Russia, India, and Ukraine. In 2015, we welcomed our first South
American sponsor from Brazil, followed by more sponsors in Latin America
starting in 2016, and our first sponsor in Indonesia in 2017.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As of December 2024, Crossref works with 124 sponsoring organizations
that support 12,195 sponsored members.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In 2021, we updated the criteria for organizations to be accepted as
sponsors, raising the bar to ensure that potential sponsors accurately
and successfully represent Crossref in the community. We also
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/refocusing-our-sponsors-program-a-call-for-new-sponsors-in-specific-countries/">paused
the acceptance of new Sponsors</a> from regions where such organisations
are already prolific. By doing so, we can focus on growing the program
in areas with the greatest need.
</p>
<p>
In 2024, we added eight new sponsors to the program; these included our
first sponsor in Bangladesh (our first GEM sponsor), as well as sponsors
in China, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Türkiye, Tunisia, Iraq, and Kenya.
</p>

<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/sponsor-growth-by-country-by-year-graph.png"
alt="graph showing growth by country" width="75%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>
Our five largest sponsors, based on the number of members they support
(as of the end of 2024) are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Relawan Jurnal Indonesia, Indonesia - 3076 members
</li>
<li>
Associacao Brasileira de Editores Cientificos do Brasil (ABEC Brasil) -
1312
</li>
<li>
Tubitak Ulakbim DergiPark, Türkiye - 1248
</li>
<li>
NEICON ISP, Russia- 713
</li>
<li>
Kyobobook Center, South Korea - 419
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The majority of sponsors are much smaller than this, looking after 25 or
fewer Sponsored Members.
</p>
<p>
Each sponsor has specific criteria for what kind of organizations they
work with. Some are dedicated to supporting organisations in a specific
country or region, while others may be based on geography, language,
subject area, or usage of a specific platform, e.g. OJS.
</p>
<p>
Our sponsors are distributed across all regions of the world, and we’re
continuously working to forge networks with organizations in regions
with the least coverage, to ensure scholarly communicators anywhere can
join Crossref and contribute to the Research Nexus.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Asia Pacific: 22
</li>
<li>
Central and Eastern Europe: 29
</li>
<li>
Central and South Asia: 25
</li>
<li>
Latin America and the Caribbean: 24
</li>
<li>
North Africa and the Middle East: 3
</li>
<li>
Sub-Saharan Africa: 2
</li>
<li>
​US and Canada: 5
</li>
<li>
Western Europe: 14
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Currently, sponsored members represent 115 different countries, with the
largest proportions from Latin America, South-eastern Asia, and Eastern
Europe. Nearly two-thirds of sponsored members self-identify as
universities, libraries, government agencies, foundations, scholar
publishers, and research institutions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To date, sponsored members have contributed 6.5 million works to the
Research Nexus.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Importantly, the sponsored members have the ability to fully participate
in Crossref – they are stewards of their records (even if some choose to
delegate this activity to their sponsor), they can vote, stand in for
elections to our Board of Directors, and collaborate with others in the
Crossref community, just as any other member.
</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-the-sponsor-program">
Benefits of the Sponsor Program
</h3>
<p>
Sponsors are key partners for us in making participation easier for
organisations in their communities. They work with us to provide
administrative, billing, technical, and local language support to the
members they work with. Depending on the financial model, they may
charge members for their services.
</p>
<p>
Technical support they provide for members makes it more tailored and
often quicker than the Crossref team could offer. For example, sponsors
can provide service in their local language using their preferred method
(helpdesk, WhatsApp, phone, email), which varies widely by region; or,
where they charge any fees – they tend to collect those in the local
currency. Some sponsors even take care of all the records registration
for the members they support.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to note that sponsors can only support the participation
of organizations that would otherwise be in the current $275 fee tier
(or up to $500 for funders) if these organizations were to join
independently. Regardless of the number of sponsored members, the
sponsor pays one membership fee on behalf of them all, and then they
also pay all the registration fees that are due on behalf of their
sponsored members, which alleviates challenges related to paying in
foreign currency. Overall, sponsors make Crossref membership more
economical for the organisations that participate this way, and Crossref
benefits from billing efficiencies.
</p>
<p>
In a recent survey of sponsored members (carried out in July 2023, with
204 responses from members working with 53 sponsors), the majority of
sponsored members (88%) said that sponsors met their expectations and
85% are likely or very likely to recommend their sponsors to another
organization.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/sponsor-survey-results-graph.png"
alt="graph showing survey results" width="75%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>
Respondents indicated that the aspects of working with a sponsor that
were most valued are technical support (72%), financial assistance/no
annual fee (37.3%), ability to pay in local currency (43%), and local
language support (44%).
</p>
<p>
It’s important to note that sponsors often offer many non-Crossref
services to members too, including anything from website design, copy
editing, typesetting, set up of publishing platform, XML-JATS markup, to
assistance with submitting content to third-party databases.
</p>
<p>
Sponsors represent Crossref in the community. They also assist us in
connecting with their communities locally. In 2024, we collaborated with
Biteca for an event in Bogotá, and Relawan Jurnal Indonesia for a
two-day event in Jakarta. Both sponsors advised on venues, promoted the
event to the members they support, coordinated local guest speakers, and
provided translation services as needed. We also collaborated with
Hipertexto-Netizen on engaging our community at the Guadalajara Book
Fair. The success of these events was in part due to our collaboration
with each sponsor.
</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-quality-experience-for-our-members">
Ensuring quality experience for our members
</h3>
<p>
We try to make sure that every sponsor we work with will be able to
commit to helping our members long-term. We offer training too, with an
expectation that they can disseminate the learning to their members. The
majority of sponsored members report receiving some training from their
Sponsors (with 70% in our survey saying they’ve received adequate
training on all services, while only 3% haven’t received any so far).
Most recently we engaged sponsors with the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Participation
Reports</a> to help them improve metadata completeness for their
members.
</p>
<p>
In 2024, we’ve been meeting sponsors individually to review how things
are going for them and their members – assessing member metadata
quality, and additional services, as well as inviting their feedback
about the program and suggestions for improvements that Crossref could
make.
</p>
<p>
We’ve learnt a lot about practices related to record registration and
training, business models and especially – a whole range of attitudes
and approaches related to metadata completeness. Some sponsors register
content for all or some of their members, while others provide technical
support but do not register the content directly for members.
</p>
<p>
Members who used OJS often had higher scores because of the ease of use
and availability of the plugins. Some sponsors noted that many journal
editors are volunteers and don’t have the time or financial resources to
collect extra metadata or update existing metadata records; they collect
only what is required to register an item. Several sponsors also
reported a barrier with authors’ mindset – they don’t tend to see the
value of including ORCiDs or ROR IDs in their submissions. Somewhat
surprisingly, we learned that not all members see the value in including
references in their deposits or don’t wish to take the time to add them
– this is a concern, as relationships created by references are a
cornerstone of the Research Nexus, and markedly support discoverability
of the content.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, sponsors are unable to continue to provide services, or they
are unable to meet the obligations of being a sponsor and their accounts
are closed. In the cases where a sponsor account is closed, we will work
with their members to find an alternative sponsor when possible.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/">Similarity
Check</a> is an external service provided in partnership with
iThenticate, that’s available to Crossref members at a more competitive
price, and it is in demand among the sponsored members too. Currently,
78 Sponsors offer Similarity Check to their members (however, not all
sponsored members working with these sponsors have elected to use the
service).
</p>
<p>
Sponsor LIBCOM Piotr Karwasinski was pleased that “All the rules of
Crossref are unified. Everything is the same for everyone - the same for
big publishers as well as small. Equal for everyone.”
</p>
<p>
Costs can sometimes be a concern; sponsors in India and Algeria both
noted that $1USD is a lot of money for some. We mentioned the fee review
being conducted with the RCFS project.
</p>
<h3 id="in-summary">
In summary
</h3>
<p>
As we move toward realizing our vision of a connected Research Nexus,
building a network for the global community must include input from all
of the global community. When Crossref began 25 years ago our first
members were mainly from the United States and Western Europe, but today
our membership is much more global and diverse. Though our membership
has grown to more than 22,000 organizations around the world, we are not
seeing significant membership growth from all regions.
</p>
<p>
In the last few years, almost half of our members came from Southeastern
Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America combined. However, there is much
slower growth in other regions, mostly notably Northern and Sub-Saharan
Africa, and parts of Central Asia, with only 5% of new member
applications coming from these regions collectively. We know there are
organizations in those areas contributing to the scholarly record,
however, many continue to face financial, technical, and administrative
barriers to become members.
</p>
<p>
The Sponsor Program is one of the avenues established to address and
reduce barriers and to help facilitate membership and participation to
all knowledge-sharing organisations worldwide. Ensuring it remains
strong and successful requires collaboration, communication, and
comprehensive training.

About Crossref
</h3>
<p>
Crossref is a nonprofit membership organization that exists to make
scholarly communications better. We run open infrastructure to link
research objects, entities, and actions, creating a lasting and reusable
scholarly record that underpins open science and makes research outputs
easy to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse.
</p>
<p>
Together with our 22,000 members in 160 countries, we drive metadata
exchange and support nearly 2 billion monthly API queries, facilitating
global research communication, for the benefit of society. Our members
include research institutions, publishers, libraries, funders,
government bodies, and other stakeholders in the scholarly
communications ecosystem.
</p>
<h3 id="about-the-crossref-website">
About the Crossref website
</h3>
<p>
We launched the current website in 2016. A few years later, we
custom-developed the current Documentation section, moving from a
separate site (Zendesk, and prior to that HelpIQ). We subsequently
launched a Discourse
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/" target="_blank">community
forum</a> and actively encourage self-service there. Despite these
efforts, we still answered about 50,000 support emails in 2024.
</p>
<p>
We use the <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a> static
site generator, and all the content, assets, and code are open in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/crossref-website/" target="_blank">GitLab</a>.
We have dedicated staging and sandbox branches, and use staging for
editing instead of the usual git merge requests, and sandbox for testing
more substantial code or navigation changes.
</p>
<p>
We share the responsibility for editing across the teams, with a page
owner/author denoted for each page. Most staff use
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a> for
editing; we don’t have or need a CMS. We deploy changes to the live site
around twice a week. Several custom shortcodes are in place, such as for
tables and displaying related information based on tags, or for
presentation elements like highlight boxes or columns. We host (many)
images and files directly in the repository, rather than using a CDN. We
use Algolia for site search, which was chosen because it can support
multiple languages.
</p>
<h4 id="current-website-structure">
Current website structure
</h4>
<p>
There are currently four main sections of the website:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/">Get involved</a>: this
landing page is the most up-to-date with our current positioning and
messaging. The section includes how to join as a member and the ways you
can participate, obligations and benefits; a welcome page for new
members to get started; events and webinars like our annual meeting;
special projects or campaigns that need landing pages; fees; programs
such as for service providers and ambassadors; global equitable
membership; code of conduct; and working groups (which are different
from board committees).
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/">Find a service</a>: listing
the purpose and value/benefits for each service, such as content
registration, metadata retrieval/APIs/Search, Crossmark, Similarity
Check, Grant Linking System, and some other quasi-services that require
members to develop or enable something, like reference linking or the
Open Funder Registry or ROR.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/">Documentation</a>:
following more-or-less our “managed member journey” pathway, this
includes getting set up, how to create DOI suffixes, how to select the
right tool for content registration, how to interpret the various
reports that members receive, what to expect in terms of invoicing,
schema library and best practices for metadata sharing incl. guidance on
principles to follow and sample XML files to edit. Each ‘service’ then
has it’s own documentation section too.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/about/">About</a>: governance,
including information about our board, committees, and bylaws. Financial
information and annual reports. Staff pages, org chart, jobs, and
policies incl. employee handbooks. History of Crossref and mission.
Under the sub-heading “Operations &amp; sustainability”, there is also
detailed information about membership processes such as revocations,
managing legal sanctions, membership best practices, and member
offboarding.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Additionally, the website hosts our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/">blog</a> and allows users to
sign up for our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/subscribe-newsletter/">newsletter</a>,
which are two key ways in which we keep our community informed.
</p>
<h3 id="project-overview">
Project overview
</h3>
<h4 id="end-goal">
End goal
</h4>
<p>
We want to allow our community to self-serve with information about what
Crossref does, how to become a member, how to use our tools, and how to
participate in our programs and services. The
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">Principles
of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a> are central to how we operate, and
we want the information about the how, what, and why of Crossref to not
only be openly available, but also easy to discover and reuse.
</p>
<p>
Visitors to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org" target="_blank">www.crossref.org</a>
should be offered the information that they are looking for quickly and
intuitively. A reduction in the number of help-desk tickets we receive
(in 2024 we answered 50,000 of them) would be an indication of an
improved self-service website, as would lower bounce rates.
</p>
<h4 id="scope-and-deliverables">
Scope and deliverables
</h4>
<p>
At the end of this information architecture review project, we expect to
have agreed on a set of recommendations for tackling the problem
statements laid out in the appendix of this document, as well as a plan
for how the recommendations should be implemented. This plan will form
the basis for an implementation project in 2026. We encourage
applications both from organizations who would also be comfortable
taking on the implementation project and from those who feel their
expertise is specific to the review project described herein.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, we expect the following deliverables:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Assessment of key user needs (through analytics and/or user interviews
incl. editors)
</li>
<li>
Audit and analysis of current site structure and how it serves key user
pathways
</li>
<li>
Recommendations for content re-architecture, navigation and search
improvements
</li>
<li>
Strategy for taxonomy and/or tagging system
</li>
<li>
Strategy for documentation site setup
</li>
<li>
Strategy for information pathways between website, docs, community
forum, ticketing systems
</li>
<li>
Recommended roadmap for 2026 implementation project
</li>
<li>
Nice to have: Wireframes or annotated sitemaps for future site layout
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="problem-statements">
Problem statements
</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>It is difficult to find information about our services</strong>.
Even Crossref staff often use search engines to find a page on our
website rather than navigating to it or using the built-in search on the
website. It’s often not clear whether the information you are looking
for is on the “Find a service” page or the “Documentation” page for a
given service, and there is no consistent cross-linking between the two
groups of pages. There is a search bar prominently placed on the home
page, but the search currently only looks for direct matches between the
search terms and page contents (with some declensions, stopwords, and
fuzziness to allow for typos). We have limited tracking available in
Algolia, but can see that in a 7-day span in March 2025, a large portion
of searches (78%) returned no results.
</li>
<li>
<strong>It is difficult to navigate our website</strong>. The home page
contains some quick links to key pages, but they are not very visible.
In order to navigate the website from the home page, users have to
expand a hamburger menu which takes up the whole page, and are then
presented with an overwhelming amount of options. Once users have left
the home page, the way they navigate depends on which section of the
website a user finds themselves in: all pages have breadcrumbs going
back to Home, while only Documentation pages have a hierarchical
sidebar. In order to switch between the basic groups of pages (<em>Get
involved</em>, <em>Find a service</em>, <em>Documentation</em>,
<em>About us</em>), users have to use the global hamburger menu.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Our home page doesn’t do a very good job of explaining who we
are and what we do</strong>. A lot of real estate is taken up by images
and recent news items without much context. Bounce rates from the home
page are high (65% as of March 2025).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Our user interfaces and reports are not easily accessible from
our website</strong>. While we are not a SaaS organization, there is an
established pattern of being able to access an organization’s services
directly from its website (often via a login button at the top right).
This is complicated by the fact that we don’t have one single frontend
“platform”. In fact we don’t have a single page linking out to the
various frontends and interfaces, nor do we have a consistent pattern of
linking out to an interface from the documentation page describing how
to use it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Some of the pages and grouping of pages are outdated and don’t
reflect our current priorities or ways of working anymore</strong>. For
example, the <em>Get involved</em> section still features <em>Special
programs</em> and <em>Service providers</em> quite prominently, but the
cross-functional programs that shape most of our strategic work now
(<em>Co-creation and Community Trends</em>, <em>Contributing to the
Research Nexus</em>, <em>Open and Sustainable Operations</em>,
<em>Metadata Development</em>) are not represented. <em>Find a
service</em> strongly suggests we’re a service provider, whereas most of
our services are enabling infrastructure, requiring members to build or
act on something. Some more recently created pages don’t fit neatly into
any of the current groupings: e.g., <em>API Learning Hub</em> can be

id="quality-control-automation-for-student-driven-digitization-workflows">Quality
Control Automation for Student Driven Digitization Workflows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>At Union College Schaffer Library, the digitization lab is mostly
staffed by undergraduates who only work a handful of hours a week. While
they do a great job, the infrequency of their work hours and lack of
experience results in errors in digitization and metadata. Many of these
errors are difficult to catch during quality control checks because they
are so minute, such as a missed counted page number here, or a
transposed character in a filename there. So, a Computer Science student
and a librarian collaborated to create a quality control automation
application for the digitization workflow. The application is written in
Python and relies heavily on using Openpyxl libraries to check the
metadata spreadsheet and compare metadata with the digitized files. This
article discusses the purpose and theory behind the Quality Control
application, how hands-on experience with the digitization workflow
informs automation, the methodology, and the user interface decisions.
The goal of this application is to make it usable by other students and
staff and to build it into the workflow in the future. This
collaboration resulted in an experiential learning opportunity that has
benefited the student’s ability to apply what they have learned in class
to a real-world problem.</p>

A Minimally Constrained Vocabulary for Work, Expression, Manifestation,

<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative has published a minimally
constrainted vocabulary for the concepts of Work, Expression,
Manifestation and Item (WEMI) that can support the use of these concepts
in metadata describing any type of created resources. These concepts
originally were defined for library catalog metadata and did not
anticipate uses outside of that application. Employment of the concepts
in non-library applications is evidence that the concepts are useful for
a wider variety of metadata users, once freed from the constraints
necessitated for the library-specific use.</p>

the Generative AI Wild West: Integrating Knowledge Graphs in Digital
Library Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Since the 17th century, scientific publishing has been
document-centric, leaving knowledge—such as methods and best
practices—largely unstructured and not easily machine-interpretable,
despite digital availability. Traditional practices reduce content to
keyword indexes, masking richer insights. Advances in semantic
technologies, like knowledge graphs, can enhance the structure of
scientific records, addressing challenges in a research landscape where
millions of contributions are published annually, often as
pseudo-digitized PDFs. As a case in point, generative AI Large Language
Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT and Meta AI’s LLAMA exemplify rapid
innovation, yet critical information about LLMs remains scattered across
articles, blogs, and code repositories. This highlights the need for
knowledge-graph-based publishing to make scientific knowledge truly FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). This article explores
semantic publishing workflows, enabling structured descriptions and
comparisons of LLMs that support automated research insights—similar to
product descriptions on e-commerce platforms. Demonstrated via the Open
Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) platform, a flagship project of the TIB
Leibniz Information Centre for Science &amp; Technology and University
Library, this approach transforms scientific documentation into
machine-actionable knowledge, streamlining research access, update,
search, and comparison.</p>

Information Literacy: Using Unity and Github to Collaborate on a Video
Game for the Library</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Gamification, as a way to engage students in the library, has been a
topic explored by librarians for many years. In this article, two
librarians at a small rural academic library describe their year-long
collaboration with students from a Game Design Program to create a
single-player pixel-art video game designed to teach information
literacy skills asynchronously. The project was accomplished using the
game engine Unity and utilizing GitHub for project management. Outlined
are the project’s inspiration, management, team structure, and outcomes.
Not only did the project serve to instruct, but it was also meant to
test the campus’ appetite for digital scholarship projects. While the
project ended with mixed results, it is presented here as an example of
how innovation can grow a campus’ digital presence, even in resistant
libraries.</p>

Language Models for Machine-Readable Citation Data: Towards an Automated
Metadata Curation Pipeline for Scholarly Journals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Northwestern University spent far too much time and effort curating
citation data by hand. Here, we show that large language models can be
an efficient way to convert plain-text citations to BibTeX for use in
machine-actionable metadata. Further, we prove that these models can be
run locally, without cloud compute cost. With these tools,
university-owned publishing operations can increase their operating
efficiency which, when combined with human review, has no effect on
quality.</p>

Alma: Simplifying Circulation Settings in the Alma Integrated Library
System (ILS)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code, in order
to make the code easier to maintain, without changing the behavior of
the software. Georgia Southern University is the product of a
consolidation of two separate universities in 2017. Before
consolidation, each predecessor university had its own cataloging
practices and software settings in the integrated library system (ILS) /
library services platform (LSP). While the machine-readable cataloging
(MARC) standard focuses on discovery, and descriptive search blended
well to support discovery, settings related to circulation were in
discord following the merger. Three busy checkout desks each had
different localized behaviors and requested additional behaviors to be
built out without centrally standardizing. Complexity stemming from
non-unified metadata and settings plus customizations implemented over
time for multiple checkout desks had ballooned to make for circulation
settings which were overly baroque, difficult to meaningfully edit when
a change to circulation practices was needed, and which were layered and
complex to such a degree that local standards could not be explained to
employees creating and editing library metadata. This resulted in
frequent frustration with how circulation worked, difficulty knowing
what was or wasn’t a software bug, and inability to quickly fix problems
once problems were identified or to make requested changes. During 2024,
the Georgia Southern University Libraries (University Libraries)
undertook a comprehensive settings clean up in Alma centered around
software settings related to circulation. This article describes
step-by-step how the University Libraries streamlined and simplified
software settings in the Alma ILS, in order to make the software
explainable and easier to manage, and all without impacting three busy
checkout desks during the change process. Through refactoring, the
University Libraries achieved more easily maintainable and explainable
software settings, with minimal disruption to day-to-day operations
along the way.</p>

Listening: Using Python and Apps Scripts to Text Mine and Tag Oral
History Collections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>This article presents a case study for creating subject tags
utilizing transcription data across entire oral history collections,
adapting Franco Moretti’s distant reading approach to narrative audio
material. Designed for oral history project managers, the workflow
empowers student workers to generate, modify, and expand subject tags
during transcription editing, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy and
discoverability of the collection. The paper details the workflow,
surveys challenges the process addresses, shares experiences of
transcribers, and examines the limitations of data-driven, human-edited
tagging.</p>

id="static-web-methodology-as-a-sustainable-approach-to-digital-humanities-projects">Static
Web Methodology as a Sustainable Approach to Digital Humanities
Projects</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>The web platforms adopted for digital humanities (DH) projects come
with significant short- and long-term costs—selecting a platform will
impact how resources are invested in a project and organization. As DH
practitioners, the time (or money paid to contractors) we must invest in
managing servers, maintaining platform updates, and learning
idiosyncratic administrative systems ultimately limits our ability to
create and sustain unique, innovative projects. Reexamining DH platforms
through a minimal computing lens has led University of Idaho librarians
to pursue new project-development methods that minimize digital
infrastructure as a means to maximize investment in people, growing
agency, agility, and long-term sustainability in both the organization
and digital outputs. U of I librarians’ development approach centered
around static web-based templates aims to develop transferable technical
skills that all digital projects require, while also matching the
structure of academic work cycles and fulfilling DH project needs. In
particular, a static web approach encourages the creation of
preservation-ready project data, enables periods of iterative
development, and capitalizes on the low-cost/low-maintenance
characteristics of statically-generated sites to optimize limited
economic resources and personnel time. This short paper introduces
static web development methodology (titled “Lib-Static”) as a
provocation to rethink DH infrastructure choices, asking how our
frameworks can build internal skills, collaboration, and empowerment to
generate more sustainable digital projects.</p>
