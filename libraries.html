      <h1>Metadata in editorial workflows</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Scholarly metadata, deposited by thousands of our members and made openly available <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/edg3w-7t592">can act as “trust signals” for the publications</a>. It provides information that helps others in the community to verify and assess the integrity of the work. Despite having a central responsibility in ensuring the integrity of the work that they publish, editorial teams tend not be fully aware of the value of metadata for integrity of the scholarly record. How can we change that?</p>
<p>Thousands of publishers and institutions from all over the world, big and small, are Crossref members, providing us rich metadata for their publications. <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/3b445-2zr32">During our discussion with the community on this topic</a>, it has surfaced that it is usually the technical or production teams, which interact closely with Crossref, where the appreciation of benefits and value of metadata remain confined.</p>
<p>Although editors may interact with some aspects of metadata when they screen manuscripts that come their way, it is not evident whether they see metadata as useful for signalling trust. In the last couple of years, we have been specifically engaging with editors, <a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/crossref-at-the-ismte-2025-annual-conference-editors-without-borders-breaking-silos-in-a-technological-world/14375">meeting them</a>, <a href="https://ease.org.uk/event/ease-germany-webinar-metadata-research-integrity-and-reproducibility/">speaking to them</a>, and <a href="https://www.csescienceeditor.org/article/scholarly-metadata-as-trust-signals-opportunities-for-journal-editors/">writing for them</a> on this topic. As next steps in this effort, we are now keen to engage with the diverse editorial community to understand where metadata fits in their workflows, and to identify opportunities for providing visibility to the importance of rich metadata.</p>
<p>To get a better grasp on this subject, I reached out to Christine Ferguson, to share her rich experience across many editorial roles with me, and to try and paint a better picture of the mutual gaps in understanding when it comes to publication metadata. Here’s what we discovered about the different editorial roles and some ideas for how Crossref might better engage with editors.</p>
<h2>We know that</h2>
<p>Our members come in all shapes and sizes, and that is also reflected in the diversity of editorial functions that may exist within their organisations. Some of our publishing members have editorial staff whose role is to screen submissions, which includes checking them to make sure that the manuscripts are formatted correctly, and have all the required information e.g. on ethics approvals, or ORCIDs (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) of authors. They then pass these manuscripts on to an external or an academic editor, who is usually a subject matter expert and is responsible for the editorial oversight of the content, to manage the rest of the peer review process, such as assessing the novelty and scope of the work, inviting and securing reviewers, and making a final decision on the manuscript. The academic editors make up a vast majority of the editorial community, variously serving as the editor-in-chief, section editors, and members of the editorial board. They usually volunteer their time as an editor, while having another primary job function.</p>
<p>Other publishers may have in-house editors who are subject matter experts themselves and manage the peer review process. Manuscripts can come to these editors after initial checks have been performed on them or the editors may also perform these checks, following which selected manuscripts undergo the peer review process.</p>
<p>Production editors assume responsibility for the manuscripts that are accepted. Their role is to make the manuscript production and publication ready, often liaising with the authors to finalise the formatting, and finally assigning it to an issue.</p>
<p>Then there are editorial roles that may be a combination of one or more of the above. The size and operational structure of an organisation may determine how editorial and other responsibilities are delegated within the organisation. For some of our medium or smaller members, it may be that the same individual or team is responsible for one or more tasks related to assessing the scientific content of the manuscript, managing the peer review process, as well as being in charge of the post-production workflows such as registering metadata with Crossref.</p>
<p>There are also emerging publishing workflows involving solicited peer-reviews of preprints or other types of works, which sometimes retain a form of editorial oversight.</p>
<p>In summary, editorial roles and responsibilities may vary quite a lot within our member organisations and we have less clarity about editorial roles and responsibilities within member organisations.</p>
<p>All of these different flavors of editors also interact with metadata at various stages in their workflows. For example, the title of the manuscripts, names of authors, whether they have ORCIDs and what is reflected in their ORCID records, and the abstracts may be used to assess the novelty and integrity of the work under consideration. The names of authors, especially if they are not known personally to the editor, can be verified in part by an ORCID check, ensuring the individuals exist, are affiliated to the organisations as claimed, that they have the relevant expertise to write or contribute to the manuscript, and to be able to find what they have written previously on the subject.
Making sure that whether all or some of the authors (e.g. the corresponding author) have provided their ORCIDs, or if the link to where the dataset has been deposited in a repository resolves correctly, is usually a part of the pre-screening or post-acceptance checklists. <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xxwy3-xhf38">As our recent metadata awardee, ASM has highlighted</a> that having this metadata can be hugely beneficial during the peer-review management process, such as for identifying conflicts of interest, to ensure data policy compliance, and even for carrying out systematic analyses.</p>
<h2>We’d like to know more about…</h2>
<p>whether all editors interact with metadata in their workflows, and whether they are sufficiently informed about the power of rich metadata. It is evident that there is a lot of diversity in editorial roles and functions. Editors, whether they are mostly concerned with scientific content or with the manuscript peer-review process, are closely connected to the researcher community and the latest research topics and trends. By virtue of this, they are in an excellent position to ascertain the important metadata elements most relevant in their scholarly community. If we have a better understanding of how editors are using metadata in their workflows, we’d be able to identify specific opportunities for engaging with this key community to create greater recognition of the role of metadata in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
<p>What we have in mind is to engage systematically with editorial community members and understand from them how, where, and which metadata are they using in their workflows. We’d like to do so by talking to editors who represent different Crossref members, perhaps in small groups, where participants will be able to share which metadata elements they interact with. We’d also like to share with them information about the use of metadata for research integrity. We’d like to understand whether they have been leveraging metadata in this context and the relevance of this information for them. Via this exercise, we hope to pick out some commonalities about the use of metadata in editorial workflows. Ultimately, we’d like to use this information to create resources that can be used for educating editors (and ultimately the researchers who submit their work for publication) about the importance of metadata, especially in signalling trust and preserving the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>

      <h1>Updating the Generative AI Product Tracker</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>In March 2024, Ithaka S+R released a tracker of generative AI products for higher education, along with an issue brief detailing our observations on the generative AI product landscape for postsecondary research, teaching, and learning activities. Since then, the list of products on the tracker has more than doubled in length and become more cumbersome for its many users. Today, we are launching a new version of our tracker that we believe will ensure its future value.</p>

      <h1>Crossref members over the years: a journey through space and time</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Crossref was created back in 2000 by 12 forward-thinking scholarly publishers from North America and Europe, and by 2002, these members had registered 4 million DOI records. At the time of writing, we have over 23,600 members in 164 different countries. Half of our members are based in Asia, and 35% are universities or scholar-led. These members have registered over 176 million open metadata records with DOIs (as of today). What a difference 25 years makes!</p>
<p>In our 25th anniversary year, I thought it would be time to take a look at how we got here. And so—hold tight—we’re going to go on an adventure through space and time<a href="#fn:1">1</a>, stopping every 5 years through Crossref history to check in on our members. And we’re going to see some really interesting changes over the years.</p>
<h2>2005</h2>
<p>Let’s go back twenty years to 2005. Crossref has been running for five years, and at this point, we have just 318 members from 31 countries, with 18 million DOI records already registered. These members and the Crossref infrastructure are supported by five Crossref employees based in just two countries—the US and the UK.</p>
<p>In 2005, the majority of our members are based in North America, Northern Europe and Western Europe, and they are mostly publishers or societies. <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/">Our sponsor program</a> doesn’t yet exist, so all members pay a membership fee directly to Crossref. Our membership fee structure is the same as it is today—we have tiered membership fees so our members can contribute to our infrastructure based on their capacity to pay. At this point, half of our members are eligible for our lowest fee tier.</p>
<h3>2005 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>318 members from 31 countries.</li>
<li>18 million DOI records registered.</li>
<li>Supported by five Crossref employees based in two countries - the US and the UK.</li>
<li>The majority (89%) are based in North America or Northern &amp; Western Europe.</li>
<li>Half are eligible for our lowest fee tier.</li>
<li>Mostly societies (40%) and publishers (33%).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2010</h2>
<p>Let’s move on by five years to 2010. By this stage, Crossref membership had grown to 1101 members from 69 countries, and these members have now registered 44 million DOI records. They are now supported by 14 Crossref employees, still all located in either the US or the UK.</p>
<p>We’re starting to see some changes in where our members are based. You’ll remember that back in 2005, 89% of Crossref members were based in North America, Northern Europe or Western Europe. By 2010, that percentage has dropped to 63%, and we’re seeing the number of members based in Asia starting to grow. In 2005, only 4% of our members were based in Asia, but by 2010, 18% of our members are based there, with 93 members in the Republic of Korea alone.</p>
<p>By 2010, the percentage of members who are eligible for our lowest fee tier has grown to 78%, so we are seeing smaller and less well-funded organisations starting to join. The types of organisations joining hasn’t changed significantly—members are still mostly societies and publishers. However, we are starting to see universities and scholar-led organisations beginning to join.</p>
<h3>2010 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>1,101 members from 69 countries.</li>
<li>44 million DOI records registered.</li>
<li>Supported by 14 Crossref employees based in two countries - the US and the UK.</li>
<li>Growth of members based in Asia (18%).</li>
<li>Smaller, less well-funded organisations starting to join - 78% eligible for our lowest fee tier.</li>
<li>Still mostly societies (37%) and publishers (28%), but universities and scholar-led members starting to emerge (23%).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2015</h2>
<p>Jumping ahead another five years to 2015, we see Crossref membership has grown to over 3,000 members from 93 countries, with registered DOI records exceeding 77 million. These members and the Crossref infrastructure are supported by 28 employees, still all based in the US and UK.</p>
<p>Membership in Asia has now really taken off, and Asian organisations now account for 38% of all Crossref members. We also see membership in Latin America emerging, representing 12% of our membership. We have members from 12 different countries in Latin America in 2015, but the most significant number are from Brazil, with 274 members.</p>
<p>Our formal Sponsor program started to emerge from 2012 onwards. Our Sponsor program supports members who are otherwise eligible for our lowest fee tier and provides financial, technical and language support to organisations that would otherwise face barriers to membership. By 2015, we have 26 sponsors in 14 countries, and 20% of all members are working with us through a Sponsor. This is one of the drivers behind smaller, less well-funded members joining Crossref. We really see a leap here in 2015 with over 90% of members now eligible for our lowest fee tier.</p>
<p>Around 2015, we also begin to see an interesting shift in the types of organisations that are becoming members. Increasingly, our new members are university-based, and that type of member organisation has overtaken the publisher group in number for the first time. However, societies still make up the largest number of members.</p>
<h3>2015 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>3,134 members from 93 countries.</li>
<li>77 million DOI records.</li>
<li>Supported by 28 Crossref employees based in two countries - US and UK.</li>
<li>Growth in Asia (38%) and members in Latin America (12%) starting to emerge.</li>
<li>Leap in smaller, less well-funded members - 92% eligible for the lowest fee tier.</li>
<li>Sponsor program emerges - 26 sponsors in 14 countries.</li>
<li>Rise of university and scholar-led members (29%) - overtaking publishers (21%). Societies (31%) are still the largest group.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2020</h2>
<p>Can you believe we’re already in 2020? Crossref now has almost 12,000 members in 133 countries, with registered DOI records totalling over 120 million! These members and the Crossref infrastructure are now supported by 43 employees across five countries, with Ireland, Germany, and France added to our staff locations.</p>
<p>Almost half of our members are based in Asia at this time, driven by growth from Indonesia, where we have 1681 members in 2020. Our sponsor program now contains 77 sponsors across 32 countries, including our first sponsor in North Africa.</p>
<p>We can now really see how membership is weighted towards smaller, less well-funded organisations: 97% of members are eligible for the lowest fee tier, and 57% choose to work with a sponsor.</p>
<p>By 2020, we also see a fundamental change in the types of organisations that are Crossref members. Societies no longer account for the largest share of our members, with both universities and publishers overtaking them. In 2016, we updated our schema to enable members to register records for preprints (and connect them to an article where relevant). By 2020, 65 members are registering preprints, and many preprint repositories have already become members.</p>
<h3>2020 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>11,976 members from 133 countries.</li>
<li>120 million DOI records.</li>
<li>Supported by 43 Crossref employees in five countries - France, Germany, Ireland, the UK, and the US.</li>
<li>46% of members based in Asia.</li>
<li>77 sponsors in 32 countries, first sponsor in N Africa.</li>
<li>Membership heavily weighted to smaller, less well-funded organisations - 97% eligible for the lowest fee tier and 57% working through a sponsor.</li>
<li>Universities and scholar-led are now the largest group (37%), followed by publishers (29%) and societies (24%).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2025</h2>
<p>And so we find ourselves back in the present day.</p>
<p>With such steady growth, it’s pretty easy to predict almost exactly how many members we will have by 31st December 2025. By year-end, we would expect to have 23,800 members in 164 countries, with registered DOI records totalling around 177 million. With recent hiring, these members and our infrastructure will be supported by 52 Crossref employees in 14 different countries.</p>
<p>Member organisations are now a real mix, with museums, hospitals, botanic gardens, banks, and many more joining. The largest proportion remains those at a university or scholar-led (35%), but interestingly, we see the percentage who consider themselves to be societies starting to fall (19%) and publishers starting to grow again (29%).</p>
<p>And we see the arrival of a new type of member - since the launch of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant Linking System</a> in 2019, we now see Research Funders joining Crossref in order to register identifiers for individual grants. These grant identifiers can then be included in the metadata for published content to uniquely identify the funding source, providing context and trust signals for the content, and fleshing out the Research Nexus. We currently have 45 funders who have registered over <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/607z6-1nh09">175,000 grant records</a>.</p>
<p>By 2025 we have 129 sponsors in 51 countries - including our first sponsors in East and West Africa who joined in 2024 and 2025 respectively. Half of all members are now based in Asia. 98% of members are now eligible for our lowest fee tier and 57% are working with us through a sponsor.</p>
<p>In 2023, we launched our Global Equitable Membership (GEM) program, which offers relief from any membership and content registration fees for organisations in the least economically advantaged countries in the world. We use the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) list as our data source for countries to include in the program. When we launched the program, 187 existing members moved under the program. Since the program’s focus is to enable participation for those who would otherwise find Crossref unaffordable, we are happy that we now have 583 organisational members in the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM Program</a>, showing the growth in participation from lower-income nations. Most members in the GEM Program are based in Southern Asia (48%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (33%).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/Location-GEM-members.png" alt="pie chart showing location of GEM members: Southern Asia (48.8%), Western Asia (4.8%), Northern Africa (1.9%), Sub Saharan Africa (33%), Latin America and the Caribbean (1.7%), Central Asia (4.5%), South Eastern Asia (3.8%)"></p>
<h3>November 2025 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>23,622 members in 164 countries.</li>
<li>175 million DOI records.</li>
<li>Supported by 52 Crossref employees from 14 countries - Armenia, Austria, Canada, Ecuador, Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong, Ireland, Kenya, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Spain, the UK, and the US.</li>
<li>51% of members are based in Asia.</li>
<li>129 sponsors in 51 countries - first sponsors in East and West Africa.</li>
<li>98% of members are eligible for the lowest fee tier, and 57% working through a sponsor.</li>
<li>Real mix of organisation types - universities and scholar-led (35%), publishers (29%), societies (19%), but also research funders, museums, pharmaceutical companies, news agencies, and more!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes over the years</h2>
<p>Here are some of that data over time, depicted in charts.</p>

<h2>2026 and beyond</h2>
<p>As you can see from our adventure through space and time, the types of organisations that work with Crossref have changed significantly over the years as the scholarly communications world has evolved. Our members now tend to be university-based research-performing organisations or scholar-led journals, based in Asia, and with low or zero publishing revenues (and volumes).</p>
<p>To meet our mission of a truly global and connected research ecosystem, it is essential to ensure that participation in Crossref and all our services and metadata is accessible to everyone involved in documenting scholarly progress.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that access to the Crossref infrastructure is equitable, so we are making two key changes in 2026: we’re extending eligibility for the GEM Program (more to follow), and we are introducing a new, lower-fee tier as an outcome of the RCFS projects <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10">more here</a>.</p>
<p>We’re excited to see how our members will change as we head into our next 25 years—we hope you’ll continue with us on our journey and welcome all kinds of new members to the expansive and vibrant Crossref community.</p>

<li>Technically, this is only an adventure through time. At the time of writing, we have no members based in space. Unless you count the European Space Agency, NASA, et al. <a href="#fnref:1">↩︎</a></li>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Our research shows that pursuing liberal educational experiences pays off. On average, students with greater exposure to liberal arts features achieve better academic outcomes without experiencing negative labor market returns. Since our findings are based on students enrolled in large public institutions, in this post we provide more targeted guidance on how to allocate their limited resources. To do so, we conducted additional analyses to examine whether the benefits of a liberal arts education vary across different groups of students.</p>

      <p>Rather than just bolting on AI to existing publication workflows,there is a real opportunity to rethink and redesign them for human–AI collaboration. Some thoughts on what that looks like in practice.</p>

      <h1>Crossref at the Frankfurt Book Fair 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>The Frankfurt Book Fair is the largest book fair in the world, and therefore a key event on our calendar. Held annually in Frankfurt, Germany, the 77th Frankfurt Book Fair (October 15–19, 2025) saw 118,000 trade visitors and 120,000 private visitors from 131 countries. The Crossref booth was located, as usual, in Hall 4.0 where all the stands with information about academic publishing can be found. Four Crossref colleagues attended the Book Fair this year, and in this blog post, you can read more about their meetings, experiences, and plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/fbm25booth.png" alt="photo of table with giveaways"></p>
<h3>First timer fun at the Frankfurt Fair - Helena</h3>
<p>Even though I’ve been working in scholarly comms for over 10 years, I’d never had a chance to visit the Frankfurt Book Fair. I was therefore really excited to have an opportunity to attend this year, and it didn’t disappoint! I arrived on Monday, October 13, in time for the STM dinner, which proved a great opportunity to meet with Crossref members and collaborators. On Tuesday, I attended the <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/events/stm-dinner-conference-2025-frankfurt/">STM conference</a> with the exciting theme of ‘The role of publishers in science diplomacy’. I think my favorite part of the day was the last panel, where the panelists realised that even though they represent different groups, in the end, they all have the same goals and are all working towards better science and dissemination.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, it was time to head over to our booth, where we prepared for the interesting conversations ahead. My meetings were mainly focused on collaborations in the area of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/research-integrity/">research integrity</a>, as Crossref plans to run pilots with potential partners next year. In-person meetings at the fair were a good opportunity to discuss in more detail which kinds of integrity checks could be useful to our members. I also had several meetings with organizations functioning as <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/service-providers/">Service Providers</a> –– depositing content on behalf of members –– who are eagerly awaiting the launch of our renewed Service Providers program next year. In these conversations, we shared our thinking about requirements for Crossref Service Providers and got input from organizations with experience serving our member community. Overall, it was a great opportunity to see members and collaborators in person, and I’ve already put the 2026 Frankfurt Book Fair in my calendar!</p>
<h3>An exciting comeback - Maryna</h3>
<p>If last year, I was a debutante at the Frankfurt Book Fair, 2025 marked an exciting comeback. It’s always a pleasure to spend time chatting with people you usually only meet through email or Zoom. Working remotely as part of a global team is something I truly value about Crossref, but it also makes those in-person moments even more special. You get to solve issues that have been sitting on your to-do list over lunch, brainstorm ideas while walking to the venue, get immediate advice in a meeting—and, of course, talk about dogs over dinner.</p>
<p>Frankfurt was busy but well organised. Our booth was lively with a mix of planned and spontaneous meetings. It was nice to reconnect with members and sponsors I’ve worked with over the years. We even gave an early look at the new <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/">Participation Reports</a> before the official release (what a thrill!). There were good conversations about <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/deprecating-co-access-crossref-plans-and-timelines/">deprecating co-access</a>, the importance of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/creating-and-managing-dois/transferring-responsibility-for-dois/">title transfers</a>, and how we can keep improving the member experience. One highlight: I spoke with a prospective member about our membership model and fee structure, and they joined the following week! Their account is already active, with a prefix assigned, which was great to see.</p>
<p>Another key topic was the importance of <a href="https://ror.org/">ROR IDs</a>. I talked with several publishers about how they could be implemented across other systems. At one point, I spotted an issue with unregistered DOIs and was able to fix it on the spot by finalising a title transfer—we’d had permission but never received the formal request—so it was satisfying to close that loop in real time.</p>
<p>Being a relatively small team serving a global membership of more than 23,000 and growing, it’s not possible to meet with every member face-to-face to respond to every question. Our team works hard to respond to all queries by email, but it’s undeniably faster and more productive in person. That’s why we keep returning to the Frankfurt Book Fair year after year—you can definitely count on seeing us again next year!</p>
<h3>Third time at bat - Luis</h3>
<p>The Frankfurt Book Fair is always an incredible opportunity to connect with our community. We come prepared with highlights of the year, plans for developments and upcoming releases, and remind the members we meet to participate and vote in the annual elections. But most of what we learn happens during the informal moments––meetings, drop-ins, and chats over coffee and tea––where people discuss what they’re working on, trends, and interests of the scholarly and publishing community.</p>
<p>This year, some of those conversations included meeting someone working with groups from Egypt and the UAE who are developing tools around our metadata. They wanted to talk through REST API use, recent Crossref updates, and how retraction metadata could fit into their systems. Another person opened their participation report with us and were surprised to see their metadata showing 0% despite the team believing they were sending complete metadata, which led to a discussion about getting their internal workflows running again.</p>
<p>Booth days always fly by, but they’re deeply informative and insightful for teams that participate in person, as we can “cross-check” (pun intended) how our different support mechanisms help the community and how well we’re delivering our communications. There is a good mix of problem-solving and catching-up; often, we see members who prepare a list of questions because they find it easier to sit and navigate through them with our support or membership colleagues. Sometimes it’s about refreshing their understanding of what Crossref is and what we do, especially during team changes. We also spoke with a publisher <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark">preparing to adopt Crossmark</a>. They wanted to check they were handling updates and relationships correctly, and mentioned that increasing transparency is becoming a priority for them. Someone else, working closely with a repository, asked about using the REST API or Metadata Plus to enrich their records.</p>
<p>A few visitors simply needed clarity––one was pleased to learn they could register reports and datasets after being told otherwise. Another visitor who registers a small number of book DOIs each year asked whether <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/web-deposit-form/">the Web Deposit Form</a> was still the best fit. We walked through the Record Registration Form together, and its new editing features helped them plan for upcoming changes.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy seeing the cultural and organisational diversity of existing and potential Crossref members, ambassadors, sponsors, allies and colleagues from all over the world at our booth. If you have the opportunity to attend the Book Fair next year, please visit our booth and say hello!</p>
<h3>This year’s Frankfurt Veteran - Paul</h3>
<p>I think this is my 5th (?) Frankfurt book fair,  and each year I come away thinking how much I appreciate the opportunity to speak with our members face to face, and I get to see and hear the impact that Crossref has, which is always such a pleasure.</p>
<p>This year, there were only four of us in attendance, and it felt busier than ever. We had a lot of pre-booked meetings at our wonderfully designed booth again (thanks to the amazing work of our colleague Rosa) but we also had lots of ad-hoc meetings, where members came up to say “hello”, “thank you” or ask about that really knotty, niche problem that they have, which they are not sure how to explain over email. From a technical support perspective, this is great, as we can go through these issues and get a resolution––or a solid background––without the delay and confusion of long email threads. I also worked with a member who got their IT department to send over a file there and then for us to work through and try to navigate a difficult question regarding reference matching and whether the <a href="https://doi.crossref.org/simpleTextQuery">simple text query form</a> worked using an API, which others could use. These were just two examples of many in which it was much easier to sit down and work through issues directly at the fair.</p>
<p>So I would always say that if you are at the Frankfurt book fair, and you have one of these issues then it is a great opportunity to come by, say hello and work through it with us. We will send out a reminder before the fair in 2026 to get any meetings booked, or just come find us at the fair.</p>
<p>A highlight for me this year was also showing some of our members our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/">new Participation Report</a>. It’s had a visual update as well as some new functionality: you can download a gap report that lists DOI numbers of records that are missing the metadata element you choose, making it easier to identify and update missing metadata. I always like attending the Frankfurt Book Fair and so might be there next year. It’s an important opportunity for all Crossref colleagues to engage and meet our members––many for the first time.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/fbm25-team.png" alt="photo of Paul, Maryna, Luis, and Helena at the table at the booth"></p>
<h3>Next year</h3>
<p>Feeling inspired after all the great meetings and conversations we had this year, we immediately started planning for next year! We’ll definitely be in Frankfurt in 2026, where you can find our team at the Crossref booth. We’re also planning to organize another roundtable on the Monday before the fair, so put October 5-9, 2026, in your calendars and stay tuned for more details.</p>
