      <h1>Innovation in scientific publishing and its implications for Crossref DOI registration practices - Request for input</h1>

(date: 2025-09-25)
      <p>
      <p><em>Lots of exciting innovations are being made in scientific publishing, often raising fundamental questions about established publishing practices. In this guest post, Ludo Waltman and André Brasil discuss the recently launched MetaROR publish-review-curate platform and the questions it raises about good practices for Crossref DOI registration in this emerging landscape.</em></p>
<p>Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique identifiers commonly assigned to research outputs such as journal articles, preprints, peer review reports, and datasets. The DOI of a research output allows the output to be identified online in a persistent way, even when the underlying publishing infrastructure changes (e.g., a journal moving from one publisher to another).</p>
<p>There are several DOI registration agencies. Most of the larger scientific publishers work with Crossref, and so do many preprint servers, and therefore our focus in this post is on Crossref. Crossref also keeps track of <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5_v2" target="_blank">metadata associated with research outputs</a>, such as the title, authors, and publication date of an output, and it makes this metadata openly available via APIs for all kinds of services to ingest and reuse. Because indexing, discovery, and evaluation tools rely heavily on this metadata, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/">content registration practices</a> and metadata design choices can have major effects on the visibility and findability of research outputs and on analytics used to monitor and assess research outputs and their contributors.</p>
<p>For the most common types of research outputs, such as journal articles and preprints, a broad consensus has emerged over the past decades on good practices for DOI registration. Such consensus means that articles are assigned the record type ‘article’ in their Crossref metadata. Likewise, many preprint servers register DOIs for preprints at Crossref, with the record type ‘preprint’ in the metadata. (The arXiv preprint server is an exception; it registers DOIs for preprints with DataCite rather than Crossref.)</p>
<p>For innovative new publication platforms, however, good practices for DOI registration are less clear. The approaches to scientific publishing offered by these platforms often do not fit neatly into established ways of working. For instance, for some of these platforms, the traditional distinction between peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals and non-peer-reviewed articles posted on preprint servers is no longer applicable. This raises fundamental questions about suitable DOI registration practices for new approaches to scientific publishing.</p>
<h2 id="metaror">MetaROR</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://metaror.org/" target="_blank">MetaROR (MetaResearch Open Review) platform</a>, launched in November 2024 by the Research on Research Institute (RoRI) and the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science (AIMOS), offers an example of the challenge of developing appropriate DOI registration practices for new publishing models.</p>
<p>Inspired by similar initiatives such as <a href="https://elifesciences.org/" target="_blank">eLife</a> and others, MetaROR adopts the so-called <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/h7swt" target="_blank">publish-review-curate model</a>. Authors first publish their article on a preprint server and then submit it to MetaROR. MetaROR then organizes an open peer review process for the article. Review reports are published on the MetaROR platform, along with a copy of the preprinted article and an editorial assessment. Rather than a simple binary decision (accept vs. reject), an editorial assessment is a short one-paragraph statement summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of an article. Each review report and each editorial assessment has its own DOI registered at Crossref. In this way, review reports are treated as first-class research outputs that can, for instance, be indexed in scientific literature databases and can be cited in other research outputs.</p>
<p>For an article submitted to MetaROR, the publication of the review reports, the editorial assessment, and a copy of the article itself concludes MetaROR’s publish-review-curate process. The authors of the article may revise their work in light of the feedback received, and MetaROR may review the revised article. However, there is no requirement that revisions must be made. The primary aim of the review reports and the editorial assessment published on the MetaROR platform is to offer context for readers of the article, helping readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the article.</p>
<h2 id="crossref-doi-registration">Crossref DOI registration</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/peer-reviews/" target="_blank">Registration of DOIs</a> for open peer review reports is <a href="https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-growth-of-open-peer-review" target="_blank">increasingly common</a>. By registering Crossref DOIs for review reports and editorial assessments, MetaROR enables reviewers and editors to be recognized for their contributions. But what about recognition for authors?</p>
<p>A crucial element in MetaROR’s philosophy is that authors of articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR deserve to be recognized in a similar way as authors of articles published in traditional peer-reviewed journals. One way to promote appropriate recognition for authors of articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR is to ensure that articles on the MetaROR platform, just like articles in peer-reviewed journals, <a href="https://www.openscience.nl/en/cases/the-metaror-publish-review-curate-model-our-experience-as-authors" target="_blank">have their own DOI</a>. While this may seem straightforward to arrange, it actually raises two non-trivial questions about good practices for Crossref DOI registration:</p>
<ol>
<li>For each article on the MetaROR platform, there is a corresponding article on a preprint server. Is it acceptable to have two Crossref DOIs, one registered by the preprint server and one registered by the MetaROR platform, for essentially the same article?</li>
<li>If Crossref DOIs are registered for articles on the MetaROR platform, should the articles be assigned the type ‘article’ or the type ‘preprint’ in their Crossref metadata, or something else entirely?</li>
</ol>
<p>On the first question, it could be argued that having <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xjgnq-a3p05" target="_blank">two Crossref DOIs for the same article</a> is problematic and that MetaROR, therefore, should not register DOIs for articles on its platform. Alternatively, one could argue that an article on the MetaROR platform differs in a meaningful way from the corresponding article on a preprint server, since the article on the MetaROR platform has been enriched with peer review reports and an editorial assessment, similar to the way an article in a peer-reviewed journal may be seen as an enriched version of the corresponding article on a preprint server. This line of reasoning would justify registering DOIs for articles on the MetaROR platform.</p>
<p>On the second question, the argument could be made that articles on the MetaROR platform should be assigned the type ‘preprint’ in their Crossref metadata, since the type ‘article’ is intended for articles in journals and MetaROR does not consider itself to be a journal (in fact, MetaROR works with <a href="https://cms.metaror.org/partner-journals/" target="_blank">partner journals</a> to enable articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR to be published in journals) and does not certify articles in the way journals do (i.e., MetaROR does not make accept/reject decisions). On the other hand, one could argue that articles on the MetaROR platform should be assigned the type ‘article’, since the peer-reviewed nature of articles in journals is typically seen as the key factor distinguishing these articles from articles on preprint servers. Articles on the MetaROR platform have been peer-reviewed, and in that sense, they resemble articles in journals. A third line of reasoning could be that neither the ‘preprint’ nor the ‘article’ type is fully appropriate for articles on the MetaROR platform and, consequently, that there is a need for a new Crossref record type.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-take">What is your take?</h2>
<p>The MetaROR team, in consultation with Crossref, will need to decide how to deal with the two questions discussed in this blog post. After some preliminary conversations between the MetaROR team and Crossref, we decided to share these questions more widely to solicit input from the broader community. We invite you to share your thoughts on the two questions, either by posting a comment on this blog post or by reaching out to us on social media or by email. Community perspectives will help shape good practices not only for MetaROR but also for other publish-review-curate initiatives facing similar questions. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

      <h1>Crossref and PKP enter new partnership phase to support richer and more inclusive metadata</h1>

(date: 2025-09-22)
      <p>
      <p>Crossref and the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) have been working closely together for many years, sharing resources and supporting our overlapping communities of organisations involved in communicating research. Now we’re delighted to share that we have agreed on a new set of objectives for our partnership, centred on further development of the tools that our shared community relies upon, as well as building capacity to enable richer metadata registration for organisations using the Open Journal Systems (OJS).</p>
<p>Crossref is working towards the vision of a rich and open network underpinning global scholarship, making relationships between works, people, institutions, and actions visible, thanks to the thread of metadata – the research nexus. This vision depends upon participation of research communication organisations coming from all parts of the world, disciplines, and languages. Working with PKP towards making tools for metadata registration more comprehensive, accessible, and easier to use is a big step towards supporting our community to participate in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">the research nexus</a>.</p>
<p>The renewed partnership has three main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developments to improve experience and support metadata registration workflows in OJS, bringing relevant functionalities together under the Crossref plug-in, and developing an OMP Crossref plug-in.</li>
<li>Joint community engagement in support of transitioning OJS users to the future Long-Term Support (LTS) version of OJS, which will enable richer metadata registration.</li>
<li>Creation of a PKP School self-paced training course for system administrators.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.59350/n3pa8-x3548" target="_blank">Crossref and PKP have a rich history of collaboration</a>, including previous investment in tools development in 2020, which resulted in some vital improvements to Crossref metadata management in OJS and a more streamlined experience for Crossref members on the platform, as well as many collaborative community events and training.</p>
<p>We know that thousands of Crossref members use OJS to register their metadata. Many are based in resource-constrained institutions, so the training provided by Crossref and PKP will be key to building their capacity to participate in the research nexus. With OJS 3.5 empowering organisations to register richer metadata, we look forward to opening up more opportunities for members to enhance their participation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At PKP, we’re excited to deepen our longstanding collaboration with Crossref, supporting our global community in amplifying the visibility and impact of their research through streamlined integration for robust metadata management. By working together on both technological innovation and capacity-building initiatives, we anticipate even greater outcomes that will strengthen open scholarship throughout the duration of this partnership and well into the future.” – said Kevin Stranack, PKP Director of Operations.</p>

      <h1>Beyond the Barista Myth</h1>

(date: 2025-09-19)
      <p>
      <p>When people discuss the value of a liberal arts degree, one stereotype often emerges: the humanities graduate working at a coffee shop. This trope is widely used, but it does not reflect the evidence. In reality, graduates with liberal arts degrees, as we define them, are employed across nearly every sector of the economy, and in jobs at all levels of earnings.</p>

      <h1>Raising the standard: GigaScience Press on metadata and discoverability</h1>

(date: 2025-09-17)
      <p>
      <p>To mark Crossref’s 25th anniversary, we launched our first Metadata Awards to highlight members with the best metadata practices.
<a href="https://www.gigasciencepress.org/" target="_blank">GigaScience Press</a>, based in Hong Kong, was the leader among small publishers, defined as organisations with less than USD 1 million in publishing revenue or expenses. We spoke with Scott Edmunds, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief at GigaScience Press, about how discoverability drives their high metadata standards.</p>
<h3 id="what-motivates-your-organisationteam-to-work-towards-high-quality-metadata-what-objectives-does-it-support-for-your-organisation">What motivates your organisation/team to work towards high-quality metadata? What objectives does it support for your organisation?</h3>
<p>Our objective is to communicate science openly and collaboratively, without barriers, to solve problems in a data- and evidence-driven manner through Open Science publishing. High-quality metadata helps us address these objectives by improving the discoverability, transparency, and provenance of the work we publish. It is an integral part of the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR principles</a> and UNESCO Open Science Recommendation, playing a role in increasing the accessibility of research for both humans and machines. As one of the authors of the FAIR principles paper and an advisor of the <a href="https://makedatacount.org/" target="_blank">Make Data Count</a> project, I’ve also personally been very conscious to practice what I preach.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-a-strategy-for-complete-metadata-which-elements-did-you-prioritise-what-workflows-tools-or-collaborations-helped-you-get-there">Do you have a strategy for complete metadata? Which elements did you prioritise? What workflows, tools, or collaborations helped you get there?</h3>
<p>We’ve been privileged to work with our technical partners at <a href="https://rivervalley.io/" target="_blank">River Valley Technologies</a>, and the novel XML-first publishing platform they have developed has made it particularly easy to integrate and collect persistent identifiers and other metadata, embedding it into the resulting rich-XML. As Open Access advocates, licensing and machine readability were early focuses when launching our journals. We ensured that we provided a text and data mining portal, allowing bulk downloads of our content to encourage reuse. Many specific metadata elements highlighted by the FAIR principles and <a href="https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546#:~:text=The%20UNESCO%20Recommendation%20on%20Open,openly%20available%2C%20accessible%20and%20reusable" target="_blank">UNESCO Open Science</a> recommendations, and so these have also helped guide what should be prioritised. If there’s one specific tool to mention, we’ve been big fans of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reports/participation-reports/" target="_blank">Crossref participation reports</a>, as this has helped highlight what is missing and what we need to improve upon.</p>
<h3 id="how-have-you-integrated-these-into-your-metadata-processes">How have you integrated these into your metadata processes?</h3>
<p>The participation reports, in particular, have been useful for this, and by regularly checking them, we’ve managed to spot when processes have broken, for example. When you’ve added new fields to the reports like <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR IDs (Research Organization Registry)</a>, this has also motivated us to prioritise integrating these, so having a curated list of metadata fields like this definitively helps users focus on what should be the most important. River Valley Technologies has been very responsive to this type of feedback, and being able to see the participation report data in real-time has helped drive them to fix and update our metadata. So I thank them for being so patient and quick to respond to our very demanding standards.</p>
<h3 id="what-impact-of-good-metadata-can-you-see-for-your-organisation">What impact of good metadata can you see for your organisation?</h3>
<p>From an Editorial side, our technical partners at River Valley Technologies have found having this metadata information available very useful in the Research Integrity tools they have developed and integrated into our publication platform. Things like <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID IDs</a>, RORs, and other identifiers are very useful for tracking provenance and increasing trust.</p>
<p>From a business side, putting the effort into collecting rich metadata has paid off in the long run by making it easier to integrate our publishing data into new platforms. Making it easier and quicker to integrate and track our data via <a href="https://oaswitchboard.org/" target="_blank">OA Switchboard</a>, for example. It also helps us more easily mirror and list our content in indexes like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/" target="_blank">PMC</a>, <a href="https://www.scopus.com/" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>, and others.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-encountered-any-challenges-in-curating-or-improving-your-metadata">Have you encountered any challenges in curating or improving your metadata?</h3>
<p>One of the main metadata areas that has currently let us down, funding and registries, is because our publishing model is so affordable. The automated production processes from RVT&rsquo;s novel publishing platform have allowed us to publish very cost-effectively (the APC of GigaByte is $535). We’ve also received sponsorship from the WHO to publish a series of public health papers, particularly supporting authors from the Global South who may not have sources of funding listed in these registries. Because of this, we’ve published numerous papers from independent researchers, students, and self-financed projects that may not have funding IDs or grant numbers. We’d like to push to get “unfunded” counted as a metadata field to address this.</p>
<h3 id="have-your-efforts-regarding-metadata-yielded-tangible-benefits-for-your-community-is-this-something-your-editors-authors-or-readers-are-aware-of-and-appreciate-if-so-why">Have your efforts regarding metadata yielded tangible benefits for your community? Is this something your editors, authors, or readers are aware of and appreciate? If so, why?</h3>
<p>We’d like to think our authors find this useful, but we’ve not had any specific feedback on this. Our readers, both human and machine, should hopefully appreciate finding our work more easily, and from a purely selfish perspective, should get us higher access and citations. This is difficult to measure, but as evidence nerds, we have <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/xv7tk" target="_blank">attempted to conduct RCTs</a> examining this for Data Citations. One anecdote I can give is about the author who told us they pasted their paper into ChatGPT and asked it which was the best journal for their work, and it suggested our journal. I’d like to think that putting in this effort in making our papers more machine-readable and comprehensible pays off at times like this to make the discoverability and visibility of our journals greater.</p>
<h3 id="looking-ahead-how-are-you-planning-to-build-on-your-metadata-quality-are-there-new-elements-or-practices-youre-exploring-and-what-advice-would-you-give-to-others-just-starting-to-strengthen-their-metadata">Looking ahead, how are you planning to build on your metadata quality? Are there new elements or practices you’re exploring? And what advice would you give to others just starting to strengthen their metadata?</h3>
<p>We still need to update older content with RORs, and improve it for the datasets
linked to our papers. To do this, we’ve had interns working to improve our <a href="https://datacite.org/" target="_blank">DataCite</a> metadata.</p>
<p>We encourage others to think about metadata issues when setting up their workflows. While it may seem like additional work, it will be increasingly important to future-proof and get journals ready for our increasingly AI-centric age. And as we show here, we can more easily carry out important tasks like getting your content more quickly and widely indexed and disseminated.</p>
<p>Strong metadata ties open science, integrity, and discoverability together. GigaScience Press shows how consistent identifiers, machine-readable formats, and continuous checks deliver real benefits. As discovery becomes more AI-assisted, the priority is clear: keep metadata complete, open, and usable.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Adult learners are frequently overlooked, but are an increasingly important student population. According to a recent report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, there are 37.6 million adult learners under 65 with some college credit, but no credential in the US and this number is increasing. In response to this challenge, Ithaka S+R is working across the United States to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pathways for returning adult learners.</p>

      <h1>A second look at Crossref's carbon footprint - the 2024 report</h1>

(date: 2025-09-15)
      <p>
      <p>In 2022, we wrote a blog post <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/bnv9r-q8f86" target="_blank">“Rethinking staff travel, meetings, and events”</a> outlining our new approach to staff travel, meetings, and events with the goal of not going back to ‘normal’ after the pandemic and said that in the future we would report on our efforts to balance online and virtual events, work life balance for staff, and track our carbon emissions. In December 2024, we wrote a blog post, <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/jjr25-es246" target="_blank">“Summary of the environmental impact of Crossref,”</a> that gave an overview of 2023 and provided the first report on our carbon emissions. Our report on 2023 only just made it into 2024, so we are happy to report on 2024 a little sooner in the year.</p>
<p>On the positive side, there are a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our spending on travel and meetings (a proxy for emissions) in 2024 was 56% of what it was in 2019, keeping below the target of not more than 60% of our 2019 spend</li>
<li>We were better at tracking hotel nights in 2024 compared to 2023</li>
<li>We managed to balance in-person, regional, and online meetings to engage with our global community while still not having returned to the pre-pandemic “normal”</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, our approach means thinking carefully about how to make the most of each trip. For example, when organising our Crossref Jakarta event, we travelled via Singapore and used the opportunity to meet with members there. Once in Jakarta, we combined our two-day event with an OJS workshop with colleagues from PKP, and another event with Universitas Indonesia. Similarly, when our colleague travelled by train to a conference in Amsterdam, they combined it with a day of visits to members in the area. These kinds of combinations reduce the need for separate trips and maximise the value of in-person travel.</p>
<p>Some of the less positive things were:</p>
<ul>
<li>As our membership continues to grow globally and we expand our staff, (which are both great things in themselves), our emissions have also increased. Not only do we have more staff, but some staff travelled more in 2024 than in 2023. We’ll keep a close eye on this to avoid ever-increasing travel.</li>
<li>Taking a train instead of flying can take longer, and clashes with our desire for staff needing to be away from home as little time as possible.</li>
<li>It is difficult to find reliable data for some calculations - for example, we have decided not to try to calculate the impact of our Zoom use because there is no reliable way to do this.</li>
<li>We don’t have good options for offsetting our emissions, and it’s unclear whether we would want to do this even if they were available.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the issue of whether it is worth it, or possible, to collect certain data, or whether it would change what we do. An example is Zoom. The estimate for the emissions from Zoom meetings in 2024 was 100 kg (that’s kilograms, not tonnes), but the calculations were made using a tool from 2020 that made many assumptions and estimates. We have no way of verifying whether the tool we used is accurate, so we decided not to update our previous calculation. In any case, we aren’t going to ration or reduce our teleconferencing, since it’s an essential tool, and especially if we want to fly less, have fewer in-person meetings, and operate effectively as a distributed organisation in multiple countries with no offices.</p>
<p>In summary, our total reported carbon emissions increased 40% from 105 tCO2e in 2023 to 147 tCO2e in 2024 (see below for the details). The positive aspect of this is that the increase is partly due to our improved ability to track our travel and hotel stays. The more concerning side of this is that we are travelling more. This enables us to engage with our growing community. We are still thinking strategically about our travel and meetings, following the approach outlined in our 2022 blog post. However, we need to carefully consider air travel in 2026, as it is our largest source of emissions (93%).</p>

</table>
<p>In 2024, we met the target of keeping our travel expenses below 60% of our 2019 level. In 2025, we will exceed this. There are a number of reasons for this. We have more staff, more members, inflation has been high, and we are subsidising a lot more travel for others, such as our ambassadors, speakers, and collaborators at local events, and some board members (since 2019, we reduced from three to one in-person board meeting per year). This aligns with our goals of inclusivity for Crossref meetings, but we have to recognise there is a trade-off. The cost of travel, particularly airfare, has increased since 2019. Using US Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2019 to 2025 the inflation multiplier for a dollar is 1.26 so adjusted for inflation the comparison figure for 2025 spending is $737,000 and forecasted 2025 spending is 60% of this. While we use cost as a proxy for travel volume, now that we’re better at tracking actual carbon emissions, we can try to set targets of keeping under a certain carbon tonne equivalent total instead of (only) a financial target.</p>
<h2 id="total-carbon-emissions-for-2024">Total Carbon Emissions for 2024</h2>
<p>Our total reported carbon emissions increased 40% from 105 tCO2e in 2023 to 147 tCO2e in 2024. In 2023, we didn’t report on the estimated emissions from hotel stays, but for 2024, we have. We recorded 415 hotel nights in 2024 for 4 tCO2e using an average of Europe/US hotel per night emissions estimates <a href="https://circularecology.com/news/the-carbon-emissions-of-staying-in-a-hotel" target="_blank">(Circular Ecology)</a>. The most carbon-intensive activity was flying. There were about 215 flights in 2024, accounting for emissions of 138 tCO2e - 93% of our total. Crossref staff and community members we covered took 88 train journeys with carbon emissions of .47 tCO2e - so the more travel by train, the better, but this isn’t always possible or feasible. We haven’t included estimates of the impact of home working (Crossref is fully distributed), but we have an initial estimate below and will look to improve this analysis for the 2025 analysis and going forward.</p>
<h2 id="estimate-of-carbon-footprint-for-distributed-staff">Estimate of carbon footprint for distributed staff</h2>
<p>Crossref is fully distributed with staff in 11 countries. We used Claude from Anthropic to calculate the emissions from home working for our staff in 2024 and asked for sources to be cited. It provided some approaches for how to go about the calculations but the results were not reliable - for our 46 staff in 10 countries (this is for 2024 - we now have 49 staff in 11 countries) estimates ranged from 5 tCO2e to 28 tCO2e depending on various assumptions such as whether to account for the grid intensity of the countries where staff are based <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/carbon-intensity-electricity" target="_blank">(Our World in Data has grid intensity figures)</a> and what estimate is used for the amount of energy an employee working from home uses each day. <a href="https://circularecology.com/news/the-carbon-emissions-of-homeworking-and-office-working" target="_blank">Circular Ecology</a> uses UK DEFRA figures to come up with 2.67 kgCO2e/day for home working. So a simple calculation of 46 staff working 230 days per year arrives at the 28 tCO2e amount. This is much less than the equivalent figure for office-based work, which is 70 tCO2e. A number of things aren’t factored into these calculations: staff with green energy tariffs, staff with solar panels and home batteries, or other renewable energy sources, and the different needs for heating and air conditioning in different countries.</p>
<p>We decided not to include these figures in our overall emissions for 2024, but we are looking at a more reliable way to estimate this for 2025. However, we need to consider what we would do with the information and whether we would, or could, do anything to reduce this.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-services">Hosting services</h2>
<p>We use AWS for hosting our REST APIs, Metadata Search, and the website. In 2024, our main metadata registry was in a data centre in Massachusetts, which is not included in our calculations. In July 2025, we transitioned fully to AWS, so from 2025 onwards, our emissions from AWS will be higher and will encompass our entire system.</p>
<p>In 2023, Amazon reports Crossref’s carbon emissions were 0.216 tCO2e compared with 0.266 tCO2e in 2022. In 2024, emissions were 0.132 tCO2e.</p>
<p>Compared to travel, the footprint from AWS is minimal.</p>
<h2 id="online-meetings">Online meetings</h2>
<p>As a distributed, remote-first organisation, Crossref is a heavy Zoom user––it’s essential for staff and for engaging with our community. However, Zoom doesn’t provide tools or estimates of the carbon impact of Zoom meetings. We used a tool last year to provide an estimate, but we aren’t confident it’s accurate or meaningful. The tool was built in 2020 and made a lot of assumptions and guestimates.</p>
<h2 id="tools-we-used">Tools we used</h2>
<p>To calculate emissions for flights and train journeys, we chose to use <a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx" target="_blank">Carbon Calculator</a>. For hotel stays and home working estimates, we used <a href="https://circularecology.com/news/the-carbon-emissions-of-staying-in-a-hotel" target="_blank">Circular Ecology</a>. For AWS, we used the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-customer-carbon-footprint-tool/" target="_blank">Customer Carbon Footprint Tool (CCFT)</a> provided by AWS.</p>
<h2 id="offsetting">Offsetting</h2>
<p>We don’t offset our emissions from travel or other operations and don’t have plans to do this. Offsetting emissions is problematic in a number of different ways, so we don’t feel confident in doing it.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>In general, it feels good to have had a few years of tracking this, learning more, finding the right tools, and trying to stick to a target to limit our increases. While of course there are always reasons for the target to increase—as we grow and are able to subsidise others beyond our staff more—we remain committed to not just monitoring our carbon spend but also maintaining it at a reasonable level and finding ways to limit and mitigate our impact on the environment. This kind of sustainability isn’t included in the POSI Principles for open scholarly infrastructures, but we’d love to see other similar organisations share their tips and measurements so that, as a community, we can learn how to do even better.</p>

      <h1>Deprecating co-access: Crossref plans and timelines</h1>

(date: 2025-09-11)
      <p>
      <p>To date, there are about 100 Crossref members who have made use of our co-access service for one or more of their books. The service was designed to be a last-resort measure when multiple parties - book publishers, aggregators, and other members - had rights to register book content. Unfortunately, the service allowed members to register multiple DOIs for shared books and book chapters, thereby violating our own core tenet of one DOI per content item. We should not have created a service that violated that tenet, resulting in duplicate DOIs. As we are able to offer an alternative in the form of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/creating-and-managing-dois/multiple-resolution/">multiple resolution service</a>, it is time to switch co-access off. Among other benefits – for the publisher and the authors, creation of a single DOI for each item, regardless of where it might be hosted, will result in more accurate citation counts and usage statistics. We’re retiring co-access at the end of 2026.</p>
<h3 id="an-idiom-to-start">An idiom to start</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s an idiom used in technology circles called &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank">eating your own dog food</a>.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s used to describe an organization that tests or uses its own products in the real world. I&rsquo;m no developer and only have a handful of years of exposure to this phrase, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to work it into one of my blog posts. The visceral reactions I have observed when it&rsquo;s been used on internal calls are just too tempting. That, and I think it applies to our own rollout of and missteps with a service we call co-access. The decision to enable co-access reflected the priorities of that period, but we can now improve on it with an upgraded multiple resolution service. That rickety footing for co-access doomed it from the start. Now&rsquo;s the time to face the music and swallow our own kibble.</p>
<p>Always meant as a last-resort measure, co-access allows multiple Crossref members to register metadata for shared book and book chapter content. Thus, use of co-access results in multiple, duplicate DOIs registered for the same book content. There are well over 500,000 DOIs in co-access within our corpus today. At least half of those are duplicates (more on this below).</p>
<p>This is far from ideal and has adverse consequences for the integrity of the scholarly record and the community. As we are able to offer an alternative in the form of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/creating-and-managing-dois/multiple-resolution/">multiple resolution service</a>, it is time to switch co-access off.</p>
<p>Among other benefits &ndash; for the publisher and the authors, creation of a single DOI for each item, regardless of where it might be hosted, will result in more accurate citation counts and usage statistics.</p>
<h3 id="duplicate-dois">Duplicate DOIs</h3>
<p>We frequently receive questions from members, metadata users, and others in the community, like <a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/duplicate-dois-keep-being-minted/3554" target="_blank">this one</a>, asking us what we are doing to combat the very real problem of registration and propagation of duplicate DOIs. We do <a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/the-problem-with-duplicate-dois-and-how-you-can-help/2634" target="_blank">take measures</a> to prevent the registration of duplicate DOIs, including flagging registration of potential duplicate records to our members using what we call conflicts and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reports/conflict-report/">conflict reports</a>. As you might expect, this has been a sensitive topic for us, because we have one glaring service, yes, co-access, that has been actively exacerbating the issue of duplicate DOIs.</p>
<p>So, while we have been actively trying to counter the rise of duplicate DOIs, co-access enabled duplicate registrations of book DOIs. For every prefix that we configured for the service, we knew we were contributing to the problem (<a href="https://doi.org/10.21428/785a6451.fb6181fd" target="_blank">our members noticed too</a>. As I said above, co-access allows multiple members to register their own DOI for shared book content. That means that book content in co-access has at least two DOIs registered. In some cases, there is book content with five or more registered DOIs for a single book. That&rsquo;s a great many duplicates that this service is responsible for.</p>
<h3 id="replacing-co-access">Replacing co-access </h3>
<p>We plan to replace co-access with an existing tool, multiple resolution, which allows for more than one resolution URL to be registered to a single DOI. A user resolving the DOI is presented with an <a href="https://doi.org/10.54675/cklg5881" target="_blank">interim page</a>, allowing them to choose from the various content sources registered with this DOI. We&rsquo;ve made some <a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/upcoming-changes-to-multiple-resolution-and-co-access-templates/3908" target="_blank">progress</a> toward making multiple resolution simpler for members to implement, but we still have more to do.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/multiple-resolution-ui.png"
alt="Screenshot of multiple resolution UI" width="100%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>We&rsquo;re aware that the technical steps involved in adopting multiple resolution might present a barrier to implementation for some of our members. To help with the transition, we are working on a basic tool (currently in beta) that simplifies the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/creating-and-managing-dois/multiple-resolution/#00118">process</a>. We will make it available to members between now and the middle of 2026.</p>
<h3 id="our-timeline">Our timeline</h3>
<p>We are not going to make these changes tomorrow. We&rsquo;re going to give members who have been using co-access time to adjust. Right now, we trigger co-access when a secondary DOI is registered by a secondary registrant (member) that: 1) is already in a co-access group within our system with the DOI prefix that registered the original DOI, 2) has at least one shared ISBN with the metadata of that original DOI, and 3) has a title (in the title element of the book or chapter XML) that exactly matches the title of the original DOI. We&rsquo;re going to stop triggering co-access for book and book chapter registrations <strong>starting 2026 July 1</strong>. No new DOIs will be placed in co-access starting then.</p>
<p>From there, there will be six months to clean up records already in co-access. One definitive DOI should be selected by the parties in a co-access group; the DOIs that will no longer be maintained for those books and book chapters should be aliased to the primary (definitive) DOI that will be maintained going forward. The primary DOI should be the DOI used on all landing pages for that book (or, book chapter).</p>
<p>In January 2027, if co-access DOIs have not been aliased to one another, we will force alias the DOIs in the record to the DOI registered by the organization identified as the publisher in the metadata records already in our system. At any point in this timeline, our team will be happy to help with the registration of secondary URLs in order to move books from co-access to multiple resolution. As a result, we will encourage members, end users, and the broader community to move back to using a single, definitive source of truth for these books and book chapters.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-registration-of-books-and-book-chapters-look-like-post-co-access">What will registration of books and book chapters look like post-co-access?</h3>
<p>Coordinated. We expect that our members and their publishing partners will define the single DOI for each book and book chapter well upstream of Crossref, so all entities and their systems will use that one definitive DOI.</p>
<p>As for the registration process and our system, the first member to register the book (and its ISBNs) will establish the DOI for that book and its chapters. Following attempts to register the same content, with a duplicate book-level DOI(s), will fail the registration. Multiple DOIs for the same book or book chapter should be avoided starting <strong>2026 July 01</strong>, as we will no longer be able to place books and book chapters into co-access.</p>
<p>We believe this will result in increased cited-by and usage metrics for that single DOI, and a cleaner, more accurate scholarly record.</p>

      <h1>Celebrating one year of Crossref Grant IDs at NWO</h1>

(date: 2025-09-09)
      <p>
      <p>This month marks one year since the Dutch Research Council (NWO) introduced grant IDs—an important milestone in our journey toward more transparent and trackable research funding. We created over <a href="https://api.crossref.org/members/47652/works?" target="_blank">1,600 Crossref Grant IDs</a> with associated metadata. We are beginning to see them appear in publications. These early examples show the enormous potential Grant IDs have. They also highlight that publishers could extend their efforts to improve the quality of funding metadata of publications.</p>
<h2 id="the-promise-of-grant-linking">The promise of grant linking</h2>
<p>For decades, funders have struggled with a seemingly simple challenge: tracking the research outputs that arise from their funding. The traditional approach—requiring grantees to cite their grants in acknowledgement sections of their papers—has all kinds of problems. Authors make many errors in providing this information, and even when funding organizations and schemes are cited correctly, there is no guarantee that a grant number is globally unique and not already in use by another funding council in the world.</p>
<p>To address these issues, and in collaboration with the research funding community, Crossref introduced the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/" target="_blank">Grant Linking System (GLS)</a> six years ago. The system allows funding organizations to assign globally unique and persistent identifiers to their grants, but - more importantly - the system allows connecting these grants with the outputs arising from them. The vision is straightforward: authors include Grant IDs (which are Crossref DOIs) in the funding acknowledgements of their research articles. Publishers either take these IDs from the acknowledgement or proactively ask authors for these IDs in their submission system. Next, when a publisher registers their publication with Crossref, it includes the grant identifier in the metadata of that publication, creating an unambiguous link between the publication and the grants from which the research was funded.</p>
<p>This last step—including the Grant ID in the metadata of the article when registering the publication with Crossref—is a crucial part of the system as it enables anyone to automatically retrieve all publications arising from a given grant over time via the Crossref API. Funding organizations interested in tracking the impact of their funding could then stop asking their grantees to manually report on the outputs of their funding, as most still do today. Instead, this information would become open data that funding organizations harvest directly themselves, reducing administrative burden on researchers while enhancing the ability to track the impact of their funding.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xqr28-ee750" target="_blank">Robert Kiley</a>, former head of Open Research at the Wellcome Trust, which piloted the GLS in 2018, put it: &ldquo;&hellip;if every funder were to adopt such a system and expose their grant metadata in a consistent, machine-readable way, it would facilitate the development of applications to help funders get a greatly enhanced picture of the global funding landscape, which in turn would inform strategic planning and resource allocation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="nwos-implementation-journey">NWO&rsquo;s implementation journey</h2>
<p>NWO joined Crossref&rsquo;s Grant Linking System in 2024. It reflects our broader commitment to open science and aligns with our <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4674512" target="_blank">Persistent Identifier Strategy</a> published in 2021, and our support for the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information</a>. Since August 2024, all new grants awarded from July 2024 onward receive a Crossref Grant ID that persistently resolves to the information about the grant on our website, displaying all basic award information including project titles, summaries, grantee names, and affiliations. NWO is <a href="https://api.crossref.org/types/grant/works?facet=publisher-name:*&amp;rows=0" target="_blank">one of the 44 funding organizations</a> worldwide that have introduced Crossref Grant IDs for their collective <a href="https://api.crossref.org/types/grant/works?facet=funder-name:*&amp;rows=0" target="_blank">111 funding programs</a>. Other organizations include the European Commission, OSTI-DOE, the Wellcome Trust, Moore Foundation, Fonds de Recherche du Québec, CSIRO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, and the <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/news/detail/neue-identifikations-nummer-fuer-fwf-projekte" target="_blank">Austrian Science Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Although it took time, implementation at NWO in general proceeded smoothly. Over the course of a year, we&rsquo;ve registered <a href="https://api.crossref.org/members/47652/works?" target="_blank">over 1,500 grant records</a> without experiencing difficulties or complaints from researchers. On the contrary, after we announced the introduction of Grant IDs, some researchers expressed disappointment on our decision—for practical reasons—to only register DOIs for new grants instead of the entire historical record. This shows that researchers understand the importance of persistent identifiers. Already, a year after its introduction, we are seeing the first NWO Grant IDs appearing in publications— showing that researchers are taking the extra step to look up their Crossref Grant ID and include it in their articles, <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/acknowledgement-in-publications" target="_blank">as we are asking them to do</a>.
However, publishers don’t always manage to handle these identifiers in the way we expect them to.</p>
<h2 id="linking-grants-to-publications-in-real-life">Linking grants to publications in real life</h2>
<p>One of the first publications to include an NWO Grant ID is a paper by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021080" target="_blank">Weile et al.</a>, published by the American Physical Society (APS) in the journal Physical Review X. On the left, we see the funding information provided by the authors, as included in the acknowledgement section of the published article. Funding by NWO from its Talent Scheme VIDI is identified with a Grant ID <a href="https://doi.org/10.61686/YDRHT18202" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.61686/YDRHT18202</a>.</p>

<p>On the right, we see how APS has included this information <a href="https://api.crossref.org/works/https://www.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021080" target="_blank">in the metadata</a> of the publication: NWO is identified with its Funder ID and the grant with the Grant ID - forging an unambiguous link between funding and publication, initially between this particular grant and this particular publication, but potentially in the future between this grant and all other outputs arising from it. This works so long as all publishers include this information in the metadata of their publications; we need to encourage more publishers and other Crossref members (e.g., preprint services, repositories, blog platforms) to follow the APS example and do the same.</p>
<h2 id="where-publishers-fall-short">Where publishers fall short</h2>
<p>There are big differences among publishers in their ability to include funding metadata. Many have been including funder IDs in the metadata for more than a decade, but some are still struggling to do that. Most are yet to catch up to start including Crossref Grant IDs, too.</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate that in an example. On the left, we see the acknowledgements section of a paper by <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202502496" target="_blank">Van Zundert et al</a>. in the journal Small, published by Wiley. The authors acknowledge a host of funding organizations and grants, including NWO with Grant ID <a href="https://doi.org/10.61686/LVZRW92421" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.61686/LVZRW92421</a>. On the right, we see that the publisher has correctly included NWO <a href="https://api.crossref.org/works/https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202502496" target="_blank">in the metadata</a> as the funder with our Funder ID, but there’s no reference to our Grant ID, instead mentioning an award number, which seems to refer to a Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant for the same research with their internal award identifier.</p>

<p>Likewise, a publication by <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2025.07.003" target="_blank">Criscuolo et al</a> in Physics of Life Reviews (a journal published by Elsevier) correctly identified NWO using our Funder ID, but omitted our Grant ID <a href="https://api.crossref.org/works/https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2025.07.003" target="_blank">in the metadata</a>, despite its clear inclusion by the author in the acknowledgements (left). Apparently, this persistent link and open metadata is being thrown out of the infrastructure at a crucial time, when the article record could be connecting up with the grant record and making it easy and open for us all to track and report on the connection.</p>

<p>Several publishers do not seem to register funding data at all, despite the opportunity existing for almost 15 years, and sometimes even when comprehensive funding information is provided by authors.</p>
<h2 id="the-broader-implications">The broader implications</h2>
<p>It has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210" target="_blank">been known for some time</a> that publishers struggle with registering complete, high-quality funding metadata for their publications. They sometimes <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/3f63f-yt393" target="_blank">blame authors</a> for not providing the required information or making errors in reporting their funding. Or they call on funders to identify their funding more precisely by introducing persistent Grant IDs for their grants. While these are legitimate issues, and it’s true that more funders could also do this, the examples presented here suggest this narrative is incomplete—when authors provide clear, standardized funding information using persistent identifiers, many publishers still fail to capture it accurately.</p>
<p>The Grant Linking System is still relatively new in terms of open infrastructure and open metadata development, and adoption from funders is still in the tens rather than the tens of thousands, with publishers being more accustomed to creating and providing millions of open metadata records for their publications. Most participating funders, like us, have only started registering grants in the past couple of years. Now that Crossref Grant IDs are becoming more widespread, and with publishers’ experience in creating open metadata, we would love to see publishers prioritise collecting and including Grant IDs in their Crossref metadata. By updating their production practices, they would be supporting the community at large in reaping the benefits of open grant metadata.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we are organizing <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/working_groups/" target="_blank">a roundtable session under the Barcelona Declaration</a> in October to discuss concrete solutions for these issues. We invite publishers who are interested in participating <a href="mailto:contact@barcelona-declaration.org">to contact us</a>. This follows a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/3f63f-yt393" target="_blank">2023 workshop</a> where many publishers were very open in discussing the challenges and working towards improving the process together with funders.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>The introduction of Crossref Grant IDs represents just the first step in a longer journey toward more open research information for NWO. We are happy to see how quickly researchers are adopting the system by including Crossref Grant IDs in their work. For Grant IDs to truly become a Grant Linking System and fulfil its promise, however, publishers must act on the need to collect and process funding information in their publishing workflows, just as they do for other joint efforts, such as for ORCID iDs for contributors. The information is there—authors are providing it in the acknowledgement sections of their articles (and probably would too if asked directly in a submission form). The question now is: can we encourage more publishers to take up the request to capture and transmit this information accurately and register it with Crossref?</p>
<p>We’re hopeful. This first year has demonstrated the enormous potential of Crossref Grant IDs in action for NWO. We call on publishers to do their bit in ensuring this vital infrastructure reaches its full potential for the research community.</p>

      <h1>Transparency in Research Reporting: An Evolving Culture</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04)
      <p>
      <p>More than two decades ago, Richard Horton, editor of <em>The Lancet</em>, raised thought-provoking questions about scientific authorship and its representation in published articles. He noted that research reports often overlook disagreements among co-authors over the interpretation of results. Bringing to light elements of this so-called "hidden paper" has become essential for the reliability of scientific reporting. This is an evolving process likely to gain even greater relevance in graduate education, especially in the current context of intellectual production increasingly permeated by Generative Artificial Intelligence. <span class="ellipsis">&#8230;</span> <span class="more-link-wrap"><a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2025/09/04/transparency-in-research-reporting-an-evolving-culture/" class="more-link"><span>Read More &#8594;</span></a></span></p>
