<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>
What are prompts in our writing tools asking us if we want to “rewrite
with AI” really telling us? And what would broad adoption of those tools
mean for creativity and scholarly research communication?

<h2 id="posi-2.0-feedback">POSI 2.0 feedback</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
As a provider of foundational open scholarly infrastructure, Crossref is
an adopter of the
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org" target="_blank">Principles
of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>. In December 2024 we posted
our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/2024-posi-audit/">updated
POSI self-assessment</a>. POSI provides an invaluable framework for
transparency, accountability, susatinability and community alignment.
There are 21 other
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/" target="_blank">POSI
adopters</a>.
</p>
<p>
Together, we are now undertaking a public consultation on proposed
revisions for a version 2.0 release of the principles, which would
update the current
<a href="https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H" target="_blank">version 1.1 of
the principles, released in November 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a crucial step in ensuring that POSI evolves to meet the needs
of the community. Whether you are part of an organization that has
adopted POSI, is considering adoption, interacts with POSI-aligned
groups, or you have a personal interest in open scholarly
infrastructure, your perspective is invaluable.
</p>
<h2 id="some-additional-context-about-posi">
Some additional context about POSI
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
POSI is not an organization; POSI adopters are an informal group of
those that have conducted self-assessments.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The POSI principles are not rules or a checklist; organizations or
groups can adopt or interpret them to fit many different circumstances.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Our goal is for POSI self-assessments to be made publicly available and
for interested communities to assess and monitor updates and progress.
