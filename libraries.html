      <h1>Celebrating one year of Crossref Grant IDs at NWO</h1>

(date: 2025-09-09, from: <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/celebrating-one-year-of-crossref-grant-ids-at-nwo/">https://www.crossref.org/blog/celebrating-one-year-of-crossref-grant-ids-at-nwo/</a>)
      <p>
      <p>This month marks one year since the Dutch Research Council (NWO) introduced grant IDs—an important milestone in our journey toward more transparent and trackable research funding. We created over <a href="https://api.crossref.org/members/47652/works?" target="_blank">1,600 Crossref Grant IDs</a> with associated metadata. We are beginning to see them appear in publications. These early examples show the enormous potential Grant IDs have. They also highlight that publishers could extend their efforts to improve the quality of funding metadata of publications.</p>
<h2 id="the-promise-of-grant-linking">The promise of grant linking</h2>
<p>For decades, funders have struggled with a seemingly simple challenge: tracking the research outputs that arise from their funding. The traditional approach—requiring grantees to cite their grants in acknowledgement sections of their papers—has all kinds of problems. Authors make many errors in providing this information, and even when funding organizations and schemes are cited correctly, there is no guarantee that a grant number is globally unique and not already in use by another funding council in the world.</p>
<p>To address these issues, and in collaboration with the research funding community, Crossref introduced the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/" target="_blank">Grant Linking System (GLS)</a> six years ago. The system allows funding organizations to assign globally unique and persistent identifiers to their grants, but - more importantly - the system allows connecting these grants with the outputs arising from them. The vision is straightforward: authors include Grant IDs (which are Crossref DOIs) in the funding acknowledgements of their research articles. Publishers either take these IDs from the acknowledgement or proactively ask authors for these IDs in their submission system. Next, when a publisher registers their publication with Crossref, it includes the grant identifier in the metadata of that publication, creating an unambiguous link between the publication and the grants from which the research was funded.</p>
<p>This last step—including the Grant ID in the metadata of the article when registering the publication with Crossref—is a crucial part of the system as it enables anyone to automatically retrieve all publications arising from a given grant over time via the Crossref API. Funding organizations interested in tracking the impact of their funding could then stop asking their grantees to manually report on the outputs of their funding, as most still do today. Instead, this information would become open data that funding organizations harvest directly themselves, reducing administrative burden on researchers while enhancing the ability to track the impact of their funding.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xqr28-ee750" target="_blank">Robert Kiley</a>, former head of Open Research at the Wellcome Trust, which piloted the GLS in 2018, put it: &ldquo;&hellip;if every funder were to adopt such a system and expose their grant metadata in a consistent, machine-readable way, it would facilitate the development of applications to help funders get a greatly enhanced picture of the global funding landscape, which in turn would inform strategic planning and resource allocation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="nwos-implementation-journey">NWO&rsquo;s implementation journey</h2>
<p>NWO joined Crossref&rsquo;s Grant Linking System in 2024. It reflects our broader commitment to open science and aligns with our <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4674512" target="_blank">Persistent Identifier Strategy</a> published in 2021, and our support for the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information</a>. Since August 2024, all new grants awarded from July 2024 onward receive a Crossref Grant ID that persistently resolves to the information about the grant on our website, displaying all basic award information including project titles, summaries, grantee names, and affiliations. NWO is <a href="https://api.crossref.org/types/grant/works?facet=publisher-name:*&amp;rows=0" target="_blank">one of the 44 funding organizations</a> worldwide that have introduced Crossref Grant IDs for their collective <a href="https://api.crossref.org/types/grant/works?facet=funder-name:*&amp;rows=0" target="_blank">111 funding programs</a>. Other organizations include the European Commission, OSTI-DOE, the Wellcome Trust, Moore Foundation, Fonds de Recherche du Québec, CSIRO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, and the <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/news/detail/neue-identifikations-nummer-fuer-fwf-projekte" target="_blank">Austrian Science Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Although it took time, implementation at NWO in general proceeded smoothly. Over the course of a year, we&rsquo;ve registered <a href="https://api.crossref.org/members/47652/works?" target="_blank">over 1,500 grant records</a> without experiencing difficulties or complaints from researchers. On the contrary, after we announced the introduction of Grant IDs, some researchers expressed disappointment on our decision—for practical reasons—to only register DOIs for new grants instead of the entire historical record. This shows that researchers understand the importance of persistent identifiers. Already, a year after its introduction, we are seeing the first NWO Grant IDs appearing in publications— showing that researchers are taking the extra step to look up their Crossref Grant ID and include it in their articles, <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/acknowledgement-in-publications" target="_blank">as we are asking them to do</a>.
However, publishers don’t always manage to handle these identifiers in the way we expect them to.</p>
<h2 id="linking-grants-to-publications-in-real-life">Linking grants to publications in real life</h2>
<p>One of the first publications to include an NWO Grant ID is a paper by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021080" target="_blank">Weile et al.</a>, published by the American Physical Society (APS) in the journal Physical Review X. On the left, we see the funding information provided by the authors, as included in the acknowledgement section of the published article. Funding by NWO from its Talent Scheme VIDI is identified with a Grant ID <a href="https://doi.org/10.61686/YDRHT18202" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.61686/YDRHT18202</a>.</p>

<p>On the right, we see how APS has included this information <a href="https://api.crossref.org/works/https://www.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021080" target="_blank">in the metadata</a> of the publication: NWO is identified with its Funder ID and the grant with the Grant ID - forging an unambiguous link between funding and publication, initially between this particular grant and this particular publication, but potentially in the future between this grant and all other outputs arising from it. This works so long as all publishers include this information in the metadata of their publications; we need to encourage more publishers and other Crossref members (e.g., preprint services, repositories, blog platforms) to follow the APS example and do the same.</p>
<h2 id="where-publishers-fall-short">Where publishers fall short</h2>
<p>There are big differences among publishers in their ability to include funding metadata. Many have been including funder IDs in the metadata for more than a decade, but some are still struggling to do that. Most are yet to catch up to start including Crossref Grant IDs, too.</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate that in an example. On the left, we see the acknowledgements section of a paper by <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202502496" target="_blank">Van Zundert et al</a>. in the journal Small, published by Wiley. The authors acknowledge a host of funding organizations and grants, including NWO with Grant ID <a href="https://doi.org/10.61686/LVZRW92421" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.61686/LVZRW92421</a>. On the right, we see that the publisher has correctly included NWO <a href="https://api.crossref.org/works/https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202502496" target="_blank">in the metadata</a> as the funder with our Funder ID, but there’s no reference to our Grant ID, instead mentioning an award number, which seems to refer to a Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant for the same research with their internal award identifier.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Likewise, a publication by <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2025.07.003" target="_blank">Criscuolo et al</a> in Physics of Life Reviews (a journal published by Elsevier) correctly identified NWO using our Funder ID, but omitted our Grant ID <a href="https://api.crossref.org/works/https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2025.07.003" target="_blank">in the metadata</a>, despite its clear inclusion by the author in the acknowledgements (left). Apparently, this persistent link and open metadata is being thrown out of the infrastructure at a crucial time, when the article record could be connecting up with the grant record and making it easy and open for us all to track and report on the connection.</p>
<p>Several publishers do not seem to register funding data at all, despite the opportunity existing for almost 15 years, and sometimes even when comprehensive funding information is provided by authors.</p>
<h2 id="the-broader-implications">The broader implications</h2>
<p>It has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210" target="_blank">been known for some time</a> that publishers struggle with registering complete, high-quality funding metadata for their publications. They sometimes <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/3f63f-yt393" target="_blank">blame authors</a> for not providing the required information or making errors in reporting their funding. Or they call on funders to identify their funding more precisely by introducing persistent Grant IDs for their grants. While these are legitimate issues, and it’s true that more funders could also do this, the examples presented here suggest this narrative is incomplete—when authors provide clear, standardized funding information using persistent identifiers, many publishers still fail to capture it accurately.</p>
<p>The Grant Linking System is still relatively new in terms of open infrastructure and open metadata development, and adoption from funders is still in the tens rather than the tens of thousands, with publishers being more accustomed to creating and providing millions of open metadata records for their publications. Most participating funders, like us, have only started registering grants in the past couple of years. Now that Crossref Grant IDs are becoming more widespread, and with publishers’ experience in creating open metadata, we would love to see publishers prioritise collecting and including Grant IDs in their Crossref metadata. By updating their production practices, they would be supporting the community at large in reaping the benefits of open grant metadata.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we are organizing <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/working_groups/" target="_blank">a roundtable session under the Barcelona Declaration</a> in October to discuss concrete solutions for these issues. We invite publishers who are interested in participating <a href="mailto:contact@barcelona-declaration.org">to contact us</a>. This follows a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/3f63f-yt393" target="_blank">2023 workshop</a> where many publishers were very open in discussing the challenges and working towards improving the process together with funders.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>The introduction of Crossref Grant IDs represents just the first step in a longer journey toward more open research information for NWO. We are happy to see how quickly researchers are adopting the system by including Crossref Grant IDs in their work. For Grant IDs to truly become a Grant Linking System and fulfil its promise, however, publishers must act on the need to collect and process funding information in their publishing workflows, just as they do for other joint efforts, such as for ORCID iDs for contributors. The information is there—authors are providing it in the acknowledgement sections of their articles (and probably would too if asked directly in a submission form). The question now is: can we encourage more publishers to take up the request to capture and transmit this information accurately and register it with Crossref?</p>
<p>We’re hopeful. This first year has demonstrated the enormous potential of Crossref Grant IDs in action for NWO. We call on publishers to do their bit in ensuring this vital infrastructure reaches its full potential for the research community.</p>

      <h1>Transparency in Research Reporting: An Evolving Culture</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04, from: <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2025/09/04/transparency-in-research-reporting-an-evolving-culture/">https://blog.scielo.org/en/2025/09/04/transparency-in-research-reporting-an-evolving-culture/</a>)
      <p>
      <p>More than two decades ago, Richard Horton, editor of <em>The Lancet</em>, raised thought-provoking questions about scientific authorship and its representation in published articles. He noted that research reports often overlook disagreements among co-authors over the interpretation of results. Bringing to light elements of this so-called "hidden paper" has become essential for the reliability of scientific reporting. This is an evolving process likely to gain even greater relevance in graduate education, especially in the current context of intellectual production increasingly permeated by Generative Artificial Intelligence. <span class="ellipsis">&#8230;</span> <span class="more-link-wrap"><a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2025/09/04/transparency-in-research-reporting-an-evolving-culture/" class="more-link"><span>Read More &#8594;</span></a></span></p>

      <p>Higher education leaders have long struggled to answer two deceptively simple questions: “where do our graduates work?” and “what are they earning?” Response rates to surveys that historically collect this information are declining, individual state data systems typically do not track graduates across state lines, and commercial datasets with these data are opaque and costly.

      <p><a href="https://elifesciences.org/" target="_blank">eLife</a> recently <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xh94q-w7335" target="_blank">won a Crossref Metadata Award</a> for the completeness of its metadata, showing itself as the clear leader among our medium-sized members. In this post, the eLife team answers our questions about how and why they produce such high-quality open metadata. For eLife, the work of creating and sharing excellent metadata aligns with their mission to foster open science and supports their preprint-centred publication model, but it also lays the groundwork for all kinds of exciting potential uses.</p>
<div class="quotecite">

<p>Having complete and rich metadata puts you in the best position to fulfil future, as-yet-undetermined requirements.</p>

<h2 id="what-motivates-your-organisationteam-to-work-towards-high-quality-metadata-what-objectives-does-it-support-for-your-organisation">What motivates your organisation/team to work towards high-quality metadata? What objectives does it support for your organisation?</h2>
<p>eLife is a mission-driven organisation tasked by its founders to help scientists accelerate discovery and encourage responsible behaviours in science. As such, we’re passionate about open science and metadata, and we&rsquo;re vocal advocates of the benefits these provide to academic communities and beyond.</p>
<p>Given Crossref’s position as a hub at the centre of scholarly communication, providing Crossref with complete metadata furthers our mission. It facilitates the discovery and reuse of research and enables linkage to key but often overlooked outputs such as datasets and software. As signatories of <a href="https://sfdora.org/" target="_blank">DORA</a> and supporters of the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration</a>, we are keenly aware of the wider context - that these efforts enable research assessment and policy decisions to be derived from open and transparent information, moving beyond closed systems that have proliferated the damaging use of anachronistic metrics.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-a-strategy-for-complete-metadata-which-elements-did-you-prioritise-what-workflows-tools-or-collaborations-helped-you-get-there">Do you have a strategy for complete metadata? Which elements did you prioritise? What workflows, tools, or collaborations helped you get there?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of existing guidelines that provide a great skeleton to follow. For example, we follow <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR data</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86" target="_blank">FORCE11 software citation principles</a>, which ensure the capture of metadata for supporting datasets and software packages. There’s not any one particular element that we’ve prioritised, although we’re keen to ensure we follow best practices while also exploring the bleeding edge.</p>
<p>We’ve collaborated with and relied on the advice of many organisations over the years, including (but not limited to) Crossref, Research Organization Registry <a href="https://ror.org" target="_blank">(ROR)</a>, <a href="https://jats4r.niso.org/" target="_blank">JATS4R</a>, <a href="https://force11.org" target="_blank">FORCE11</a>, <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/" target="_blank">Software Heritage</a>, <a href="https://openrxiv.org/" target="_blank">openRxiv</a>, and our production vendors <a href="https://www.kriyadocs.com/exeterpremedia" target="_blank">Exeter Premedia</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve developed our own <a href="https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-crossref-xml-generation" target="_blank">open source Crossref metadata generation library</a>. Keeping this process in-house has proven really fruitful. It allows us to quickly and continuously improve upon the metadata we provide.</p>
<p>And we have a data team that has created a centralised data hub, serving as a really useful authoritative resource that can be queried, instead of always making use of disparate systems.</p>
<h2 id="how-have-you-integrated-these-into-your-metadata-processes">How have you integrated these into your metadata processes?</h2>
<p>At submission, we collect ROR IDs for (a subset of) affiliations, and structured data for funding, datasets, and other information. Our publication model is centred around preprints, so it’s necessary to capture related information such as the preprint DOI, preprint posted date, the version that pertains to each specific revision (and so on). Without this information, we could not post public reviews to the correct preprint version on the preprint server, or indeed ensure the article we publish is the correct iteration of that work.</p>
<p>The systems that enable the publication of eLife Reviewed preprints are dependent on <a href="https://docmaps.knowledgefutures.org/" target="_blank">DocMaps</a>, a framework for a machine-readable representation of the processes involved in the creation of a document. These are provided by our Data Hub and enable us to capture structured information about the peer review process and accompanying metadata for each article.</p>
<p>Our proofing system for journal articles only permits login via <a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank">ORCID authentication</a>, and we don’t capture unauthenticated ORCID IDs that have been copied or keyed (see <a href="https://info.orcid.org/whats-so-special-about-signing-in/" target="_blank">‘What’s So Special About Signing In?’)</a>. It also makes use of both the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/">Crossref API</a> and the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/developers/" target="_blank">PubMed Central API</a> to ensure we have persistent identifiers where possible for references. We have an in-house content validator, which uses <a href="https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api" target="_blank">ROR’s API</a> to ensure we have ROR IDs for affiliations and funders where possible. We use Software Heritage to archive author-generated code, and include their persistent ID <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/software-hash-identifier-swhid/" target="_blank">(SWHID)</a> in software references.</p>
<p>All our published content is captured as <a href="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/index.html" target="_blank">JATS XML</a> (the industry standard format for journal articles), which our metadata generation library uses as its input.</p>
<h2 id="what-impact-of-good-metadata-can-you-see-for-your-organisation-is-it-supporting-the-business-andor-editorial-side-of-your-work">What impact of good metadata can you see for your organisation? Is it supporting the business and/or editorial side of your work?</h2>
<p>Persistent identifiers are very useful for reporting. Creating a report that, for example, includes publication volumes from a particular institution is trivial when content is enriched with persistent identifiers. It’s more complex when all you have are messy author-supplied strings of text. They’re also useful for content validation. For example, when we have a persistent ID and a method to retrieve the related metadata, we can confirm that the information we’ve been provided is complete and correct.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many other benefits, some of which are &ldquo;unknown unknowns.&rdquo; Having complete and rich metadata puts you in the best position to fulfil future, as-yet-undetermined requirements.</p>
<h2 id="have-you-encountered-any-challenges-in-curating-or-improving-your-metadata-if-so-what-were-they-and-how-did-you-address-those">Have you encountered any challenges in curating or improving your metadata? If so, what were they, and how did you address those?</h2>
<p>In 2024, we started introducing <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/grants/">persistent grant IDs</a> for our content. While we updated our submission system to collect these from authors, it’s apparent that many authors aren’t aware when/if these have been registered by funders, and they still provide us with the (internal) grant numbers instead.</p>
<p>Our workaround was to pull grant data from Crossref and then replace the grant numbers with the persistent IDs when we’re confident of a match. Since the grant number registered at Crossref might not exactly match the grant number the authors have given us, potential matches are confirmed by a team member or our production vendors. Since many organisations do a great job of creating informative landing pages (for example, <a href="https://europepmc.org/" target="_blank">EuropePMC</a> for Wellcome funding), this is feasible, but we’re investigating ways we can make this less manual while remaining careful that we don’t introduce false positives.</p>
<h2 id="have-your-efforts-around-metadata-led-to-real-benefits-for-your-community-is-this-something-your-editors-authors-or-readers-are-aware-of-and-appreciate-if-so-why">Have your efforts around metadata led to real benefits for your community? Is this something your editors, authors, or readers are aware of and appreciate? If so, why?</h2>
<p>Yes, I think this is something that is becoming increasingly visible. Authors are very mindful of the benefits that good metadata can bring for discoverability and promotion. And much is lost without the increased interoperability it brings, both for publishers themselves but also the wider ecosystem. For example, we’ve had some great feedback from numerous organisations that appreciate that the outputs we publish directly link to the preprints they are based on.</p>
<p>In recent years, there’s been an increased focus on research integrity, and this is likely to remain the case. Metadata has an obvious and key role in providing trust and transparency, whether that’s through the presence of trust markers like ORCID IDs or through the inclusion of complete post-publication metadata such as correction, retraction, or withdrawal information.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead-how-are-you-planning-to-build-on-your-metadata-quality-are-there-new-elements-or-practices-youre-exploring-and-what-advice-would-you-give-to-others-just-starting-to-strengthen-their-metadata">Looking ahead, how are you planning to build on your metadata quality? Are there new elements or practices you’re exploring? And what advice would you give to others just starting to strengthen their metadata?</h2>
<p>Several years ago, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/about/peer-review" target="_blank">we introduced a &ldquo;publish, review, curate&rdquo; model of publishing</a>, where we publish ‘Reviewed preprints’ following each stage of review. We don’t collect the same level of structured information from authors at submission for these as we do for Versions of Record. This presents a challenge for retrieving and disseminating complete metadata for Reviewed preprints. We aim to start moving this forward so that comprehensive metadata is available at earlier stages of the publication process. For example, we recently started depositing (some) funding metadata for these.</p>
<p>We’re also keen to explore the ways in which we can make our <a href="https://elifesciences.org/about/elife-assessments" target="_blank">eLife Assessments</a> more discoverable. Our Editors use a common vocabulary to describe the significance of the findings and strength of evidence in a paper. Other publishers moving beyond accept/reject publication models use different rubrics and taxonomies, so having one restrictive field in a schema for the entire corpus of research won’t cut it. But nevertheless making these terms more discoverable and interoperable would be preferential.</p>
<p>We’ve found that the integration of public APIs/data within systems (such as ROR’s, Crossref’s, PubMed’s, and OpenAlex’s) to be really helpful in validating the correctness and completeness of content/metadata. The effort in adding these integrations will pay dividends in the future.</p>
