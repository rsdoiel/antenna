      <p>Over the past two decades, scientific publishing has undergone a technological and economic transformation that has opened the door to more unorthodox models and, unfortunately, predatory practices. Predatory publishing refers to journals and publishers that charge authors (very high fees) to publish, claim peer review and indexing practices that do not exist or are fraudulent, and prioritize quick revenue over scientific quality. …<a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2026/01/23/the-rise-of-predatory-publishing/">Read More →</a></p>

      <h1>Insights from a roundtable on author affiliation metadata</h1>

(date: 2026-01-22)
      <p>
      <p>It’s been said that Americans are unusual in tending to ask “Where do you work?” as an initial question upon introduction to a new acquaintance, indicating a perhaps unhealthy preoccupation with work as identity. But in the context of published research, “What is this author’s affiliation?” is a question of global importance that goes beyond just wanting to know the name – and perhaps prestige level – of the place a researcher works.</p>
<p>When collected, used, and analyzed at scale, data about author affiliations can provide intriguing insights about international collaboration trends, signal trust and lack of trust in particular research institutions, generate business intelligence for publishers, help universities track the work their researchers do, help funders demonstrate the impact of their funding, and much more.</p>
<p>In November we partnered with <a href="https://oaswitchboard.org/">OA Switchboard</a> to organize a roundtable on author affiliation metadata for the Crossref community, service and infrastructure providers, production vendors, data scientists, researchers, and librarians. We aimed to bring together scholarly information professionals with many diverse perspectives; ultimately, participants from more than 40 organizations joined the roundtable to share their experiences and their thoughts.</p>
<p>In focusing on a single type of metadata, we hoped to focus our discussions, as well. Similarly, in October the Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information organized <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/news/20251023_community_roundtable/">a roundtable on “Moving Funding Metadata Forward”</a> in which it became clear that “improving the quality and coverage of funding metadata was on the agenda of many organisations and there was a strong interest in collaborating on practical next steps.”</p>
<p>While many of the issues and solutions discussed at both roundtables are similar, in the course of the author affiliation metadata roundtable we identified some unique challenges as well as benefits related to this particular flavor of information. In this blog post, I’ll share these insights.</p>
<h2>Insights from presenters</h2>
<p>I opened the roundtable with a brief introduction and a working definition of affiliation metadata: names and/or identifiers such as <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/">Research Organization Registry (ROR)</a> IDs for organizations where research was conducted or with which authors and contributors are associated, usually officially, as in their place of employment.</p>
<p>Next, to create a shared context for discussion, we heard four presentations on the current state of author affiliation metadata, its importance, and Crossref’s ongoing initiative to enhance it automatically.</p>
<p>Nees Jan van Eck of Leiden University’s <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/social-behavioural-sciences/cwts">Center for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS)</a> shared observations on the state of author affiliations from a preprint titled “ <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5_v2">Crossref as a source of open bibliographic metadata</a>” that presents the findings of an analysis performed annually since 2021. Nees’s key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crossref is a foundational data source for bibliographic metadata.</li>
<li>Affiliation metadata is available for only 1 out of 3 journal articles in Crossref for the period 2023-2024.</li>
<li>There is considerable variation in the extent to which Crossref members deposit affiliation metadata.</li>
<li>Downstream sources try to fill gaps using suboptimal approaches, leading to missing, inaccurate, and inconsistent linking of publications to institutions.</li>
<li>Publications lacking affiliation metadata in Crossref are less visible in bibliometric applications, analyses, studies, and tools (such as the <a href="https://open.leidenranking.com/">open edition of the Leiden Ranking</a> of over 2800 universities).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2026/aff-roundtable-01.png" alt="Crossref as a source of open bibliographic metadata."></p>
<p>Next, Yvonne Campfens of OA Switchboard reiterated the desirability of the Crossref community providing complete and accurate author affiliation metadata at the source. Yvonne called upon publishers to “Integrate metadata creation in your systems and workflows before publication and relay it throughout the editorial, production, and publication processes.”</p>
<p>Yvonne pointed out that in the context of managing Open Access agreements, publishers ought to keep in mind that providing good affiliation metadata improves customer satisfaction, since institutions and consortia need to have that information in order to connect research to the correct organization. In closing, Yvonne featured best practices from <a href="https://www.oaswitchboard.org/dqc-publisherbestpractices">OA Switchboard’s Data Quality Challenge</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>eLife captures affiliations at submissions with “author select,” ensuring that ROR IDs are introduced early and verified before publication, coupled with a quality assurance process during proofing. (See also our piece on <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/3gcdf-23s29">Metadata Excellence Award winner eLife</a>.)</li>
<li>EMS Press captures metadata via manuscript extraction as early as at submission, building on globally valid identifiers whenever possible (ROR IDs, DOIs, ORCIDs).</li>
<li>Pensoft Publishers uses AI-assisted metadata extraction with human review and in-house metadata validation.</li>
<li>Beilstein-Institut performs post-acceptance metadata quality assurance through automation and expert review.</li>
<li>The Royal Society embeds metadata in OA payment and agreement workflows.</li>
<li>American Chemical Society (ACS) has a multi-method persistent identifier matching strategy with near-complete coverage.</li>
<li>The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) combines AI-powered submission tools with editorial oversight via expert manual checks. (See also our piece on <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xxwy3-xhf38">Metadata Excellence Award winner ASM</a>.)</li>
<li>Rockefeller University Press (RUP) maintains ROR IDs across the full publishing workflow with “author select” at submission through metadata deposits upon publication. (See also the <a href="https://doi.org/10.71938/t63t-g186">ROR case study on RUP</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2026/aff-roundtable-02.png" alt="Having great metadata improves your operational excellence."></p>
<p>Adam Day of <a href="https://clear-skies.co.uk/">Clear Skies Ltd</a> began his talk by wryly framing the first and second rules of data science as contradictory: “Never fix data: always use sources that produce high-quality data in the first place,” but also “Get good at fixing data, because you will have to.” Adam went on to demonstrate the central role author affiliation metadata plays in research integrity investigations, displaying anonymized data for institutions with a high number of alerts. In conclusion, Adam reiterated the importance of author affiliation metadata to research integrity efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data analysis is critical to research integrity.</li>
<li>Quality data helps enormously by giving oversight, saving time, and assisting investigations.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2026/aff-roundtable-03.png" alt="Value comes from data."></p>
<p>Lastly, our own Director of Technology <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/dominika-tkaczyk">Dominika Tkaczyk</a> gave an account of our plans to enrich author affiliation metadata by matching organization name text strings to <a href="https://ror.org">ROR IDs</a> as part of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/">metadata matching</a> initiative. A strategy for performing such matching has already been developed and tested and an <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15254993">open dataset of results made available</a>. Tests on a set of 3,000 affiliations sampled from our metadata show that the strategy can be expected to match 95 million ROR IDs to organization names with 97.35% precision, an astronomical increase over the less than 1 million ROR IDs deposited in Crossref records to date.</p>
<p>Dominika concluded the presentation portion of the session by reiterating that our planned enrichment of author affiliation metadata</p>
<ul>
<li>Will use flexible and transparent matching strategies (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/marple/-/tree/main/strategies_available/affiliation_single_search">open code</a>),</li>
<li>Will welcome community participation in developing new strategies, and</li>
<li>Will be available in the REST API.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2026/aff-roundtable-04.png" alt="Matching affiliation strings to ROR IDs."></p>
<p>Automatic matching of organization names to ROR IDs in author affiliations cannot solve the problem of missing organization names, of course, but it represents a huge leap forward in addressing metadata quality issues.</p>

<h2>Insights into challenges</h2>
<p>In the next stage of the event, participants broke into six breakout groups to identify factors contributing to incomplete or inaccurate affiliation metadata. Participants were pre-assigned to groups randomly by role to ensure a variety of perspectives in every discussion.</p>
<p>At least two participants, it should be noted, pointed out that it would be helpful to agree on a definition of “complete” and “accurate” affiliation metadata, which in itself is a challenge, and one we did not address in this roundtable. For instance, practices most recently have trended away from defining a complete author affiliation in open metadata as including an institutional address, although many internal databases might include such information separately.</p>
<p>Even without such definitions, however, all six groups were able to identify several general areas for attention, and one participant provided a particularly helpful categorization of these areas that is largely reused here.</p>
<h3>Inherent data complexity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research organizations have names in different languages, abbreviations, and many other name variants.</li>
<li>Research organizations have frequent name changes, mergers, and rebranding.</li>
<li>Research organizations have different degrees, levels, and complexity of hierarchical granularity, and authors, publishers, and software systems are often misaligned as to which level in an organization’s structure is appropriate to use in a particular instance.</li>
<li>Research organizations often lack official policies on how affiliations should be written, leading to hundreds of variations for a single institution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Author-related issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corresponding authors often submit information for all co-authors, which can lead to inaccuracies.</li>
<li>Many authors have multiple profiles across multiple submission systems, which can introduce errors.</li>
<li>Authors may have “octopus affiliations,” claiming affiliations with many institutions that are difficult to verify.</li>
<li>Authors may fail to update affiliations when changing institutions between manuscript acceptance and publication.</li>
<li>Authors may demonstrate “apathy” when repeatedly filling out submission forms, sometimes providing incomplete, inconsistent, or incorrect information.</li>
<li>On occasion, authors might even provide false or purchased affiliations, which of course is a significant research integrity concern.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical barriers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many manuscript tracking and peer review systems, especially legacy systems, lack structured fields for affiliations or don’t support open organization identifiers like ROR.</li>
<li>Some systems limit authors to a single affiliation, despite many researchers having multiple institutional connections.</li>
<li>Some systems only collect affiliation information for the corresponding author.</li>
<li>Some systems link affiliations to user accounts instead of to publications.</li>
<li>Different systems use competing identifier registries, including proprietary identifier registries, creating interoperability challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Publisher practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even when publishers improve current metadata collection practices, historical data correction is resource-intensive and often not prioritized.</li>
<li>Publishers collect affiliation information at submission but don’t ensure that it is maintained throughout all stages of the publication process and deposited in metadata.</li>
<li>Some publishers are unaware of the importance of author affiliation metadata or do not prioritize its improvement.</li>
<li>Some publishers deliberately choose not to deposit affiliation metadata to Crossref, viewing it as value-added information they’ve invested in curating.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insights into solutions</h2>
<p>Naturally, we didn’t rest at identifying challenges: after a break, we gathered in the same groups to brainstorm approaches to improving author affiliation metadata.</p>
<h3>Adopt collective approaches</h3>
<ul>
<li>Collective action, where corrections and improvements made by various stakeholders flow back into shared systems, has historically worked for proprietary systems and could be even more powerful with open infrastructure.</li>
<li>Since those who do not provide metadata “upstream” will inevitably have it provided for them “downstream” by multiple separate entities using multifarious methods, provenance metadata indicating who asserted author affiliations and how (whether automatically or with the author’s or editor’s input) would help metadata users assess trust levels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engage authors and institutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reach out to authors and institutions to educate them on the need for more consistent affiliation reporting, especially in terms of language, name format, and degree of hierarchical granularity.</li>
<li>Demonstrate the benefit to institutions of maintaining accurate records in registries like ROR, including abbreviations and name variants.</li>
<li>Publishers and/or software systems should allow authors to review (though not necessarily edit) affiliation information during the proofing process to verify accuracy. Authors should not, however, need to know, see, or use ROR IDs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improve the tech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Publishers would welcome submission systems that incorporate structured fields for author affiliations with well-designed auto-suggestions linked to ROR or other organization identifiers.</li>
<li>Making affiliation data mandatory at submission could significantly improve capture rates, although it would be important to ensure that independent researchers can use these systems as well.</li>
<li>Enable collection of affiliations for all authors, not just the corresponding author.</li>
<li>Pull in <a href="https://info.orcid.org/trust-markers-in-orcid-records-verified-email-domains/">verified affiliation information from ORCID</a>.</li>
<li>Increasingly, intelligent matching systems can be implemented to reduce author burden and perhaps also increase accuracy and completeness of metadata.</li>
<li>Better crosswalks between different organization identifier systems would make it vastly easier for publishers to maintain better metadata. Since open registries cannot include proprietary information, proprietary registries should provide their customers with crosswalks to all standard open identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Encourage publisher best practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Publishers can use already-available tools to help assess and improve the quality of both new and legacy author affiliation metadata.

<p>It’s worth mentioning that these solutions are heterogeneous: not all strategies can be implemented by any one actor nor even by any one sector of our profession. Clearly, collaborative action is necessary for substantive change.</p>
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
<p>The affiliations metadata roundtable represented an important step in addressing affiliation metadata challenges in a productive and collaborative way. If there was a consensus, it was that while perfect completeness and accuracy of author affiliation metadata may not be achievable (or even definable), incremental improvements can substantially enhance the quality and availability of affiliation metadata for the entire scholarly information community.</p>
<p>Here at Crossref, we intend to use the insights from this roundtable to inform our support of the Crossref community, including publishers, service providers, and metadata users. We welcome your comments, questions, and suggestions on this issue! <strong>Share your thoughts with Amanda French at <a href="mailto:alfrench@crossref.org">alfrench@crossref.org</a>.</strong></p>

      <p>In today’s technology-driven world, digital literacy isn’t just a skill—it’s a lifeline. For individuals who are incarcerated, the ability to effectively use digital tools can mean the difference between returning to the community prepared or being left even further behind. As research shows, digital skills acquisition is critical for navigating all phases of reentry.</p>

      <p>The Socratic maieutic perspective offers a philosophical framework for rethinking the use of AI in scientific output. Instead of an oracle that provides answers, AI can be a dialogical partner that helps researchers to make latent knowledge explicit and thus reposition the discussion about authorship: the researcher remains the responsible epistemic agent, while AI acts as an intellectual midwife. …<a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2026/01/19/who-is-the-midwife-and-who-is-the-parturient-the-maieutic-perspective-for-rethinking-authorship-and-epistemic-responsibility-in-the-use-of-ai-in-scientific-output/">Read More →</a></p>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>Higher education institutions will face multiple enrollment challenges in the next decade., including the projected decline in the number of high school graduates after 2025 and more prospective students being open to career options outside of a four-year degree. As they consider how to respond to these challenges, colleges and universities, including those with high-graduation rates, should take a closer look at the population of adult learners, particularly those within their geographic region, to support future enrollment efforts.</p>

      <h1>The GEM program - Year Three and program expansion for 2026</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>As Crossref membership continues to grow, finding ways to help organisations participate is an important part of our mission. Although Crossref membership is open to all organisations that produce scholarly and professional materials, cost and technical challenges can be barriers to joining for many.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">Global Equitable Membership (GEM) Program</a> aims to provide greater membership equity and accessibility to organisations in the world’s least economically advantaged countries. Eligible members pay no membership or record registration fees. Eligibility for the program is based on a member’s country. Seeing its effectiveness in increasing participation in the research nexus from previously underrepresented regions, this year we are expanding the GEM program to include 18 new countries.</p>
<h3>Overview of the first 3 years of GEM</h3>
<p>The program began in January 2023 with 214 existing members. By the end of 2025, we had 628 organisations under the GEM program. Of these, 535 are independent members, and 89 members work through one of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/membership/about-sponsors">sponsors</a>. To date, GEM program members have contributed approximately 334,000 works to the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus">Research Nexus</a>.</p>

<p>Membership Density in GEM Program Countries until the end of 2025</p>
<h3>Program expansion in 2026</h3>
<p>Starting on 1st of January 2026, we’re excited to invite organisations from Angola, Belize, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Dominica, Eswatini, Fiji, Grenada, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Timor Leste, and Uzbekistan to join Crossref and register their content and metadata with us without membership or record registration fees. There are 711 existing Crossref members based in these countries who are now eligible for the program, bringing the overall number of GEM members to 1339 across 77 countries (that’s close to 5% of all Crossref members).</p>
<p>In creating our eligibility list, we refer to existing sources. For the first three years of the program, our list was predominantly based on the World Bank’s <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups">International Development Association (IDA)</a> classification. In 2026, we leveraged additional sources to curate our list, resulting in the inclusion of 18 new countries in the program. Following community feedback, we now refer to the IDA, the <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups">IDA Blend List</a>, and the <a href="https://www.un.org/ohrlls/content/list-ldcs">United Nations Least Developed Countries</a> list. In our choices, we also keep abreast of the global situation and conversations about supporting equitability in scholarly publishing and in the future, we may consider other factors too.</p>
<p>We will review our lists and the eligibility criteria annually and note any changes on our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">website</a>. Members whose country moves on or off the GEM Program will be notified of any upcoming fees (or the removal of fees) with adequate time to plan and budget accordingly.
Although the GEM program reduces financial barriers, many small organisations may still need administrative, technical, and language support provided by our Sponsors, and we will continue working with suitable organisations to make participation in Crossref easier.</p>

      <h1>Reduction of Grant DOI registration fees: a boost for the Research Nexus</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>We are pleased to announce that—effective 1st January 2026—we have made two changes to grant record registration fees that aim to accelerate adoption of Crossref’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant Linking System (GLS)</a> and provide a two-year window of opportunity to increase the number and availability of open persistent grant identifiers and boost the matching of relationships with research objects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/gls/gls-benefits.png" alt="High-level benefits of the Crossref Grant Linking System (GLS)"></p>
<p>Launched in 2019 with close input from several funders and other infrastructure organisations, the GLS primarily offers the ability to create and steward Crossref Grant DOIs, along with several benefits such as dedicated grant/award metadata like funding type, value, contributors, and projects, as well as hosted landing pages, tools to create and update metadata, and of course both member-asserted and Crossref-automatic matching of relationships within the global corpus of 180 million other research objects. Essentially, we need to identify what research objects are produced as a result of the award, and these objects could be articles, preprints, data, code, blogs, posters, and more.</p>
<p>This connected network is what we call the Research Nexus, essential for exploring research activity in general, as well as evaluating reach and return on funding and other support like use of facilities/equipment.</p>
<h3>A fee reduction and a two-year fee waiver pilot</h3>
<p>Following a review by our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/">Membership &amp; Fees Committee</a>, the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#board-members">Board</a> met in December and passed two related motions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Current-Year (CY) grant registration fee has been cut in half to match other record types</strong>: The board approved the adjustment of the Current-Year (CY) grant registration fee down from <span class="math inline">\(2.00 to \)</span>1.00 USD, effective 1st January 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Back-Year (BY) grant registration fee is waived through 2027</strong>: The board approved a time-limited fee waiver as a pilot for Back-Year (BY) grant registration fees, bringing that per-record fee down from <span class="math inline">\(0.30 to \)</span>0.00 for 2026 and 2027.</li>

<p>We aim to boost registration of Back-Year (BY) records and accelerate the growth of the Research Nexus with millions more grant&lt;-&gt;output matches. During the course of the two-year pilot, the Membership &amp; Fees Committee and our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">fee project work</a> that started in 2023 and also <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10">brought in other fee reductions</a>, will consider more adjustments across BY registration fees for the benefit of members beyond just funders and beyond just grants.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#motions">Board motions are publicly available</a> and we encourage questions from the community about our governance processes and the decisions on our members’ behalf; <a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org">email us via feedback@crossref.org</a> anytime, or <a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/strategy/">post on the forum</a>.</p>
<h3>Supercharging the Grant Linking System</h3>
<p>Leading up to the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">GLS</a> launch in 2019, we worked with a group of funders and metadata experts to inform the design and implementation of the new service, including a funder governance and fees working group. That was seven years ago, and our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders/">Funder Advisory Group</a> now includes nearly 100 funding community representatives the GLS has grown to almost 50 funder members that have registered more than 185,000 open grant metadata records. But they are mostly research councils and agencies or charities from Europe and North America, and we know that for a truly comprehensive and interconnected Research Nexus, more needs to be done to include organisations from all parts of the world. The other key driver is simply to boost more metadata connections; the more grant metadata we gather, the better we can match it to all kinds of research outputs, and this metadata directly feeds thousands of services available in our community, from Dimensions and Scopus, to OA.Report and OpenAlex, as well as funders’ own analytics tools. See our <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/607z6-1nh09">recent report about the latest dataset</a> and of course use <a href="htps://api.crossref.org">api.crossref.org</a> directly.</p>
<p>Relatedly, we just added a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/x7d4h-x3r11">new Grant DOI field</a> to our schema for all record types, to give our members a precise and accurate way of capturing funding metadata for all research outputs. With the new lower CY registration fee and a pilot waiver of BY fees for grant records, we hope to boost the creation of more Grant DOIs by more funders from more parts of the world—so that others also see and can build on the momentum and reuse the data in their own tools and services. <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/news/20251023_community_roundtable/">All actors need to play their role</a>, and Crossref’s part is in running the global linking infrastructure at scale, connecting research objects and making them openly available while ensuring that the barriers for the registration, use and reuse of metadata remain as low as possible.</p>
<p>We feel we’re at a tipping point that only needs a small nudge to truly scale the Grant Linking System.</p>
<p>By waiving BY fees entirely for two years, we’re hoping to see members fill in historical data and create more comprehensive grant&lt;-&gt;outcome connections. There is often a long period of time between funding being awarded, and the resulting research objects being generated and communicated. That is why historical grant metadata is so important; we think that there will be many funding outcome relationships and insights just waiting to be uncovered!</p>
<h3>Why give funders a fee break and not others?</h3>
<p>We’re not ruling out this kind of fee incentive in future for other members and other object types, but that needs more analysis (which we plan to do) and right now, the relatively small number of grant records, combined with a growing need for this kind of metadata, means the changes are small enough to have almost no impact on Crossref’s healthy financial position.</p>
<p>This decision is consistent with the goals of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability (RCFS)</a> to review our fees to make sure they are equitable and clear, while ensuring Crossref retains a sustainable business model. Our fees can encourage or discourage the community to participate in Crossref. The RCFS project has also resulted in the creation of a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/j2bgz-v7h50/">lower membership fee tier</a> for the very lowest-resourced members, and the tidying up of <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10">things like outlier volume discounts</a>.</p>
<p>The BY fee waiver is positioned as a pilot to allow us to measure its impact over the next two years and feed into the Membership &amp; Fees Committee and RCFS project. We will evaluate the pilot results (i.e. does it indeed supercharge funding metadata connections and adoption?) and consider additional adjustments to other BY registration fees and whether such fee incentives might be extended to other members.</p>
<p>We encourage all funders to take advantage of these reduced rates to contribute to the Research Nexus and help us build a more complete picture of the relationship between research funding and outcomes.</p>
<p>Take a look at the recent case studies from early GLS adopters <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/n9n69-y5b75">FWF</a> (Austria), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69">NWO</a> (The Netherlands), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/9gjfp-5p698">FCCN|FCT</a> (Portugal), and <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/c1dh8-qn968">Wellcome/EuropePMC</a>, reach out to them or us with any questions, or peruse the <a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/crossref-services/grant-linking-system/">GLS community forum</a>!</p>

      <h1>The best way of acknowledging research funding in the metadata: Crossref Grant ID</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>We are very pleased to kick off the New Year with another important schema update and the news that a Grant DOI field is now supported for all record types. This means that Crossref members can explicitly include the Crossref Grant IDs as part of their DOI metadata records for publications and any other output type, accurately linking research outputs to the funding that made it possible, all through metadata. We hope that our members will leverage this to respond to recent calls for <a href="https://council.science/statements/isc-position-on-research-funding-transparency/">stronger funding transparency</a> and best practices for <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/discussion-document/declaring-funding-sources-research">reporting funding sources in research outputs</a>.</p>
<p>Funding information is very important for the research community. As explored by <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2025/12/11/open-funder-metadata-is-essential-for-true-research-transparency/">some key European funder representatives</a>, providing mechanisms to clearly link funding with its outputs is essential for the community to have a full picture of the research endeavour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When funders systematically register grants with persistent identifiers and make this information openly available, they create a foundation that publishers and infrastructure providers such as repositories can reliably build upon when depositing output metadata.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Hans de Jonge, Katharina Rieck and Zoé Ancion</p>
<p>Up until now, if a Crossref member wanted to include a Crossref Grant ID to unambiguously identify the output funding source, they would need to use other available fields, such as for an award number. While it was an important step towards increasing transparency and is heavily used for reporting and impact assessment, being an unstructured field, it was prone to errors, and of course, funders’ internal award identifiers are not unique, persistent, or necessarily open. This limited our ability to create unambiguous relationships with the Crossref Grant DOIs registered by our now ~50 funder members. As the new field becomes increasingly populated by our members, this rich metadata will pave the way for capturing and representing the funding relationships in a more accurate and complete way and fulfilling one of our commitments at the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/news/20251023_community_roundtable/">recent funding metadata workshop with the Barcelona Declaration.</a></p>
<p><strong>The Crossref Grant ID field in the schema is a clear signal of the growing demand for these persistent Grant IDs (Crossref DOIs), and the relationships these help us create.</strong> Those connections can in turn enable streamlined reporting for the grantees, as well as compliance tracking and programme evaluation for funders.</p>
<p>As part of our work to enable the research nexus, Crossref has been proactively identifying funding information and prototyping metadata enrichment processes <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/">through matching projects</a>, ensuring that as many <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/607z6-1nh09">relationships as possible are established and made discoverable</a>. With this schema update, we aim to lower barriers and encourage more members to register output-funding relationships at source. This will facilitate the links that make the research nexus a connected, interoperable, and an important source of information that ensures a transparent and trustworthy research process.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage all Crossref members to start incorporating Grant DOIs when available into your metadata submissions.</strong> By taking advantage of this new field, you’ll help build a more complete and transparent record of research funding, making it easier for the community to understand and trace the impact of funded research.</p>
<p>When collecting funding information for your publication, please consider asking the authors for the Grant DOI (Crossref Grant ID) as well as the funder’s details (such as their name and identifier). Here’s how the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Scientific and Technical Information’s (OSTI-DOE) grant <a href="https://doi.org/10.46936/aps-182101/60010611">https://doi.org/10.46936/aps-182101/60010611</a> can be included in the metadata for related works, from datasets, to preprints, conference proceedings, journal articles, and more:</p>
<pre><code class="language-JS">&lt;assertion name=&quot;fundgroup&quot;&gt;
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;ror&quot;&gt;https://ror.org/04qxsr837&lt;/assertion&gt;
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;grant_doi&quot;&gt;10.46936/aps-182101/60010611&lt;/assertion&gt;
 &lt;/assertion&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, a grant <a href="https://doi.org/10.3030/732489">https://doi.org/10.3030/732489</a> from European Union H2020-EU.2.1.1. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP, would be represented in related work’s metadata as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-JS">&lt;assertion name=&quot;fundgroup&quot;&gt;
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;funder_name”&gt;H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;funder_identifier”&gt;10.13039/100010669&lt;/assertion&gt;
 &lt;/assertion&gt;
 &lt;assertion name=&quot;grant_doi&quot;&gt;10.3030/732489&lt;/assertion&gt;
&lt;/assertion&gt;

</code></pre>
