Post — Speak Finance: Gain University Support for Open Scholarship</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>
The federal government is mandating that the knowledge and data produced
from federal grants be widely available for our collective good.
Libraries remain under-resourced to make this happen. Let’s add some new
metrics and language to this narrative to help articulate the value of
libraries.
