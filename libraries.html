<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: Open Citation blog at Hypotheses.org</p>
<p>January is a strange month. After the festive whirl of December’s
gatherings, it quickly shifts into the hustle and bustle of the new
year’s commitments and the work that follows the holidays. For us at
OpenCitations, however, it has become a tradition to take a moment at
the end of this month to pause after the first hectic weeks of the year.
This time allows us to reflect on the achievements of the past year and
plan for the future with a clearer mind. …

<h2 id="retraction-watch-retractions-now-in-the-crossref-api">Retraction
Watch retractions now in the Crossref API</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Retractions and corrections from Retraction Watch are now available in
Crossref’s REST API. Back in September 2023, we announced the
acquisition of the Retraction Watch database with an ongoing shared
service. Since then, they have sent us regular updates, which are
publicly available as a
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/retraction-watch-data" target="_blank">csv
file</a>. Our aim has always been to better integrate these retractions
with our existing metadata, and today we’ve met that goal.
</p>
<p>
This is the first time we have supplemented our metadata with a
third-party data source. Until now, our APIs have included metadata
provided by Crossref members along with outputs from our internal
enrichment workflows, such as matches found for bibliographic reference
matching and funders. Third party metadata has been gathered in Event
Data, but this has been stored and delivered separately.
</p>
<p>
Knowing when work has been retracted is critical for assessing the
integrity of research, and this enhancement of the data will be a great
benefit to the community.
</p>
<h2 id="where-does-the-data-come-from">
Where does the data come from?
</h2>
<p>
Retraction Watch carefully curates retractions, pulling them from
several non-Crossref sources, including PubMed and publisher websites.
Each entry is manually checked and annotated before being added to the
database. The high level of curation and broad coverage is what made a
partnership between Crossref and Retraction Watch attractive, and our
shared goal of making changes to metadata more visible.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Our goal with the Retraction Watch Database has always been for it to
be as useful to as many people as possible, and available from as many
sources as possible,” says Ivan Oransky, co-founder of Retraction Watch
and executive director of The Center For Scientific Integrity, its
parent nonprofit organization. “Integration with Crossref’s REST API is
a huge step in that direction.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="where-can-i-see-the-retractions">
Where can I see the retractions?

<p>
If you use a service that collects Crossref metadata, you will start to
see the Retraction Watch retractions as they are picked up. To access
the data directly, you can find retractions from both Crossref members
and Retraction Watch in our REST API, for example with the following
request for all retractions:

of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>. In December 2024 we posted
our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/2024-posi-audit/">updated
POSI self-assessment</a>. POSI provides an invaluable framework for
transparency, accountability, susatinability and community alignment.
There are 21 other
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/" target="_blank">POSI
adopters</a>.
</p>
<p>
Together, we are now undertaking a public consultation on proposed
revisions for a version 2.0 release of the principles, which would
update the current
<a href="https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H" target="_blank">version 1.1 of
the principles, released in November 2023</a>.

<p>
This is a crucial step in ensuring that POSI evolves to meet the needs
of the community. Whether you are part of an organization that has
adopted POSI, is considering adoption, interacts with POSI-aligned
groups, or you have a personal interest in open scholarly
infrastructure, your perspective is invaluable.
