<p>
Scholarly communication is amid a reconfiguration that, from a
conservative perspective, should be as paradigm-shifting as the creation
of the first scientific journal <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, in
1665. From a more disruptive perspective, this transformation will
reshape the entire scientific culture, redefining the autonomy of
researchers and institutions in producing and validating knowledge.
Sustaining research integrity and rigor in projects and publications
calls for strategies extending beyond transparency policies for
researchers using Generative Artificial Intelligence. <span

id="meet-six-winners-of-the-first-ever-crossref-metadata-awards">Meet
six winners of the first ever Crossref Metadata Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-07, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Marking our 25th anniversary, we launch the Crossref Metadata Awards to
emphasise our community’s role in stewarding and enriching the scholarly
record.
</p>
<p>
We are pleased to recognise Noyam Publishers, GigaScience Press, eLife,
American Society for Microbiology, and Universidad La Salle Arequipa
Perú with the Crossref Metadata Excellence Awards, and Instituto
Geologico y Minero de España wins the Crossref Metadata Enrichment
Award. These inaugural awards highlight the leadership of members who
show dedication to the best metadata practices.
</p>
<p>
Crossref exists to make scholarly communications better by making
research objects easy to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse. Our
members weave the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">research
nexus</a>: a rich and reusable open network of connections between works
resulting from the scholarly process and the people and institutions
engaged in it.
</p>
<p>
Rich metadata improves discoverability of and trust in published works.
Many institutions now strive to turn towards open research information
in their reporting, assessment and evaluation. And so we believe it’s
time to give credit to members that are doing the best work in
supporting others across the scholarly ecosystem with their metadata.
</p>
<p>
The awards presented today will be followed by a series of blog
interviews, where the winners will share how they achieved their high
level of metadata completeness.
</p>
<p>
Starting in 2025, we will hold the awards every other year.
</p>
<p>
Read on to get more acquainted with the winners, learn about other high
performing organisations and overall trends in metadata practices we see
at Crossref.
</p>
<h2 id="recognising-metadata-excellence">
Recognising Metadata Excellence
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://noyam.org/" target="_blank">Noyam Publishers</a> is
based in Ghana. Colleagues had the pleasure of meeting them in person,
during the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/reflections-from-crossref-accra-2025-strengthening-open-science-and-partnerships-in-ghana/">Crossref
Accra</a> event this March. Striving for visibility motivates Noyam’s
high performance when it comes to metadata. With 57% coverage of key
metadata elements across their records, they are a leader among the
members in our Global Equitable Membership (GEM) program.
</p>
<p>
Among other GEM members who show high participation in the research
nexus, we see more than 40% coverage of key metadata elements for the
records registered by University of Sierra Leone Teaching Hospitals
Complex in Sierra Leone, Queen Arwa University in Yemen, Kathmandu
University School of Education in Nepal, and International Journal for
Innovation Education and Research in Bangladesh.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://gigasciencejournal.com/" target="_blank">GigaScience
Press</a>, based in Hong Kong, is the leader among small members
(organisations of less than USD 1 mln of publishing revenue or
expenses). Discoverability drives their high metadata standards, and
GigaSciencePress sees those having advantages in terms of service
integrations and development too. They are quick to credit the expertise
of their technology partner, River Valley Technologies as the strategic
contributor to them achieving 82% coverage of key metadata elements
across their records.
</p>
<p>
It’s worth highlighting that the competition among our small members was
much closer than in any other category! Stichting SciPost (Netherlands)
also show more than 80% coverage across their records, followed by Life
Science Alliance, LLC (United States), National Institute for Health and
Care Research (United Kingdom), and Universidad La Salle Arequipa
(Peru), each of which achieved more than 70% metadata coverage across
their registered works.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://elifesciences.org" target="_blank">eLife</a> leads
among our medium members (organisations between USD 1 mln and 10 mln of
publishing revenue or expenses) with 85% coverage of key metadata
elements. They have shown dedication to metadata quality and
consistently high performance over the years. They are also the first
publisher to include Crossref grant IDs in their records, adopting the
Grant Linking System.
</p>
<p>
Other medium-sized organisations to note are MDPI AG in Switzerland, and
XMLink in South Korea – while there’s a significant gap to the leader,
each of these organisations has more than 50% coverage of key metadata
elements across their records.
</p>
<p>
It appears that large members (organisations with more than USD 10 mln
of publishing revenue or expenses) struggle to achieve consistency in
metadata quality across all of their records. Yet, we are delighted to
recognise the <a href="https://asm.org" target="_blank">American Society
for Microbiology</a> in the United States, who have embarked on a large
metadata quality improvement project several years ago, and it continues
to bear fruit as we see 56% of metadata coverage across ASM’s records.
They’ve
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/shooting-for-the-stars-asms-journey-towards-complete-metadata/" target="_blank">shared
their experience on our blog already</a>, so this time we’ll invite them
to follow up with the latest updates on their metadata practices.
</p>
<p>
American Geophysical Union (AGU), Public Library of Science (PLOS), SAGE
Publications, and Wiley, all based in the United States, are ASM’s
closest runners up. While the gap is significant – still each of these
organisations has more than 40% of metadata coverage across their
records. PLOS has an impressive proportion of Crossmark-enabled works
(99%), and American Geophysical Union and Wiley are registering a
significant proportion of abstracts for their records (87% and 59%
respectively).
</p>
<p>
It often takes time to hone new processes and learn about metadata
practices, so we decided to recognise metadata excellence among our new
members: organisations that joined Crossref within the past two years.
Our inaugural award for excellence among new members goes to
<a href="https://www.ulasalle.edu.pe/" target="_blank">Universidad La
Salle Arequipa Perú</a>, who joined Crossref in May 2023, and have 71%
metadata coverage across their records.
</p>
<h2 id="rewarding-metadata-enrichment">
Rewarding Metadata Enrichment
</h2>
<p>
Our members don’t just register their records with us – they also
steward and maintain their metadata over time. As new technical
capabilities and metadata elements become available, members have the
ability to update their metadata. We decided to recognise the member who
achieved the biggest transformation to their records in the past two
years: Instituto Geologico y Minero de España, based in Spain, jumped
from just over 1% to more than 40% metadata coverage for their records
in the space of the past two years.
</p>
<p>
Others who made more than 30% jump in their metadata completeness in the
past two years are Cabrera Research Lab (United States), Centro de
Investigaciones Sociologicas (Spain), Bon View Publishing PTE
(Singapore), Asociacion Colombiana de Neurologia (Colombia), Instituto
Superior Tecnológico Almirante Illingworth (Ecuador), and Tashkent State
University of Economics (Uzbekistan).
</p>
<h2 id="how-did-we-select-the-winners">
How did we select the winners?
</h2>
<p>
Our Metadata Excellence Awardees have been selected on the basis of the
overall highest coverage of metadata elements included in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Participation
Reports</a> as of March 2025, and the Metadata Enrichment Award was
based on the comparison between performance on the same criteria between
March 2023 and March 2025. Participation Reports are openly available
and provide information about the proportion of a given member’s records
that include the following high-value metadata elements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
References
</li>
<li>
Abstracts
</li>
<li>
ORCID iDs
</li>
<li>
Affiliations
</li>
<li>
ROR IDs
</li>
<li>
Funder Registry IDs
</li>
<li>
Funding award numbers
</li>
<li>
Crossmark enabled
</li>
<li>
Text mining URLs
</li>
<li>
License URLs
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The report also includes Similarity Check URLs. However, since
Similarity Check is an optional service that attracts a separate fee –
it wouldn’t be equitable to include it in our analysis.
</p>
<p>
We encourage all members to periodically monitor their participation
reports, and we offer frequent
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/metadata-health-check-webinars/">drop-in
metadata health-check sessions</a>, where we review the reports together
and offer advice on making improvements in areas where our members
experience challenges.
</p>
<p>
In a membership of more than 22,000 organisations, it’s difficult to
recognise just one organisation as a model of best practices. There are
many nuances that influence the performance and we would like to be
transparent about some considerations we made in our awarding process.
</p>
<p>
First of all, we considered volume of publishing as a key variable, and
decided to qualify organisations with a minimum of 20 items of
registered content.
</p>
<p>
We also recognise that size matters – and decided to award our Metadata
Excellence Awards in four categories corresponding with organisational
size and resourcing.
</p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-winners----overview-of-good-metadata-practice-across-different-types-of-works">
Beyond the winners – overview of good metadata practice across different
types of works
</h2>
<p>
The scholarly communications landscape is always evolving, and new types
of content arise all the time. Crossref schema enables rich metadata
collection about journal articles, books, book chapters, preprints,
conference proceedings, technical reports, as well as grants, and more.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the most prolific way of sharing scholarship - at least
judging by the number of records registered with Crossref – is a journal
article. There are 112,982,290 journal articles in the Crossref
database, and in 2024 alone our members created 6,747,031 journal
articles records with us.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to books (2,212,221 total records) and book chapters
(22,892,785 total records), publishers with the richest metadata records
include Universitatsbibliothek Kiel (Germany) with more than 50%
coverage of key metadata elements across their book records, and 70% for
their book chapters. RTI Press (US) also has strong metadata for books
(52%), while Firenze University Press (Italy) has 56% of metadata
coverage across their book chapters. Incidentally,
Universitatsbibliothek Kiel (Germany) are also leaders in metadata for
conference proceedings (53% metadata coverage of those records).
</p>
<p>
Preprints and posted content (including preprints, eprints, working
papers, reports) are relatively new on the scene and growing rapidly –
Crossref has 1,683,351 preprint records (413,742 registered in 2024).
The richest metadata records for preprints belong to eLife (UK) - they
cover more than 50% of key metadata elements across their preprints
records in Crossref. Springer Science and Business Media LLC
(Netherlands) have 48% metadata coverage for their preprints, American
Chemical Society (ACS; United States) with 46%, and UNISA Press (South
Africa) and PeerJ (US) follow with 44% coverage.
</p>
<p>
The newest of record types that can be registered with us are grants. At
present this is an early adopters domain, with 152,810 registered grants
so far. The European Union (represented in Crossref by the Publications
Office of the European Union) registered the most grants to date.
</p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-winners----overview-of-coverage-in-key-metadata-elements">
Beyond the winners – overview of coverage in key metadata elements
</h2>
<p>
When speaking about key metadata elements reflected in our Participation
Report, the coverage varies widely. For example, overall 21% of records
in Crossref have abstract metadata; 2,000 members have a full coverage
of their records with abstracts, while 1,000 don’t include any.
Deposition of ORCID iDs is growing but still very low, with only 10% of
records including ORCID iDs.
</p>
<p>
Affiliation metadata, broadly sought after by many stakeholders in the
scholarly ecosystem - not least because of its role as a key marker of
trust - is growing steadily but slowly: only 16% of records included it
at the end of March 2025. With recent improvements in our helper tools
(especially the latest version of the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/record-registration-form/">record
registration </a>form), and the upcoming developments in other
publishing software (notably the upcoming 3.5 version of OJS), which
support affiliation metadata better – we’re expecting a significant
improvement in the coming months.
</p>
<p>
As with affiliations, when research integrity judgements are concerned,
another key element is the funding information. The growing interest in
metadata among funders further strengthens the case for increasing
inclusion of funder information in this way, ideally including Crossref
grant DOIs that funders are registering in the hope of using the Grant
Linking System to help their assessment and evaluation work. At the
moment the space for improvement is vast, with only 6% of Crossref
metadata including funder IDs and award numbers.
</p>
<p>
We support ROR IDs in both affiliation and funding metadata, but
adoption among our members is slow. So far the top five contributors of
ROR IDs to Crossref are Fonds de recherche du Québec, eLife, American
Physical Society (APS), Optica Publishing Group, and Wellcome.
</p>
<p>
Licence metadata is currently included for 43% of records in Crossref,
and we see that thousands of members don’t include it. Not all members
realise that this is a practical challenge for their authors, as it
hinders institutions and funders who seek to monitor compliance with
their openness mandates.
</p>
<p>
Finally, references metadata is the lifeblood of the research nexus,
supporting transparency and discoverability of scholarship. We’ve got
44% coverage of reference metadata across records registered in
Crossref. While
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reference-linking/">reference
linking</a> is a member obligation, including references in the metadata
is a recommended best practice. The way references are recognised and
included in works varies by publication type and discipline, which makes
it harder for some members to provide it.
</p>
<p>
There’s an ongoing need to raise awareness about the role of metadata
among the wider community, including editors and researchers. We have
collaborated with practitioners, supporters, and users of metadata to
develop relevant resources as part of the
<a href="https://metadata2020.org" target="_blank">Metadata 20/20
initiative</a>.
</p>
<p>
We make efforts to educate our members about best practices when it
comes to registering their metadata with us and offer a range of support
options, including
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/tech-support/8" target="_blank">technical
support on our Community Forum</a>. Recognising the leaders in metadata
participation is part of that process too. With the upcoming blog series
from our awardees, we hope to spur peer-to-peer learning to facilitate
widespread improvements and to raise the profile of metadata quality
among the community.
