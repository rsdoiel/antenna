storage closet to metadata champions: ASM’s journey toward a smarter
scholarly infrastructure</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://asm.org/" target="_blank">American Society for
Microbiology (ASM)</a> has earned recognition in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Crossref’s
Participation Reports</a> for its exceptional metadata coverage among
large publishing members––an achievement built on intentional change,
technical investment, and collaborative work. In this Q&amp;A, the ASM
team shares what that journey looked like, the challenges they’ve
tackled, and how centering metadata has helped them better connect
research with the global scientific community.

A key lesson we learned is that meaningful progress doesn’t require

<a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/nhmg5-3ra76" target="_blank">Since we
first featured your metadata efforts in 2022</a>, what developments or
improvements have you made—and how does this new recognition reflect the
journey so far?
</h3>
<p>
Once we completed our initial metadata cleanup of our backfile and made
sure that we were producing good, clean, and consistent Crossref
metadata (no small feat), we realized that each new policy, process, or
even style change should be viewed through a metadata capture lens. By
looking at our publishing goals through that lens, we are better able to
see the right time and method to help enrich and “grow” both our article
metadata breadth and depth. Much of the metadata work is invisible or an
afterthought. But the recognition of ASM’s coverage in the participation
reports has affirmed that our change in perspective — shifting from
viewing Crossref metadata as something produced as an afterthought to
centering our processes around the creation of that metadata — has put
us on the right path.
</p>
<h3 id="have-any-of-your-goals-around-metadata-changed-or-grown-since-then-what-feels-different-about-your-work-now-compared-to-when-you-were-first-featured">
Have any of your goals around metadata changed or grown since then? What
feels different about your work now compared to when you were first
featured?
</h3>
<p>
When we first started on our various metadata cleanup projects, it felt
like there were just a few of us, arguing, agreeing, and arguing some
more about obscure tagging structures and proper XML modeling in a
closet––literally… My office actually was an old storage closet, and my
pre-pandemic whiteboard still has that ghostly blue haze of angle
brackets scribbled with dry-erase markers.
</p>
<p>
Since then, our goals have shifted significantly. Early on, we just
wanted all our content mapped to DOIs; then we thought, “Oh wait. Let’s
include as many abstracts as possible. And references. If we have the
data, let’s send it.” Now that we have a strong metadata foundation, we
can think proactively about what to capture and transmit, how we want to
prioritize our efforts, and how to make research we publish more
discoverable to those who need it.
</p>
<h3 id="looking-back-were-there-any-changes-in-internal-collaboration-or-external-partnerships-that-influenced-your-progress">
Looking back, were there any changes in internal collaboration or
external partnerships that influenced your progress?
</h3>
<p>
Over the past three to four years, we have made some significant changes
to our partnerships. We migrated to a new online platform (Atypon), a
new production partner (Kriyadocs), a new submission platform
(Chronoshub), and a new billing system (RLSC). Each of these
partnerships allowed us to evaluate how we were capturing metadata, when
that capture occurred, and how best to improve the QC process to ensure
accuracy and quality. These partnerships accelerated all our efforts to
improve hidden metadata and finally brought them out of the storage
closet into the light.
</p>
<h3 id="have-you-adopted-any-new-tools-standards-or-technologies-since-your-last-blog">
Have you adopted any new tools, standards, or technologies since your
last blog?
</h3>
<p>
Our production software (Kriyadocs) has centered metadata capture as a
core function. We have processes and procedures that match all
affiliations to Ringgold and
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/">ROR IDs</a>. We have
invested heavily in partnerships with organizations like Chronoshub to
utilize natural language processing, automating the identification of
authors and affiliations, so that users no longer have to fill out
tedious forms. We embraced
<a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a> and strongly
encourage all authors to register for one if they don’t already have it.
We have also adopted
<a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/z39104-2022-credit" target="_blank">the
CRediT taxonomy</a> as a contributor framework and have built processes
to make it easy for authors to stay within that taxonomy.
</p>
<h3 id="have-you-encountered-any-challenges-in-curating-or-improving-your-metadata-if-so--what-were-they-and-how-did-you-address-those">
Have you encountered any challenges in curating or improving your
metadata? If so – what were they and how did you address those?
</h3>
<p>
The core problem (from our perspective) has always been the difference
between author profile information and what is actually submitted in
manuscripts. Auto-extraction of manuscript data into submission forms is
one small step toward unifying author identity with manuscript data. One
of our biggest pain points now is reconciling the chaotic data on author
affiliations in manuscripts with institutional identifiers. Over the
next year, this will be one of our main initiatives.
</p>
<h3 id="can-you-share-any-examples-where-high-quality-metadata-clearly-benefited-your-organization-community-or-publishing-processes">
Can you share any examples where high-quality metadata clearly benefited
your organization, community, or publishing processes?
</h3>
<p>
The capture of ORCID IDs has improved our ability to match papers to
editors and identify hidden conflicts of interest. ORCID IDs have also
helped us expand our reviewer pool, as they enable us to better
disambiguate individuals with similar names.
</p>
<p>
Because we now capture CRediT roles in a controlled manner (rather than
as loose text in the acknowledgments section), we are better able to
identify when authors are contributing equally and how authors determine
author order in the byline when this occurs.
<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00646-24" target="_blank">This
analysis</a> was undertaken by one of our Editors-in-Chief to study
gender bias when authors contributed equally to a work. Now that we
capture CRediT roles as structured data, we can build on his research.
</p>
<p>
In the last two years, we have also begun capturing Data Availability
Statements and Ethics Statements in unique metadata fields (rather than
as unstructured text in the body of an article or in the acknowledgments
sections) because some of our editors are curious about open data policy
compliance and whether there is higher uptake of open science
initiatives in certain microbiology fields.
</p>
<p>
<strong>RC: These are very interesting and quite profound results,
especially for integrity and equality in the publishing process! Good to
see how useful you find this information as we’re approaching our schema
updates to include contributor roles, among other things. I see that
editors are already on board and taking advantage of high quality
metadata. Are authors more engaged with metadata now than
before?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Our authors likely are engaged too––though we have tried to build author
metadata QC into our proofing and typesetting process in such a way that
they wouldn’t even notice.
</p>
<h3 id="what-challenges-have-you-encountered-while-sustaining-or-scaling-your-metadata-work">
What challenges have you encountered while sustaining or scaling your
metadata work?
</h3>
<p>
In the realm of metadata, there are two standard solutions: 1) hire
vendors to clean data at the end (the throw-people-at-the-problem
philosophy); or 2) trust a black-box technical solution. The problem
with the first method is that it is inefficient and can become
expensive. The issue with the second is that, in my experience, most
technical solutions have an 80% success rate. That may be acceptable for
certain types of data, but it can fail spectacularly at the worst
possible moment.
</p>
<p>
For example, let’s say you find a technical solution that parses
affiliation data in such a way as to assign a PID. Great, wonderful.
Let’s say your parser is the best natural language processor in the
world and makes matches 90% of the time (if you have one that does this,
I’m all ears). You announce that you are including these IDs. Everyone
cheers. It is great, right? Now, imagine you want to use those IDs to
identify subscribing institutions to offer discounts or fee-less
publishing for authors. You also want to use those IDs to send alerts to
institutional admins of publishing activity. In both situations,
achieving 90% accuracy simply won’t work. What we’ve learned is that
black-box technology and ’throw people at it’ philosophies cannot work
alone. Metadata curation must be a collaborative effort among authors,
publishers, funders, and institutions, where the information grows
throughout the research process.
</p>
<h3 id="whats-next-are-you-exploring-any-new-metadata-elements-or-areas-eg-funding-data-peer-review-metadata-preprints">
What’s next? Are you exploring any new metadata elements or areas (e.g.,
funding data, peer review metadata, preprints)?
</h3>
<p>
Over the next year, we will focus on CRediT identifiers and pass them to
Crossref, along with institutional PIDs (ROR, Ringgold, and ISNI). We
are also exploring various ways to capture peer reviewer activity and
contributions, which will inevitably lead us down new and interesting
paths.
</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-you-want-to-share">
Anything else you want to share?
</h3>
<p>
Here’s the thing about metadata that I wish I’d known when I started:
it’s not a project with a finish line. It’s more like tending a garden
that keeps growing in unexpected directions. Every time you think you’ve
got it figured out, someone invents a new identifier, or your authors
start doing something creative with their affiliations, or a funder
changes their requirements, and suddenly you’re back to the drawing
board.
</p>
<p>
But what I’ve also learned from our journey out of that metaphorical
(and literal) storage closet: the best metadata work happens when you
start thinking of it as infrastructure. Good metadata is like good
plumbing; when it’s working, nobody notices it, but when it’s not,
everything backs up and gets messy fast.
</p>
<p>
If you’re just starting this journey, my advice is this: don’t try to
boil the ocean (gosh, I still need to remember that one). Pick one
thing. Perhaps it could be ORCID IDs or institutional identifiers. Do it
really, really well. Then build on that success. And please, for the
love of all that is holy, invest in good partnerships. We couldn’t have
done any of this without partners who understood that metadata isn’t
just data entry; it’s the connective tissue of scholarly communication.
</p>
<p>
Of course, even with the best partners and aligned teams, there will
still be moments when you’ll sit dumbfounded in front of a screen where
an author’s affiliation that was listed as “Bloomberg School of Public
Health” matched to the identifier linked to the “Escuela Nacional de
Sanidad.” On those days, just remember: at least you’re not still
working in a storage closet with a haunted whiteboard.
</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>
Good metadata is more than just a technical specification, and it’s not
just for those XML wonks and nerds. It’s a service to science, and its
core mission is to help us understand the world around us.

</blockquote>
<p>
<cite>– David Haber, ASM</cite>
</p>
</div>
<p>
ASM’s story is a reminder that building a strong metadata infrastructure
isn’t just about meeting technical requirements—it’s about aligning
people, tools, and values around the idea that clean, connected, and
consistent metadata is foundational to open and discoverable research.
Whether you’re starting small or overhauling major systems, their
experience shows what’s possible when you treat metadata not as a
checkbox, but as a core part of scholarly publishing.
