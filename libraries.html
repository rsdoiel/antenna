id="reflections-from-crossref-accra-2025---strengthening-open-science-and-partnerships-in-ghana">Reflections
from Crossref Accra 2025 - Strengthening open science and partnerships
in Ghana</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-29, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Crossref is a membership organisation, and it’s the global community of
members that creates the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">Research
Nexus</a> together. Meeting our community locally is a highlight and an
important learning experience. This year, we started by connecting with
a growing community in Accra, Ghana - our first in-person event in the
country included in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">our GEM
program</a>. From 14 members in 2023 to 31 in 2025, our community in
Ghana is blooming.
</p>
<p>
At its core, Crossref Accra 2025 was about showing up for the community
in Ghana - listening, learning, and building together. On the 20th of
March, we welcomed 66 participants: journal editors, university staff,
librarians, and researchers. People who are doing the real work of
making scholarly publishing happen in the region.

<p>
We started the day with a
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/">walkthrough of Crossref’s
services</a>, then shifted into more tailored conversations - talking
metadata quality, improving discoverability, and making Crossref tools
work for the local context. The panel featuring
<a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajol" target="_blank">AJOL</a>,
<a href="https://wacren.net/en/" target="_blank">WACREN</a>, and
<a href="https://www.carligh.org/" target="_blank">CARLIGH</a> was a key
moment. We heard honest reflections about journal sustainability, the
barriers to indexing, and how Open Access can grow if local
infrastructure is supported. Each organisation shared how they’re
working to strengthen research communities and where they see Crossref
fitting into that bigger picture.

<p>
During the dedicated listening session, participants spoke candidly
about the cost burden of APCs, the over-reliance on foreign journals for
recognition, and the uphill battle local journals face, from limited
resources to slow workflows. There was a clear push for stronger local
publishing platforms and more training around
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/ojs-plugin/">tools
like OJS</a>. People want technical clarity: How does Crossref fit into
their workflows? What’s involved in registering metadata and DOIs?
What’s the actual value? Many also voiced interest in strengthening
relationships with indexing services, and connecting university presses
more directly with Crossref. The afternoon breakout sessions were
hands-on. One group explored how to use the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reports/participation-reports/">Participation
Reports</a> to check metadata completeness, while the other dove into
using
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/">the
Crossref API</a>. People started swapping tips, asking questions, and
brainstorming ways to improve how their institutions handle metadata.
Several wanted to know how to automate more of their workflows through
OJS, boost reference linking, and pull better reports from the Crossref
system.

<p>
Outside the main event, we also visited some of our members and stopped
by the <a href="https://aau.org/" target="_blank">Association of African
Universities</a>. These visits gave us more time for deeper
conversations about publishing workflows, ORCID uptake, metadata
visibility, and the bigger picture of Open Access in Ghana. We heard a
lot about the potential for more equitable partnerships and stronger
local ownership of publishing infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Post-event feedback made one thing clear: people want more opportunities
to learn - more practical workshops, more guidance on using Crossref
tools, and more support navigating the technical side of things. There’s
growing interest in forming a local user group, a space to keep sharing,
troubleshooting, and moving forward together. And the desire to improve
indexing and visibility was a recurring theme. People see registering
identifiers for content as an essential step on that journey. There’s
also a broader concern about long-term sustainability and ethical
publishing practices. Many journals are doing their best in tough
conditions, and there’s a real appetite for honest conversations about
quality, trust, and resilience.

Crossref Accra 2025 reminded us how valuable these local gatherings are
- not just for sharing tools and workflows, but for building lasting
connections. We’re grateful to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/ambassadors/">our
Ambassadors</a> and team who helped make it happen, and we’re committed
to deepening our support across the region. There’s so much potential in
Ghana’s scholarly community, and in West Africa more broadly, as we’ve
seen again at WACREN in Senegal a couple of weeks later. We’re committed
to working with local partners to help it grow.

<h2 id="enhancing-doi-accessibility-for-all-users">Enhancing DOI
Accessibility for All Users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<h2 id="2025-update">
2025 Update
</h2>
<p>
In 2022, we set out to update our DOI display guidelines with the
intention to adopt
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.crossref.org/blog/accessibility-for-crossref-doi-links-call-for-comments-on-proposed-new-guidelines/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1743783400818874&amp;usg=AOvVaw1nQSWSpVDD3j4Hbeo-Hb_g" target="_blank">the
proposals</a> in 2025. It’s important to note from the outset that we
are not mandating any immediate changes to the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/display-guidelines/" target="_blank">DOI
display guidelines</a>. Instead, we are working with our community to
co-create a solution that addresses the diverse needs of all users,
rather than imposing technical changes that may not suit everyone.
</p>
<h2 id="background">
Background
</h2>
<p>
DOI links are the lifeblood of scholarly communication. They’re the
canonical identifiers that enable researchers to find, cite, and assess
academic work. In essence, they’re stable, reliable, and easy to
use—provided you can see them. But what happens when a user can’t rely
on visual cues?
</p>
<h2 id="the-accessibility-challenge">
The Accessibility Challenge
</h2>
<p>
For users of screen readers and other assistive technologies, the full
value of a DOI link can be lost. While sighted users benefit from the
context surrounding a DOI link—such as the title, abstract, and other
metadata—screen reader users often hear just the bare URL. This means
they might not know what content the DOI link represents, leading to
confusion and a diminished browsing experience.
</p>
<p>
The problem is compounded by the technical nature of DOI links. Being
URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), they don’t naturally lend
themselves to the same accessibility techniques as standard URLs. When
we attempted to tweak DOI links directly, every change that improved
accessibility for one group inadvertently hindered another. Whether it
was a WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) rule or an ARIA
(Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attribute, a solution that
worked in one area would break in another.
</p>
<h2 id="a-community-driven-approach">
A Community-Driven Approach
</h2>
<p>
Realizing that a one-size-fits-all fix wouldn’t work, we took a
different approach - one that involved the community from the outset.
After consulting with early adopters and attending an insightful session
with the <a href="https://jats4r.niso.org/" target="_blank">JATS4R</a>
accessibility group, it became clear that the answer lay in
experimentation and iteration. Rather than modifying the DOI display
guidelines immediately, we are developing a tool that enhances the user
experience without disrupting the current standards.
</p>
<p>
It’s worth noting that this solution places the responsibility on the
end user rather than on publishers and platform providers. However, by
doing so, users can have a consistent browsing experience regardless of
the platform they use to access scholarly content. This approach also
serves as an important stepping stone toward a future publisher-provided
solution—be it via accessibility-focused JavaScript or a mandated
dual-link implementation—and any efforts to recommend or mandate such
changes will benefit greatly from concrete evidence of the effectiveness
and scalability of this approach.

Introducing the DOI Accessibility Enhancer
</h2>
<p>
First
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBnfkOxVr6s&amp;t=1916s" target="_blank">demonstrated
at the recent Crossref Annual Meeting</a>, here we share our DOI
Accessibility Enhancer browser extension. Available now on the
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/crossref-doi-a11y-tool/" target="_blank">Firefox
Add-on Store</a> and the
<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/crossref-doi-accessibilit/nmpnpkdfcdnbnpiekngokijfoilpfpbc" target="_blank">Chrome
Web Store</a>, this extension is designed to improve the experience of
DOI links for screen reader users without altering the default behavior
for sighted users.

</div>
<h2 id="how-it-works">
How It Works
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Scanning for DOI Links:</strong> The extension scans any webpage
for DOI links.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Querying Metadata:</strong> Once a DOI is detected, it queries
the Crossref REST API to retrieve the title of the corresponding
scholarly work.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Enhancing the Link:</strong> The title is then injected as a
screen-reader–only link. This means that when a screen reader user
navigates to the DOI, they hear the title of the paper rather than the
opaque URL.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Maintaining Visual Integrity:</strong> For sighted users, the
original DOI link remains unchanged—visible, clickable, and easy to
copy-and-paste.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Highlighting for Testing:</strong> An optional feature
highlights updated links, making it easier for developers and testers to
see the changes in action.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="get-involved">
Get Involved
</h2>
<p>
This project is very much a community effort. The extension is
open-source, and we welcome feedback and contributions via our
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/doi-accessibility-enhancer" target="_blank">GitLab
repository</a>, email, or
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/" target="_blank">Community
Forum</a>. Your real-life experiences and insights will drive future
improvements, ensuring that our solution meets the diverse needs of all
users.

</div>
<p>
If you’re using Firefox, head over to the Firefox Add-on Store and
install the
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/crossref-doi-a11y-tool/" target="_blank">DOI
Accessibility Enhancer</a> today. If you’re a Chrome user, you can find
the extension directly in the
<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/crossref-doi-accessibilit/nmpnpkdfcdnbnpiekngokijfoilpfpbc" target="_blank">Chrome
Web Store</a>. If you use a screen reader you’ll experience the
difference firsthand - and if you don’t, give it a try with VoiceOver
enabled (Command-F5 on a Mac).
</p>
<p>
Together, we can advance scholarly accessibility and ensure that
critical research remains discoverable for everyone.
