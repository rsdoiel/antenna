<h2 id="research-integrity-roundtable-2024">Research Integrity
Roundtable 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-15, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
For the third year in a row, Crossref hosted a roundtable on research
integrity prior to the Frankfurt book fair. This year the event looked
at
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/crossmark/" target="_blank">Crossmark</a>,
our tool to display retractions and other post-publication updates to
readers.
</p>
<p>
Since the start of 2024, we have been carrying out a
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossmark-community-consultation-what-did-we-learn/" target="_blank">consultation
on Crossmark</a>, gathering feedback and input from a range of members.
The roundtable discussion was a chance to check and refine some of the
conclusions we’ve come to, and gather more suggestions on the way
forward. As in previous years, we were able to include a range of
organisations, which led to lively and interesting discussions. See
below for the full participant list.
</p>
<h2 id="crossmark-feedback">
Crossmark feedback
</h2>
<p>
We started by presenting Crossmark and a summary of the consultation
process. There are a number of areas where we have learned more about
how the community operates or found that Crossmark needs to adapt. These
include:
</p>
<p>
<em>Implementation</em>: Our members have struggled to implement
Crossmark and uptake is low. At the same time, in many organisations the
workflows for handling retractions are not well-defined because they are
rarely used, if ever. The responsibility for updating Crossref metadata
can be unclear and this may be a factor in the low uptake.
</p>
<p>
<em>Education</em>: There are different levels of understanding about
how to handle retractions. Some members are very defensive when asked
about retractions, others state they will never make updates to
published works. How can we have a constructive conversation where the
value of communicating updates appropriately is recognised?
</p>
<p>
<em>Community engagement</em>: Given the different scales, locations,
disciplines, and technologies used by our members, it looks like one
size will not fit all when it comes to updates. How can we get
continual, representative feedback on new tools and processes?
</p>
<p>
<em>Metadata assertions</em>: Crossmark allows the deposit of metadata
using custom field names, however this metadata seems to have low
usefulness and is not highly valued by the community. Should we continue
to collect it? Can we make some of the most-used field names part of our
standard schema?
</p>
<p>
<em>Changing the Crossmark UI</em>: Although we didn’t specifically ask
about it during the consultation, the look of the Crossref logo often
came up, and concern that it is not recognised and not well-used. Can we
change the look and behaviour so that it has more impact?
</p>
<h2 id="niso-recommendations">
NISO Recommendations
</h2>
<p>
Patrick Hargitt represented the NISO group on
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/crec" target="_blank">Communication
of Retractions, Removals, and Expressions of Concern (CREC)</a>. The
group’s recommendations were published earlier this year and cover how
retractions are communicated. CREC arose from an earlier project,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-022-00125-x" target="_blank">IRSRS</a>.
A large part of the motivation is that retracted works continued to be
cited, with citing authors apparently unaware of the retraction. Patrick
presented the CREC recommendations, which cover:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Metadata receipt, display, and distribution,
</li>
<li>
Which metadata elements to communicate,
</li>
<li>
How to implement the recommendations,
</li>
<li>
Discussion of some special cases,
</li>
<li>
Key stakeholders and their responsibilities.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The two presentations prompted discussion, which was taken into the
first of two workshops.
</p>
<h2 id="first-workshop-improving-collection-of-retractions-and-crossmark">
First workshop: Improving collection of retractions and Crossmark
</h2>
<p>
The first workshop looked at proposed changes to Crossmark and how to
encourage more members to deposit their retractions, corrections, and
other post-publication updates. Several important themes emerged.
</p>
<p>
First, the question of whose responsibility it should be to provide
metadata on retractions and similar updates. Crossref has a
responsibility to work with the community to obtain high quality and
complete metadata; publishers should take responsibility for handling
issues of research integrity and reporting them to relevant downstream
services, like Crossref; and platforms need to provide tools that allow
easy reporting of retractions.
</p>
<p>
The value of Crossmark appearing in PDFs was reiterated. The fact that a
PDF can be downloaded, and years later there is a way to tell whether it
has been retracted or not is highly valued. There was also the
suggestion that the Crossmark logo on web pages can indicate a change
before it has been clicked. This is something that we have been
considering at Crossref and it was useful to have the idea reinforced.
Another suggestion was that a browser plugin would make a good
complement to Crossmark.
</p>
<p>
Implementation issues with Crossmark were raised, including that it’s
difficult to validate whether a specific implementation is complete.
There are a number of different changes (to metadata deposit and
content, and websites) that need to work together to have Crossmark
fully functional. There were several questions and a discussion about
Retraction Watch data. Some were about understanding its collection and
validation. A number of participants are actively using the data and it
was great to see the variety of applications.
</p>
<h2 id="second-workshop-community-use-of-retraction-metadata">
Second workshop: Community use of retraction metadata
</h2>
<p>
The second workshop focused on a broader set of downstream organisations
that might want to make use of retraction metadata. We looked at
stakeholders and their needs, and attempted to match them up with
existing tools. Several gaps were identified as a result, which may
provide opportunities for new services or collaborations to fill them.
</p>
<p>
We identified a number of tools available for publishers, editorial
systems, metadata researchers, and readers. A good example is reference
managers, many of which are now highlighting retracted works to authors.
This can help to reduce the number of retracted works being cited.
Publishing platforms are also providing support to editors, using tools
that include retraction metadata.
</p>

<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/frankfurt-roundtable-workshop2-postits.jpg"
alt="A whiteboard showing post-it notes from the second workshop." width="40%">
</figure>
</center>
<p>
Some of the stakeholders identified have limited tools for identifying
retractions that are relevant to them. These include funders, archives
and repositories, journalists, and institutions.
</p>
<p>
Often, there are pathways for retraction data to be communicated but
they are not being sufficiently used. There needs to be a concerted
effort to improve the quality of retraction metadata for tools to
function better. For example, a second author on a paper might not know
that a correction or retraction is planned for their article. If their
email or ORCID isn’t included in the metadata, an alerting tool wouldn’t
be able to let them know. A similar argument can be made for
institutions or funders if they are not well-identified in the metadata.
</p>
<p>
The question of standardisation of metadata was raised. It seems too
early to implement a full set of standards at the moment. CREC and
similar initiatives have documented and accommodated for a range of
practices while providing guidance and principles to work towards. More
discussion is needed in the community to work out paths that could be
applied across the broad spectrum of scholarly communication.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
The event was very valuable in bringing up a range of topics related to
retraction and communication of post-publication changes to scholarly
works. We are grateful to all of the participants for their
contributions and sharing their diverse experience and opinions with us.
</p>
<p>
Research integrity is an area of flux, with significant changes over the
past few years. While there has been progress, there remain gaps in
metadata and tools to communicate retractions. This is something that
Crossref will continue to contribute to, and Crossmark clearly still has
a role to play.
</p>
<p>
Some of the ideas and suggestions from the discussion can be implemented
in the near future. Others need further development, and we will
continue to engage the community. Reading this, there may be topics
where you feel you have a role to play. We are keen to partner with
other organisations in this space as we continue to improve the
transparency and communication of metadata for post-publication updates.
