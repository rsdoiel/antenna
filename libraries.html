id="sprinting-to-progress-behind-the-scenes-of-our-first-metadata-sprint">Sprinting
to Progress: Behind the scenes of our first metadata sprint</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
If you take a peek at our blog, you’ll notice that metadata and
community are the most frequently used categories. This is not a
coincidence – ommunity is central to everything we do at Crossref. Our
first-ever Metadata Sprint was a natural step in strengthening both.
<em>Cue fanfare!</em>. And what better way of celebrating 25 years of
Crossref?
</p>
<p>
We designed the Crossref Metadata Sprint as a relatively short event
where people can form teams and tackle short problems. What kind of
problems? While we expected many to involve coding, teams also explored
documenting, translating, researching—anything that taps into our open,
member-curated metadata. Our motivation behind this format was to create
a space for networking, collaboration, and feedback, centered on
co-creation using the scholarly metadata from our REST API, the Public
Data File, and other sources.
</p>
<h2 id="what-have-we-learned-in-planning">
What have we learned in planning
</h2>
<p>
The journey towards the event was filled with valuable lessons and
learnings from our community. Our initial call received submissions from
71 people, which was exciting but presented the first challenge: we felt
our event would work better with a relatively smaller group. An
additional challenge we faced was the enthusiasm from people from
different regions of the world who were eager to join, but needed
support to attend in person. It reminded us how global our community is,
and how important it is to think about different ways of making
participation possible, especially in future events.
</p>
<p>
We also wanted to make sure that participation wasn’t limited by
technical background. The selection process included a preliminary
review by several members of our team to bring in a mix of perspectives
and reduce bias. The event welcomed participants from all kinds of
expertise levels, including colleagues who had never worked with APIs
before. We sought to provide common ground for all with several group
calls, where we presented introductions to our tools and used the
opportunity to collect requests about tools, specific data, and
questions from the participants that could enhance their preparation
during the sprint.
</p>
<h2 id="at-the-crossref-metadata-sprint">
At the Crossref Metadata Sprint
</h2>
<p>
I’ve recently stumbled upon the following quote from a recognized data
scientist:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a
clear and convincing voice. (Stephen Few)
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It made me think that we can replace <em>numbers</em> for
<em>metadata</em> and the idea still holds. Surrounded by the
paleontological collections of the National Museum of Natural History,
on 8th of April in Madrid, 21 participants and 5 Crossref staff came
together to work on twelve different projects. These ranged from
improvements to our Public Data file formats and exploring metadata
completeness, to tackling multilingual metadata challenges,
understanding citation impact for retracted works, and connecting
Retraction Watch metadata with other knowledge graphs metadata. <br>

The different teams that participated in the first Crossref Metadata
Sprint.
</center>
<br> The initial hours were the most energetic (but not chaotic!) as
most of the participants had the chance to interact in person for the
first time, ideas were exchanged, and pre-formed groups became more
stable (however, one of the advantages of the format is that teams don’t
have to be rigid). Twelve coffee- and tea-powered projects started
taking shape, a few of which are part of larger ideas under development.
By the end of the second day, we saw:
<ul>
<li>
Author changes between preprints and published articles.
</li>
<li>
Coverage of funding information by publisher.
</li>
<li>
Enriching citations with Crossref metadata.
</li>
<li>
Funding metadata completeness.
</li>
<li>
Improvement to the Public Data File.
</li>
<li>
Interoperability between Crossref DOIs and hash-based identifiers.
</li>
<li>
University of Tetova’s metadata coverage.
</li>
<li>
Retraction Watch data mash-up.
</li>
<li>
Perspective about AI-driven multilingual metadata.
</li>
<li>
Public Data File in Google Big Query.
</li>
<li>
Visibility of retractions across citations.
</li>
<li>
Visualising Crossref geographic member data.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our team worked as part of some of these projects, providing valuable
insights and feedback to the participants. We ended the first session
with a group dinner and re-energised for the second day, which started
with everybody fully immersed in their tasks. As we approached the
conclusion, the groups started preparing some quick slides for a short
presentation (that you can find
<a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/gpvx-dbde" target="_blank">here</a>).
</p>
<p>
Our team and the participants left excited and looking forward to the
next opportunity to collaborate. We certainly see the potential of
recreating these spaces, and we’ll work on future editions in a
different location. All of the project summaries and notes will remain
stored in our
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/metadata-sprint-2025/" target="_blank">metadata
sprint Gitlab repo</a>. Would you like to know more about any of these
ideas? Let us know in the comments.
