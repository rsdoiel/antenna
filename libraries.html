<h2 id="editorial">Editorial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Cod4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Welcome to a new issue of Code4Lib Journal! We hope you like the new
articles.</p>
<p>We are happy with Issue 59, although putting it together was a
challenge for the Editorial Board. This was in no small part because
Issue 58 was so tumultuous, including a crisis over our unintentional
publication of personally identifiable information, a subsequent
internal review by the Editorial Board, an
<a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/18040">Extra
Editorial</a>, and much self-reflection. All of this (quite rightly)
slowed down our work. Several Editorial Board members resigned, which
left us with a much smaller team to handle a larger workload. As a
volunteer-run organization without a revenue stream, Code4Lib Journal is
a labor of love that we all complete off the side of our overfilled
desks. It was demoralizing to feel that we had lost the support of many
in our community. A lot of us were tempted to quit rather than try to
pick up and carry on. So, although we have published Issue 59 later than
planned, and with a different coordinating editor, we made it. This
issue is testament to the perseverance of my colleagues on the Editorial
Board, and to the wonderful articles contributed by our community.</p>

PREMIS Events Through an Event-Sourced Lens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Cod4Lib Journal</p>
<p>The PREMIS Editorial Committee (EC) read Ross Spencer’s recent
article “PREMIS Events Through an Event-sourced Lens” with interest. The
article was a useful primer to the idea of event sourcing and in
particular was an interesting introduction to a conversation about
whether and how such a model could be applied to Digital Preservation
systems.</p>
<p>However, the article makes a number of specific assertions and
suggestions about PREMIS, with which we on the PREMIS EC disagree. We
believe these are founded on an incorrect or incomplete understanding of
what PREMIS actually is, and as significantly, what it is not.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to address those specific points.</p>

Open-Source Digital Collections: What We Need, What We Want, and What We
Can Afford</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Cod4Lib Journal</p>
<p>After 15 years of providing access to our digital collections through
CONTENTdm, the University of Louisville Libraries changed direction, and
migrated to Hyku, a self-hosted open-source digital repository. This
article details the complexities of customizing an open-source
repository, offering lessons on balancing sustainability via
standardization with the costs of developing new code to accommodate
desired features. The authors explore factors in deciding to create a
Hyku instance and what we learned in the implementation process.
Emphasizing the customizations applied, the article illustrates our
unexpected detours and necessary considerations to get to “done.” This
narrative serves as a resource for institutions considering similar
transitions.</p>

per Use in Power BI using Alma Analytics and a Dash of Python</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Cod4Lib Journal</p>
<p>A trio of personnel at University of Oregon Libraries explored
options for automating a pathway to ingest, store, and visualize cost
per use data for continuing resources. This paper presents a pipeline
for using Alma, SUSHI, COUNTER5, Python, and Power BI to create a tool
for data-driven decision making. By establishing this pipeline, we shift
the time investment from manually harvesting usage statistics to
interpreting the data and sharing it with stakeholders. The resulting
visualizations and collected data will assist in making informed,
collaborative decisions.</p>

id="launching-an-intranet-in-libguides-cms-at-the-georgia-southern-university-libraries">Launching
an Intranet in LibGuides CMS at the Georgia Southern University
Libraries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Cod4Lib Journal</p>
<p>During the 2021-22 academic year, the Georgia Southern University
Libraries launched an intranet within the LibGuides CMS (LibGuides)
platform. While LibGuides had been in use at Georgia Southern for more
than 10 years, it was used most heavily by the reference librarians.
Library staff in other roles tended not to have accounts, nor to have
used LibGuides. Meanwhile, the Libraries had a need for a structured
intranet, and the larger university did not provide enterprise level
software intended for intranet use. This paper describes launching an
intranet, including determining what software features are necessary and
reworking software and user permissions to provide these features,
change management by restructuring permissions within an established and
heavily used software platform, and training to introduce libraries
employees to the intranet. Now, more than a year later, the intranet is
used within the libraries for important functions, like training,
sharing information about resources available to employees, for
coordinating events and programming, and to provide structure to a
document repository in Google Shared Drive. Employees across the
libraries use the intranet to more efficiently complete necessary work.
This article steps through desired features and software settings in
LibGuides to support use as an intranet.</p>

Dangers of Building Your Own Python Applications: False-Positives,
Unknown Publishers, and Code Licensing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Cod4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Making Python applications is hard, but not always in the way you
expect. In an effort to simplify our archival workflows, I set out to
discover how to make standalone desktop applications for our archivists
and processors to make frequently used workflows easier and more
intuitive. Coming from an archivists’ background with some Python
knowledge, I learned how to code things like Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs), to create executable (binary) files, and to generate software
installers for Windows. Navigating anti-virus software flagging your
files as malware, Microsoft Windows throwing warning messages about
downloading software from unknown publishers (rightly so), and
disentangling licensing changes to a previously freely-available Python
library all posed unexpected hurdles that I’m still grappling with. In
this article, I will share my journey of creating, distributing, and
dealing with the aftereffects of making Python-based applications for
our users and provide advice on what to look out for if you’re looking
to do something similar.</p>

the Bliss Bibliographic Classification to SKOS RDF using Python
RDFLib</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Cod4Lib Journal</p>
<p>This article discusses the project undertaken by the library of
Queens’ College, Cambridge, to migrate its classification system to RDF
applying the SKOS data model using Python. Queens’ uses the Bliss
Bibliographic Classification alongside 18 other UK libraries, most of
which are small libraries of the colleges at the Universities of Oxford
and Cambridge. Though a flexible and universal faceted classification
system, Bliss faces challenges due to its unfinished state, leading to
the evolution in many Bliss libraries of divergent, in-house adaptations
of the system to fill in its gaps. For most of the official, published
parts of Bliss, a uniquely formatted source code used to generate a
typeset version is available online. This project focused on converting
this source code into a SKOS RDF linked-data format using Python: first
by parsing the source code, then using RDFLib to write the concepts,
notation, relationships, and notes in RDF. This article suggests that
the RDF version has the potential to prevent further divergence and
unify the various Bliss adaptations and reflects on the limitations of
SKOS when applied to complex, faceted systems.</p>

Subject Indexing: A Python-Powered Approach in KBR, the National Library
of Belgium</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Cod4Lib Journal</p>
<p>This paper details the National Library of Belgium’s (KBR)
exploration of automating the subject indexing process for their
extensive collection using Python scripts. The initial exploration
involved creating a reference dataset and automating the classification
process using MARCXML files. The focus is on demonstrating the
practicality, adaptability, and user-friendliness of the Python-based
solution. The authors introduce their unique approach, emphasizing the
semantically significant words in subject determination. The paper
outlines the Python workflow, from creating the reference dataset to
generating enriched bibliographic records. Criteria for an optimal
workflow, including ease of creation and maintenance of the dataset,
transparency, and correctness of suggestions, are discussed. The paper
highlights the promising results of the Python-powered approach,
showcasing two specific scripts that create a reference dataset and
automate subject indexing. The flexibility and user-friendliness of the
Python solution are emphasized, making it a compelling choice for
libraries seeking efficient and maintainable solutions for subject
indexing projects.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>
We often think of bullying as a childhood issue, but people can take
that behavior to the workplace. The scourge of workplace bullying, and
its harmful effects on mental health, needs to be recognized and
addressed.
