<h2 id="version-5.4.0-metadata-schema-update-now-available">Version
5.4.0 metadata schema update now available</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
This year, metadata development is one of our key priorities and we’re
making a start with the release of version 5.4.0 of our input schema
with some long-awaited changes. This is the first in what will be a
series of metadata schema updates.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-in-this-update">
What is in this update?
</h2>
<h3 id="publication-typing-for-citations">
Publication typing for citations
</h3>
<p>
This is fairly simple; we’ve added a ‘type’ attribute to the citations
members supply. This means you can identify a journal article citation
as a journal article, but more importantly, you can identify a dataset,
software, blog post, or other citation that may not have an identifier
assigned to it. This makes it easier for the many thousands of metadata
users to connect these citations to identifiers. We know many
publishers, particularly journal publishers, do collect this information
already and will consider making this change to deposit citation types
with their records.
</p>
<h3 id="support-for-version-numbering">
Support for version numbering
</h3>
<p>
Members can now supply a version number across all relevant record
types, including journal articles, book chapters, conference papers,
posted content/preprints, datasets, reports, standards, and
dissertations. The versioning update also includes an optional
description field.
</p>
<p>
Members who version content are encouraged to register a new DOI with
each version and supply the <code>isVersionOf</code>’ relationship to
connect versions to each other, facilitating the Research Nexus and
allowing members to avoid additional content registration fees, which
don’t apply for versions.
</p>
<h3 id="preprint-status">
Preprint status
</h3>
<p>
This is specific to the ‘posted content’ record type and comes as a
result of
the<a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/qzusj" target="_blank">recommendations</a>
of the Preprints Advisory Group. The new status field allows
repositories to flag a preprint as ‘withdrawn’ or ‘removed,’ a situation
specific to posted content.
</p>
<p>
There are some other minor updates as well, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An expansion of the language codes supported by a language attribute.
</li>
<li>
Additions to the archive locations we collect. Our membership terms ask
members to commit to archiving content, ensuring their DOIs are
persistent, and ask that the archive(s) they use are identified in the
metadata records registered with us.
</li>
<li>
We’ve increased the number of ISBNs supported per item from 6 to 100.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you would like to begin using this schema, a brief transition guide
is
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16peqiXX66l9w-VCsieiuNjzrXGNchNAhy9g7Q4dtlpA/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.
A full set of schema files are in our
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/schema/-/releases/0.3.3" target="_blank">GitLab
repository,</a> and more information is available in our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/metadata-deposit-schema-5-4-0/">website
documentation for schema 5.4.0</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">
What’s next?
</h2>
<p>
We’ve already begun working on our next update, which will be an
expansion of contributor roles. We’ll allow multiple contributor roles
instead of the single role we currently support, we’ll add
‘corresponding author’ and ‘other’ to the Crossref role vocabulary. We
will be also adding full support for
<a href="https://credit.niso.org/" target="_blank">CRediT</a>.
</p>
<p>
We’re also hoping to fit in a remodeling of our group contributor
(currently labeled ‘organization’ in our input schema) in the next
update, and I would appreciate
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NJlNS2DqlWgns-2pdNQ3xALmQasBFrujHgViu5t5Lz0/edit" target="_blank">feedback
on this planned update</a>.
</p>
<p>
More changes are planned, including an update to our grants schema, and
expanded support for abstracts. We’ll be circulating details about those
updates soon.
