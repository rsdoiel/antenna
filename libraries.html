<h2 id="scholarly-blogs-and-their-place-in-the-research-nexus">Scholarly
blogs and their place in the research nexus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
If you are reading this blog on our website, you may have noticed that
alongside each post we now list a Crossref DOI link, which was not the
case a few months ago (though we have retroactively added DOIs to all
older posts too). You can find the persistent link for this post right
above this paragraph. Go on, click on it, we’ll wait.
</p>
<p>
Are you back here? Good. As you probably expected, the DOI link for this
post resolves to the post itself, and you should use it anytime you want
to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reference-linking/">cite
this post</a>. But the DOI does more than just point readers to this
page––it is part of a rich metadata record that includes the authors’
ORCID iDs, the publication date, and more. In other words, the posts on
this blog are part of what we call the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">research
nexus</a>: the open network of relationships connecting research
outputs, people, organisations, and actions.

<h3 id="why-blogs-deserve-a-place-in-the-scholarly-record">
Why blogs deserve a place in the scholarly record
</h3>
<p>
A blog post may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think
of scholarly outputs. But scholarly blogs have been around since at
least the early 2000s and have carved out a niche for themselves as a
type of “grey literature” that allows researchers to write about
research in a way that may not fit neatly into more traditional,
peer-reviewed publishing venues, but also is too long-form for social
media. Science blogs can give readers a window into ongoing work that
isn’t ready to publish yet, serve as a self-publishing venue, or allow
researchers to comment on others’ work and recent developments in
science and science communication. These kinds of perspectives add
crucial context to the scholarly record that should not be overlooked.
</p>
<p>
However, as Martin Fenner
<a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/t8azz4brot" target="_blank">explained</a>
at the #Crossref2023 annual meeting, blogs have largely not benefitted
from the metadata and long-term archiving solutions that tend to be
applied to more “traditional” forms of publishing. As a result, most
blogs have been left out of the scholarly record. But in recent years,
there have been some efforts in the community to change this. Earlier
this year, ORCID added support for the work type <code>blog post</code>,
<a href="https://info.orcid.org/new-work-types/" target="_blank">among
others</a>, to align more closely with the Confederation of Open Access
Repositories (COAR) vocabulary of resource types.
</p>
<p>
At our
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15389087" target="_blank">2025
midyear community update</a>, we asked our community what content types
they saw as growing in importance. Blog posts were mentioned several
times as a ‘trending’ record type, and as one that members would like to
see support for in the Crossref system.
</p>
<h3 id="eating-our-own-dog-food">
Eating our own dog food
</h3>
<p>
We had already been thinking for a while about how our own blog should
be a part of the research nexus. We started out by
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/direct-deposit-xml/admin-tool/">manually
uploading XML files through our Admin tool</a> for each post. We did
this for a few months and quickly found, like many of our members do,
that this can be a laborious and error-prone process.
</p>
<p>
In the product management world, the process of using the products you
usually spend your time building and maintaining is often referred to as
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MS.2006.72" target="_blank">dogfooding</a>.
The idea is that firsthand experience makes it easier to understand your
end users’ needs and feel their pain - and we have certainly found that
registering metadata for our blog posts has reinforced the importance of
<a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/30vzx-r5x16" target="_blank">making
manual registration easier for our members</a>, but also of supporting
and enabling machine-to-machine integrations.
</p>
<h3 id="what-did-we-do">
What did we do?
</h3>
<p>
The Crossref website, which includes this blog, uses an open-source
static site generator named
<a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>. Rather than using
a content management system (CMS), we edit the website content in
Markdown format using code editors. Whenever we start working on a post
for this blog, we not only write the content of the post itself, but
also include some front matter for the page, which contains some key
metadata about the post.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/blog-front-matter-example.png"
alt="Screenshot of the front matter of a Crossref blog post in Hugo" width="65%">
<figcaption>
<p>

post</a> on this blog
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
We wanted this metadata to be part of the research nexus. But then there
was also the question of archiving. Our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/membership/terms/">membership
terms</a> state that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Member shall use best efforts to contract with a third-party archive
or other content host (an “Archive”) (a list of which can be found
<a href="https://keepers.issn.org/keepers" target="_blank">here</a>) for
such Archive to preserve the Member’s Content and, in the event that the
Member ceases to host the Member’s Content, to make such Content
available for persistent linking.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So we knew that if this blog was to be part of the scholarly record, we
would need to ensure that it would be available in perpetuity, even if
<a href="https://www.crossref.org" target="_blank">www.crossref.org</a>
were to go offline one day.
</p>
<p>
Doing this properly was starting to look like a sizeable project!
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, we knew that others had already done some great work in
this field, so we would not have to start from scratch. After
considering our options, we opted to integrate our blog with an
established workflow for registering blog metadata: the
<a href="https://rogue-scholar.org" target="_blank">Rogue Scholar</a>
service.
</p>
<p>
The Rogue Scholar was launched in 2023 by Martin Fenner as an archive
for scholarly blog posts, hosted by
<a href="https://front-matter.io" target="_blank">Front Matter</a>.
Rogue Scholar improves science blogs in important ways, including
full-text search, long-term archiving, and DOIs and metadata, such as
versions and relationships along with identifiers such as ORCID iDs and
ROR IDs. It provides the necessary tools to treat blog posts as research
outputs through better attribution, preservation, and discoverability.
</p>
<h3 id="how-did-we-do-it">
How did we do it?
</h3>
<p>
Rogue Scholar works on the basis of consuming RSS and ATOM feeds (you
may remember them from the days of getting headlines direct to your
browser or feed reader). We created a
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/feed.xml" target="_blank">new
feed</a>, including the proposed DOI as each entry’s <code>id:</code>
and taking full advantage of the ATOM format by listing the post’s
authors and including their ORCID iDs. We also provide the entire post
as the entry’s <code>&lt;content&gt;</code> to allow for full-text
indexing and archiving.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive">

post</a> on this blog
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
For each post, we generate and assign a unique DOI under the Crossref
prefix <code>10.64000</code>. The Rogue Scholar integration then
registers the DOI along with the metadata of the post as
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/posted-content-includes-preprints/">posted
content</a>. If you are interested in getting a similar workflow set up
for your blog, you can read more in the Rogue Scholar
<a href="https://doi.org/10.53731/fz73s-sv368" target="_blank">blog</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.rogue-scholar.org/" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-future-hold-for-scholarly-blogs">
What does the future hold for scholarly blogs?
</h3>
<p>
Researchers are increasingly sharing their early work, or commenting on
others’ work, in less formal ways, and if you look at the growth in the
number of blogs covered in the Rogue Scholar platform in just a couple
of years, it seems like science blogging is here to stay and will only
increase. We believe that this practice is an integral part of a healthy
scholarly ecosystem, and it needs to be represented in the research
nexus.
</p>
<p>
The Crossref input schema does not include a <code>blog</code> work
type, but we are planning to add it as a subtype of posted content in
our next schema update. We will discuss this and other plans and ideas
in the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/n23nw-3d593" target="_blank">metadata
advisory group</a> that we are currently forming.
</p>
<p>
If you have thoughts on the role of blogs in the public discourse around
science and science communications, or you would like to share your
experience of registering metadata for your blog, let us know by
commenting below. Your comments will be threaded in our
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/" target="_blank">community
forum</a> for discussion.

to Progress: Behind the scenes of our first metadata sprint</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
If you take a peek at our blog, you’ll notice that metadata and
community are the most frequently used categories. This is not a
coincidence – community is central to everything we do at Crossref. Our
first-ever Metadata Sprint was a natural step in strengthening both.
<em>Cue fanfare!</em>. And what better way of celebrating 25 years of
Crossref?
</p>
<p>
We designed the Crossref Metadata Sprint as a relatively short event
where people can form teams and tackle short problems. What kind of
problems? While we expected many to involve coding, teams also explored
documenting, translating, researching—anything that taps into our open,
member-curated metadata. Our motivation behind this format was to create
a space for networking, collaboration, and feedback, centered on
co-creation using the scholarly metadata from our REST API, the Public
Data File, and other sources.
</p>
<h2 id="what-have-we-learned-in-planning">
What have we learned in planning
</h2>
<p>
The journey towards the event was filled with valuable lessons and
learnings from our community. Our initial call received submissions from
71 people, which was exciting but presented the first challenge: we felt
our event would work better with a relatively smaller group. An
additional challenge we faced was the enthusiasm from people from
different regions of the world who were eager to join, but needed
support to attend in person. It reminded us how global our community is,
and how important it is to think about different ways of making
participation possible, especially in future events.
</p>
<p>
We also wanted to make sure that participation wasn’t limited by
technical background. The selection process included a preliminary
review by several members of our team to bring in a mix of perspectives
and reduce bias. The event welcomed participants from all kinds of
expertise levels, including colleagues who had never worked with APIs
before. We sought to provide common ground for all with several group
calls, where we presented introductions to our tools and used the
opportunity to collect requests about tools, specific data, and
questions from the participants that could enhance their preparation
during the sprint.

<p>
I’ve recently stumbled upon the following quote from a recognized data
scientist:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a
clear and convincing voice. (Stephen Few)
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It made me think that we can replace <em>numbers</em> for
<em>metadata</em> and the idea still holds. Surrounded by the
paleontological collections of the National Museum of Natural History,
on 8th of April in Madrid, 21 participants and 5 Crossref staff came
together to work on twelve different projects. These ranged from
improvements to our Public Data file formats and exploring metadata
completeness, to tackling multilingual metadata challenges,
understanding citation impact for retracted works, and connecting
Retraction Watch metadata with other knowledge graphs metadata. <br>

The different teams that participated in the first Crossref Metadata
Sprint.
</center>
<br> The initial hours were the most energetic (but not chaotic!) as
most of the participants had the chance to interact in person for the
first time, ideas were exchanged, and pre-formed groups became more
stable (however, one of the advantages of the format is that teams don’t
have to be rigid). Twelve coffee- and tea-powered projects started
taking shape, a few of which are part of larger ideas under development.
By the end of the second day, we saw:
<ul>
<li>
Author changes between preprints and published articles.
</li>
<li>
Coverage of funding information by publisher.
</li>
<li>
Enriching citations with Crossref metadata.
</li>
<li>
Funding metadata completeness.
</li>
<li>
Improvement to the Public Data File.
</li>
<li>
Interoperability between Crossref DOIs and hash-based identifiers.
</li>
<li>
University of Tetova’s metadata coverage.
</li>
<li>
Retraction Watch data mash-up.
</li>
<li>
Perspective about AI-driven multilingual metadata.
</li>
<li>
Public Data File in Google Big Query.
</li>
<li>
Visibility of retractions across citations.
</li>
<li>
Visualising Crossref geographic member data.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our team worked as part of some of these projects, providing valuable
insights and feedback to the participants. We ended the first session
with a group dinner and re-energised for the second day, which started
with everybody fully immersed in their tasks. As we approached the
conclusion, the groups started preparing some quick slides for a short
presentation (that you can find
<a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/gpvx-dbde" target="_blank">here</a>).
</p>
<p>
Our team and the participants left excited and looking forward to the
next opportunity to collaborate. We certainly see the potential of
recreating these spaces, and we’ll work on future editions in a
different location. All of the project summaries and notes will remain
stored in our
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/metadata-sprint-2025/" target="_blank">metadata
sprint Gitlab repo</a>. Would you like to know more about any of these
ideas? Let us know in the comments.
