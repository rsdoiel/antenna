      <h1>Some things are big because they are small – the new fee tier for Crossref members takes effect</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>In January 2026, our new annual membership fee tier takes effect. The new tier is US<span class="math inline">\(200 for member organisations that operate on publishing revenue or expenses (whichever is higher) of up to US\)</span>1,000 annually. We <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10">announced the Board’s decision</a>, making it possible in July, and––as you can infer from <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/tch5n-9px70">Amanda’s latest blog</a>––this is the first such change to the annual membership fee tiers in close to 20 years!</p>
<p>The new fee tier resulted from the consultation process and fees review undertaken as part of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability program</a>, carried out with the help of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/">Membership and Fees Committee</a> (made up of representatives from member organisations and community partners). The program is ongoing, and the new fee tier, intended to make Crossref membership more accessible, is one of the first changes it helped us determine.</p>
<p>When our membership renewal invoices are sent out in January 2026, the new fee tier will apply to 3,194 of our existing members, who will receive annual membership invoices 27% lower than previously. Surveys preceding the introduction of the new fee tier have shown that it might be applicable to between 30-60% of the organisations in what used to be our lowest fee tier (US<span class="math inline">\(275 fee for organisations with publishing revenue or expenses of up to US\)</span>1 million).</p>
<p>We received positive feedback from members affected by the change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are very grateful for the new lowest membership fee tier. The Crossref fee is indeed a significant expense for our organisation, but we accept it given its importance. This new fee structure will make it easier for us to cover the cost.” – said Marina Pérez, Análisis Filosófico.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This initiative by Crossref to reduce membership fees is a welcome step toward achieving a truly global and connected research ecosystem. This will undoubtedly help our journal’s mission in fostering inclusive, open, and accessible publishing.” – said Dev Roychowdhury, Journal of Psychological Experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the feedback provided in the consultations and a number of prompts over the months after the original announcement, our Membership Team gathered information necessary to transition 3,194 members into the new fee tier. That’s 14.5% of all Crossref members (please note that in the graph below the number of members in <span class="math inline">\(200 tier is higher due to recent influx of new members who didn’t need to transition, further – “\)</span>0” denotes all our sponsored members, who don’t pay membership fees to us, and those included in the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM program</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/newfee-pie.png" alt="pie chart showing proportion of Crossref members on each membership fee tier"></p>
<p>Any members out there who think their organisation should be moved to the new lowest membership fee tier and haven’t already informed us – please contact us as soon as possible, before the end of the year, so we can make the change before invoices are raised in January.</p>
<p>We know – from speaking with our community (and thank you SO MUCH, for everyone’s feedback in surveys and discussions!) that this change makes participation in Crossref more accessible to smaller organisations communicating research. This will result in a continued flow of new records and associated metadata into the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">research nexus</a>, helping us to make it easier to find and assess research, achieve greater transparency in the scientific process, and continue building trust in its outputs.</p>
<p>We’re not done reviewing our fees, and we don’t think the new fee tier addresses all the needs of the growing and evolving scholarly community. We continue working with Sponsors and Ambassadors, and we have upcoming changes to the Global Equitable Membership program to facilitate participation by all types and sizes of organisations sharing research.</p>

      <h1>It's Time: Planning for Metadata Schema Deprecation</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>It has been 18 (!) years since Crossref last deprecated a metadata schema. In that time, we’ve released numerous schema versions, some major updates, and some interim releases that never saw wide adoption. Now, with 27 different schemas to support, we believe it’s time to streamline and move forward.</p>
<p>Starting next year, we plan to begin the process of deprecating lightly-used schemas, with the understanding that this will be a multi-year effort involving careful planning and plenty of communication.</p>
<h2>Which schema will be deprecated?</h2>
<p>There are two types of schema used to register content metadata records: a full metadata input schema, which follows the pattern <em>crossrefX.X.X.xsd</em>, and resource schema, which follows the pattern <em>doi_resourcesX.X.X.xsd</em>. The resource schema are used to <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/maintaining-your-metadata/resource-only-deposit/">append metadata</a>, such as references or funding data, to an existing metadata record.</p>
<p>I’ve categorized our schemas by usage levels to help prioritize the deprecation process:</p>
<p>Light usage (planned for initial deprecation):</p>
<ul>
<li>crossref4.3.1.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.3.2.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.8.1.xsd</li>
<li>doi_resources4.3.2.xsd</li>
<li>doi_resources4.3.4.xsd</li>
<li>doi_resources4.3.5.xsd</li>
<li>doi_resources4.4.2.xsd</li>
</ul>
<p>Moderate usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>crossref4.3.3.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.3.4.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.3.5.xsd</li>
</ul>
<p>High usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>crossref4.3.0.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.3.6.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.3.7.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.4.0.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.4.1.xsd</li>
<li>crossref4.4.2.xsd</li>
<li>doi_resources4.3.0.xsd</li>
<li>doi_resources4.3.6.xsd</li>
</ul>
<p>We currently support 5 versions of our grants-specific schema and will be working with our funder members to move to new versions of that schema over time - this will follow a different timeline and process as there are fewer schemas to navigate.</p>
<p>If you don’t know which version you’re currently using, now would be a good time to check. Many of our members are still using 4.3.0, the earliest supported version.</p>
<h3>Why deprecate now?</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Supporting 27 schema is unsustainable</em>: Each schema version we maintain adds complexity to our systems and makes it harder to implement improvements that benefit everyone.</li>
<li><em>Existing schema need modernization</em>. Some fundamental elements, like names and titles, need to be modeled differently to fully capture variations in language and usage patterns across different cultures and contexts. We also have too many bespoke record types. Consolidating these will create a simpler, more coherent structure. We may retain certain specialized structures for journal articles and books, but overall, simplification will benefit everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Our current requirements are too minimal</em>. For most record types, we only require a title and publication year. While this low barrier has made registration accessible, it hasn’t served metadata quality well. We know you can do better, and we’d like to ask for more to improve the richness and utility of Crossref metadata.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens next?</h3>
<p>This won’t be an abrupt change. We would like to deprecate the schema flagged ‘light usage’ by the end of 2026 and will be reaching out to impacted members early next year. For other schema, we’re planning a multi-year effort with clear communication at every stage. We’ll provide ample notice before any schema is deprecated, along with migration guidance and support.</p>
<p>With the exception of recent changes to affiliation metadata, we’ve primarily been building on existing schema structures. This means upgrading should be straightforward for most users. As mentioned, we’ll judiciously making some breaking changes to names, titles, and requirements, and would like to consolidate schema as we move forward.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a more robust, modern metadata framework that better serves the scholarly community while reducing the maintenance burden that comes with supporting decades of schema versions. Stay tuned for more details on timelines and migration paths. In the meantime, if you’re unsure which schema version you’re using, we encourage you to check your current implementation.</p>

      <h1>Metadata in editorial workflows</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Scholarly metadata, deposited by thousands of our members and made openly available <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/edg3w-7t592">can act as “trust signals” for the publications</a>. It provides information that helps others in the community to verify and assess the integrity of the work. Despite having a central responsibility in ensuring the integrity of the work that they publish, editorial teams tend not be fully aware of the value of metadata for integrity of the scholarly record. How can we change that?</p>
<p>Thousands of publishers and institutions from all over the world, big and small, are Crossref members, providing us rich metadata for their publications. <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/3b445-2zr32">During our discussion with the community on this topic</a>, it has surfaced that it is usually the technical or production teams, which interact closely with Crossref, where the appreciation of benefits and value of metadata remain confined.</p>
<p>Although editors may interact with some aspects of metadata when they screen manuscripts that come their way, it is not evident whether they see metadata as useful for signalling trust. In the last couple of years, we have been specifically engaging with editors, <a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/crossref-at-the-ismte-2025-annual-conference-editors-without-borders-breaking-silos-in-a-technological-world/14375">meeting them</a>, <a href="https://ease.org.uk/event/ease-germany-webinar-metadata-research-integrity-and-reproducibility/">speaking to them</a>, and <a href="https://www.csescienceeditor.org/article/scholarly-metadata-as-trust-signals-opportunities-for-journal-editors/">writing for them</a> on this topic. As next steps in this effort, we are now keen to engage with the diverse editorial community to understand where metadata fits in their workflows, and to identify opportunities for providing visibility to the importance of rich metadata.</p>
<p>To get a better grasp on this subject, I reached out to Christine Ferguson, to share her rich experience across many editorial roles with me, and to try and paint a better picture of the mutual gaps in understanding when it comes to publication metadata. Here’s what we discovered about the different editorial roles and some ideas for how Crossref might better engage with editors.</p>
<h2>We know that</h2>
<p>Our members come in all shapes and sizes, and that is also reflected in the diversity of editorial functions that may exist within their organisations. Some of our publishing members have editorial staff whose role is to screen submissions, which includes checking them to make sure that the manuscripts are formatted correctly, and have all the required information e.g. on ethics approvals, or ORCIDs (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) of authors. They then pass these manuscripts on to an external or an academic editor, who is usually a subject matter expert and is responsible for the editorial oversight of the content, to manage the rest of the peer review process, such as assessing the novelty and scope of the work, inviting and securing reviewers, and making a final decision on the manuscript. The academic editors make up a vast majority of the editorial community, variously serving as the editor-in-chief, section editors, and members of the editorial board. They usually volunteer their time as an editor, while having another primary job function.</p>
<p>Other publishers may have in-house editors who are subject matter experts themselves and manage the peer review process. Manuscripts can come to these editors after initial checks have been performed on them or the editors may also perform these checks, following which selected manuscripts undergo the peer review process.</p>
<p>Production editors assume responsibility for the manuscripts that are accepted. Their role is to make the manuscript production and publication ready, often liaising with the authors to finalise the formatting, and finally assigning it to an issue.</p>
<p>Then there are editorial roles that may be a combination of one or more of the above. The size and operational structure of an organisation may determine how editorial and other responsibilities are delegated within the organisation. For some of our medium or smaller members, it may be that the same individual or team is responsible for one or more tasks related to assessing the scientific content of the manuscript, managing the peer review process, as well as being in charge of the post-production workflows such as registering metadata with Crossref.</p>
<p>There are also emerging publishing workflows involving solicited peer-reviews of preprints or other types of works, which sometimes retain a form of editorial oversight.</p>
<p>In summary, editorial roles and responsibilities may vary quite a lot within our member organisations and we have less clarity about editorial roles and responsibilities within member organisations.</p>
<p>All of these different flavors of editors also interact with metadata at various stages in their workflows. For example, the title of the manuscripts, names of authors, whether they have ORCIDs and what is reflected in their ORCID records, and the abstracts may be used to assess the novelty and integrity of the work under consideration. The names of authors, especially if they are not known personally to the editor, can be verified in part by an ORCID check, ensuring the individuals exist, are affiliated to the organisations as claimed, that they have the relevant expertise to write or contribute to the manuscript, and to be able to find what they have written previously on the subject.
Making sure that whether all or some of the authors (e.g. the corresponding author) have provided their ORCIDs, or if the link to where the dataset has been deposited in a repository resolves correctly, is usually a part of the pre-screening or post-acceptance checklists. <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xxwy3-xhf38">As our recent metadata awardee, ASM has highlighted</a> that having this metadata can be hugely beneficial during the peer-review management process, such as for identifying conflicts of interest, to ensure data policy compliance, and even for carrying out systematic analyses.</p>
<h2>We’d like to know more about…</h2>
<p>whether all editors interact with metadata in their workflows, and whether they are sufficiently informed about the power of rich metadata. It is evident that there is a lot of diversity in editorial roles and functions. Editors, whether they are mostly concerned with scientific content or with the manuscript peer-review process, are closely connected to the researcher community and the latest research topics and trends. By virtue of this, they are in an excellent position to ascertain the important metadata elements most relevant in their scholarly community. If we have a better understanding of how editors are using metadata in their workflows, we’d be able to identify specific opportunities for engaging with this key community to create greater recognition of the role of metadata in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
<p>What we have in mind is to engage systematically with editorial community members and understand from them how, where, and which metadata are they using in their workflows. We’d like to do so by talking to editors who represent different Crossref members, perhaps in small groups, where participants will be able to share which metadata elements they interact with. We’d also like to share with them information about the use of metadata for research integrity. We’d like to understand whether they have been leveraging metadata in this context and the relevance of this information for them. Via this exercise, we hope to pick out some commonalities about the use of metadata in editorial workflows. Ultimately, we’d like to use this information to create resources that can be used for educating editors (and ultimately the researchers who submit their work for publication) about the importance of metadata, especially in signalling trust and preserving the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>

      <p>In March 2024, Ithaka S+R released a tracker of generative AI products for higher education, along with an issue brief detailing our observations on the generative AI product landscape for postsecondary research, teaching, and learning activities. Since then, the list of products on the tracker has more than doubled in length and become more cumbersome for its many users.

      <h1>Media Roundup: “Supreme Court Leaves Copyright Official Targeted by Trump in Place For Now”</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>From Reuters: The U.S. Supreme Court postponed on Wednesday a decision on whether to let Donald Trump remove the government’s top copyright official, leaving her in place for now in the latest battle over the Republican president’s targeting of federal officials.

      <h1>Open Science between Promises and Paradoxes, democratization or new dependency?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Open science promises to democratize knowledge but faces deep paradoxes. Open data do not guarantee equity when the capacity to process them remains concentrated. We must rethink openness in light of global power asymmetries so that it does not become a new form of dependency. …<a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2025/11/26/open-science-between-promises-and-paradoxes-democratization-or-new-dependency/">Read More →</a></p>

      <h1>Crossref members over the years: a journey through space and time</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Crossref was created back in 2000 by 12 forward-thinking scholarly publishers from North America and Europe, and by 2002, these members had registered 4 million DOI records. At the time of writing, we have over 23,600 members in 164 different countries. Half of our members are based in Asia, and 35% are universities or scholar-led. These members have registered over 176 million open metadata records with DOIs (as of today). What a difference 25 years makes!</p>
<p>In our 25th anniversary year, I thought it would be time to take a look at how we got here. And so—hold tight—we’re going to go on an adventure through space and time<a href="#fn:1">1</a>, stopping every 5 years through Crossref history to check in on our members. And we’re going to see some really interesting changes over the years.</p>
<h2>2005</h2>
<p>Let’s go back twenty years to 2005. Crossref has been running for five years, and at this point, we have just 318 members from 31 countries, with 18 million DOI records already registered. These members and the Crossref infrastructure are supported by five Crossref employees based in just two countries—the US and the UK.</p>
<p>In 2005, the majority of our members are based in North America, Northern Europe and Western Europe, and they are mostly publishers or societies. <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/">Our sponsor program</a> doesn’t yet exist, so all members pay a membership fee directly to Crossref. Our membership fee structure is the same as it is today—we have tiered membership fees so our members can contribute to our infrastructure based on their capacity to pay. At this point, half of our members are eligible for our lowest fee tier.</p>
<h3>2005 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>318 members from 31 countries.</li>
<li>18 million DOI records registered.</li>
<li>Supported by five Crossref employees based in two countries - the US and the UK.</li>
<li>The majority (89%) are based in North America or Northern &amp; Western Europe.</li>
<li>Half are eligible for our lowest fee tier.</li>
<li>Mostly societies (40%) and publishers (33%).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2010</h2>
<p>Let’s move on by five years to 2010. By this stage, Crossref membership had grown to 1101 members from 69 countries, and these members have now registered 44 million DOI records. They are now supported by 14 Crossref employees, still all located in either the US or the UK.</p>
<p>We’re starting to see some changes in where our members are based. You’ll remember that back in 2005, 89% of Crossref members were based in North America, Northern Europe or Western Europe. By 2010, that percentage has dropped to 63%, and we’re seeing the number of members based in Asia starting to grow. In 2005, only 4% of our members were based in Asia, but by 2010, 18% of our members are based there, with 93 members in the Republic of Korea alone.</p>
<p>By 2010, the percentage of members who are eligible for our lowest fee tier has grown to 78%, so we are seeing smaller and less well-funded organisations starting to join. The types of organisations joining hasn’t changed significantly—members are still mostly societies and publishers. However, we are starting to see universities and scholar-led organisations beginning to join.</p>
<h3>2010 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>1,101 members from 69 countries.</li>
<li>44 million DOI records registered.</li>
<li>Supported by 14 Crossref employees based in two countries - the US and the UK.</li>
<li>Growth of members based in Asia (18%).</li>
<li>Smaller, less well-funded organisations starting to join - 78% eligible for our lowest fee tier.</li>
<li>Still mostly societies (37%) and publishers (28%), but universities and scholar-led members starting to emerge (23%).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2015</h2>
<p>Jumping ahead another five years to 2015, we see Crossref membership has grown to over 3,000 members from 93 countries, with registered DOI records exceeding 77 million. These members and the Crossref infrastructure are supported by 28 employees, still all based in the US and UK.</p>
<p>Membership in Asia has now really taken off, and Asian organisations now account for 38% of all Crossref members. We also see membership in Latin America emerging, representing 12% of our membership. We have members from 12 different countries in Latin America in 2015, but the most significant number are from Brazil, with 274 members.</p>
<p>Our formal Sponsor program started to emerge from 2012 onwards. Our Sponsor program supports members who are otherwise eligible for our lowest fee tier and provides financial, technical and language support to organisations that would otherwise face barriers to membership. By 2015, we have 26 sponsors in 14 countries, and 20% of all members are working with us through a Sponsor. This is one of the drivers behind smaller, less well-funded members joining Crossref. We really see a leap here in 2015 with over 90% of members now eligible for our lowest fee tier.</p>
<p>Around 2015, we also begin to see an interesting shift in the types of organisations that are becoming members. Increasingly, our new members are university-based, and that type of member organisation has overtaken the publisher group in number for the first time. However, societies still make up the largest number of members.</p>
<h3>2015 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>3,134 members from 93 countries.</li>
<li>77 million DOI records.</li>
<li>Supported by 28 Crossref employees based in two countries - US and UK.</li>
<li>Growth in Asia (38%) and members in Latin America (12%) starting to emerge.</li>
<li>Leap in smaller, less well-funded members - 92% eligible for the lowest fee tier.</li>
<li>Sponsor program emerges - 26 sponsors in 14 countries.</li>
<li>Rise of university and scholar-led members (29%) - overtaking publishers (21%). Societies (31%) are still the largest group.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2020</h2>
<p>Can you believe we’re already in 2020? Crossref now has almost 12,000 members in 133 countries, with registered DOI records totalling over 120 million! These members and the Crossref infrastructure are now supported by 43 employees across five countries, with Ireland, Germany, and France added to our staff locations.</p>
<p>Almost half of our members are based in Asia at this time, driven by growth from Indonesia, where we have 1681 members in 2020. Our sponsor program now contains 77 sponsors across 32 countries, including our first sponsor in North Africa.</p>
<p>We can now really see how membership is weighted towards smaller, less well-funded organisations: 97% of members are eligible for the lowest fee tier, and 57% choose to work with a sponsor.</p>
<p>By 2020, we also see a fundamental change in the types of organisations that are Crossref members. Societies no longer account for the largest share of our members, with both universities and publishers overtaking them. In 2016, we updated our schema to enable members to register records for preprints (and connect them to an article where relevant). By 2020, 65 members are registering preprints, and many preprint repositories have already become members.</p>
<h3>2020 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>11,976 members from 133 countries.</li>
<li>120 million DOI records.</li>
<li>Supported by 43 Crossref employees in five countries - France, Germany, Ireland, the UK, and the US.</li>
<li>46% of members based in Asia.</li>
<li>77 sponsors in 32 countries, first sponsor in N Africa.</li>
<li>Membership heavily weighted to smaller, less well-funded organisations - 97% eligible for the lowest fee tier and 57% working through a sponsor.</li>
<li>Universities and scholar-led are now the largest group (37%), followed by publishers (29%) and societies (24%).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2025</h2>
<p>And so we find ourselves back in the present day.</p>
<p>With such steady growth, it’s pretty easy to predict almost exactly how many members we will have by 31st December 2025. By year-end, we would expect to have 23,800 members in 164 countries, with registered DOI records totalling around 177 million. With recent hiring, these members and our infrastructure will be supported by 52 Crossref employees in 14 different countries.</p>
<p>Member organisations are now a real mix, with museums, hospitals, botanic gardens, banks, and many more joining. The largest proportion remains those at a university or scholar-led (35%), but interestingly, we see the percentage who consider themselves to be societies starting to fall (19%) and publishers starting to grow again (29%).</p>
<p>And we see the arrival of a new type of member - since the launch of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant Linking System</a> in 2019, we now see Research Funders joining Crossref in order to register identifiers for individual grants. These grant identifiers can then be included in the metadata for published content to uniquely identify the funding source, providing context and trust signals for the content, and fleshing out the Research Nexus. We currently have 45 funders who have registered over <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/607z6-1nh09">175,000 grant records</a>.</p>
<p>By 2025 we have 129 sponsors in 51 countries - including our first sponsors in East and West Africa who joined in 2024 and 2025 respectively. Half of all members are now based in Asia. 98% of members are now eligible for our lowest fee tier and 57% are working with us through a sponsor.</p>
<p>In 2023, we launched our Global Equitable Membership (GEM) program, which offers relief from any membership and content registration fees for organisations in the least economically advantaged countries in the world. We use the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) list as our data source for countries to include in the program. When we launched the program, 187 existing members moved under the program. Since the program’s focus is to enable participation for those who would otherwise find Crossref unaffordable, we are happy that we now have 583 organisational members in the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM Program</a>, showing the growth in participation from lower-income nations. Most members in the GEM Program are based in Southern Asia (48%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (33%).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/Location-GEM-members.png" alt="pie chart showing location of GEM members: Southern Asia (48.8%), Western Asia (4.8%), Northern Africa (1.9%), Sub Saharan Africa (33%), Latin America and the Caribbean (1.7%), Central Asia (4.5%), South Eastern Asia (3.8%)"></p>
<h3>November 2025 at a glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>23,622 members in 164 countries.</li>
<li>175 million DOI records.</li>
<li>Supported by 52 Crossref employees from 14 countries - Armenia, Austria, Canada, Ecuador, Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong, Ireland, Kenya, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Spain, the UK, and the US.</li>
<li>51% of members are based in Asia.</li>
<li>129 sponsors in 51 countries - first sponsors in East and West Africa.</li>
<li>98% of members are eligible for the lowest fee tier, and 57% working through a sponsor.</li>
<li>Real mix of organisation types - universities and scholar-led (35%), publishers (29%), societies (19%), but also research funders, museums, pharmaceutical companies, news agencies, and more!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes over the years</h2>
<p>Here are some of that data over time, depicted in charts.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/Member_numbers.png" alt="line graph showing growth of member numbers from 2005 (300 members) to 2025 (23,000 members)"></p>

<h2>2026 and beyond</h2>
<p>As you can see from our adventure through space and time, the types of organisations that work with Crossref have changed significantly over the years as the scholarly communications world has evolved. Our members now tend to be university-based research-performing organisations or scholar-led journals, based in Asia, and with low or zero publishing revenues (and volumes).</p>
<p>To meet our mission of a truly global and connected research ecosystem, it is essential to ensure that participation in Crossref and all our services and metadata is accessible to everyone involved in documenting scholarly progress.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that access to the Crossref infrastructure is equitable, so we are making two key changes in 2026: we’re extending eligibility for the GEM Program (more to follow), and we are introducing a new, lower-fee tier as an outcome of the RCFS projects <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10">more here</a>.</p>
<p>We’re excited to see how our members will change as we head into our next 25 years—we hope you’ll continue with us on our journey and welcome all kinds of new members to the expansive and vibrant Crossref community.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Technically, this is only an adventure through time. At the time of writing, we have no members based in space. Unless you count the European Space Agency, NASA, et al. <a href="#fnref:1">↩︎</a></li>
