## “Tariff on the brain”

date: 2025-03-13, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this episode, Kai and Kimberly divide into the back and forth over tariffs. The on-again, off-again levies are making it tough for industries to plan and trade. With all the uncertainty, are markets — from stocks to agriculture — on the verge of becoming untradable? Plus, we’ll wryly smile at a biting, century-old song about farmers who were ticked off about tariffs. (Thanks to our listener, Robert, for sharing his rendition!)</p>

## Let’s talk about Newsom the Govcaster

date: 2025-03-12, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A new contender has entered the podcast landscape: wait, is that California Governor Gavin Newsom? His show features a surprisingly conservative guest list, including MAGA stars Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. Kai and Kimberly break down the fourth wall and discuss whether there&#8217;s value in platforming guests who hold a different set of values. Plus, more federal layoffs took place this past week, this time in the U.S. Department of Education and its civil rights division. Then, the hosts get smiley about rescue dogs in a sled dog race (thanks, Abigail!) and the birds in Kai&#8217;s neighborhood.</p>
<p>Here’s everything we talked about today:</p>

## Unpacking our collective COVID-19 trauma, five years on

date: 2025-03-12, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Five years ago, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, there have been lockdowns, a recession, two presidential elections and more than a million American lives lost from the disease. In many ways, life feels like it’s back to normal, but David Wallace-Wells, a writer for The New York Times, argues that the pandemic still has a grip on American life, from our faith in public health institutions to the way consumers feel about the economy. On the show today, Wallace-Wells walks us through how Americans neglected to process the seismic impact of the pandemic in the rush to recover from it, and how it&#8217;s left us more self-interested and less empathetic. Plus, how this can help explain disgruntled consumers and a growing appetite for risk-taking in the economy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll get into how responses to public health emergencies have shifted to the realm of the private sector. And, we&#8217;ll hear listeners&#8217; reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic, five years on.</p>
