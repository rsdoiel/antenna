We&#8217;ll break it down. Plus, why is nobody talking about the debt limit? And, congrats to Bill in Ohio on scoring a hat trick!</p>

## Angel City FC and the rise of women’s pro soccer

date: 2025-03-05, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The National Women&#8217;s Soccer League&#8217;s regular season kicks off next week. And thanks in part to a record-breaking <a href="https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/nwsl-announces-landmark-media-partnerships-with-cbs-sports-espn-prime-video-and-scripps-sports">media rights agreement</a> and the growth of women&#8217;s professional sports across the board, the league is gaining more attention — and investment — than ever. Angel City Football Club became the highest-valued women&#8217;s sports team in the world last year when Willow Bay and Bob Iger acquired a controlling stake in the franchise for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5642755/2024/07/17/angel-city-new-ownership-willow-bay-bob-iger/">$250 million.</a> Julie Uhrman, the team&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, says Angel City is just the beginning. On the show today, Uhrman explains how she and her co-founders got investors to see their vision, why a game day experience that leaves you with FOMO is key to Angel City&#8217;s growth, and how to watch the NWSL&#8217;s season.</p>

## Are egg producers inflating prices during bird flu outbreak to boost profits?

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

omaha, nebraska — Egg producers blame the bird flu outbreak for driving prices to record highs, but critics believe giant companies are taking advantage of their market dominance to profit handsomely at the expense of budget-conscious egg buyers. 


Advocacy groups, Democratic lawmakers and a Federal Trade Commission member are calling for a government investigation after egg prices spiked to a record average of $4.95 per dozen this month. The Trump administration did unveil a plan this week to combat bird flu, but how much that might ease egg prices — a key driver of inflation — remains to be seen. 


"Donald Trump promised to lower food prices on 'Day One,' but with egg prices skyrocketing out of control, he fired the workers charged with containing bird flu. Working families need relief now," Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement. 


What's behind the record egg prices? 


The industry blames bird flu, as do most experts. More than 166 million birds have been slaughtered to try to contain the virus. Some 30 million egg layers have been wiped out just since January, significantly disrupting egg supplies. The Department of Agriculture's long-standing policy has been to kill entire flocks anytime the virus is found on a farm. 


As a result, the number of egg layers has dropped nationwide by about 12% from before the outbreak to 292 million birds, according to a Feb. 1 USDA estimate, but another 11 million egg layers have been killed since then, so it's likely worse. When prices spiked to $4.82 two years ago and prompted initial calls for price gouging probes, the flock was above 300 million. 


"This has nothing to do with anything other than bird flu. And I think to suggest anything else is a misreading of the facts and the reality," American Egg Board President Emily Metz said. 


"Our farmers are in the fight of their lives, period, full stop. And they're doing everything they can to keep these birds safe," Metz said. "This is a supply challenge. Due to bird flu. Nothing else." 


Farm Action suspects monopolistic behavior. The group that lobbies on behalf of smaller farmers, consumers and rural communities notes that egg production is down only about 4% from last year and 7.57 billion table eggs were produced last month, yet some consumers are still finding egg shelves empty at their local grocery stores. 




"Dominant egg corporations are blaming avian flu for the price hikes that we're seeing. But while the egg supply has fallen only slightly, these companies profits have soared," said Angela Huffman, Farm Action's president. The Justice Department acknowledged receiving the group's letter calling for an investigation but declined to comment on it. 


The fact that a jury ruled in 2023 that major egg producers used various means to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price of products during the 2000s only adds to the doubts about their motives now. 


What do the numbers show? 


Retail egg prices had generally remained below $2 per dozen for years before this outbreak began. Prices have more than doubled since then, boosting profits for egg producers even as they deal with soaring costs. 


Most of the dominant producers are privately held companies and don't release their results. But the biggest, Cal-Maine Foods, which supplies about 20% of the nation's eggs, is public, and its profits increased dramatically. Cal-Maine reported a $219 million profit in the most recent quarter when its eggs sold for an average of $2.74 per dozen, up from just $1.2 million in the quarter just before this outbreak began in early 2022 when its eggs were selling for $1.37 per dozen. 


Sherman Miller, Cal-Maine's president and CEO, said in reporting the numbers that higher market prices "have continued to rise this fiscal year as supply levels of shell eggs have been restricted due to recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza." 


But he said Cal-Maine also sold significantly more eggs — 330 million dozen, up from 288 million the year before — in the quarter because demand is so strong and Cal-Maine has made a number of acquisitions. Cal-Maine also suffered few outbreaks on its farms, outside of a couple facilities in Kansas and Texas. The Mississippi-based company didn't respond to calls from The Associated Press. 


What about production costs? 


Economists and analysts say the record egg prices aren't a sure sign of something nefarious, and short-term profits might only last until farms get hit. Once a flock is slaughtered, it can take as long as a year to clean a farm and raise new birds to egg-laying age. The USDA pays farmers for every bird killed, but it doesn't cover all the costs for farmers as they go without income. 


"The consumer, I think, will probably feel like they're getting the rough end of the stick. But I guarantee you, the farmers that are having to depopulate the barns, they're having a rougher time," CoBank analyst Brian Earnest said. 


Inflation in the costs of feed, fuel and labor have contributed to rising egg prices, and farmers have been investing in biosecurity measures to help keep the virus away. So production costs also appear to be at an all-time high, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' producer price index. 


"This isn't a case where they're taking the price up to gouge the market. It is the price is going up through auction at wholesale. And they're benefiting from higher prices because supplies are tight," University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said.

## Gene Hackman likely died Feb. 17, last day of activity on pacemaker, official says

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

Academy Award-winning actor Gene Hackman likely died on Feb. 17, the last day there was any activity on his pacemaker, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday. "According to the pathologist," Mendoza said, "that is a very good assumption that was his last day of life," nine days before investigators found his body.


The bodies of Hackman, 95, and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 64, a classical pianist, were found, along with the dead body of one of their three dogs, Wednesday in their home in the southwestern U.S. state of New Mexico.


The initial findings of autopsies on the couple revealed that Hackman and his wife both tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning and "no external trauma" was reported to either of them.  Mendoza said, "There were no apparent signs of foul play."


However, the couple’s "manner and cause of death has not been determined," according to the sheriff. "The official results of the autopsy and toxicology reports are pending."


Investigators have retrieved an assortment of prescription and over-the-counter medications, in addition to cellphones and records from medical diagnostics testing from the house.


"I'm pretty confident there is no foul play," Mendoza said Friday on The Today Show. He said the autopsy results "will steer us in the right direction" in determining what happened to Hackman and his wife.


Without the autopsy, the sheriff said, it is difficult to determine how long the couple had been dead.


A search warrant affidavit issued Thursday said the circumstances surrounding the couple's deaths were "suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation."




Mendoza told The Today Show that several doors around the house were unlocked and one door in the rear of the house was open. Earlier reports said the front door was open.


Hackman's body was found near the rear of the house, while his wife's body was found in a bathroom. The dead dog's body was found in a dog crate, not far from Arakawa's body. The couple had three German shepherds. The other two dogs were found alive and healthy at the property.


The search warrant affidavit also revealed that police called the Santa Fe Fire Department and the New Mexico Gas Company to Hackman's residence, but no toxic fumes or leaky pipes were found on the grounds.


Storied career


Hackman had a lengthy career on stage and screen, including appearing in Broadway shows, on television and in more than 80 films.


He won an Oscar for best actor for his role in the 1971 film The French Connection and a best supporting Oscar for the 1992 film Unforgiven.


Hackman's resume featured three other Oscar nominations, including his breakout role in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 as well as I Never Sang for My Father in 1970 and Mississippi Burning in 1988.


His work crossed genres as he appeared in action movies, thrillers and off-beat comedies.


In addition to his award-nominated works, he was also known for roles in films such as The Poseidon Adventure, Young Frankenstein, Superman, Hoosiers, The Birdcage, and The Royal Tenenbaums.


His last film was Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.


His loss was immediately felt throughout the entertainment community as fellow artists praised him on social media. Director Francis Ford Coppola and actor Morgan Freeman were among those who posted their remembrances of the actor.


"The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration," Coppola posted on Instagram. "Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. I mourn his loss and celebrate his existence and contribution." Hackman starred in Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation.


Freeman posted on Instagram: "One of the personal highlights of my career was bringing the French Film Gardé a Vue (Under Suspicion) to life with the incredibly gifted Gene Hackman. And of course... Unforgiven. Rest in peace, my friend."


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.

## Illinois jury convicts man of murdering Palestinian American boy

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

An Illinois jury on Friday found a man guilty of murder and hate crime charges for an October 2023 stabbing that killed a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy and severely wounded his mother, according to court documents.


Joseph Czuba, 73, faces life in prison when he is sentenced in May for a murder that prosecutors said was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. It took place just days after Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, carried out an Oct. 7, 2023, attack inside Israel.


The murder of the boy, Wadee Alfayoumi, and the attack on his mother, Hanan Shaheen, constituted one of the earliest and worst hate crime incidents targeting Muslims in the U.S. after the Hamas attack on Israel.


Rights advocates have noted rising Islamophobia and antisemitism in the U.S. since that attack.


Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy 26 times with a military-style knife with an 18-centimeter (7-inch) serrated blade, authorities said. Shaheen suffered multiple stab wounds in the attack, which occurred in Plainfield Township, about 64 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Chicago.


During the trial this week, Shaheen testified that Czuba told her "you, as a Muslim, must die," according to local media reports.


Michael Fitzgerald, prosecutor at the Will County State's Attorney's Office, presented a 911 call recording in the trial.


"The landlord is killing me and my baby," Shaheen is heard saying on the audio, according to CBS Chicago.


Other U.S. incidents raising alarm about anti-Arab bias include the attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian American girl in Texas and the stabbing of a Palestinian American man in Texas.


A few incidents raising alarm about antisemitism include threats of violence against Jews at Cornell University that led to a conviction and sentencing, and an unsuccessful plot to attack a New York Jewish center.

## Measles cases rise to 146 in outbreak that led to first US measles death in 10 years

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

DALLAS, TEXAS — The number of people with measles in Texas increased to 146 in an outbreak that led this week to the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, health officials said Friday. 


The number of cases — Texas' largest in nearly 30 years — increased by 22 since Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said cases span over nine counties in Texas and 20 patients have been hospitalized. 


The child who died Tuesday night in the outbreak is the first U.S. death from the highly contagious but preventable respiratory disease since 2015, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 


Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation's top health official and a vaccine critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services was watching cases but dismissed the outbreak as "not unusual." 


But on Friday afternoon, Kennedy said in a post on X that his heart went out to families impacted by the outbreak, and he recognized "the serious impact of this outbreak on families, children, and healthcare workers." 


Kennedy also said his agency will continue to fund Texas' immunization program and that ending the outbreak is a "top priority" for him and his team. 


The virus has largely spread through rural, oil rig-dotted West Texas, with cases concentrated in a "close-knit, undervaccinated" Mennonite community, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton has said. 


Gaines County has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year. 


Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. Anton has said the number of unvaccinated kids in Gaines County is likely significantly higher because homeschooled children's data would not be reported. 


The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. 


Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. 


The U.S. had considered measles eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that sickened more than 60. 


Eastern New Mexico has nine cases of measles, but the state health department said there is no connection to the outbreak in West Texas. 


At a news conference Friday in Austin, officials urged people to get vaccinated if they are not already. 


"We're here to say quite simply: Measles can kill, ignorance can kill and vaccine denial definitely kills," said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat.

## European leaders stand by Ukraine after heated exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

European leaders across much of the continent vowed to stand by Ukraine after a White House meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned into a heated exchange Friday, with Trump calling Zelenskyy "disrespectful."


European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it has become clear that "the free world needs a new leader."

"Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine," Kallas wrote on the social media platform X.


German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X, "Ukraine can rely on Germany — and on Europe," while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on social media, "Ukraine, Spain stands with you."


"Dear @ZelenskyyUa, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone," wrote Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on X.


French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters in Portugal, "Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people."

Other European leaders, including from Finland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Norway, also took to social media to voice support for Ukraine.


Not all European leaders backed Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has long been critical of EU military aid to Kyiv, posted on X, "President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!"


The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy came as the two countries were seeking a deal that would allow the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare mineral rights. The discussion took a combative tone about 40 minutes into the meeting when Zelenskyy raised Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea.


U.S. Vice President JD Vance immediately criticized Zelenskyy, accusing him of engaging in a "propaganda tour."


Both Vance and Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of not being thankful for the assistance his country has received from Washington.


After the meeting abruptly ended, the White House confirmed that the mineral deal was not signed.


US response


In the U.S., many Republicans in Congress expressed support for Trump's actions.


Senator Lindsey Graham, who has previously supported military aid to Ukraine, said, "What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again."


House Republican leader Steve Scalise, who has also previously supported military aid to Ukraine, wrote on X, "President Trump is fighting for PEACE around the world and is putting America First as our best negotiator — he's the only one to get Russia to the table to consider a serious and lasting peace agreement with Ukraine."


Republican Representative Andy Biggs wrote on X, "Dictator Zelensky had the audacity to disrespect President @realDonaldTrump and VP @JDVance during what should have been a friendly meeting, and @POTUS rightfully showed him the door. This is the leadership America has craved for four years."


Democratic leaders in Congress argued that Trump's actions would only benefit Russia.


"Trump and Vance are doing [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's dirty work. Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.


House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a statement, "Today's White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator. The United States must not reward Russian aggression and continue to appease Putin."


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.

## Iowa removes gender identity protections from state's civil rights code

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowa became the first U.S. state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code on Friday when Governor Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that opponents say will expose transgender people and other Iowans to discrimination in all aspects of daily life. 


The new law, which goes into effect July 1, follows several years of action from Reynolds and Iowa Republicans to restrict transgender students' use of such spaces as bathrooms and locker rooms, and their participation on sports teams, in an effort to protect people assigned female at birth. Republicans say those policies cannot co-exist with a civil rights code that includes gender identity protections. 


The law passed quickly after being introduced last week. It also creates explicit legal definitions of female and male based on their reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the idea that a person can transition to another gender. Reynolds proposed a similar bill last year, but it didn't make it to a vote of the full House or Senate. 


Reynolds posted a video on social media explaining her signature on the bill and acknowledging that it was a "sensitive issue for some." 


"It's common sense to acknowledge the obvious biological differences between men and women. In fact, it's necessary to secure genuine equal protection for women and girls," she said, adding that the previous civil rights code "blurred the biological line between the sexes." 


President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to formalize a definition of the two sexes at the federal level, leading several Republican-led legislatures to push for laws defining male and female. Trump posted in support of the Iowa bill on his Truth Social platform Thursday after it got final approval from the Iowa House and Senate. 




Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in the House and Senate in voting against the bill. Iowa state Representative Aime Wichtendahl was the final Democrat to speak before the vote, wiping away tears as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: "I transitioned to save my life." 


"The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence," Wichtendahl said. "The sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal." 


Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading "Trans rights are human rights" and chanting slogans including "No hate in our state!" There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. The few protesters who lingered for final passage of the bill were emotional. 


Not all states include gender identity in their civil rights codes, but Iowa is now the first in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank. 


Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state's Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers. 




The House Republican moving the bill Thursday, Representative Steven Holt, said that if the Legislature can add protections, it can remove them. 


As of July 1, Iowa's civil rights law will protect against discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status. 


Iowa's Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity. 


Advocacy groups promise to defend transgender rights, which may lead them to court. 


Keenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy for LGBTQ+ advocacy group One Iowa, said the organization is still analyzing the text of the bill and that its vagueness makes it "hard to determine where the enforcement is going to come from." 


"We will pursue any legal options available to us," Crow said.

## US tariff hike on vehicle imports could impact Nigeria's auto market

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

ABUJA, NIGERIA — For longtime automotive importer David Tope, Nigeria's auto market has become increasingly difficult. He used to import up to five vehicles per week from the United States and Canada. But since 2023, import costs have surged dramatically, driven by currency depreciation and increased duties.


By early 2025, Tope paused his import business.


"It's not just the country that's the thing, but our inflation rate is so high on duties and the naira devaluation — so it's affecting importing from any country at all," said Tope. "It's not just for the car to be cheap, but also for our custom duties to be reconsidered so that the normal man can at least survive this business of car dealership."


While Tope mulls his next move, the U.S. announced an impending 25% tariff on vehicle imports, starting in April.


Though the policy targets cars entering the U.S., the decision could impact Nigeria's auto market, which depends on American used car exports.


"U.S. is the main market of importation that we do, so if inflation rate of 25% is being put on their cars, it's going to affect Nigeria market," Tope said. "If the cars are being produced in U.S., it is going to be cheaper for us. But if the cars are being imported to U.S, then exported to us, the inflation rate will be unbearable for car dealers like me."


Importers aren't the only ones affected. Vehicle prices in Nigeria have jumped nearly 400% over the past two years, putting car ownership out of reach for many consumers.


Nigerians such as Emmanuel Aaron and Akintunde Akinmolaye worry the U.S. tariff will exacerbate price woes.


"Honestly, the cost has gone so, so high that my interest in buying cars has to be suspended," Aaron said.


"We know that U.S. cars are built with quality, care and comfort compared to other places," said Akinmolaye, "but in terms of cost now, cost may make one jettison all those preferences."


Economist Hauwa Mustapha believes a 25% U.S. tariff could reshape Nigeria's auto market. If the U.S. prioritizes local vehicle production, fewer used cars could be available for export, pushing up prices in Nigeria.


Beyond affordability, she said the import business itself is at risk. Thousands of Nigerians depend on vehicle imports for their livelihoods — from importers to mechanics, parts dealers and transport workers.


Currently, Nigeria produces about 14,000 vehicles annually, a small fraction of what its market demands. Experts say strengthening local manufacturing is the only long-term solution.


Mustapha said more needs to be done to revive and strengthen the country's steel industry.


Shoring up Nigeria's supportive infrastructure, she said, "will enable more production of some of these already locally assembled vehicles."


For now, Nigerian importers like Tope are in wait-and-see mode.

## UN chief urges US to reverse ‘severe’ aid cuts to humanitarian programs

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that Washington has notified many U.N. agencies and humanitarian and development organizations this week of “severe” funding cuts, which he said will be “devastating” for the world’s most vulnerable people, and he urged the Trump administration to reconsider them.


“Going through with these cuts will make the world less healthy, less safe and less prosperous,” Guterres told reporters at the United Nations. “The reduction of America’s humanitarian role and influence will run counter to American interests globally.”


He urged the United States, as well as other countries that have recently announced reductions in humanitarian and development aid, to reverse their decisions after more careful reviews of the programs.


“In the meantime, every United Nations agency stands ready to provide the necessary information and justification for its projects,” Guterres added. “And we look forward to working with the United States in this regard.”




The U.N. chief did not give a dollar figure of how much the U.N. and its agencies will lose and would not take reporters’ questions. But the United States is the largest single donor in terms of humanitarian funding to the United Nations humanitarian appeal. In 2024, it provided $14 billion, just over 40% of the total contributions. By contrast, Germany, the second-largest contributor, provided $2.7 billion, or about 8% of global funding.


The Trump administration, through its Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has slashed $60 billion in overseas assistance as part of its effort to massively cut government costs. That included shuttering the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and reversing decades of U.S. foreign policy that viewed the soft power of humanitarian aid as being in America’s national interest.


That has left scores of international aid agencies scrambling to try to keep their programs going. The secretary-general said U.N. staff in the field are also taking urgent steps to protect as much of their lifesaving work as possible.


Guterres gave some examples of where U.S. cuts would affect — or already have affected — provision of critical services.


“In Afghanistan, more than 9 million people will miss out on health and protection services, with hundreds of mobile health teams and other services suspended,” he said.


In South Sudan, he said, funding has run out for programs to support people who have fled the war in neighboring Sudan. And in Ukraine, cash-based humanitarian assistance has been suspended in key regions.




“Our absolute priority remains clear,” Guterres said. “We will do everything we can to provide lifesaving aid to those in urgent need. And we will continue our efforts to diversify the pool of generous donors who support our work.”


Questioned later by reporters, Guterres’ spokesperson said the agencies had been informed by letter of the cuts, most coming from USAID’s acting deputy administrator, Peter Marocco. Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that U.N. officials “at a fairly senior level” had tried to talk with U.S. officials about the cuts.


“But I can’t say we’ve detected much interest in engaging on this issue,” he said.


Dujarric listed some of the agencies that have received termination letters, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which received 27 letters; the International Office for Migration (IOM), which had 22 of 25 USAID programs terminated; and the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which had about 50 projects terminated.


“Their office in Mexico, which deals among other things with the flow of fentanyl, may have to close,” Dujarric said of UNODC. “It will impact their programs in Central America and the Darien Gap focusing on fighting human trafficking.”


UNAIDS, which provides lifesaving HIV treatment around the world, said Friday that it received a letter from Washington on Thursday terminating its agreement with UNAIDS “with immediate effect.”


This follows the decision in late January by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to continue funding UNAIDS while the U.S. foreign assistance review was ongoing and other international assistance was paused.




“This is a serious development which impacts the entire HIV response, including in the continuity of lifesaving HIV services for people living with and affected by HIV, civil society and our partners,” UNAIDS said in a statement.


Since 2003, through its PEPFAR program, the United States has helped save more than 26 million lives by investing in critical HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programs in 55 countries.


Rubio has said that going forward, all foreign aid must make America safer, stronger and more prosperous.


A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that so far more than 9,100 foreign assistance-related grants worth over $15.9 billion have been reviewed. More than 4,100 grants worth nearly $4.4 billion have been identified for elimination as part of “the America First agenda” — a 28% reduction in total grant value.


“USAID evaluated 6,200 multiyear awards with $58.2 billion in value remaining,” the spokesperson added. “At the conclusion of a process led by USAID leadership, including tranches personally reviewed by Secretary Rubio, nearly 5,800 awards with $54 billion in value remaining were identified for elimination as part of the America First agenda — a 92% reduction.”


State Department Correspondent Nike Ching contributed to this report. Some information came from The Associated Press.

## White House media access stirs debate

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Who gets access to cover the White House and what their role is have been the subject of debate over the past few weeks.


The two main issues are a lawsuit filed by The Associated Press to contest the White House's restrictions on its reporters, and the White House's announcement that it is taking control of the pool system that provides close-up coverage of the president.


Here's a breakdown on the cases.


White House to pick press pool 


In a departure from decadeslong precedent, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that the White House will decide which reporters make up the press pool.


"Legacy outlets who have participated in the press pool for decades will still be allowed to join — fear not," Leavitt said during a press briefing. "We will also be offering the privilege to well-deserving outlets who have never been allowed to share in this awesome responsibility."


The press pool is a rotating group of journalists from print, TV and radio who cover the president up close each day for the broader press corps. VOA is among the outlets that provides pool coverage.


The White House Correspondents' Association, or WHCA, has coordinated the press pool since the 1950s. The association's nearly 800 members represent nearly 300 news organizations. Not all members of the association are part of the presidential pool – only those that can devote the time and resources needed to accompany the president on trips.


The WHCA described the decision to change the system as an affront to press freedom.


"This move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States," WHCA president Eugene Daniels said in a statement. "In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps."


Some media outlets that are part of the pool and rely on its coverage have said the change could hamper the spread of reliable information.


AP restrictions 


A judge this week described the White House's ban on The AP as "problematic" but declined to immediately order the White House to restore the news agency's access.


The nonprofit news agency has been blocked from some White House events, as well as the Oval Office and Air Force One, over its editorial decision to retain the "Gulf of Mexico" name to refer to the body of water that Trump renamed the Gulf of America via an executive order.


After Trump issued his "Gulf of America" executive order, the news agency said it would continue referring to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico while acknowledging the name Trump had picked in an effort to avoid confusing its international audiences.


Many news outlets have followed The AP's lead, but others, including VOA, Fox and Axios, have changed their style to reflect the executive order. VOA, like many other media outlets, also subscribes to The AP's news and video services.


Jane Kirtley, a media ethics and law professor at the University of Minnesota, said it could be considered unethical for news outlets to comply with such orders from a president.


"I think there is an argument that the ethical thing to do for a news organization is to resist that," Kirtley told VOA. "In order to maintain their independence, they sometimes need to fight back against overreaching by the government."


In a lawsuit filed Feb. 21, The AP said the ban violates its First Amendment free speech rights and its Fifth Amendment procedural rights, because it had no chance to appeal the decision internally.


Trump has stood by the ban, saying, "We're gonna keep them [The AP] out until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America."


At the Monday court hearing, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden said The AP had not yet demonstrated that it had suffered irreparable harm.


The White House celebrated McFadden's ruling. "As we have said from the beginning, asking the president of the United States questions in the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to journalists, not a legal right," it said in a statement.


Still, McFadden said the White House's restriction on AP was problematic. "It seems pretty clearly viewpoint discrimination," he said.


Viewpoint discrimination is when the government retaliates against individuals or news outlets over specific viewpoints. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that such discrimination constitutes a First Amendment violation because it prevents a level playing field for all opinions.


After the Monday hearing, AP spokesperson Lauren Easton said in a statement that the news agency looked forward to the next hearing "where we will continue to stand for the right of the press and the public to speak freely without government retaliation."


In its statement after the Monday hearing, the White House said, "We stand by our decision to hold the Fake News accountable for their lies."


The next hearing in The AP's lawsuit is set for March 20.

## China's backdoor to US markets may be closing soon

date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Donald Trump's 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, scheduled to kick in Tuesday, will affect not only those two countries but also will have direct implications on Chinese companies. 


The Hofusan Industrial Park is a complex about 20 km north of Monterrey, Mexico, and a 2.5-hour drive to the U.S. border city of Laredo, Texas. The industrial park, set up specifically for Chinese companies, describes itself as "an ideal logistics hub for the North American market" on its website.  


The site also promotes itself as "an alternative” to exporting Chinese products to America" and lists "to avoid trade barriers" as reasons for Chinese capital to be invested in the Mexico-based industrial park.


At a Thursday news conference, Trump repeated his reasons for imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, which also goes into effect Tuesday.


"The drugs come in through Mexico. A lot of them, not all, but a lot come from China, and that's why we did that," Trump said.


The tariffs are not aimed solely at drugs, according to Evan Ellis, research professor of Latin American studies and a China expert at the U.S. Army War College.


He told VOA that Trump “also is sending the message that his administration will not allow Chinese companies to use Mexico as a pass-through, for tariff-free access to the U.S. market, by reinventing themselves as Mexican companies, however attractive such investment may be in the short term to Mexico."


The 25% tariff on Mexican imports will "significantly" affect these Chinese businesses, said Christopher Tang, business and supply chain professor at the University of California-Los Angeles. 


"These tariffs can erode their competitive advantage and profit margins. The tariffs effectively close the U.S. market door for these companies unless they find alternative strategies to mitigate the impact," Tang said.  


Chinese companies that operate within the Hofusan Industrial Park did not respond to VOA's requests for comment. 


Tang expects Chinese companies in Mexico to either refocus on Latin American markets, if they stay in Mexico, or move their operations to the U.S. or Asia to avoid the steep tariff. 


Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said, "Chinese companies located in Canada or Mexico will obviously be targets of the United States. Therefore, I think Chinese companies need to look for other locations, and possible destinations include Australia, Japan, Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, Brazil."


Mexico: cost-effective alternative 


Tariffs imposed during Trump's first term, maintained and expanded during Joe Biden's presidency, plus higher transportation costs in recent years, prompted many Chinese companies to look for an alternate, more cost-effective way of entering the U.S. market.  


Mexico became their first choice for building factories, and the Hofusan Industrial Park tailored for Chinese enterprises broke ground in 2017.  


Some companies import products or components from China to produce in Mexico and export to the United States.  


Others have been manufacturing and assembling their products in Mexico, putting on the "Made in Mexico" label, and sending the products to the United States with no tariff. 


Currently there are about 40 companies in the industrial park, including engineering equipment manufacturer Lingong Heavy Machinery, electric car manufacturer BYD, home appliance manufacturer Hisense, solar panel manufacturer Trina Solar and Man Wah Furniture. 


The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), implemented in July 2020, allows Mexican-made products that meet certain rules of origin to enter the U.S. tariff free.  


The agreement is up for review and renewal in July 2026. If it is not renewed or if there are even more tariffs imposed on Mexican imports, "the incentives for Chinese investment going to Mexico will largely go away, and thus Mexico will not reap the continued benefits of the current rush by Chinese companies to invest in Mexico to take advantage of nearshoring anyway," said Ellis. 

 

Chinese reshoring 


Xeneta, an Oslo-based company that analyzes air and ocean freight markets, said in a study last year that China's trade with Mexico was "the fastest growing trade route on the planet."


Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico has also increased significantly over the past five years. The automotive industry has long been a major driver of Chinese direct investment in Mexico, accounting for about a third of Mexican investment since the mid-2010s. But in the past few years, it has become the main driver of investment. 


According to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group, in 2023, Chinese companies invested $2.72 billion in the automotive sector, accounting for 72% of China's investment in Mexico that year. This trend continued until the first half of 2024, with automotive industry investment accounting for three-quarters of China's total investment in Mexico. 


Backdoor concern 


Mexico's rapidly growing trade relationship with China has aroused concerns in the United States that Chinese companies are using the "backdoor" of USMCA to continue to import goods into the U.S. 


Nick Vyas, a global supply chain expert at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, told VOA that Chinese companies setting up factories in Mexico have become a pressing issue in bilateral trade negotiations between the United States and Mexico. 


"Chinese direct or indirect investment in Mexico has now become a question," he said. "When we say 'Made in Mexico,' is it really made in Mexico or is it assembled in Mexico?" 


"Traceability and trade compliance will be the focus of the next generation of trade issues," said Vyas, who believes that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is likely to sacrifice the interests of these Chinese companies if necessary. 


Ellis said, "It is likely that there will be an escalation in the trade war that will further damage the already fragile PRC [People’s Republic of China] economy and Chinese companies, if the PRC government responds with tariffs of its own." 


But a trade war is also worrying U.S. businesses and consumers, said Tang. 


"Cost goes up, price goes up, and availability/choices will go down," he said. "[The] U.S. needs time to rebuild its industrial ecosystem that has been hollowed out since the 1980s. Pushing so many tariffs all at once without securing the production capabilities and capacity is very risky."
