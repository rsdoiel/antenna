## Vance tells Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

Paris — U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on Tuesday their "massive" regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as "authoritarian censorship."


The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey to nurture the next big AI giant.


Vance, setting out the Trump administration's America First agenda, said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union's far tougher regulatory approach.


"We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry," Vance told an AI summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris.


"We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship," he added.


Vance criticized the "massive regulations" created by the EU's Digital Services Act, as well as Europe's online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms.


"Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation," he said.


European lawmakers last year approved the bloc's AI Act, the world's first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology.


Vance is leading the American delegation at the Paris summit.




Vance also appeared to take aim at China at a delicate moment for the U.S. technology sector.


Last month, Chinese startup DeepSeek freely distributed a powerful AI reasoning model that some said challenged U.S. technology leadership. It sent shares of American chip designer Nvidia down 17%.


"From CCTV to 5G equipment, we're all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that's been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes," Vance said.


But he said that "partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true? Just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product."


Vance did not mention DeepSeek by name. There has been no evidence of information being able to surreptitiously flow through the startup's technology to China’s government, and the underlying code is freely available to use and view. However, some government organizations have reportedly banned DeepSeek’s use.


Speaking after Vance, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he was fully in favor of trimming red tape, but he stressed that regulation was still needed to ensure trust in AI, or people would end up rejecting it. "We need a trustworthy AI," he said.


European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would cut red tape and invest more in AI.




In a bilateral meeting, Vance and von der Leyen were also likely to discuss Trump's substantial increase of tariffs on steel.


OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was expected to address the summit on Tuesday. A consortium led by Musk said on Monday it had offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI.


Altman promptly posted on X: "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want."


The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump administration will ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the U.S. sue or investigate the industry's biggest players.


Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI -- which big players develop -- he also said: "Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field."

## Modi to meet Trump with focus on trade, immigration and strategic ties

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

New Delhi — As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the United States for a two-day visit starting Wednesday, officials in New Delhi expressed optimism that the visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among U.S. President Donald Trump’s top priorities.


Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India-U.S. ties are solid and that “this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.”


Modi will reach Washington after visiting France, where he is attending a global conference on artificial intelligence.


Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are “very big tariff abusers.” In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship.


His top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, repeated such concerns on Monday. "India has enormously high" tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC.




New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it will lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars.


It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain market access to India and boost energy imports from the U.S., say analysts.


“New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,” said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. “India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.”


For India, the stakes are high — the U.S. is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with a surplus of about $32 billion in India’s favor in 2023.


India has not been impacted so far by Trump’s tariff impositions — the latest 25 percent tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have merely a marginal impact on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials.


Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, President Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of American-made security equipment.


India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries like France, Israel and the United States.


“The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,” according to Rahul Bedi, defense analyst in New Delhi. “There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.”


Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties.




Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations.


At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology.


“People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,” Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees.


In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term.




Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts point out that the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues.


“It was president Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about ten years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,” said Mahapatra. “This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.”

## Virginia governor declares storm emergency as snow and ice bear down on mid-Atlantic states

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

A wintry mess was bearing down on mid-Atlantic states Tuesday with forecasts of significant snow and ice accumulations prompting warnings of potential power outages.


The National Weather Service said travel would become treacherous Tuesday through early Wednesday in much of Virginia and West Virginia.


Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm, allowing state agencies to assist local governments. Schools and government offices throughout Virginia were set to be closed Tuesday.


The heaviest snow, up to 25.4 centimeters, was forecast in portions of northern and central Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Ice accumulations could range from a glaze in Kentucky and West Virginia to 1.3 centimeters in the Roanoke Valley of southwest Virginia, the weather service said. Power outages and tree damage were likely in places with heavy ice buildups.


“Did you think winter was over? Think again!” the weather service's office in Blacksburg, Virginia, said in a post on the social media platform X.


Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said it has requested 700 additional workers from neighboring utilities to assist with problems by Tuesday morning.


In northern Virginia, the National Park Service closed a portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a narrow highway that winds its way through woods along the Potomac River. The parkway connects multiple small national park sites and has historically been a trouble spot during winter storms for abandoned cars that created a slalom course for snowplows and other vehicles.


Winter storm warnings extended from Kentucky to southern New Jersey, and a flood watch was posted for a wide swath of Kentucky, Tennessee, southwest Virginia and northern Georgia. The snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain as temperatures climb by Wednesday afternoon.


A separate storm system is set to bring heavy snow from Kansas and Missouri to the Great Lakes on Wednesday, the weather service said.


Dangerous cold was forecast Tuesday from an Arctic air mass stretching from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes.


The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus 36 degrees Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for the homeless in the city of about 35,000 planned to be out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needs them, Erickson said.


“When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,” he said. “Having all those resources available literally can save their life or keep them from frostbite.”

## Private jets collide at Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, killing 1 person, authorities say

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.  — One person was killed and others were injured when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, authorities said.


Neil's jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway and collided with another parked plane, Neil's representative Worrick Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them.


“Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today," Robinson said.


The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared that the primary landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in the collision, she said.


Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane.


Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of the person killed in the collision.


“Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,” Folio said.


The runway has been closed and will remain closed “for the foreseeable future,” Kuester said.


Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowsky said in a statement that she is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport, police and federal agencies.


“On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment,” she said. “We will keep all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.”


The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just a few miles away.


The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation disasters in the past two weeks. 


A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome, killing all 10 people on board.

## Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel tariffs that could hit Canada and Mexico, the top two exporters to the U.S., the hardest. Trump’s ongoing trade offensive also provoked chiding from the U.S.’ top competitor, China. VOA correspondent Anita Powell reports from the White House.

## Back to plastic: Trump announces US policy ‘to end the use of paper straws’

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday declaring that it is “the policy of the United States to end the use of paper straws.”


Former President Joe Biden’s administration, in an attempt to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, announced a plan in July 2024 to replace plastics with reusable, compostable and highly recyclable products.


Trump’s order Monday stated that paper straws “are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple straws.”


He also noted that paper straws are often individually wrapped in plastic, which undermines the environmental argument for their use.


“It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said Monday as he signed the order.


The Biden policy aimed to get plastic straws and other single-use plastics out of federal food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.


Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media post over the weekend.


In his Monday order, he instructed agency officials to stop buying paper straws and make sure paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.


He also directed officials to create a national strategy to end the use of paper straws within 45 days.


Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

## Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

White House — President Donald Trump on Monday fired another volley in his ongoing trade war, announcing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers.


“It’s a big deal,” Trump said, the thick black marker in his right hand hovering over the executive order.


“This is the beginning of making America rich again,” he said, dragging his distinctive jagged signature over the paper.




Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, watched from over Trump’s left shoulder in the Oval Office. Trump's trade adviser said this move will help domestic producers and support U.S. economic and national security. Lutnick spoke of the 120,000 jobs this could bring back.


“You are the president who is standing up for the American steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand next to you,” Lutnick said.


The nuts and bolts


Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports.


Trump’s actions also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminum to be "smelted and cast" in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel.


The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs.


Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security.


"The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security," he told reporters.


"This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum," Navarro said.


What now?


Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action Sunday — and the move drew instant pushback in what is unfolding as a tit-for-tat exchange.


Earlier Monday, Beijing enacted additional tariffs on U.S. goods as a countermeasure to Trump’s earlier 10% hike on Chinese goods.


“There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,” said Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “They harm the interests of the people of both countries. What is needed now is not unilateral tariff increases but equal dialogue and consultation based on mutual respect. We urge the U.S. to correct its wrong practices and stop politicizing and instrumentalizing economic and trade issues.”


Most economists believe tariffs raise consumer prices. Scholars of supply chains and logistics say Trump’s move also raises major global policy questions.


“It's not clear whether this is a negotiating strategy, whether this is going to be permanent,” said Professor Sunderesh Heragu of Oklahoma State University. “Is this only restricted to Canada, Mexico and China as it is now, or is it going to expand to the European Union, for example, or even the BRICS countries, of which, you know, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and 12 or 14 other countries, are part of?”


He said these concerns may prompt countries to realign their trade relationships, which will likely alarm producers.


“It clearly causes a lot of confusion, and you know, businesses, again, hate uncertainty,” Heragu said. “So, they're going to put everything on pause. That means, you know, there could be a decrease in production activity, while at the same time, the tariffs could have inflationary effects.”


Some in the automotive industry in Detroit, the U.S.’ “Motor City,” echoed that concern.


"Sudden tariffs to a system — there isn't a lot of good that comes out of that,” said Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of MichAuto and vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives at the Detroit Regional Chamber.


Studies attempting to understand the impact of these moves yield mixed pictures. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs will generate around $100 billion each year in federal tax revenue.


Another analysis shows they could “impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and ultimately driving up consumer prices.”

## Hamas threatens to delay hostage release

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

Hamas officials accused Israel of violating a ceasefire agreement Monday and threatened to delay releasing more hostages, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to say “all hell is going to break out” if all the remaining hostages are not turned over by Saturday.


The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel.


A spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement the militants remain committed to the ceasefire terms “as long as the occupation adheres to them.”


Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. The group said Palestinians were targeted “with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas” and Israel has failed “to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.”


However, a United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated.


Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be “a complete violation” of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli military on the highest level of alert.


In Washington Monday, Trump said he would propose canceling the ceasefire agreement if all the remaining hostages being held in Gaza were not released by 12 o’clock Saturday, but he did not specify whether that was noon or midnight, and he did not indicate a time zone. 


He also said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don't take Palestinian refugees being relocated from Gaza.


Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages while Israel has released more than 730 prisoners.


Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan for the enclave, they would have no right to return.


In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a "real estate development for the future."


“I would own it," he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have already rejected.


Trump, a billionaire New York real estate magnate before entering politics in 2015, did not say where the Palestinians would be relocated. But when asked by Fox anchor Bret Baier if they would be allowed to return home to Gaza, Trump said, "No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing."


"In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable,” Trump said of Gaza, decimated by 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas.


In the Fox interview, Trump said he would build "beautiful communities" for the Palestinians.


"Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is," Trump said.


On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by fighting.


Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had "forced the enemy to submit to our demands" and that it thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's “Illusion of achieving total victory."


Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to where. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire.


During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor.


In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a "sustainable calm." But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated.


The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

## Justice Dept directs prosecutors to drop charges against New York mayor

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

The Justice Department on Monday directed federal prosecutors in New York to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, according to a memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.


Bove, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, intervened in the case, saying the indictment of Adams interfered with his 2025 mayoral reelection campaign.


A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment.


Prosecutors have not yet indicated to the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho in Manhattan, that they plan to drop the case, court records showed Monday evening.


Adams was the subject of a five-count indictment charging him with accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey.


Adams pleaded not guilty.

## Musk-led group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

A consortium led by Elon Musk said Monday it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the billionaire's fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from transitioning to a for-profit firm.


Musk's bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want."


Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023.


Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a $500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House.


OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models.


Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure.


Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money.


"It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was," Musk said in a statement Monday. "We will make sure that happens."


Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


"Musk's bid puts another wrinkle into OpenAI's quest to remove the nonprofit's control over its for-profit entity," said Rose Chan Loui, executive director of the UCLA Law Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits.


"This bid sets a marker for the valuation of the nonprofit's economic interests," she said. "If OpenAI values the nonprofit's interests at less than what Musk is offering, then they would have to show why."


The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund III, Emanuel Capital Management, and Eight Partners.


XAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal which first reported Musk's offer earlier Monday. XAI recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion, sources have told Reuters.


Throwing a wrench


"This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things," said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance.


"The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it's a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit. If this was a public company, plaintiffs' lawyers would justifiably be lining up down the block to sue that transaction."


OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January.


Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds.


"Musk's offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation," said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.


"The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors ... OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank."


Musk's stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his $44 billion buyout of the social media platform that was called Twitter in 2022.

## Saipan: A birth tourism destination for Chinese mothers

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

So-called birth tourism is not only happening on the U.S. mainland. Pregnant Chinese mothers have been heading to a U.S. territory much closer to home to have their babies and obtain for them coveted U.S. citizenship. VOA Mandarin’s Yu Yao and Jiu Dao have the details from Saipan, capital of the Northern Mariana Islands. Elizabeth Lee narrates.

## Facing backlash over $500K salary, LA's wildfire recovery czar agrees to work for free

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Steve Soboroff, a longtime fixture in Los Angeles civic life who is now serving as chief recovery officer for the city’s wildfire comeback, won’t take a salary after facing backlash over plans to pay him $500,000. He would have been paid through charitable donations, not with taxpayer money.


Soboroff had defended the proposed salary of half-a-million dollars for three months of work, saying his expertise as a residential property developer made him worth the price. But after criticisms mounted from elected officials and residents, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reversed course over the weekend and said Soboroff would receive no compensation. Soboroff is the city’s former police commissioner.


“Steve is always there for LA. I spoke to him today and asked him to modify his agreement and work for free. He said yes. We agree that we don’t need anything distracting from the recovery work we’re doing," Bass said in a statement Saturday. She had named him to the recovery czar position on Jan. 17.


A message seeking comment was left for Soboroff on Monday.


Soboroff, 76, raised his family in the Pacific Palisades area, where nearly 7,000 homes were destroyed by last month's inferno. His son, NBC News journalist Jacob Soboroff, reported from the devastated neighborhood where he grew up.


He was initially tasked with leading the first phase of the city’s wildfire rebuilding effort. On Friday though, Bass suggested that the scope of his work could be diminished, saying he would focus primarily on rebuilding the Palisades’ historic business district.


Soboroff disputed that notion, saying he is regularly interacting with federal agencies.


In addition to developing thousands of homes over decades, Soboroff served on the city’s Board of Police Commissioners and on the city commission that oversees the Department of Recreation and Parks — both volunteer positions.


Before the salary reversal, he told the Los Angeles Times that he put aside other real estate and environmental consulting work to take on the role of the city's recovery officer.


“I’ve been doing this for 35 years for free on some of the biggest civic projects for the city of Los Angeles. But nobody ever asked me to drop everything. This time they did,” Soboroff said. “And I said OK, under the condition that my pay not be taken out of city money, or from any wildfire survivors who would otherwise benefit from that money.”


It wasn't clear which charitable organizations would have covered his pay. Los Angeles City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who sits on the committee overseeing the recovery, called the proposed salary “obscene.”


Soboroff’s original salary was first reported by the Times.

## What the Westminster show dogs' names mean

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

They have names that could make a random password generator cry uncle.


Meet, for example, GCHG CH Calicops Sassafras Gonnakikurass.

“She’s a saucy girl. Her name says it all,” Fred Ortiz said as he groomed the Brussels griffon to compete Monday at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show.


Her name says ... what exactly? Well, ponder the final part, and you may understand what her owners are wryly getting at. But in any event, you can just call her Wrassy.


Westminster’s main competition began Monday with breed-by-breed judging that leads to U.S. dogdom's most illustrious best in show prize, awarded Tuesday night. The kennel club held agility and obedience contests Saturday, as well as other events.


If show dogs are the aristocrats of the canine world, they often have the names, titles and nicknames to match.


Their “registered,” or formal, names are the ones used for showing. Those long, confounding-sounding appellations are packed with show-dog information.


Clumps of capital letters at the beginning, and sometimes also the end, signify the dogs’ achievements in various sports. “GCHG” and “CH,” for example, denote various levels of championship in the traditional, breed-by-breed judging.


After those titles, the first word in a registered name generally indicates the kennel, or breeding program, that produced the dog. Other kennels or dogs in the pedigree might get a shout-out at the end.




Meanwhile, show dogs have “call names” that they go by on a day-to-day basis. A dog might also have had a different “puppy name” bestowed by its breeder and later changed by its eventual owner.


The portmanteau words and puzzling phrases in registered names are partly meant to avoid duplication with other dogs in registries that go back over a century.


But many breeders also use patterns to help them remember which litter was which.


Professional dog handlers and sometime miniature schnauzer breeders Rachel Adams and Alberto Montila name their litters in alphabetical order — one litter had names that start with “A,” the next with “B,” and so on, Adams said Monday. She was blow-drying a French bulldog named GCHG CH Elysium’s Adventurous Rapscallion D’Assisi, better known as Finn.


When Amie McLaughlin picks names for her litters of Norwegian buhunds, she just likes to have pun.


“I like the name to be something that someone looks at and says, ‘Oh, that’s cute,'” said McLaughlin, of Kent, Washington.


A dog she bred and guided Monday, GCH CH Cloudpointe Nothing Betta Than This CGC, was born into a fish-themed litter (hence “Betta,” a type of Southeast Asian fish). He goes by Eirik when he's at home with co-owner Sarah Woodworth in Paloa, Hawaii.


GCH CH Aberdeen's Zoltar RN BN-V — just Zoltar, to his friends — has owners who appreciate humor, too. For one thing, they share their Los Angeles-area home with a shaggy, clownish, 120-pound otterhound who likes to cuddle.


Comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who owns the dog with his wife, model and actor Lydia Hearst, named Zoltar for the fortune-telling machine that makes a teenager grow to adult proportions overnight in the movie “Big.”


“We knew he was going to grow,” and plenty big, explained Hearst.


Zoltar got some recognition Monday from the judge, but the dog's cousin Melody, aka GCHS CH Dobhran’s Alexa Play Some Music, won best of breed.


Hardwick and Hearst were also cheering on the French bulldog breed winner called Sassy, or GCHS Diva's Sassafras Lass. She and other breed winners were headed into a semifinal round Monday night.




Sassy is owned and was co-bred by Hearst's mother, newspaper heir Patricia Hearst Shaw. Famous in the 1970s for her abduction and involvement in a robbery by a radical group, she's been renowned in recent years for her Frenchies and other show dogs.


Colton Johnson and his family name their litters of old English sheepdogs by themes, such as songs, movies, money, or — appropriately — fluffy things.


One of those “fluff” dogs is GCH CH Bugaboo's Give Me S'more, who lolled on a table while Johnson brushed him Monday.


“It’s his spa day,” joked Johnson, of Colorado Springs, Colorado.


The dog’s call name is Graham, as in the crackers that join toasted marshmallow and chocolate to make s’mores. The Johnsons considered calling him Marsh or Mallow, but those names didn't stick.


Three-year-old Graham is a grandson of Swagger, the old English sheepdog whom Johnson handled to a second-place finish at Westminster in 2013.


Last year's runner-up, a German shepherd named GCHP Kaleef's Mercedes, is back this year for a last hurrah and won her breed Monday. The 5-year-old will retire from showing after this event, co-owner Dr. Cynthian Wilhelmy said.


As for her name, “I wanted something German and something that represented excellence,” said Wilhelmy, of Martinsburg, West Virginia. “Classic, reliable and excellent — that's Mercedes.”

## Democrats look for ways to oppose Trump administration's changes while in the minority

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

Democratic lawmakers criticized what they called the Trump administration’s “extreme” efforts to reshape the U.S. government, vowing to oppose those changes despite limited political capital in both chambers of the U.S. Congress.


House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the chamber’s floor Monday that Republicans were departing from their campaign pledge not to follow Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the U.S. government.


“This year, Republicans have spent all of their time implementing the most extreme parts of Project 2025 and have done nothing to lower the high cost of living,” Jeffries said.


Congressional Republicans say Trump is exercising broad presidential authority to reevaluate government agencies. Trump is accomplishing this through Elon Musk, a multibillionaire whom he put in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, whose aim is to reduce federal spending.


Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues that Democrats have a four-pronged strategy to oppose the Trump administration’s actions: oversight, litigation, legislation, and communication and mobilization.


Schumer also said Democrats would continue to support litigation in the courts to stop the funding freeze and to prevent federal employees from being laid off.


Vice President JD Vance criticized those judicial decisions, writing on X, “If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.”


Democratic Senator Chris Murphy responded on X Monday, “For those of us who believe we are in the middle of a constitutional crisis, this is the meat of it. Trump and Vance are laying the groundwork to ignore the courts — democracy’s last line of defense against unchecked executive power.”


Senate Democrats also announced a new whistleblowers portal for federal civil service employees and public servants to disclose information about wrongdoing.


In a statement, they said, “As Senate Republicans refuse to fulfill their constitutional duty to provide a check on the Executive Branch, Senate Democrats remain steadfast in our commitment to uncovering the truth. We are prepared to issue demand letters, preserve public records, conduct public hearings, and pursue legal action where necessary.”


Schumer said Democrats would support legislation funding the U.S. government but called on Republicans to negotiate in a bipartisan fashion. A short-term resolution funding the U.S. government expires on March 14. Any bill funding the government past that date needs 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass. Republicans currently hold the majority in the chamber with 53 seats.

## As tariffs take effect, Beijing and Washington look back to 2020 deal

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

New Chinese tariffs on a range of U.S. goods went into effect Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese products last week. Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum are next.


Despite the tariffs and rising tensions, both sides seem reluctant to launch into a full-on trade war, analysts say.


Beijing has its plate full battling its own internal economic struggles, and for now President Trump has deferred most of his promised tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy.


Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is preparing to offer to return to a so-called “Phase 1” trade deal that was signed during Trump’s first term.


The Trump administration has sent its own signals as well. 


Trump has called for the Office of the United States Trade Representative to review the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement and determine whether Beijing has fulfilled its commitments in the contract.


Last week, Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, said he would assess China's compliance with the first phase of the agreement quickly upon his appointment to ensure the implementation of the deal. Greer also said he would use it as a starting point in relations with China.




What is the Phase 1 deal?


On January 15, 2020, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed the Phase 1 agreement, which laid out several terms for trade between the world’s two biggest economies. The deal called on the United States to cut some of its imposed tariffs on China and included a commitment from Beijing to buy more U.S. products and implement certain reforms.


The 96-page agreement, divided into eight sections, placed a big emphasis on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, and protecting domestic industries by cracking down on Chinese trade practices, such as nontariff trade barriers, intellectual property violations and the forced transfer of technology without adequate compensation.




The agreement mandated that China purchase at least $200 billion in U.S. products and services over a two-year period from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. It also required that Beijing stop subsidizing strategic sectors and give fairer treatment to American companies in terms of regulation.


Despite those commitments from China, data from a report published in 2022 by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington showed that Beijing did not reach its purchase target.


The report also showed that Beijing has completed 57% of the spending laid out in the agreement, a total that is lower than the level of China's purchase of goods from the United States before the U.S.-China trade war.


Although China was not expected to fully meet its commitments, the agreement did have some benefits for Washington, as it helped decrease Washington’s trade deficit with Beijing.




Starting point


Analysts say the agreement may be revisited as a starting point for new trade discussions.


“The two sides need to start somewhere. Phase 1 may at least provide some common language that both sides will be familiar with so as to get that ball rolling,” Chad Brown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, explained to VOA in an emailed response Friday.


Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii, says the Phase 1 agreement has two advantages for acting as a foundation for U.S.-China trade discussions.


“First, the two sides reached a similar agreement before, so they know it’s feasible,” he told VOA in an emailed response on Friday.


He also explained that using the agreement “suits both sides’ interests.”


"Trump wants to claim he has resolved the bilateral trade imbalance, which he sees as his primary measure of success," he explained, noting that this agreement supports that narrative.


He added that the deal benefits Beijing by allowing China to avoid making significant structural reforms.


Roy, however, adds that several factors make an agreement between Washington and Beijing difficult.


“A major bilateral economic deal would depend on avoiding a strategic crisis, which might occur over Taiwan or the South China Sea, or an encounter between U.S. and Chinese ships or aircraft that escalates, or something like the spy balloon incident,” he said.


Early in 2023, the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon floating through U.S. airspace delayed a U.S. diplomatic visit to the country by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The ballon was eventually shot down.

## Arizona adds endangered bat to list of night-flying creatures that frequent the state

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA — Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive. 


Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders. 


Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva-swabbing campaign. 


The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA — or eDNA — to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home. 


The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988, and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It is an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants. 




Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated. 


“If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you’re not guaranteed to be successful,” said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. “By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit." 


Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall. 


The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall. 


Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge. 


Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months. 


“There’s a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what’s in the database," Riley said. "A little bit like a Google search — you’ve got your question, you’re asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you’ve got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.” 


Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats. 


“They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,” Lear said.

## 15 cases of measles in Texas county with numerous vaccine exemptions

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Fifteen measles cases — mostly in school-aged children — have been confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates of vaccine exemptions in the state.


South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said Monday that his department was first notified in late January about the first two cases in Gaines County, which he said were “two children who had seen a physician in Lubbock.”


Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is ongoing.


“I wouldn’t say they’re all connected, but our teams are looking into exposure sites and the background of those cases," he said.


Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last week and are offering screening services to residents.


The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month, health officials in metro Atlanta are working to contain a measles case that spread to two unvaccinated family members.


Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs.


The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from .76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to Texas Department of State Health Services data.


Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the 2023-24 school year, which is more than five times the state average of 2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%.


But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely significantly higher, DSHS spokesperson Lara Anton said, because Gaines County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.


The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are a two-shot series: The first is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and second between 4 to 6 years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the U.S.


But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have proposed various vaccine requirement changes at a time when anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and Human Services.


One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no immediate reports of infection. New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott said the agency has been in communication with Texas officials but there was no known exposure to measles in his state.


“We're going to watch this very closely,” Nott said.


Two cases of measles were reported in early January in the Houston area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don't appear to be connected.


Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.

## US judge keeps block on Trump federal buyout plan in place for now

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

BOSTON/WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge kept his block on President Donald Trump's buyout plan for federal employees in place on Monday while he considers whether to impose it for a longer period of time. 


The decision by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston prevents Trump's administration from implementing the buyout plan for now, giving a temporary victory to labor unions that have sued to stop it entirely. 


More than 2 million federal civilian employees had faced a midnight deadline Monday to accept the proposal. It is unclear when O'Toole will rule on the request by the unions. 


The buyout effort is part of a far-reaching plan by Trump and his allies to reduce the size and rein in the actions of the federal bureaucracy. Trump, who returned to the presidency on Jan. 20, has accused the federal workforce of undercutting his agenda during his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021. 


Unions have urged their members not to accept the buyout offer — saying Trump's administration cannot be trusted to honor it — but about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts as of Friday, according to a White House official. 


Reuters has been unable to independently verify that number, which does not include a breakdown of workers from each agency. 


The offer promises to pay employees their regular salaries and benefits until October without requiring them to work, but that may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14, and there is no guarantee that salaries would be funded beyond that point. 


At a court hearing, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton called the buyout plan a "humane off-ramp" for those frustrated by Trump's decision to reduce the size of the workforce and end the ability of many of them to work from home. 


But a lawyer for the unions said the plan had been carried out in a "slap dash" fashion with little regard to how it might disrupt operations at agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. 


"They failed to consider the continued functioning of government," lawyer Elena Goldstein said. 


The administration had initially proposed a deadline of last Thursday before O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton, extended it so he could consider the case. 


Trump has tasked Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with overseeing the purge of federal employees through his Department of Government Efficiency, which is not an actual government agency. 


Musk's actions have sown panic among federal workers and prompted public protests. His actions also have led to a flood of calls to U.S. lawmakers by voters worried about the access that Musk's team has been given to sensitive information in government computer systems that contain data on federal payments to Americans and personal details of federal workers. 


Several lawsuits 


The unions and Democratic attorneys general have brought lawsuits challenging Trump's rapid remaking of government and won some initial victories. 


A union that represents Consumer Financial Protection Bureau workers has filed a lawsuit seeking to block acting chief Russell Vought's move to suspend CFPB activities, one of several legal challenges that Trump's administration now faces. 


Democratic attorneys general from 22 U.S. states filed a lawsuit on Monday in Boston challenging sharp cuts to federal grant funding for universities, medical centers and other research institutions by the Trump administration. 


An effort to hollow out the U.S. Agency for International Development is partially on hold after a judge's ruling. 


Trump's effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans, grants and other financial assistance has also been paused in a separate case. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Monday ruled that the administration must restore all domestic funding while he considers the case. 


On Saturday, a judge temporarily blocked Musk's entity from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments at the Treasury Department.

## Trump signs executive orders on steel, aluminum tariffs

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Donald Trump moved to substantially raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday, canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and other countries in a move that could boost the risk of a multifront trade war. 


Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the U.S. duty free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product exclusions. 


The proclamations were extensions of Trump's 2018 Section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these measures. 


Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminum to be "smelted and cast" in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel into the U.S. 


The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs. 


Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security. 


"The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security," he told reporters. 


"This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum." 


Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.

## 2 US deportation flights head to Venezuela, alleged gang members aboard

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants deported from the United States — the first since a January deal between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — are heading to Venezuela, the South American country's government said Monday. 


The flights, run by Venezuelan airline Conviasa, are part of a plan to repatriate thousands of migrants who fled Venezuela "because of economic sanctions and the campaigns of psychological warfare against our country," the government statement said. 


Some of the people on the flight are allegedly involved in illegal activities with the Tren de Aragua gang, the statement said and will be vigorously investigated for criminal ties. 


Trump envoy Richard Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 31, where the two men discussed migration and sanctions, among other issues. Grenell left the South American country with six Americans who had been held by Venezuelan authorities. 


The Trump administration has said it is a priority to deport members of Tren de Aragua from the U.S. and Trump himself said after Grenell's visit that Maduro agreed to receive all Venezuelan illegal migrants and provide for their transportation back home. 


The Venezuelan government says it destroyed Tren de Aragua within its borders in 2023. 


Trump's administration has also moved to remove deportation protection from about 348,000 Venezuelans in the U.S., who could lose work permits and then be deported in April. 


More than 7 million Venezuelan migrants have left their country in recent years amid a sustained economic and social collapse blamed by the government on sanctions by the United States and others. 


Maduro and several allies have been indicted by the United States on drug trafficking charges and international observers and the country's opposition say a July election which gave Maduro his third term was fraudulent.

## Trump calls for halting penny production, saying it's too expensive

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  — The lowly penny, the forgotten mainstay of coin jars and car cupholders everywhere, may soon be no more.


President Donald Trump announced Sunday he's ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin, whose buying power is long past its prime.


Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost — currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint.


Trump's surprise order comes after decades of unsuccessful efforts to pitch the penny.


"Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny. But sometimes traditions get ridiculous," the Farmers' Almanac said in its 1989 edition.


Here's a look at some questions surrounding Trump's order.


Can Trump really order the Treasury to stop minting pennies without Congress' approval?


Yes, according to legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard University.


U.S. code gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to mint and issue coins "in amounts the secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States."


If Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent decides the amount necessary for the penny is zero, he's within his legal rights, Tribe said.


"Unlike a lot of what the new administration has been doing pursuant to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to me entirely lawful and fully constitutional," Tribe said, referring to the aggressive executive action Trump's taken on other issues since taking office.


Congress, which dictates currency specifications like the size and metal content of coins, could make Trump's order permanent through law. But past congressional efforts to ditch the penny have failed.


Pennies are mostly made of zinc, and the American zinc lobby has been a major opponent to suggestions that the penny be eliminated.


How many pennies are in circulation?


It depends on what you mean by circulation.


Pennies are the most popular coin made by the U.S. Mint, which reported making 3.2 billion of them last year. That's more than half of all the new coins it made last year.


MIT Professor Jeff Gore, who founded Citizens to Retire the Penny, said coins are supposed to stay in circulation for about 30 years and that in the last three decades the U.S. Mint has made about 250 billion pennies.


But, he says, "because nobody wants to use pennies, they fall out of active circulation much faster than other coins."


If pennies sit in drawer for a decade, Gore asks, "Does that qualify as being in circulation?"


Will Americans miss pennies?


Experience in other countries suggests no.


Canada started phasing out its penny a dozen years ago and urged store owners to round prices to the nearest nickel for cash transactions. Electronic purchases were still billed to the nearest cent. The move came after New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and others dropped their lowest-denomination coins.


After dropping the penny or its equivalent, those countries have not looked back.


What comes next?


Trump's order, which he announced in a social media post as he was departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl, was the latest in his administration's rapid-fire efforts to cut government costs.


"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time," Trump wrote in his post, which was light on details about plans for a post-penny future.


After Canada stopped minting new pennies, it began recycling them for their "valuable" copper and zinc, according to a 2022 report from the Canadian Mint.

## Boston man cleared of US charges he acted as Chinese agent

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Boston — A jury found a Boston man not guilty on Monday of U.S. charges that he acted as an unlawful agent of China's government by supplying officials information about individuals, dissidents and groups in the local Chinese community. 


Litang Liang, 65, was acquitted in federal court of charges that he acted as an unregistered Chinese agent in a case brought in 2023 that U.S. authorities had portrayed as part of their commitment to counter efforts by China's government ato silence its critics abroad. 


Liang, a China-born U.S. citizen, had denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. His lawyer during the trial called the charges "ridiculous" and called them an effort to chill the free speech of a local community activist who advocated for the "reunification" of democratically governed Taiwan with mainland China -- a view in harmony with China's leaders. 


"Justice has finally arrived," Liang told reporters through a translator following the verdict. 


U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office pursued the case, said in a statement that while prosecutors "respect the jury's decision, we are disappointed in (Monday's) verdict." 


Liang had worked at a hotel and for years had been an active member in his union as well as a community organizer and activist in the Chinese-American community in Boston, according to his lawyer, Derege Demissie. 


Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Kistner told jurors on Friday during closing arguments in the case that China's government sought out Liang because it "wanted someone already involved in the community who knew the people who were there." 


Prosecutors said Liang from 2018 to 2022 provided Chinese officials with information on individuals and shared details about dissidents and groups with pro-Taiwan leanings. 


Prosecutors said that in 2018, after traveling to Beijing for meetings with an arm of the Chinese Communist Party, Liang founded the New England Alliance for the Peaceful Unification of China, which focused on promoting China's goals with Taiwan. 


China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. 


Prosecutors said Liang, also at the direction of Chinese officials, in 2019 organized a counter-demonstration against pro-democracy protesters, and in 2022 provided an official with a Chinese agency, tasked with investigating political dissidents, information on two potential local recruits. 


Demissie in his closing argument to the jury countered that Liang made no secret of his activism and that his prosecution infringed on Liang's right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. 


"This case would have meant nothing if it did not involve China," Demissie said. "That's what this is about. And it had the purpose of scaring people, and it achieved that purpose."

## US judge says Trump administration violated order lifting spending freeze

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

A U.S. judge on Monday said President Donald Trump's administration violated a court order lifting a broad freeze on federal spending and directed the government to immediately release any withheld funds. 


U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, had already blocked the funding freeze with a temporary restraining order on Jan. 31, but a group of Democratic state attorneys general who sued to block the move said last week that the government was still withholding funds. 


The Trump administration on Monday said it is appealing. 


"The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as the court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country," McConnell said on Monday. "These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the TRO." 


McConnell said all funding must be restored at least until he can hold a hearing on the states' motion for a longer-term order. 


On Feb. 6, a lawyer with the office of Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James told McConnell that state agencies were still having difficulty accessing federal funds, including billions of dollars for infrastructure projects under the Inflation Reduction Act. 


The Trump administration had told states it believed the order did not apply to certain environmental and infrastructure spending, and that some payments were delayed for "operational and administrative reasons." 


However, McConnell said his order had been "clear and unambiguous" in applying to all funding frozen in response to sweeping executive orders by Trump. 


The states originally sued the administration over a memorandum from the White House's Office of Management and Budget announcing a wide-ranging freeze of federal spending. Soon after the lawsuit was filed, OMB rescinded that memo. 


The memo was part of a larger Trump administration push to tighten federal spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy, which has sparked a flurry of lawsuits. 


In a separate case over Trump's push to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, federal employee unions have accused the administration of violating a court order reinstating USAID workers who were placed on administrative leave.

## VOA Mandarin: China courts India as Trump, Modi vow to deepen ties

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the U.S. on Wednesday. President Donald Trump announced Modi's White House visit as India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing, where they agreed to restore bilateral ties and resume direct flights and pilgrimages by Indian pilgrims to a holy site in Tibet. 


While Modi's government has shifted toward populist policies, China launched an aggressive public relations campaign in 2024 to improve its standing with India. Analysts view China's diplomatic push as a response to the deepening U.S.-India partnership and Beijing's desire to maintain regional influence, particularly given expected tensions with the Trump administration.

## US defense chief headed to Europe for NATO, Ukraine meetings

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is headed to Europe, his first international trip since taking office last month.


Hegseth departed from Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, early Monday, for stops in Germany, Belgium and Poland.


In Germany, the defense secretary is scheduled to visit the headquarters for U.S. European Command, and U.S. Africa Command, getting updates on developments in both regions. 




From Germany, Hegseth will travel to Brussels for the NATO Defense Ministerial and a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday and Thursday.


U.S. defense officials say Hegseth is expected to press U.S. allies in Europe to increase their defense spending and take more of a leadership role for challenges facing Europe.


He is also expected to echo U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for a diplomatic end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is about to enter its third year.


The meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a group of almost 50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia — is the first to take place during the new Trump administration and will be the first led by a country other than the U.S.


This week’s meeting, the 26th, will be led by Britain.


Britain’s Defense Ministry, in a statement Thursday said the meeting will focus on “priorities for Ukraine as the international community continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion.”


The Pentagon, in a statement previewing Hegseth’s participation in the meeting, said in addition to emphasizing Trump’s push for a diplomatic resolution to the war, the secretary, “will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine.”




Following the meetings in Brussels, Hegseth is scheduled to travel to Poland to meet with leaders there and visit with U.S. troops.


Of note, the U.S. defense secretary said he is skipping the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, which bills itself as “the world's leading forum for debating international security policy,” which gets underway Friday.


“We're not going to the Munich Security Conference,” Hegseth told defense officials and troops at a town hall meeting last Friday at the Pentagon.


“We're instead going to Poland to see the troops out there and we're going to Germany to see EUCOM and AFRICOM,” he said. “I would much rather talk to troops than go to cocktail parties. That's my job.”


Instead, the U.S. is set to be represented in Munich by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

## Opening statements begin in trial of man accused of trying to kill Salman Rushdie

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Mayville, New York — Lawyers began delivering opening statements Monday at the trial of the man charged with trying to fatally stab author Salman Rushdie in front of a lecture audience in western New York.  


Rushdie, 77, is expected to testify during the trial of Hadi Matar, bringing the writer face-to-face with his knife-wielding attacker for the first time in more than two years.  


Rushdie, the Booker Prize-winning author, had been about to speak about keeping writers safe from harm in August 2022 when Matar ran toward him on the stage at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater. Matar stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times in the neck, stomach, chest, hand and right eye, leaving him partially blind and with permanent damage to one hand. 




The Indian-born British-American author detailed the attack and his long, painful recovery in a memoir, "Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder," released last year. Rushdie had worried for his safety since his 1989 novel "The Satanic Verses" was denounced as blasphemous by many Muslims and led to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death.  


Rushdie spent years in hiding, but had traveled freely over the past quarter century after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree.  


The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa — Feb. 14, 1989 — approaches.  


Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, is charged with attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty.  


A jury was selected last week. Matar was in court throughout the three-day process, taking notes and consulting with his attorneys. He calmly said, "Free Palestine" while being led in to court Monday past members of the media taking photographs and video.  


Matar's defense faced a challenging start after it was announced that his lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness and would not attend the start of the trial.  


Judge David Foley refused a defense request to postpone opening statements, instead instructing an associate of Barone to deliver the defense's opening statement in his place.


Once testimony is underway, the trial is expected to last a week to 10 days. Jurors will be shown video and photos from the day of the attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until police arrived.  


The event's moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded. Matar told investigators he traveled by bus to Chautauqua, about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. He is believed to have slept in the grounds of the arts and academic retreat the night before the attack.  


Matar's attorney has not indicated what his defense will be. In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization's endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death.  


A later trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization — will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.  


Rushdie has been one of the world's most celebrated authors since the 1981 publication of "Midnight's Children," winner of the Booker Prize. His other works include the novels "Shame" and "Victory City," which he had completed shortly before the 2022 stabbing, and the 2012 memoir "Joseph Anton," in which he wrote about his time in hiding.


In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group's then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

## Third federal judge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Concord, New Hampshire — A third federal judge on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally.  


The ruling from U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Trump's order violates the Constitution and "attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional values."  


Trump's Republican administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States and therefore are not entitled to citizenship.  


The administration is appealing the Seattle judge's block on Trump's executive order.  


At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed.  


In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the U.S. Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.  


The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli, or "right of the soil" — is applied. Most are in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.

## Court grants request to block detained Venezuelan immigrants from being sent to Guantanamo

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.  — A federal court on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending three Venezuelan immigrants held in New Mexico to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as part of the president's immigration crackdown.


In a legal filing earlier in the day, lawyers for the men said the detainees "fit the profile of those the administration has prioritized for detention in Guantanamo, i.e. Venezuelan men detained in the El Paso area with (false) charges of connections with the Tren de Aragua gang."


It asked a U.S. District Court in New Mexico for a temporary restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that "the mere uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest injunction."


During a brief hearing, Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales granted the temporary order, which was opposed by the government, said Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney for the three men.


"It's short term. This will get revisited and further fleshed out in the weeks to come," Vosburgh told The Associated Press.


A message seeking comment was left for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.


The filing came as part of a lawsuit on behalf of the three men filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, and Las Americas Immigrant Advisory Center.


The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a lawless prison in the central Venezuelan state of Aragua more than a decade ago and has expanded in recent years as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled President President Nicolás Maduro 's rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S.


Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that flights of detainees had landed at Guantanamo. Immigrant rights groups sent a letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent there, saying the base should not be used as a "legal black hole."


White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.


Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the U.S. illegally.

## 'Anora' wins at Producers and Directors Guild Awards

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Did a wide-open Oscar race just get a front runner?


Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy “Anora” took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors.


Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged “Anora” as the front runner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival.


But after several films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners “The Brutalist” and “Emilia Perez," “Anora” reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday.


Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times.


The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.


The guild also named RaMell Ross' “Nickel Boys" best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut.


Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's “Emilia Perez" is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.


Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's “The Wild Robot” cleaned up with nine awards including best film. “The Wild Robot” will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards.

## Super Bowl commercials rely on comedy, nostalgia to avoid potential missteps

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Most of the commercials airing during this year’s Super Bowl are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a little break.


As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves Sunday. Many companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to maintain an element of surprise.


Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and buzz around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man's tongue starts dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestlé Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes an actual seal, sad that he can't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers.


Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the “Fast and Furious” franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars.


Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers.


Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials features a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.


“That’s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,” Calkins said. “Safe advertising isn’t the advertising you notice or remember.”


And advertisers can't afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year.


Here are some of the themes of this year's Super Bowl ads:


Heartwarming nostalgia


Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989's “When Harry Met Sally,” except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann's mayonnaise.


The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from “Frozen,” Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.


Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said.


Celebrity mashups


Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats.


Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns.


Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don’t remember which brand they're advertising, Xu said.


Serious moments


It isn't all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talks about America's obesity epidemic.


For the third Super Bowl in a row, Come Near — a nonprofit that promotes the teachings of Jesus — is running an ad as part of its He Gets Us campaign. The ad, featuring Johnny Cash's cover of “Personal Jesus,” shows everyday people being helpful and heroic. And the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show how pointless hate is.


Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said.


“We just had an election year and there’s a lot of discussion around divisiveness,” she said. “People might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.”


Artificial intelligence arrives


Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's “50 States, 50 Stories” campaign will show viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.

## Westminster show's canine athletes get their piece of Super Bowl weekend

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

New York — They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship.


Sorry — no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports.


Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years.


"I always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl 'the Westminster of football,' " quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers.


The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all.


And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster's green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)


Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.


"We never thought we'd be here. And now we're here," Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday.


A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 300 champion-level canines.


"She's very intuitive, very natural — probably smarter than me," handler Emily Klarman of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.


A special award for the best mixed-breed competitor went to Gable, handled by Kayla Feeney of Lima, New York.


Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillon mix named Nimble, who competed again this year.


She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.


His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored.


"He's always exciting — he does ridiculous things," Ondeyka said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs. "We have fun, regardless what happens."


While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly Labradoodle mix, used to be "afraid of the world" but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.


Saturday's competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a 7-pound (0.9-kilogramg) papillon, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog.


They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes.


Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again.


Westminster's traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night.


That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey.


Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl — because he was confident the Eagles would prevail.


There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.


The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball.


"It's a lot of organized chaos," Hillary Brown said after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break were a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix.


"It's a blast. The dogs love it," Brown said.

## Trump to announce 25% steel, aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.


Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately.




Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.


Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has dropped in recent years.


White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum.


Trump on Friday announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs — raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners — on many countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties would be imposed "so that we're treated evenly with other countries."

## Chiefs chase Super Bowl 'three-peat' as Trump attends NFL showpiece

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

New Orleans, Louisiana — The Kansas City Chiefs aim for a historic hat-trick of Super Bowl titles on Sunday when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles in front of a star-studded crowd in New Orleans headed by U.S. President Donald Trump.


Trump will become the first sitting president ever to attend the NFL showpiece when he takes his seat among a sell-out crowd of around 74,000 fans at the Superdome for the biggest annual event in the American sporting calendar, which kicks off at 5:30pm local time (2330 GMT).


Pop superstar Taylor Swift will also be in the VIP seats to watch as her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his fellow Chiefs bid to become the first team in history to lift three consecutive Vince Lombardi Trophies.


Trump's presence at the NFL showpiece will mean even tighter security than normal around an event which was already bolstered by a heavy police presence following a New Year's Day attack which left 14 people dead and many more injured on the Big Easy's famous Bourbon Street.


Trump has had a strained relationship with the NFL stretching back several decades, and triggered uproar during his first time in 2017 when he attacked the patriotism of players who kneeled during the playing of the U.S. national anthem in a protest against racial injustice.


Speaking in a pre-game interview aired on Fox News, Trump said his decision to attend this year's Super Bowl was for the good of the country.


"I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the President be at the game," Trump told Fox.


"It's an iconic day. It's going to be a great game, two great teams, and let's see what happens," Trump added, revealing that he was tipping Kansas City for victory, citing the record of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is eyeing his fourth Super Bowl win.


"When a quarterback wins as much as he's won, I have to go with Kansas City," Trump said. "I have to go with Kansas City."


Trump was due to fly into New Orleans from Florida, where he reportedly played a round of golf with Tiger Woods earlier Sunday. A schedule released by the White House said he is expected to leave the Superdome at around 8.05pm local time, well before the game reaches its conclusion.


Super Bowl fans on Sunday welcomed Trump's attendance at the game.


"I think it is awesome, congratulations to him for being the first President to make it," Bob Benderovich, a Philadelphia Eagles fan from Fort Myers, Florida, told AFP.




Chiefs favorites


As always, the Super Bowl crosses over into popular culture and the half-time show this year will feature hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar, who had a clean sweep at last Sunday's Grammys, winning in all five categories for which he received nominations.


Bookmakers and casinos meanwhile are taking odds on whether Chiefs star Kelce will propose to pop icon Swift after what might be his final game in the NFL.


For the more serious punters, the oddsmakers have the Chiefs as slight favorite for the game, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years ago which the Chiefs won by three points.


They defended their title last year, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas and putting them one win away from an unprecedented "three-peat."


The 29-year-old Mahomes will become one of just four quarterbacks in National Football League history to have won more than three Super Bowls should he triumph again, having first led the Chiefs to Super Bowl glory in 2020.


But the Eagles have added serious offensive firepower since their defeat two years ago with mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts joined by the game-changing speed and power of running back Saquon Barkley.


The Chiefs put the finishing touches to their game preparations Saturday with a 30-minute walkthrough of a mock game.


Chiefs coach Andy Reid saluted his team's attitude to training over the whole week since arriving in Louisiana.


"I thought the guys worked hard, they got done what they needed to get done," Reid said.


The Eagles had a similarly relaxed final session before going to the Superdome on Saturday for a team photo.


Head coach Nick Sirianni said his Eagles were "hungry" and "ready to roll."


"We're ready for the challenge against a really good team," Sirianni said.

## Trump official orders consumer protection agency to stop work

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. 


Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis. 


The email also ordered the bureau to “cease all supervision and examination activity.” 


Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any. 


Yet Elon Musk commented, “CFPB RIP” on social media site X on Friday. And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a message reading “page not found.” 


Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million are “excessive." Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from political pressures. 


“This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off,” Vought said on X. 


The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts — and “cheating” customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result. 


Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group, said, “that's why Wall Street’s biggest banks and Trump’s billionaire allies hate the bureau: it’s an effective cop on the finance beat and has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans — Republicans and Democrats — battling financial predators, scammers, and crooks.” 


The administration's move against the CFPB also highlights the tensions between Trump's more populist promises to lower costs for working-class families and his pledge to reduce government regulation. 


During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be implemented. 


The bureau can still take complaints, but it can’t conduct exams or pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups. 


Musk’s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if Musk’s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on competitors such as Cash App, the person said. 


Vought's email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed excessive. 


Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the 2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large banks and financial industry trade associations. 


“Vought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families," Warren said. 


Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks. 


Vought's email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to disavow during last year's campaign. 


Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks, limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling personal information such as Social Security numbers.

## White House defends efforts to shut down foreign aid agency

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

White House national security adviser Michael Waltz on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s plan to shut down the country’s chief foreign aid agency, contending that “all too often” it was not aligned with U.S. strategic interests and wastes money.


Waltz told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the U.S. Agency for International Development programs, often food and humanitarian assistance across the world, “are not in line with strategic U.S. interests like pushing back on China. They're doing all kinds of other things that frankly, aren't in line with strategic interests or the president's vision.”


Moreover, he said, “Often, all too often, only cents on the dollar actually makes it to people in need, between the big contractors, the subcontractors, the local contractors, the dollars aren't being used … wisely. We need to take a hard look at it. We need to move quickly, and that's exactly what's being done.”.”


Trump this past week ordered the 10,000-worker agency shut down with fewer than 300 of them expected to eventually be retained as the agency’s programs are either shifted to State Department control or terminated.


A federal judge in Washington on Friday ordered a temporary halt to plans to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job.


On the same day, workers pried the name of the agency letter by letter off the entryway of its headquarters in Washington.


Democrats in Congress have been critical of the changes regarding USAID, with some pledging to stall Trump’s Cabinet nominees and leverage their votes on a new government spending bill, in protest.


The effort to shut down USAID was the most visible result of Trump dispatching billionaire Elon Musk and his aides to review programs and the legitimacy of spending at dozens of federal government agencies.


Trump offered virtually all the government’s 2.3 million civilian workers a chance to resign and continue to get paid through Sept. 30 without working, but a federal judge paused the offer until he holds a new hearing Monday afternoon on its legality.


The White House said 65,000 workers, 2.8% of the government’s civilian workforce, accepted the offer to quit and be paid not to work, far fewer than the 5- to 10% figure Musk and his cost cutters were hoping for.


Trump said all government agencies would be subject to financial reviews, including one of the biggest targets, the Defense Department, where Musk has billions of dollars of contracts.


Waltz said a review of Pentagon spending was especially necessary.


“Everything there seems to cost too much, take too long and deliver too little to the soldiers… we do need great minds, and we do need business leaders to go in there and absolutely reform the Pentagon's acquisition process,” he said.


Waltz, a former congressman from the southern state of Florida, said, “I, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, held up a bag of bolts that would cost 100 bucks … in a hardware store, that cost $90,000 to the United States Air Force and the American people have said enough, enough with the bloat and the waste….”


“For our barracks and our soldiers, we need all the efficiency we can get in the Pentagon, and I think the American people and the soldiers will welcome” a spending review, he said.”


On another matter, Waltz said “sensitive conversations” are occurring on how to end Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine.


“We will have our secretary of state, our secretary of defense, our vice president, our special envoy in Europe this week talking through the details of how to end this war,” Waltz said. “And that means getting both sides (to) the table.”


Waltz said the discussions would include future U.S. aid to Ukraine, possibly in exchange for Kyiv supplying the U.S. with its rare earth minerals — necessary for the manufacture of high-tech goods.


“Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward,” Waltz said. “President Trump is going to end it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.”

## ‘Dog Man’ bests ‘Heart Eyes,’ ‘Love Hurts’ at box office

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

New York — On a quiet winter weekend at the box office, DreamWorks Animation’s “Dog Man” chased its own tail, repeating as the top movie in theaters. 


The animated Universal Pictures release, adapted from Dav Pilkey’s popular graphic novel series, collected $13.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Both new releases — the Ke Huy Quan action movie “Love Hurts” and the Valentine’s Day-themed slasher “Heart Eyes”— were left nipping at the heels of “Dog Man.” 


Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen. Last year, Apple’s much-derided “Argylle” debuted on the same weekend. Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters in trailers for the huge football audience on TV. 


It wasn’t a banner weekend for “Dog Man.” It fell steeply, dropping 62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million, “Dog Man” has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two weeks. 


Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group’s “Heart Eyes,” released by Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102 locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less impressed. Moviegoers gave it a “B-” CinemaScore. Spyglass made “Heart Eyes” for $18 million. 


“Love Hurts,” the action comedy from 87North Productions (“John Wick,” “The Fall Guy”), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters. In his first big movie role since his Oscar-winning comeback in “Everything All at Once,” Ke Huy Quan stars as a mild-mannered realtor with a hitman past. Ariana DeBose co-stars. It, too, was modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected the movie, giving “Love Hurts” a “C+” CinemaScore. 


Next weekend should bring Hollywood its biggest box-office weekend of the year with the release of Marvel’s “Captain America: Brave New World” and Sony’s “Paddington in Peru.” 


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 


1. “Dog Man,” $13.7 million. 


2. “Heart Eyes,” $8.5 million. 


3. “Love Hurts,” $5.8 million. 


4. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $3.9 million. 


5. “Companion,” $3 million. 


6. “One of Them Days,” $3 million. 


7. “Becoming Led Zeppelin,” $2.6 million. 


8. “Flight Risk,” $2.6 million. 


9. “Sonic the Hedgehog,” $1.8 million. 


10. “Moana 3,” $1.5 million.

## Soaring egg prices in US pique interest in backyard chickens

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Thinking about backyard chickens as egg prices soar? Think hard, especially in light of the bird flu outbreak.


Keeping home chickens as a pastime has continued to grow since the pandemic. But if eggs are the goal, remember that it takes planning and investment to raise the chickens and protect against bird flu. Costs might go well beyond the nationwide average of $4.15 a dozen that commercial eggs sold for in December.


"Anyone who's done an ounce of research will very quickly understand that there are no free eggs, there are no inexpensive eggs in keeping chickens," said Kathy Shea Mormino, a home chicken blogger and author who has about 50 of the birds at her Suffield, Connecticut, home.


"You're going to pay more, particularly in your first several years, in your setup and in your birds. And there's a huge learning curve on how to care for animals that are really unusual pets," said Mormino, who has kept chickens for 15 years and calls herself the Chicken Chick.


Costs vary wildly, from about $200 to $2,000 for a coop alone. Feeders and waterers range from about $8 to $50 or more, depending on the size and type.


Bird flu has forced farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, contributing (along with inflation) to the steep price of commercial eggs and resulting in some scantily stocked stores around the country. The scarcity and high prices are causing some to look for a backyard alternative.


"We've seen a real uptick in calls recently from people wanting to start their own backyard flocks. With the egg shortages at grocery stores, many are excited about the idea of raising chickens and taking steps toward sustainability," said Matthew Aversa, a co-owner of Winding Branch Ranch, a nonprofit sanctuary and farm animal rescue outside San Antonio.


"We adopt out whole flocks. We're receiving at least a dozen inquiries per week," he said.




Kate Perz, the animal science coordinator for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, New York, said that unlike other pandemic pastimes, raising home chickens has only grown.


"It's not always cost-effective," she said. "You have to really look at how many eggs you're eating and what the cost of those are versus what you would be spending."


There are other reasons, of course, to keep chickens at home, not the least of which is the sheer joy of their presence. Mormino and other "chickeneers," as she calls home enthusiasts, have a coop full of tips on how to get started.


Tend to legal matters


You may be ready to dive right in. Your town may not. Mormino, who wrote The Chicken Chick's Guide to Backyard Chickens, said the first thing to consider is whether chickens are right for you. After that, don't assume your county, town or city will allow it.


Look up zoning and building codes yourself if you feel capable. Otherwise, consult an attorney who specializes in municipal law in your area.


Don't rely on word of mouth or even a town worker to know the ins and outs. Is a building permit required to build a coop? Are roosters banned under noise ordinances? Sometimes, zoning codes are silent on the subject. Don't assume that's a green light. Many codes are "permissive use" regulations, Mormino said, essentially meaning that if the code doesn't say you're permitted, you're not!




If chicken-keeping is allowed, is there a limit on how many birds? Are there restrictions on where a coop can be built in relation to neighboring property lines. Most homeowners associations have rules on animal keeping.


Mormino lives in a farming town and had a neighbor who kept three horses and a small flock of chickens, so she assumed they were legal. They weren't. She called the town clerk's office to ask whether a building permit was required to build a coop and was told it wasn't. It was.


In the end, she successfully defended a lawsuit against her (she's an attorney) and prevailed in a long battle to amend the law, legalizing backyard chickens in her town.


What about bird flu?


Bird flu is highly contagious. It spreads mostly by migrating waterfowl in their droppings. Chickens are far from immune if they spend any time free ranging or in a run without protection from wild fowl droppings.


"There's a limited number of things that we can do because our birds live where wildlife live," Mormino said. "People need to know if they have a bird or birds that die suddenly from some of the symptoms, they need to contact the USDA to get the postmortem exam and the birds tested for bird flu."


Don't bring sick birds into the house for care. That raises the risk of transmission to humans. Once the virus is confirmed, the entire flock needs to be euthanized, she and Perz said.


Symptoms of bird flu include: sudden death without any clinical signs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles or hocks; diarrhea; stumbling or falling down; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; and coughing and sneezing.


Don't feed any wildlife in areas where your chickens dwell or roam. Wash hands thoroughly after tending to chickens and dedicate a pair of shoes or boots strictly for use around them.


"The biggest mistake backyard chickeneers make is to bring new chickens into their flock that have lived someplace else. That's the fastest way to bring disease into your chicken yard," Mormino said.


Consider your costs


Sarah Penny has turned her 7,000-square-foot home lot in Knoxville, Tennessee, into a beautiful garden and chicken home. She has nine birds and grows more than half the food she and her 13-year-old son eat.


She's had chickens since 2021 and estimates her startup costs at about $2,500.




Monthly costs vary based on what chickens are fed and how coops are kept. Penny, for instance, uses the deep litter method and composts from her coop, meaning she's not mucking out her coop more than twice a year.


"But the cost of starting with backyard chickens is definitely quite expensive. I don't know if a lot of people know that," Penny said.


Her coop alone, which her family built themselves, cost about $2,000. It had to be outfitted to keep predators out, including rats that tunnel under the ground.


Many people start with buying hatchlings, which just got more expensive to ship via the U.S. Postal Service due to new fees. Raising hatchlings requires a chick brooder involving a separate enclosure, heat lamp, feeders and other supplies.


Penny buys a bag of feed every two weeks for $15 to $20 a bag. There's also the cost of calcium, such as oyster shells, and grit to aid digestion if chickens are not free-ranging or getting those elements in their feed.


She estimates her monthly costs at about $60, saving a bit by also feeding her chickens healthy human leftovers. She's careful not to include foods that are toxic for chickens, including onions, potatoes and avocados.


It's all worth it to Penny.


"We eat a lot of eggs," she said. "We probably go through a dozen every two days. We bake a lot. We're an ingredient household, so the majority of our food is cooked from scratch. Eggs are a main staple for our breakfast."

## High home prices and mortgage rates put American dream out of reach for many

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

The Petersen family's two-bedroom apartment in northern California is starting to feel small.


Four-year-old Jerrik's toy monster trucks are everywhere in the 1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it's only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more toys, adding to the disarray, said her mother, Jenn Petersen.


The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a 39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental. Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices stubbornly high, there's no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in their area.


According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80% of their income on housing — including an $8,600 monthly mortgage payment — to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That's far higher than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on a mortgage or rent.


Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens — they have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if they move to a lower cost-of-living area. "I'm not willing to give up my job and close connections with my family for a house," Petersen said.




The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since late 2007, just before the housing market crash.


"The American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn't exist anymore," Petersen said. "The whole idea that you get a house after you graduate college, get a steady job and get married? I've done most of those milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn't fit financially."


Supply lags demand


First-time homeowners are getting older. The same is true for an increasing number of American families.


In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. That's significantly above historic norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old from 1993 to 2018.


The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded that renting is their only option.


"Wage growth hasn't kept up with the increase in home prices and interest rates," said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia. "Even though people are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate."


That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It's also led to widespread worries about housing in the United States. About 7 in 10 voters under age 45 said they were "very" concerned about the cost of housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.


Is the dream going to fade? 


Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he frequently tells his students that "there are few things that all Americans agree on, but one of them is that they'd rather own a home than rent."


McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not owning a home has its advantages, too — it gives people more flexibility to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not be able to afford to buy property in.


McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease — all of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is the "apex of the American dream."


"The big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start to fade," McCabe said. "It's such an interesting cultural marker: Why is owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?"


It's a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family "house poor."


"I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a natural milestone you have to reach," she said. "At some point, though, what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we're paying a mortgage that's most of our take-home pay?"


Petersen said she'll "always hold out a little bit of hope" that homeownership will be in her family's future. But if they find a townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their $3,600 monthly rental budget?


"I'd take that," she said.


Cities offer support


Some cities are providing crucial aid to first-time homebuyers


Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach.


"The prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and higher," said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing tickets for parking violations.


Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment's monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000 annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her own place.


Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000 from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit and another $50,000 from the city of Boston's Office of Housing — funds that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about $2,160 a month on her mortgage.




Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding first-time buyers like herself — Boston has poured more than $24 million into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes.


But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of working — doing jobs that included everything from telecommunications to health care to electronics.


"I was determined to have my piece of the pie," she said. "I felt I deserved that. I've always worked. Always. Nonstop."

## Japan prime minister voices optimism over averting US tariffs

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed optimism on Sunday that his country could avoid higher U.S. tariffs, saying President Donald Trump had recognized Japan's huge investment in the U.S. and the American jobs that it creates.


At his first White House summit on Friday, Ishiba told public broadcaster NHK, he explained to Trump how many Japanese automakers were creating jobs in the United States.


The two did not specifically discuss auto tariffs, Ishiba said, although he said he did not know whether Japan would be subject to the reciprocal tariffs that Trump has said he plans to impose on imports.


Tokyo has so far escaped the trade war Trump unleashed in his first weeks in office. He has announced tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, although he postponed the 25% duties on his North American neighbors to allow for talks.


The escalating trade tensions since Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20 threaten to rupture the global economy.


Ishiba said he believes Trump "recognized the fact Japan has been the world's largest investor in the United States for five straight years and is therefore different from other countries."


"Japan is creating many U.S. jobs. I believe (Washington) won't go straight to the idea of higher tariffs," he said.


Ishiba voiced optimism that Japan and the U.S. can avoid a tit-for-tat tariff war, stressing that tariffs should be put in place in a way that "benefits both sides."


"Any action that exploits or excludes the other side won't last," Ishiba said. "The question is whether there is any problem between Japan and the United States that warrants imposing higher tariffs," he added. 


Japan had the highest foreign direct investment in the United States in 2023 at $783.3 billion, followed by Canada and Germany, according to the most recent U.S. Commerce Department data.


Trump pressed Ishiba to close Japan's $68.5 billion annual trade surplus with Washington but expressed optimism this could be done quickly, given a promise by Ishiba to bring Japanese investment in the U.S. to $1 trillion.


On Sunday, Ishiba identified liquefied natural gas, steel, AI and autos as areas that Japanese companies could invest in.


He also touched on Trump's promise to look at Nippon Steel investing in U.S. Steel as opposed to buying the storied American company, a planned purchase opposed by Trump and blocked by his predecessor, Joe Biden.


"Investment is being made to ensure that it remains an American company. It will continue to operate under American management, with American employees," Ishiba said. "The key point is how to ensure it remains an American company. From President Trump's perspective, this is of utmost importance."


On military spending, another area where Trump has pressed allies for increases, Ishiba said Japan would not increase its defense budget without first winning public backing.


"It is crucial to ensure that what is deemed necessary is something the taxpayers can understand and support," he said.

## VOA immigration weekly recap, Feb. 2–8

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

Editor's note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.


Historical precedent, legal questions swirl around Trump plan to detain migrants at Guantanamo


The Trump administration's expansion of migrant detention facilities, notably its use of the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has reignited debate among human rights advocates and legal experts. VOA’s immigration Aline Barros reports.


What is birthright citizenship?


President Donald Trump is reigniting a fierce debate: Should everyone born on U.S. soil automatically become a citizen? This question strikes at the heart of American identity, history and law. Trump signed an executive order last month seeking to end the right, but two federal judges have placed injunctions on the order, pausing it indefinitely. Here’s what you need to know about birthright citizenship.


Rubio visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala on trip focused on migration, security ties


U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Tuesday with officials in Costa Rica and later in Guatemala as part of a tour of Latin America focused on migration, security cooperation and countering Chinese influence in the region. Rubio was in El Salvador for talks Monday with President Nayib Bukele, and he announced that Bukele had offered to accept any deportees from the United States, regardless of their nationality. Reported by VOA’s State Department Correspondent Nike Ching.


California city breaks with state on shielding undocumented migrants


U.S. Border Patrol agents are detaining undocumented migrants as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Many of those arrests have been in California, where one city is trying to break with the state and cooperate with federal immigration agencies. Genia Dulot reports from Huntington Beach.


10 'high-threat illegal aliens' arrive at Guantanamo Bay


The first undocumented migrants — described by U.S. officials as the "the worst of the worst" — are being held in jail cells at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, waiting to be sent home. The Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed 10 "high-threat illegal aliens" arrived Tuesday at the detention facility, where they are being held under the watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Carla Babb, VOA's Pentagon correspondent, and Jeff Seldin, VOA’s national security correspondent, report.


Trump's birthright citizenship order put on hold by 2nd federal judge


A U.S. federal judge ordered a second temporary pause Wednesday on President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States to someone in the country illegally. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman said no court in the country has endorsed the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment. "This court will not be the first," she said. The Associated Press reports.


Trump administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000 Venezuelans


U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday moved to remove protection against deportation from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President Donald Trump's expanding immigration crackdown. The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the program, could be deported and lose work permits in April, according to a government notice. The notice said the protections were contrary to U.S. interests and no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela. Reuters reports.


Afghan refugees in California seek clarity amid illegal immigration crackdowns


Afghan refugees in the United States are expressing concern about their status as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal immigration. In California, immigration lawyers are stepping in to address these concerns and clarify the potential effects on their status. Fahim Sediqi reports from Sacramento, California, narrated by Bezhan Hamdard.


Immigration around the world


Darfuri women face sexual violence in war, refuge


Aid groups say sexual violence is a constant threat for women in Sudan’s Darfur, but refugees also say it’s a problem for those who have fled the region. Reporting from a refugee camp on Chad’s border with Darfur, Henry Wilkins looks at the phenomenon of "firewood rape." Camera: Henry Wilkins.


US deportation flight carrying undocumented Indian migrants lands in Punjab


A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals accused of entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of Punjab on Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump administration launched a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104 deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly manner. Anjana Pasricha reports for VOA from New Delhi, India.


News Brief


A South Texas man was sentenced for conspiring to smuggle undocumented immigrants, resulting in multiple deaths.

## Lasers aid river search for debris from plane-helicopter collision

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

Crews continuing to search for debris from the deadly collision of a passenger jet and Army helicopter near Washington used a plane outfitted with lasers to scan the bottom of the Potomac River early Saturday, the National Transportation Safety Board said. 


Large pieces of the jetliner and helicopter along with the remains of all 67 victims were recovered this week, and crews will spend the coming days looking for smaller debris before finishing the work in about a week. 


A plane operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and equipped with laser scanning technology flew at low altitudes over the crash site. The lasers are used to penetrate the river's surface and map the riverbed. 


"All major pieces" of the two aircraft have been found, and investigators will examine them for any markings that could reveal the angle of the collision, according to an NTSB statement released Saturday afternoon. 


The NTSB said information collected will be part of its ongoing investigation into the January 29 collision between the Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight over Washington. There were no survivors. 


U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the collision on what he called an obsolete computer system used by U.S. air traffic controllers and vowed to replace it. 


NTSB officials told members of Congress that the helicopter's advanced surveillance technology, which transmits aircraft location and other data to air traffic control and other aircraft, was turned off, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said Thursday. 


Investigators are also looking into the altitude of the plane and helicopter, including whether the helicopter was above its 61-meter flight ceiling. Investigators need to be able to examine the wreckage of the Black Hawk to get more precise information. 


The crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since November 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.

## US judge temporarily blocks Musk's DOGE from accessing payment systems

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

A federal judge early Saturday temporarily blocked billionaire Elon Musk's government efficiency team and Trump administration political appointees from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments, citing a risk that sensitive information could be improperly disclosed.


U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan issued the order after a coalition of Democratic attorneys general from 19 U.S. states filed a lawsuit late Friday arguing Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has no legal power to access the U.S. Department of Treasury systems.


Musk, on X, called the ruling "absolutely insane!" and said without evidence that "something super shady is going to protect scammers."


"How on Earth are we supposed to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer money without looking at how money is spent?" Musk said on his social media platform and called Engelmayer "an activist posing as a judge."


The lawsuit said Musk and his team could disrupt federal funding for health clinics, preschools, climate initiatives, and other programs, and that Republican President Donald Trump could use the information to further his political agenda.


DOGE's access to the system also "poses huge cybersecurity risks that put vast amounts of funding for the States and their residents in peril," the state attorneys general said. They sought a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE's access.


The judge, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the states' claims were "particularly strong" and warranted him acting on their request for emergency relief pending a further hearing before another judge on Feb. 14.


"That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking," Engelmayer wrote.


New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office is leading the case, welcomed the ruling, saying nobody was above the law and that Americans across the country had been horrified by the DOGE team's unfettered access to their data.


"We knew the Trump administration's choice to give this access to unauthorized individuals was illegal, and this morning, a federal court agreed," James said in a statement. "Now, Americans can trust that Musk — the world's richest man — and his friends will not have free rein over their personal information while our lawsuit proceeds."


Engelmayer's order bars access from being granted to Treasury Department payment and data systems by political appointees, special government employees and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department.


The judge also directed that anyone prohibited under his order from accessing those systems to immediately destroy anything they copied or downloaded.


The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


Trump deputized Musk to lead DOGE to identify fraud and waste in the government. Musk's efforts have alarmed Democrats and advocacy groups who say he is overstepping his authority by seeking to dismantle agencies responsible for critical government programs and fire federal workers en masse.


Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Trump appointee, said this week that the department's payment system will not be touched by Musk and that any decisions to stop payments would be made by other agencies.

## Spending bill talks bog down after Trump's efforts to slash government

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Before President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress can enact much of their legislative agenda, they must deal with some unfinished business — completing work on the current budget year's spending bills. It's a task that by all accounts is not going well. 


The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that, without congressional action, there would be a partial government shutdown. 


Five weeks is an eternity when it comes to resolving spending bills in Washington. But Trump's first weeks in office have escalated tensions between the two parties as the new administration reshapes agency priorities and dismantles existing programs without congressional approval. 


A look at where the talks stand: 


Republicans accuse Democrats of abandoning negotiations 


Republican and Democratic leaders of the two appropriations committees in Congress were holding spending bill talks in late January; aides said the two sides were committed to getting a deal done. But optimism has faded in recent days. 


"Obviously, the Democrats are not in a good place right now, so they walked away from talks. But it'll have to resume," House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, said Thursday. 


House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, gave a similar assessment, contending that comments by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and some of his colleagues made it seem as though they are "trying to set up some sort of government shutdown, which I think is very unfortunate. We were negotiating in good faith and trying to get the topline number, but so far as I know, they've been sort of unresponsive the last two days or so. So, I hope we can get back to it." 


Representative Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he heard from Democratic lawmakers as recently as Thursday, so he did not believe they were walking away from talks. 


"But we're not making the progress I would hope," said Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma. 


Democrats dispute GOP leadership's characterization 


Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro, the lead Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said "that is false" in response to the assertion that Democrats have withdrawn from negotiations. 


"The Democrats have made their offer. We have not walked away from the table," DeLauro said. 


Jeffries told reporters that DeLauro "has been trying to get Republicans to respond to her for weeks." 


"I'm hopeful that Republicans are actually willing now to sit down at the table and reach a spending agreement in the best interest of the American people, not in the best interest of their billionaire donors," Jeffries said. 


Tensions over topline spending levels 


Under terms of an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, worked out with then-President Joe Biden, spending for defense and non-defense would increase by 1% for the current budget year, which began October 1. That would bring the tallies to about $895.2 billion for defense and $780.4 billion for non-defense. 


Congress set the spending levels to grow below the rate of inflation, at the insistence of Republicans, as part of a package that also suspended the debt limit so that the federal government could continue paying its bills. Democrats say an agreement is an agreement. 


"That is the path forward that will allow everyone to come together to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people," Jeffries said. 


Republicans don't see it that way. 


Cole said Democrats should adjust to the reality of a Republican president in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress. 


"We have to remember the deal they are trying to enforce is when we had a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. We don't have those anymore," Cole said. "And in particular, the president doesn't feel bound by an agreement made by another president that didn't go down on his watch." 


Cole said that "there's only one signature that matters right now and it's not Joe Biden's anymore." 


Democrats wary as Trump, Musk revamp federal government 


Democrats are struggling to keep up and provide a unified response to Trump's first weeks in office as government workers are pushed to resign, entire agencies are dismantled, and Elon Musk's team from the Department of Government Efficiency gains access to sensitive information of countless Americans. 


They are worried about how current government services are being affected, with Democrats accusing the administration of blocking hundreds of billions of dollars in previously approved funding. Those concerns are also swaying their thinking as they approach the spending bill negotiations. 


"The level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here in Congress," said Washington Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. "It is up to our Republican colleagues to stand up to this and assure us an agreement and a law is real." 


DeLauro said Democrats need assurances that Republicans will follow through on whatever spending agreement the negotiators reach. 


"You won some. I won some. We lost some each. But we have a deal. And that's got to be it. Those assurances have to be made," DeLauro said. 


Plan B 


If lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a full-year spending measure, then it's possible that they could also pass another temporary measure to keep the government open for a few more weeks or months while they try to work out their differences. 


Such stopgap measures, called continuing resolutions (CRs), generally fund government programs and agencies at current levels. 


"I don't want a CR," Cole said. "But I certainly prefer a CR to a shutdown."
