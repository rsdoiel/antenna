## Vietnam braces for fallout from US tariffs on Chinese goods

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh instructed his Cabinet to prepare for a possible global trade war after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 10% on all Chinese products.


"Prepare for the possibility of a world trade war this year," the prime minister said at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, according to the Dan Tri online newspaper.


Pham spoke after Trump announced a pause in his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days.


Pham told the Cabinet that the situation in the world and the region was "developing very unpredictably, directly affecting our country, especially on exports, production and business, and the macro economy."


He emphasized that if a global trade war were to occur, with countries imposing retaliatory tariffs on each other's exports, it could disrupt supply chains and shrink the country's export markets, posing significant risks to Vietnam's economy.


Pham did not specifically mention Trump's tariffs on products from China, a strategic trade partner and a neighboring country of Vietnam.


There are worries that Trump's tariffs may cause rising product prices and reduced consumer purchasing power in Vietnam, a highly open economy that relies heavily on exports and foreign direct investment, with China as its leading trade partner.


Vietnamese businesses and consumers are bracing for U.S. tariffs on China to drive up the costs of some goods as the country imports machinery and electronic devices, such as computers and cellphones, from the U.S., with elements or pieces that originated from China.


The country will also likely have to cope with pressure from Beijing to import more Chinese products, analysts said.


"Vietnam may be under pressure to import more products from China as Chinese products are levied higher tariffs by the U.S.," Nguyen Quang A, an economic political observer and businessman in Hanoi, told VOA this week.


Others predict that as American markets close to Chinese companies, they will increasingly turn to regional trading partners, like Vietnam.


In 2024, Vietnam's exports to China totaled $61.2 billion. Meanwhile, imports from China surged to $144 billion, according to the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.


With the United States, the situation is reversed, with Vietnam's trade surplus in 2024 exceeding $123 billion, Reuters reported.


According to analysts, Hanoi's pledges to import more from the U.S. as well as other offsetting measures could spare Vietnam from the Trump administration's tariffs.


Nguyen noted a major hidden risk for Vietnam is that Chinese companies are setting up factories in Vietnam to import products for re-export, meaning they would repackage Chinese products with minimal labor by cheap Vietnamese workers and export them under the "Made in Vietnam" label to avoid tariffs.


"Chinese businesses [are] moving to Vietnam and are processing their imported materials from China and then labeling their products as 'Made in Vietnam' before exporting to the U.S. The U.S. will definitely examine this issue carefully," Nguyen said.


Vietnam, which has long had geopolitical tensions with China, may face the risk of potential reprisal measures from China as Beijing said it would impose retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods as soon as next week.


However, Vietnam seemed to win big in Trump's first-term trade war with China as the Southeast Asian country attracted manufacturers wanting to avoid Chinese tariffs.


If Trump's tariffs are extended to Vietnam, the economic effects could ripple through trade balances, exchange rates, supply chains and foreign direct investment, said Vo Tri Thanh, former vice president at the Central Institute for Economic Management and a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council, writing in Vietnam News.


The sweeping tariffs have triggered the phenomenon of goods being stockpiled in Vietnam and in the region to avoid tax hikes, driving up demand for container shipping and pushing freight costs to new highs.


Despite these pressures, Vietnam may find itself positioned to capitalize on global supply chain shifts, Nguyen Hong Dien, Vietnam's minister of industry and trade, told Tuoi Tre Online, explaining that the country could attract more investment in high-value sectors.

## Authorities continue search for plane missing in Alaska

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

Rescuers in Alaska continued their search Friday for an airplane that went missing Thursday with nine passengers and a pilot onboard.


Several groups were involved in the search, including the Alaska State Troopers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Alaska Air National Guard, the Alaska Army National Guard and local search teams.


Authorities said a Jayhawk helicopter was brought in Friday morning to help with the search.


The FBI was also providing technical assistance, including cellphone analysis, to help locate the aircraft.


The Bering Air Caravan flight was traveling in western Alaska, just south of the Arctic Circle, from Unalakleet to Nome. State troopers said they were notified Thursday at 4 p.m. about the plane's disappearance.


The Coast Guard said on X that the flight was 19 kilometers offshore when its position was lost.


The families of the passengers have been notified, according to the Nome Volunteer Fire Department, but passengers' names have not been released.


The fire department posted on X that it was conducting an active ground search, but weather and visibility conditions were hampering the department's air search. The department urged people not to form their own search parties because of hazardous weather conditions in the region, which is prone to sudden snow squalls and high winds.


Airplanes are often the only method of transportation between rural Alaskan villages.


Nome is well-known as the last stop in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.


The missing flight is the third major U.S. aviation incident in recent days. On January 29, a commercial airliner and an Army helicopter collided near Washington's Reagan National Airport. Two days later, a medical transportation plane crashed into a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, neighborhood shortly after takeoff, killing six people onboard and another person on the street.


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.

## US judge to temporarily block Trump from taking some steps to dismantle USAID

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Friday said he would enter a "limited" order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from taking some steps to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, adding that 2,200 employees from the agency would not immediately be placed on administrative leave. 


U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington, who was nominated by Trump during his first term, announced the decision at a hearing on a lawsuit from the largest U.S. government workers' union and an association of foreign service workers, who sued to stop the administration from dismantling the agency. 


Nichols said the written ruling would be issued later Friday. 


The administration in a notice sent to the foreign aid agency's workers on Thursday said it would keep 611 essential workers on board at USAID out of a worldwide workforce that totals more than 10,000. 


"The major reduction in force, as well as the closure of offices, the forced relocation of these individuals were all done in excess of the executive’s authority in violation of the separation of powers," Karla Gilbride, a lawyer for the unions, said at the hearing. 


A Justice Department official, Brett Shumate, told Nichols that about 2,200 USAID employees would be put on paid leave under the administration's plans, adding that 500 had already been placed on leave. 


"The president has decided there is corruption and fraud at USAID," Shumate said. 


However, the judge said his order would prevent those 2,200 employees from being immediately placed on administrative leave and would also pause the relocation of certain humanitarian workers stationed outside the United States. 


Hours after he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, Trump ordered all U.S. foreign aid be paused to ensure it was aligned with his "America First" policy. Chaos has since consumed USAID, which distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid around the world. 


The State Department issued worldwide stop-work directives after the executive order was issued, effectively freezing all foreign aid with the exception of emergency food assistance. That brought USAID programs covering lifesaving aid around the globe to a grinding halt, in a move that experts warned risked killing people. 


The gutting of the agency has largely been overseen by businessman Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close Trump ally spearheading the president's effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy.  


In fiscal 2023, the United States disbursed, partly via USAID, $72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. 


The U.S. provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024, yet that represents less than 1% of its total budget.

## Trump pauses repeal of tariff on packages as they pile up at US customs

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON/LONDON/LOS ANGELES — U.S. President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change sparked chaos for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers.


The cancellation of de minimis means low-value e-commerce packages arriving in the United States with goods from China must use the "formal entry" process that requires additional information and duties before entering the country — a more time-consuming process.


The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages — even those that had paid duties — at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport.


"Well, that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce," said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors.


The change, implemented with just 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China and Hong Kong earlier this week.


Popular online retailers, including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service, fly packages direct from Chinese factories to U.S. shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low. Those retailers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published today, a White House spokesperson said.


U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has the job of screening e-commerce packages and collecting duties on them, on Thursday held a meeting with logistics professionals to discuss the status of more than 1 million packages piling up at JFK Airport, according to a source familiar with the meeting.


One logistics executive on Friday told Reuters that customs had begun releasing packages it was holding at JFK, which has been taking in about 60 million de minimis e-commerce packages annually.


Trump scrapped the duty-free treatment for Chinese goods with the stated aim of stopping the flow of fentanyl and precursor chemicals into the United States.


White House officials have said Canada and Mexico are conduits for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. in small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents. While fentanyl traffickers have exploited a U.S. trade law, public data shows 0.2% of all fentanyl seized in the U.S. comes from the Canadian border, while the vast majority originates from the southern border.


Many shipping experts and attorneys warned that switch would overwhelm customs inspections because the agency does not have systems and processes in place. Its staff are also stretched thin because they fall under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which also is responsible for border security.


Companies like Shein and Temu had halted some air cargo flights, invoking force majeure to cancel agreements without penalties, said Kathy Liu, Director of Global sales and marketing, Asia-focused freight forwarder Dimerco.


U.S. shoppers also got hit with bills for duties on purchases of dresses, tops and baby clothing that previously were exempt. It is not immediately clear whether those consumers would be eligible for refunds for any duties paid.


"We're navigating these significant changes to U.S. trade policy as they come, as best we can on behalf of our clients," said Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer for SEKO Logistics, which moves e-commerce packages targeted with new duties.


Delivery firms UPS, FedEx and DHL also handle those packages. Their representatives did not immediately comment on the Trump administration's pause on duty collection.

## Trump updates Iran peace deal effort to reflect new realities, analysts say

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace overtures toward Iran this week —  made as he signed a directive to put the country under “maximum pressure” for malign behavior — signal a revived policy that some analysts say has evolved from his first term as he adapts to Iran’s new circumstances.


Trump made his overture in a Wednesday post on his Truth Social platform, saying he seeks a “Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper” in return for ensuring that the Islamic Republic “cannot have a Nuclear Weapon.”


A day earlier, Trump also told a news conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “I would love to be able to make a great deal [with Iran], a deal where you can get on with your lives, and you'll do wonderfully.”


In 2020, during Trump’s first term, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and then a senior adviser, made a similar, if more muted, appeal to Iran's then-President Hassan Rouhani, in an interview with VOA.


“For President Rouhani, I would say it’s time for the region to move forward. Let’s stop being stuck in conflicts of the past. It’s time for people to get together and to make peace,” he said.




At the time, Trump said a key goal of his original "maximum pressure” campaign was to negotiate a new bilateral agreement to end Iran’s perceived malign behaviors that he said were not sufficiently addressed by Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Trump withdrew the United States from that deal in 2018 and started the pressure policy.


Trump revived his “maximum pressure” policy by signing a presidential memorandum Tuesday, directing a series of economic and legal measures to counter Iranian activities that threaten U.S. national interests. The document highlighted Iran’s development of nuclear weapons-related capabilities, ballistic missiles and its regional aggression through support of proxy forces.


‘Higher ambitions and more tools for pressure’


The new Iran policy is “qualitatively different” from what Trump pursued in his first term, Brian Katulis, a senior fellow of the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told VOA.


“It has higher ambitions and more tools for pressure,” he said.


Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded to Trump's new policy Friday, saying Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal shows that negotiating with the U.S. "is neither rational, nor intelligent, nor honorable, and [we] should not engage in negotiations with it.”


Iranian state media said Khamenei made the comment while speaking to a gathering of air force personnel. They also quoted him as issuing the following warning to the U.S.: "If they threaten us, we will threaten them. If they carry out their threat, we will carry out our threat. And if they disrupt the security of our nation, we will definitely disrupt their security as well."




Iran long has denied seeking nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said Iran suspended an active nuclear weapons program in 2003, but Israel, a U.S. ally, said in 2018 its agents in Tehran stole documents indicating the Iranian government had covertly continued that program.


Trump’s new “maximum pressure” memorandum includes two specific measures that were prominent features of his first term campaign — seeking to drive Iran’s export of oil, its highest revenue-earner, to zero and calling for a snapback, or return, of international sanctions the U.N. Security Council lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal.


In the first announcement of new sanctions in Trump’s second term, the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday, targeted Iran’s oil exports by sanctioning an international network it said facilitates the shipment of “millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars” to China, Iran’s top oil customer.




Trump’s goals of reducing Iranian oil exports to zero and restoring international sanctions on Iran were not fully achieved in his first term.


An October 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports reached a low of 0.4 million barrels per day in 2020 "due to the U.S. reimposition of sanctions in November 2018 and the decline in demand because of the COVID-19 pandemic.”


Trump’s first administration also unilaterally declared a restoration of international sanctions on Iran in September 2020, but most other U.N. Security Council members rejected the move. They asserted the U.S. had forfeited its right to trigger the return of international sanctions by quitting the 2015 nuclear deal that lifted those sanctions.


One provision of Trump’s new Iran memorandum, setting a goal that was not explicitly stated in his first term, is ensuring neither Iraq nor the Gulf countries can be used by Tehran to evade sanctions.


Trump’s first administration had tried to stop such evasion by Iran, according to Elliott Abrams, a Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow who served as U.S. special envoy for Iran at the end of Trump’s first term.


Responding to a VOA question in a Federalist Society webinar on Thursday, Abrams said, “There were points at which we said to the Emiratis, ‘Look, Dubai is being used by the Iranians to get around sanctions. Close that down.’”


He said the second Trump administration appears to be giving that objective more public attention.


Another new feature of Trump's pressure campaign is its order to “modify or rescind sanctions waivers ... that provide Iran any degree of economic or financial relief ... related to Iran’s Chabahar port project.”


India has been developing a terminal at the Iranian port under a 2016 agreement and secured a waiver from the first Trump administration in 2018 to continue the project to facilitate humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.


The Biden administration extended the waiver, but when India signed a deal last year to operate the Iranian port for a decade, Biden’s State Department said that “anyone considering business deals with Iran, they need to be aware of the potential risk that they are opening themselves up to ... sanctions.”


'Enhanced' campaign seen


Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, told VOA he expects to see Trump pursue an “enhanced” maximum pressure campaign that is tailored to the “changed geopolitical realities of 2025, rather than to 2018.”


One of those new realities is a major rebound in Iranian oil exports, primarily due to what Brodsky said was lax Biden administration sanctions enforcement.


The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s October report, citing data from international energy analytics company Vortexa, said Iran’s oil exports increased to an average of 1.5 million barrels per day in the first eight months of last year.


The Biden administration rejected accusations of lax sanctions enforcement made by critics of its Iran policy while it was in office, highlighting its sanctioning of hundreds of entities for Iran-related activities. But Biden’s treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said in April 2024 that Iran was “continuing to export some oil” and added, “there may be more that we could do.”


Other new factors Brodsky cited as reasons for Trump to enhance his maximum pressure strategy include Iran’s progress in uranium enrichment during the Biden administration and Tehran’s recent regional losses. In the past year, Israel killed the leaders of Iran’s terror proxies Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon and Gaza, while Islamist rebels in Syria ousted longtime Iran-backed leader Bashar al-Assad from power.


But Brodsky said the new maximum pressure memorandum also raises questions about what Trump wants out of a potential new deal with Iran.


He noted the document calls for ending the "[Iranian] regime’s nuclear extortion racket" and asked whether this means Trump will demand that Iran stop uranium enrichment, as Trump did in his first term.


“We don't have answers right now,” Brodsky said.

## VOA Russian: What economic measures can US use to force Russia to end war?

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

VOA Russian spoke to U.S. experts who outline how a mix of U.S. sanctions, export controls and other methods of applying pressure on the Russian economy can help President Donald Trump's administration to force Moscow to stop the war in Ukraine. Experts agree that if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not engage in negotiations, the U.S. should expand punitive economic measures to hurt the Russian economy, so Moscow simply won't have resources to continue the war.

## US employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, jobless rate slips to 4% to start the year

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, but the jobless rate slipped to 4% to start 2025 and the government revised November and December payrolls higher.


The first job report of Donald Trump’s second presidency suggested that he inherited a labor market that is solid but unspectacular. Economists had expected about 170,000 new jobs in January.


It's a downshift from 2024 which averaged 186,000 new jobs a month, including a surge of 256,000 in December. The unemployment rate is expected to remain low at 4.1%.



The future is cloudier.


A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's plan to push out federal workers by offering them financial incentives, yet a federal hiring freeze that Trump imposed January 20 is a “negative for employment growth,’’ Bradley Saunders, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a commentary last week.






The freeze came after the Labor Department collected the January jobs numbers, so any impact would be revealed in upcoming employment data.


Likewise, a cold snap that probably increased seasonal layoffs in the Midwest and Northeast occurred late in January and won’t register in government jobs data until the February numbers come out, Saunders wrote.


Economists are also worried about Trump’s threat to wage a trade war against other countries. He’s already imposed a 10% tax on imports from China.




Canada and Mexico — America’s two largest trading partners — remain in his crosshairs, although he gave them a 30-day reprieve from the 25% tariffs he was planning to sock them with on Tuesday, allowing time for negotiations. Trump says that America’s two neighbors and allies haven’t done enough to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States.



Trump is also ready to slap tariffs on the European Union; pointing to America’s deficit in the trade of goods with the EU, which came to $236 billion last year, he says that Europe treats U.S. exporters unfairly.


The tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers who generally try to pass along the cost to customers, could rekindle inflation – which has fallen from the four-decade high it reached in mid-2022 but is still stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. If the tariffs push prices higher, the Fed may cancel or postpone the two interest-rate cuts it had forecast for this year. And that would be bad for economic growth and job creation.




The job market already has cooled from the red-hot days of 2021-2023. American payrolls increased by 2.2 million last year, down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. The Labor Department also reports that employers are posting fewer jobs. Monthly job openings have tumbled from a record 12.2 million in March 2022, to 7.6 million in December – still a decent number by historical standards.


As the labor market cools, American workers are losing confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions by changing jobs. The number of people quitting has fallen from a record 4.5 million near the height of the hiring boom in April 2022, to December’s 3.2 million, which is below pre-pandemic levels.


Still, layoffs remain below pre-pandemic levels, creating an unusual situation: If you are employed, you probably enjoy job security. If you’re looking for one, things have gotten tougher.


The Labor Department also is expected to report annually released revisions Friday that will show job creation from April 2023 through March 2024 wasn’t as strong as originally reported.


A preliminary version of the revisions, released in August, showed that 818,000 fewer jobs were created over those 12 months – lowering average monthly hiring during that span from 242,000 to 174,000. Because they are not final, the August estimates have not yet been added to the official government payroll numbers. The revisions out Friday will become official and part of the historic data.

## Iran's supreme leader criticizes proposed nuclear talks with US

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran's supreme leader said Friday that negotiations with America “are not intelligent, wise or honorable” after U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of nuclear talks with Tehran.


Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also suggested that “there should be no negotiations with such a government” but stopped short of issuing a direct order not to engage with Washington.


Khamenei's remarks upend months of signals from Tehran to the United States that it wanted to negotiate over its rapidly advancing nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of crushing economic sanctions worth billions of dollars.


What happens next remains unclear, particularly as reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian promised as recently as Thursday to enter a dialogue with the West.


Khamenei’s remarks to air force officers in Tehran appeared to contradict his own earlier remarks in August that opened the door to talks.


However, the 85-year-old Khamenei has always been careful with remarks about negotiating with the West. That includes balancing the demands of reformists within the country who want the talks against hard-line elements within Iran’s theocracy, including the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.


Khamenei noted that Trump unilaterally withdrew from the earlier nuclear deal under which Iran drastically limited its enrichment of uranium and overall stockpile of the material, in exchange for crushing sanctions being removed.


“The Americans did not uphold their end of the deal,” Khamenei said. “The very person who is in office today tore up the agreement. He said he would, and he did.”


He added: "This is an experience we must learn from. We negotiated, we gave concessions, we compromised — but we did not achieve the results we aimed for. And despite all its flaws, the other side ultimately violated and destroyed the agreement.”


Mixed messages from Trump


It's not clear what sparked Khamenei's remarks. However, they come after Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran, even while signing an executive order to reimpose his “maximum pressure" approach to Iran on Tuesday.


“I’m going to sign it, but hopefully we’re not going to have to use it very much,” he said from the Oval Office. “We will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran.


“We don’t want to be tough on Iran. We don’t want to be tough on anybody,” Trump said. “But they just can’t have a nuclear bomb.”


Trump followed with another online message on Wednesday, saying: “Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens, ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED.


“I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper,” he wrote on Truth Social. “We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed.”


He did not elaborate.


Nuclear enrichment


Khamenei, like other Iranian leaders, uses elliptical comments to indirectly govern policy while not boxing himself into any one decision. As supreme leader, he's also created a vast bureaucracy that competes with itself for influence, including with its civilian leadership under Pezeshkian.


As recently as Thursday, Pezeshkian suggested Iran could open itself up to even more inspections from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.


“They [can] come and inspect one hundred times more since we are not supposed to go after” a nuclear weapon, Pezeshkian told foreign diplomats.




Iranian diplomats have long pointed to Khamenei’s preachings as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran won't build an atomic bomb.


Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, it now enriches uranium to 60% purity — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iranian officials increasingly suggest Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”


Gaza and oil sanctions


Earlier in the week, Trump also said that displaced Palestinians in Gaza could be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and proposed the U.S. take “ownership” in redeveloping the area into “the Riviera of the Middle East.”


Khamenei appeared to reference Trump's Gaza proposal in his remarks.


“The Americans sit, redrawing the map of the world — but only on paper, as it has no basis in reality," Khamenei said. “They make statements about us, express opinions and issue threats. If they threaten us, we will threaten them in return. If they act on their threats, we will act on ours. If they violate the security of our nation, we will, without a doubt, respond in kind.”


Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Ministry separately criticized the U.S. Treasury's move to levy sanctions Thursday against firms trading sanctioned Iranian crude oil to China. The Treasury described the firms as forming an “international network for facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars.”


Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei called the Treasury's decision “completely unjustified and contrary to international rules and regulations.”

## Historical precedent, legal questions swirl around Trump plan to detain migrants at Guantanamo

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

The Trump administration's expansion of migrant detention facilities, notably its use of the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has reignited debate among human rights advocates and legal experts.


President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to curb legal migration and deport those in the U.S. without legal status.


Late last month, he instructed his administration to prepare the facility for the detention of up to 30,000 "high-priority" unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. The first group arrived on Tuesday.


Described as the "the worst of the worst” by administration officials, the detainees were identified by the Department of Homeland Security as part of the transnational criminal organization "Tren de Aragua,” which the U.S. designated a foreign terrorist organization on January 20.




VOA sent numerous requests to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding what crimes the migrants committed. ICE directed VOA to contact the Department of Homeland Security, which has not responded to emails.


Miriam Pensack, a historian who studies Latin America and the Caribbean and is a postgraduate scholar at Princeton University, said the U.S. government has been using Guantanamo Bay to hold migrants on and off for 30 years.


"There is an ICE office in Guantanamo. ... But obviously what we’re seeing now is a huge expansion of that capacity,” she said.


Trump’s decision to use the naval base as a migrant detention center follows his signing of the Laken Riley Act, which mandates detention for those accused of theft or violent crimes while in the country unlawfully.


Supporters say that using Guantanamo will alleviate pressure on overcrowded detention facilities and serve as a stronger deterrent against illegal crossings to the United States.




Earlier this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described Guantanamo as the "perfect place" to detain migrants as he visited the border with Mexico.


The Pentagon will provide any necessary assets "to support the expulsion and detention of those in our country illegally," he told Agence France-Presse.


Guantanamo and migrant detention


The U.S. first used Guantanamo Bay to detain migrants, mostly Haitian and Cuban asylum-seekers under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s.


Following a military coup in Haiti in 1991, thousands fled by boat to the U.S. but were intercepted at sea and taken to Guantanamo. In 1994, Guantanamo became the site of the world’s first and only prison camp for people with HIV, where more than 300 Haitian refugees, including children, were confined behind razor wire.


“These were refugees fleeing slaughter in their country, whose credible fear of persecution the U.S. officials who screened them acknowledged, who were held for no reason other than their HIV status. When these people protest detention, the response was brutal,” said Pardiss Kebriaei, senior staff attorney at the U.S.-based Center for Constitutional Rights, to reporters during a press call last Thursday.


Legal challenges eventually forced the U.S. government to release the detainees, setting a precedent that indefinite offshore detention without due process is legally dubious.


In 2002, the George W. Bush administration built a detention camp in Guantanamo Bay to hold terror suspects following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001.




But Guantanamo’s use for migrant detention continued with at least two presidents, Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, using the base.


The Biden administration sought to close Guantanamo, but Congress never passed the legislation, leaving the base operational for future use.


“The idea of closing Guantanamo as a prison is one thing; closing Guantanamo as a 45-square-mile base held in Cuba is another,” Pensack said.


Legal and human rights concerns


Advocates warn that offshore detention facilities allow the U.S. to sidestep domestic constitutional protections and limit oversight.


Eunice Cho, attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project, told reporters during the press call last Thursday that “detaining immigrants on military bases in the United States and Guantanamo would subject people to dangerous conditions ... and attempt to avoid scrutiny by lawyers, the press, and congressional oversight.”




Historically, legal challenges have helped curb indefinite detentions at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court ruling in Rasul v. Bush (2004) established that Guantanamo detainees have the right to challenge their detention in U.S. courts. However, the Trump administration could attempt to argue that civil immigration detainees fall outside this precedent.


While prior administrations may have seen Guantanamo as a law-free zone, “That is not the case today,” said Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights, adding that migrants at Guantanamo now “have due process rights under the Constitution.”


“[Meanwhile], people would be detained. … and [litigation] would go on and people would suffer during that time,” she said.


In the meantime, the Trump' administration border czar Tom Homan told reporters outside the White House on Thursday that “President Trump made a commitment that the worst of the worst will go to Gitmo.”


Broader immigration, policy implications


The Guantanamo facility has historically been used in moments of crisis, from Cuban and Haitian exoduses to post-9/11 military detention. The Trump administration’s decision to include Guantanamo in its mass detention strategy signals a shift toward increasingly punitive measures, according to some analysts.


Stacy Suh, program director at Detention Watch Network, emphasized the link between detention expansion and deportations.


“Detention plays a crucial role in deportation. … More detention means more people would be deported,” she said.


The Department of Homeland Security has yet to clarify whether the latest White House policy includes detention of migrants without criminal records or whether they would have access to asylum proceedings or be expelled outright.


Homan said the U.S. has had a migrant processing at “Gitmo for decades. So, we’re increasing our footprint there.”


Legal response


The administration's decision has sparked backlash from advocacy groups, legal experts, and members of Congress, many of whom are calling for oversight hearings and possibly legal action.


Cho of the ACLU urged vigilance, saying there is a need for “a robust response from both the press, from government oversight agencies, Congress, advocacy organizations, and the community."


With Guantanamo’s history of controversial and legally ambiguous detentions, experts predict judicial and political battles over its use for immigration enforcement.

## Trump administration plans to slash all but a fraction of USAID jobs, officials say

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration presented a plan Thursday to dramatically cut staffing worldwide for U.S. aid projects as part of its dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, leaving fewer than 300 workers out of thousands.


Late Thursday, federal workers associations filed suit asking a federal court to stop the shutdown, arguing that President Donald Trump lacks the authority to shut down an agency enshrined in congressional legislation.


Two current USAID employees and one former senior USAID official told The Associated Press of the administration's plan, presented to remaining senior officials of the agency Thursday. They spoke on condition of anonymity due to a Trump administration order barring USAID staffers from talking to anyone outside their agency.


The plan would leave fewer than 300 staffers on the job out of what are currently 8,000 direct hires and contractors. They, along with an unknown number of 5,000 locally hired international staffers abroad, would run the few life-saving programs that the administration says it intends to keep going for the time being.


It was not immediately clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what the Trump administration says is a review of which aid and development programs it wants to resume.


The administration earlier this week gave almost all USAID staffers posted overseas 30 days, starting Friday, to return to the U.S., with the government paying for their travel and moving costs. Workers who choose to stay longer, unless they received a specific hardship waiver, might have to cover their own expenses, a notice on the USAID website said late Thursday.


Speaking to reporters Monday in El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the agency as historically "unresponsive" to Congress and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to take its direction from the State Department.


"USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that there's somehow a global charity separate from the national interest," Rubio said. "These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest."


Speaking in the Dominican Republic on Thursday, Rubio said the U.S. government will continue providing foreign aid.


"But it is going to be foreign aid that makes sense and is aligned with our national interest," he told reporters.


The Trump administration and billionaire ally Elon Musk, who is running a budget-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, have targeted USAID hardest so far in an unprecedented challenge of the federal government and many of its programs.


Since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, a sweeping funding freeze has shut down most of the agency’s programs worldwide, and almost all of its workers have been placed on administrative leave or furloughed. Musk and Trump have spoken of eliminating USAID as an independent agency and moving surviving programs under the State Department.


Democratic lawmakers and others call the move illegal without congressional approval.


The same argument was made by the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees in their lawsuit, which asks the federal court in Washington to compel the reopening of USAID’s buildings, return its staffers to work and restore funding.


Government officials "failed to acknowledge the catastrophic consequences of their actions, both as they pertain to American workers, the lives of millions around the world, and to U.S. national interests," the suit says.

## Trump to create religious office in White House, target 'anti-Christian bias'

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would create a White House faith office and direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead a task force on eradicating what he called anti-Christian bias within the federal government.


Trump delivered remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast at the U.S. Capitol and used his speech to call for unity, telling lawmakers his relationship with religion has changed since a pair of failed assassination attempts last year.


At a second prayer breakfast in Washington, Trump struck a more partisan tone, took a victory lap for getting "rid of woke over the last two weeks" and announced steps to protect Christians from what he said was religious discrimination.


"The mission of this task force will be to immediately halt all forms of anti-Christian targeting and discrimination within the federal government, including at the DOJ, which was absolutely terrible, the IRS, the FBI and other agencies," Trump said.


He vowed his attorney general would work to "fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide."


The president did not cite specific examples of anti-Christian bias during his remarks but has previously claimed that the Biden administration used the federal government to target Christians specifically.


Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish the task force and its responsibilities, which include recommending steps to terminate "violative policies, practices, or conduct."


Biden's administration announced a strategy in December for countering anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bigotry, and a similar plan to fight antisemitism in September 2023.


The actions announced on Thursday could pose constitutional questions about the separation of church and state, with the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment limiting government endorsement of religion.


In the last three election cycles, white evangelical Christian voters, who make up a critical piece of the Republican base, have supported Trump. He has embraced the conservative Christian world view and policies that speak to the bloc's anxiety about changing gender norms and family patterns.


The president on Thursday also announced he will create a White House Faith Office, led by the Rev. Paula White, who has served as a religious adviser to him for many years.


Trump established a similar office at the White House during his first term and regularly consulted with a tight group of evangelical advisers.


Trump also said he would create a new commission on religious liberty, and he criticized the Biden administration for the "persecution" of believers for prosecuting anti-abortion advocates.


In 2023, the National Prayer Breakfast split into two events, the one on Capitol Hill attended by lawmakers and a separate private event for thousands at a hotel ballroom after some lawmakers sought to distance themselves from the private religious group following questions over how it was run and funded.

## Trump imposes sanctions on International Criminal Court

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on International Criminal Court investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies such as Israel, repeating action he took during his first term.  


The move coincides with a visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who -- along with his former defense minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas -- is wanted by the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip.  


It was unclear how quickly the U.S. would announce names of people sanctioned. During the first Trump administration in 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her top aides over the ICC's investigation into alleged war crimes by American troops in Afghanistan. 


The ICC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sanctions include freezing any U.S. assets of those designated and barring them and their families from visiting the United States. 


The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals. The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members.  


Trump signed the executive order after U.S. Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court.  


The court has taken measures to shield staff from possible U.S. sanctions, paying salaries three months in advance, as it braced for financial restrictions that could cripple the war crimes tribunal, sources told Reuters last month. 


In December, the court's president, judge Tomoko Akane, warned that sanctions would "rapidly undermine the Court's operations in all situations and cases, and jeopardize its very existence."


Russia has also taken aim at the court. In 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. Russia has banned entry to ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan and placed him and two ICC judges on its wanted list.

## US Senate confirms Trump budget director pick Vought

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Republican-led U.S. Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's nominee Russell Vought as budget director on Thursday, placing the reins of government funding in the hands of a hard-line conservative who has advocated for reducing Congress's power over taxpayer dollars.


The Senate voted 53-47 to confirm Vought after a marathon overnight session during which Democrats denounced him as a dangerous far-right ideologue and blasted Republicans for rubber-stamping Trump's nomination.


Vought, who also headed the Office of Management and Budget during Trump's first presidential term, raised concerns among members of both parties by criticizing a 1974 law preventing presidents from unilaterally blocking congressionally approved funding, a practice known as "impoundment."


In his two confirmation hearings, Vought repeatedly said he believed a 1974 law was unconstitutional, a position that even the Republican committee chairmen said they did not fully support.


Last week, the White House Budget Office issued a memo freezing hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and loans. The White House said the freeze was necessary to ensure aid programs were aligned with Trump's priorities including his executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.


The White House rescinded the memo and a federal judge temporarily blocked the freeze, but not before the action raised widespread fears about the future critical government-funded services and concerns that Trump could take unilateral action against other government funding.


Democrats sought to link Vought's role in the hard-right Project 2025 policy initiative to a range of administration actions, including the Trump administration's unilateral actions to essentially shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development and fire prosecutors at the Justice Department.


"Whether it's with federal workers, whether it's at USAID, whether it's hurting Justice Department prosecutors, all of that is Russell Vought at work," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on a floor speech.


"He's working to hurt you, Mr. and Mrs. America."


Republicans championed Vought’s experience as budget director and the role they expect him to play in cutting wasteful government spending.


"Identifying ways to rein in our spending – and to target government waste – has to be a priority. And I’m confident that Mr. Vought will help lead that charge," Senate Majority Leader John Thune said this week. "There is no question that he will be able to hit the ground running."

## Treaty obliges US to defend Panama Canal, says Rubio

date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States has a treaty obligation to protect the Panama Canal if it comes under attack, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday, amid confusion and what Panama has described as "lies" regarding whether U.S. Navy ships can transit the Panama Canal for free.


"I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict. Those are our expectations. … They were clearly understood in those conversations," Rubio said during a press conference in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. He held talks with Panamanian President Jose Rauu Mulino in Panama City on Sunday.


Rubio was referring to a treaty signed by the U.S. and Panama in 1977.


The top U.S. diplomat told reporters that while he respects Panama's democratically elected government and acknowledges that it has "a process of laws and procedures that it needs to follow," the treaty obligation "would have to be enforced by the armed forces the United States, particularly the U.S. Navy."


The U.S. intends to pursue an amicable resolution, Rubio said.


Mulino posted on X that he planned to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon.




On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said, via a social media post on X, that U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without incurring fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars annually.


But the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government, disputed the U.S. claim, saying that it has made no adjustments to these fees. It also expressed its willingness to engage in dialogue with relevant U.S. officials.


During his weekly press conference on Thursday, the Panamanian president denied his country had reached a deal allowing U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free, saying he completely rejected the State Department's statement.




Belt and Road Initiative


Meanwhile, Mulino told reporters that the Panamanian Embassy in Beijing had provided China with the required 90-day notice of its decision to exit the Belt and Road Initiative, also known as BRI.


He denied that the decision was made at Washington's request, saying that he was taking time to assess Panama's relationship with China and decide what would best serve his country's interests.


"I don't know what the incentive was for the person who signed that agreement with China," Mulino said in Spanish, adding that he did not think the BRI had brought major benefits to his country.


Panama joined China's BRI under former President Juan Carlos Varela. The agreement was signed in 2018, following Panama's decision in 2017 to establish its diplomatic relations with China and sever ties with Taiwan.


Rubio has welcomed Panama's decision not to renew its participation in China's BRI.


China describes the BRI, which was launched in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, as a vast infrastructure initiative designed to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes.


The United States has warned that the project is driven by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.


In Beijing, Chinese officials dismissed what they called the U.S.'s "irresponsible remarks on the Panama Canal issue" and accused Washington of intentionally distorting, attacking and mischaracterizing relevant cooperation.


"China firmly opposes it and made stern demarches to the U.S. side," said Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry.


While in Santo Domingo, Rubio met with Dominican President Luis Abinader and Foreign Minister Roberto Alvarez.


The Dominican Republic is the final stop on Rubio's five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean, which focuses on curbing illegal immigration, combating drug trafficking and countering China's growing influence in the Western Hemisphere.

## White House monitoring China’s complaint on Trump tariffs at WTO

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

white house — The White House on Thursday said it was monitoring a complaint by China to the World Trade Organization that accuses the United States of making “unfounded and false allegations” about China’s role in the fentanyl trade to justify tariffs on Chinese products.


The complaint was made Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%. The White House said the new duties on Chinese goods were aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl opioids and their precursor chemicals.


China said it was imposing retaliatory tariffs on some American goods beginning February 10, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas imports and 10% on petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission vehicles and pickup trucks. The country also immediately implemented restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals and launched an antitrust investigation into American tech giant Google.


In the WTO filing, China said the U.S. tariff measures were "discriminatory and protectionist" and violated international trade rules. Beijing has requested a consultation with Washington.


China’s request will kick-start a process within the WTO’s Appellate Body, which has the final say on dispute settlements. A White House official told VOA the administration was monitoring Beijing’s file but did not provide further details.


Analysts say Beijing’s move is largely performative and unlikely to yield much relief. The Appellate Body has been largely paralyzed following the first Trump administration’s 2019 move to block appointments of appellate judges over what it viewed as judicial overreach. The Biden administration continued the policy.


China recognizes the WTO is not going to put a lot of pressure on the United States because Washington is fully capable of blocking any legal process there, said Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.


“So instead, I think the Chinese reaction has been moderate in indicating that they will act tit for tat against U.S. trade,” he told VOA.


Schott added that there’s “a desire to keep things cool” and moderate the damage, just as what happened during the first Trump administration when a trade deal was agreed upon after initial retaliatory trade actions.


On the U.S. side, the 10% tariffs against China are much lower than the up to 60% that Trump promised during his presidential campaign, he said. 


Trump-Xi call


Trump imposed import duties on Beijing after delaying his actions to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada following conversations Monday with their leaders. Tariff critics are hoping that a conversation between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could lead to similar results.


White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the call “is being scheduled and will happen very soon.”


However, Trump has dismissed the negative impact of China’s tariffs and said he was “in no rush” to speak with Xi.


“We’ll speak to him at the appropriate time,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.


Unlike Trump’s deal with Mexico and Canada, an agreement with Beijing is unlikely to come quickly, considering strong bipartisan support for placing tariffs on China because of concern about the influx of illegal drugs and other national security concerns, said Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.


“Even if they come up with some kind of agreement to settle this particular tariff or to remove the countertariffs, there will probably be more tariffs on China later in this administration,” she told VOA.


The U.S. Postal Service on Tuesday announced that it was suspending acceptance of inbound packages from China and Hong Kong, closing a loophole that Chinese garment and other consumer goods companies have used in the past. These companies, including Shein and Temu as well as Amazon vendors, bypassed existing U.S. tariffs by shipping to American customers directly from China.


On Wednesday, USPS reversed its decision, saying it would work with Customs and Border Protection on a way to collect the new tariffs. 


The Postal Service “will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts,” it said. “The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery.”


It is unclear how the fee will be collected in such direct transactions between Chinese sellers and American buyers.


Trump’s trade actions on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as his threat to impose duties on all foreign shipments into the country, including from European allies, have caused confusion and uncertainty across global trade. 


Businesses usually respond to trade uncertainty by holding off on investments or passing on increased costs to customers. But the damage goes beyond small and large businesses domestically and abroad, Ziemba said.


“If one of the U.S. goals is relying less on China and Chinese supply chains for critical minerals, for energy, for other things like that, then the uncertainty about whether there’s going to be tariffs and investment restrictions on its allies fly in the face of that goal,” she said.

## VOA Mandarin: Trump tariffs close loophole used by Chinese online retailers

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

The new tariffs on Chinese imports, imposed by President Donald Trump this month, include a provision that will close a loophole that Chinese online retailers used for their U.S.-bound exports. The “de minimis” exemption that applies to packages worth less than $800 is commonly used by Chinese online retailers such as Shein and Temu to ship goods at a lower price directly to U.S. consumers.

## US judge blocks Trump offer for government workers until at least Monday

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

A U.S. judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Trump administration's proposed incentive for federal workers until at least Monday, giving an initial win to labor unions that sued to stop it. 


The ruling by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston pushes back a midnight deadline set by the Trump administration, which is pressing federal workers to leave their jobs in an unprecedented drive to overhaul the federal government. 


O'Toole could opt to delay the buyout further or block it on a more permanent basis when he next considers the legal challenge by the unions at a hearing on Monday. 


The proposal has upended Washington, sparking street protests and accusations by labor unions and opposition Democrats that Republican President Donald Trump is violating multiple laws. 


The offer promises to pay employees' salaries until October, but that may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14 and there is no guarantee that salaries will be funded beyond that point. 


The Education Department told staffers who accept it that their paychecks could stop at any time, media outlets reported. Labor unions and Democrats have said the offer is not trustworthy.  


Some federal employees said they were heartened by Thursday's court ruling. 


"It's a glimmer of hope that the courts might help us and block the whole resignation program," said an employee at the General Services Administration, which manages federal properties.  


The buyout encompasses not only employees at domestic agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency that have traditionally drawn the ire of Trump's Republicans, but intelligence agencies like the CIA as well. 


White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said more than 40,000 federal employees had accepted the offer so far, roughly 2% of the federal government's 2.3 million civilian workforce. 


Roughly 6% of federal workers retire or resign in a typical year, according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. 


The administration said earlier in the day that those who do not accept the buyout could lose their jobs. 


The White House has sought to identify workers hired within the last two years, who lack full civil-service protections and would be easier to fire. 


It has also ordered agency officials to identify those appointed by Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who remain in civil-service jobs, as well as those who have received poor performance ratings. 


Federal workers say they are operating in a climate of fear and uncertainty. 


Workers said they were downloading pay and benefit records that they feared could be erased from government computers as they weighed whether to take a buyout deal that might not be honored or stay on with the knowledge they could be fired. 


The White House says it is following through on Trump's campaign promise to cut wasteful spending and slim down a bureaucracy that many conservatives see as left-leaning and unresponsive to the president's agenda. 


Trump has tasked Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with leading the overhaul effort. 


Musk and his aides have moved rapidly, turning up at agencies throughout Washington to demand access to sensitive information, including personnel files. Their efforts have resulted in purges of staff in several departments and a significant scaling down of operations of America's main humanitarian aid agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development.  


Among the data Musk's team has been examining are Medicare and Medicaid payments to older Americans and lower-income enrollees.

## Though China might aim to fill aid void left by USAID, its own challenges could limit it

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. foreign aid agency broadly shut down by the Trump administration has long been criticized by Beijing. But as USAID projects wind down, will Beijing step in to try to build influence? Some analysts say although China will want to fill the vacuum, its own economic problems could limit what it will do.  


U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is now the acting director of U.S. Agency for International Development, said he will bring the agency's activities in line with the agenda of the new government. 


"These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest," he told reporters while visiting El Salvador earlier this week. 


USAID had an annual budget of more than $40 billion and managed aid programs around the world, including a China-related program that has become a target of criticism by the White House. 


On a "waste and abuse" fact sheet released on Feb. 3, the White House said USAID had given millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. organization working on protections against infectious disease. The organization has been accused of working with Wuhan Institute of Virology on coronavirus research that had caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Both EcoHealth Alliance and the Chinese government have rejected those accusations. 


Agency has framed funding as strategy


In recent years, USAID has increasingly framed its funding for China-related programs as a strategy to contain China's global expansion through aid and investments. 


An archived page of USAID's now-closed website shows that the agency lauded its "Countering Chinese Influence Fund" as one of its "key accomplishments." The fund "will advance national-security goals" to "build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from the CCP and other malign actors." 


Michael Schiffer, former USAID assistant administrator for Asia, told a congressional panel in 2023 that the agency had for more than a decade supported data collection on China's overseas investments through AidData, a research group at the College of William and Mary in the U.S. state of Virginia.


The funding freeze has put at least one such USAID-funded project in financial trouble. Brian Eyler, a researcher at the Stimson Center in Washington, wrote in a public post on Facebook that his project, Mekong Dams Monitor, has difficulty continuing operation because of the freeze. 


"We are ordered to stop work on those grants for 90 days pending further review. And that means our Southeast Asia program might not be able to keep the lights on," he wrote.   


Eyler's project was launched by the State Department during the first Trump administration to study how dams built by China and other countries on the Mekong River in southeast Asia have negatively affected communities downstream. According to Eyler's post, the project received funding from both the State Department and USAID.   


Chinese state media had accused the project of smearing China. 


VOA Mandarin reached out to Stimson Center for more details but did not receive a response.   


On Wednesday, Rubio said the Trump administration is in the process of identifying programs that are exempted from the funding freeze.  


"This [is] not about ending foreign aid. It is about structuring it in a way that furthers the national interest of the United States," Rubio said during his multiday trip to Latin America.


Critics of USAID 


USAID also has been a target of Beijing's ire. China's foreign ministry released a report last year accusing USAID programs of corruption and prioritizing the advancement of U.S. interests.


The shutdown of USAID has been met with cheers and celebrations on the Chinese internet, where anti-U.S. narratives permeate. Many users praised Elon Musk, the billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency, for closing the agency.   


Musk previously posted on X describing USAID as "a criminal organization" and that it is time "for it to die." 


USAID critics


Critics of the funding freeze and the shuttering of USAID worry that Beijing will see this as an opportunity to fill the void left by the U.S. 


"China has spent trillions of dollars in numerous countries because it is interested in pulling them into its sphere of influence," U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons wrote in The Washington Post. 


Steven Balla, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., told VOA Mandarin he agrees with the assessment. But he said China's plan to expand foreign aid is likely to be hindered by its lingering domestic problems. 


"You think about youth unemployment; you think about the real estate bubble and so forth," he said. "That might make it difficult for the Xi administration to aggressively expand into new parts of the world because the U.S is pulling back."


Some activists worry that even if China tries to fill the void, certain areas where there once were U.S. aid programs will not receive the same kind of funding, if at all.   


A former environmental lawyer in China who now lives in the U.S. told VOA Mandarin that, compared to U.S. aid programs, China's assistance is of a more transactional nature and seeks financial returns. She wants to remain anonymous because she fears harassment from Beijing. 


A 2021 report released by China shows that between 2013 and 2018, China had spent $376 billion on foreign aid, 45% of which went to Africa in areas such as agriculture, medical assistance, food supply, disease control, and climate change. 


The former environmental lawyer said if it is entirely left for China to provide aid, areas such as women's rights and natural resource management will lose a large portion of funding, if not entirely, because China is not interested in improving local governance. 


"There will certainly be a very severe impact on the African people," she said, "which isn't something you'll be able to see within just a day or two."

## US imposes new sanctions targeting Iran oil exports

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Thursday new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, targeting an international network that facilitates the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China.


In a release, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, said the sanctions target Sepehr Energy, a front company through which Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff, or AFGS, ships the oil. The sanctions include entities and individuals in China, India and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several vessels.


The office said Sepehr Energy and its affiliate companies, which operate under the AFGS, use “deceitful evasion methods,” including the falsification of maritime documents, to disguise the Iranian origin of the oil that it trades and transports to overseas buyers, including China.


The OFAC said each year, the illicit sales generate the equivalent of billions of dollars, which Iran uses to fund its destabilizing regional activities and support of multiple regional terrorist groups, including Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah.


Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.


In the statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Iran also uses the funds to develop its nuclear program and the production of deadly ballistic missiles and military drones.


“The United States is committed to aggressively targeting any attempt by Iran to secure funding for these malign activities,” he said.


In a separate statement, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the United States will not tolerate Iran’s destructive and destabilizing behavior.


“We will use all tools at our disposal to hold the regime accountable for its destabilizing activities and pursuit of nuclear weapons that threaten the civilized world,” she said.


Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating the U.S. government impose maximum pressure on Tehran to dissuade it from pursuing its nuclear program. Iran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.

## House lawmakers push to ban AI app DeepSeek from US government devices

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A bipartisan duo in the U.S. House is proposing legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular social media platform TikTok.


Lawmakers Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Darin LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, on Thursday introduced the "No DeepSeek on Government Devices Act," which would ban federal employees from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They cited the Chinese government's ability to use the app for surveillance and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks.


"The Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans," Gottheimer said in a statement. "We simply can't risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security."


The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others. DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and technologists.


The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems, and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be needed to develop the highest end AI models.


Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a window for a long-term solution before the legally required ban takes effect.


In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices.


"The technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the United States can afford to lose," LaHood said in a statement. "This commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from federal workers' phones while closing backdoor operations the company seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard Americans' data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI."


The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban. The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek.


Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, would bar the import or export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national security concerns.

## US service member, 3 contractors die in plane crash in Philippines

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

MANILA, PHILIPPINES — One U.S. service member and three defense contractors were killed Thursday when a plane contracted by the U.S. military crashed in a rice field in the southern Philippines, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said.


The aircraft was conducting a routine mission "providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support at the request of our Philippine allies," the command said in a statement. It said the cause of the crash was under investigation.


The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines also confirmed the crash of a light plane in Maguindanao del Sur province. It did not immediately provide other details.


The bodies of the four people were retrieved from the wreckage in Ampatuan town, said Ameer Jehad Tim Ambolodto, a safety officer of Maguindanao del Sur. Indo-Pacific Command said the names of the crew were being withheld pending family notifications.


Windy Beaty, a provincial disaster-mitigation officer, told The Associated Press that she received reports that residents saw smoke coming from the plane and heard an explosion before the aircraft plummeted to the ground less than a kilometer from a cluster of farmhouses.


Nobody was reported injured on or near the crash site, which was cordoned off by troops, Beaty said.


U.S. forces have been deployed in a Philippine military camp in the country's south for decades to help provide advice and training to Filipino forces battling Muslim militants. The region is the homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation.

## Trump's US trade negotiator pick vows hard-line policies

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's choice to be the top U.S. trade negotiator, promised to pursue the president's hard-line trade policies in testimony Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee. But he faced pushback from senators unsettled by Trump's unpredictable actions on trade.


Trump's protectionist approach — involving the heavy use of taxes on foreign goods — will give Americans "the opportunity to work in good-paying jobs producing goods and services they can sell in this market and abroad to earn an honest living," Greer said in remarks prepared ahead of his confirmation hearing.


As U.S. trade representative, Greer would have responsibility along with commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick for one of Trump's top policy priorities: waging — or at least threatening — trade war with countries around the world, America's friends and foes alike.


On Saturday, Trump signed orders imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico — America's two biggest trading partners. Then on Monday, he turned around and gave those countries a 30-day reprieve from the tariffs after their leaders made modest concessions on stopping the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States.


"Trump governs by whim, and in trade that hurts American families," said Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the finance committee. "His tariff bluff created huge uncertainty that is costing American businesses and putting the global economy on a month-to-month lease."


Trump believes that imposing tariffs — import taxes — on U.S. trade partners can reduce America's massive trade deficits, protect U.S. industry from competition, bring manufacturing back to the United States and pressure other countries into making concessions on a variety of issues, including reducing illegal immigration and cracking down on drug trafficking.


The hostilities have already begun. On Tuesday, the United States imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports on top of levies imposed in Trump’s first term. Beijing promptly lashed back, announcing tariffs on U.S. coal, crude oil and other products, restricting exports of critical minerals and launching an antitrust investigation of Google.




But the Chinese tariffs don't take effect until Monday, buying time for the two countries to reach some kind of truce. That is what happened earlier this week. Trump had signed an order Saturday hitting imports from America's two biggest trade partners, Canada and Mexico, with 25% tariffs. They were supposed to take effect Tuesday, too, but were called off — and delayed for 30 days — after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed Monday to do more to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across U.S. borders.


Economists have warned that Trump's tariffs would disrupt trade and drive up prices for American consumers. Democrats and others have also criticized the impulsive and unpredictable way that Trump conducts trade policy and his decision to target America's neighbors and allies, not limiting his tariff onslaught to U.S. geopolitical rival China.


Wyden expressed concern about Trump's campaign promises to impose an across-the-board "universal" tariff on imports as opposed to targeting China and other countries for unfair trade practices or protecting workers in specific industries struggling with foreign competition.


The universal tariffs, Wyden said, amount to a "prescription for hitting our citizens, small businesses, really hard and also raising inflationary pressures."


Greer responded that universal tariffs "should be studied" as a way to possibly lower America's massive trade deficits. Greer was a veteran of Trump's first-term trade battles, serving as chief of staff to then-U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. In that position, Greer was involved in a U.S.-China trade brawl that saw the world's two biggest economies slap tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of each other's goods.


He also played a role in Trump's contentious and successful campaign to rewrite a North American trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and to get Congress to approve the new pact.


Earlier, Greer, a graduate of the University of Virginia law school, served as a lawyer in the U.S. Air Force's Advocate General's Corps, doing a tour in Iraq and serving as a prosecutor and defense counsel in criminal cases involving U.S. airmen.


After Trump's first term, Greer joined the Washington law firm King & Spalding, representing clients in cases before the Commerce Department, the International Trade Commission and federal courts.

## Trump attends National Prayer Breakfast

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that his relationship with religion had "changed" after a pair of failed assassination attempts last year, as he advocated at the National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol for Americans to "bring God back into our lives."


Trump joined a Washington tradition of more than 70 years that brings together a bipartisan group of lawmakers for fellowship. He was also to speak at a separate prayer breakfast at a Washington hotel sponsored by a private group.


"I really believe you can't be happy without religion, without that belief," Trump said. "Let's bring religion back. Let's bring God back into our lives."


Trump reflected on having a bullet coming close to killing him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, telling lawmakers and attendees, "It changed something in me, I feel."


He continued: "I feel even stronger. I believed in God, but I feel, I feel much more strongly about it. Something happened."


He drew laughs when he expressed gratitude that the episode "didn't affect my hair." The president, who's a nondenominational Christian, called religious liberty "part of the bedrock of American life" and called for protecting it with "absolute devotion."




Trump and his administration have already clashed with religious leaders, including him disagreeing with the Reverend Mariann Budde's sermon the day after his inauguration, when she called for mercy for members of the LGBTQ+ community and migrants who are in the country illegally.


Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic, has sparred with top U.S. leaders of his own church over immigration issues. And many clergy members across the country are worried about the removal of churches from the sensitive-areas list, allowing federal officials to conduct immigration actions at places of worship.


The Republican president made waves at the final prayer breakfast during his first term. That year the gathering came the day after the Senate acquitted him in his first impeachment trial.


Trump in his remarks then threw not-so-subtle barbs at Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who publicly said she prayed for Trump, and Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who had cited his faith in his decision to vote to convict Trump. "I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong."


Trump said then in his winding speech, in which he also held up two newspapers with banner headlines about his acquittal. "Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that that's not so."


Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to attend the prayer breakfast, in February 1953, and every president since has spoken at the gathering.


Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Republican Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas are the honorary co-chairs of this year's prayer breakfast.


In 2023, the National Prayer Breakfast split into two dueling events, the one on Capitol Hill largely attended by lawmakers and government officials and a larger private event for thousands at a hotel ballroom.


The split occurred when lawmakers sought to distance themselves from the private religious group that for decades had overseen the bigger event, due to questions about its organization and how it was funded. In 2023 and 2024, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, spoke at the Capitol Hill event, and his remarks were livestreamed to the other gathering.

## Mexico deploys the first of 10,000 troops to US border after Trump's tariff threat

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

CIUDAD JUÁREZ, MEXICO — A line of Mexican National Guard and Army trucks rumbled along the border separating Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, Texas, on Wednesday, among the first of 10,000 troops Mexico has sent to its northern frontier following tariff threats by President Donald Trump. 


Masked and armed National Guard members picked through brush running along the border barrier on the outskirts of Ciudad Juárez, pulling out makeshift ladders and ropes tucked away in the trenches, and pulling them onto trucks. Patrols were also seen on other parts of the border near Tijuana. 


It comes after a turbulent week along the border after Trump announced he would delay imposing crippling tariffs on Mexico for at least a month. In exchange, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised she would send the country’s National Guard to reinforce the border and crack down on fentanyl smuggling. 


Trump has declared an emergency on the border despite migration levels and fentanyl overdoses significantly dipping over the past year. The U.S. said it would, in turn, do more to stop American guns from being trafficked into Mexico to fuel cartel violence, which has rippled to other parts of the country as criminal groups fight to control the lucrative migrant smuggling industry. 


On Tuesday, the first of those forces arrived in border cities, climbing out of government planes. Guard members in the Wednesday patrol confirmed that they were part of the new force. 


"There will be permanent surveillance on the border," José Luis Santos Iza, one of the National Guard leaders heading off the deployment in the city, told media upon the arrival of the first set of soldiers. "This operation is primarily to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, mainly fentanyl." 


At least 1,650 troops were expected to be sent to Ciudad Juárez, according to government figures, making it one of the biggest receivers of border reinforcements in the country, second only to Tijuana, where 1,949 are slated to be sent. 


During U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s trip through Latin America — where migration was at the top of the agenda — the top American diplomat thanked the Mexican government for the forces, according to a statement by the Mexican government. 


The negotiation by Sheinbaum was viewed by observers as a bit of shrewd political maneuvering by the newly elected Mexican leader. Many had previously cast doubt that she’d be able to navigate Trump’s presidency as effectively as her predecessor and ally, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

## US government vessels can sail Panama Canal without fees, US says

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of State said on Wednesday American government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees.


"The government of Panama has agreed to no longer charge fees for U.S. government vessels to transit the Panama Canal," the department said in a post on X.


It said the agreement will save the U.S. government millions of dollars each year.


The Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino on Sunday during a trip to Central America.


Panama has become a focal point of the Trump administration as President Donald Trump has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its passage.


"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question," Trump said last month.


Mulino has dismissed Trump's threat that the U.S. retake control of the canal, which it largely built. The U.S. administered territory surrounding the passage for decades.


But the U.S. and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canal's return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed it over in 1999 after a period of joint administration.

## New attorney general orders review of Trump cases as she takes over the Justice Dept.

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — New Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday issued a series of directives designed to overhaul a Justice Department that President Donald Trump says is biased against conservatives.


Hours after she was sworn in at the White House, Bondi called for the creation of "weaponization working group" that will scrutinize the work of special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump in two criminal cases. The group will also review "unethical prosecutions" stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, among other things, according to the memo.


Trump and his allies have contended that the Justice Department under the Biden administration had become weaponized against conservatives. Some of the department’s most high-profile probes concerned the Democratic president and his son, and there's been no evidence to support the idea that the prosecutions against Trump were launched for a partisan purpose.


It was one of 14 directives signed by Bondi designed to roll back Biden administration policies and align the Justice Department with the priorities of a White House that seeks to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees it views as disloyal.


Among other directives Bondi signed were orders to lift the moratorium on the federal death penalty and end federal grants administered by the Justice Department for jurisdictions that "unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement."


The Justice Department will provide quarterly reports to the White House on the progress of the working group’s review, which will look for instances where agencies' actions "appear to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice," according to the memo.


In another memo, Bondi wrote that prosecutors could face firings if they refuse to sign onto briefs or appear in court to argue on behalf of the administration, saying it's the department lawyers' job to "vigorously defend presidential policies and actions against legal challenges."




The flurry of activity signals a dramatic reshaping of the Justice Department under Bondi, a longtime Trump ally and former Florida attorney general who defended the president during his first impeachment trial against allegations that he abused the power of his office.


Democrats who opposed Bondi's confirmation have raised concerns about whether she would be able to lead a Justice Department free of influence from the White House given her close relationship with the president, who repeatedly suggested on the campaign trail that he would seek to use the justice system to exact revenge on his perceived enemies.


Bondi has said that politics will play no role in her decision-making, but she also refused at her confirmation hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump's adversaries. She also has repeated Trump's claims that the prosecutions against him amounted to political persecution, telling senators that the Justice Department "had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it's got to stop."


Despite the wide-ranging ambitions of the "weaponization working group" memo, there's no indication that the group will have prosecutorial powers or tools such as subpoenas that could compel subjects of the inquiries to cooperate with the new unit.


And though the memo purports to take aim at the "weaponization" of the Justice Department, it excludes from review investigations into Democrats by Biden's Justice Department, including special counsel probes into the former president's handling of classified information and his son Hunter's gun and tax allegations, which resulted in felony convictions before he was pardoned by his father in December.


Smith's team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump's November presidential win because of long-standing Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.


Bondi takes over department, which has been roiled by the firings of career prosecutors and senior FBI officials, along with the highly unusual scrutiny of thousands of agents involved in the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation.


FBI agents this week sued after the Justice Department demanded that the bureau turn over the names of all agents involved in the Jan. 6 probe, which agents believe may be a precursor to mass firings.

## Greenlanders explore Pacific Islands’ relationship with Washington

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Greenland’s representative in the United States met recently with at least one ambassador from the Pacific Islands to learn more about a political arrangement that some think could create an opportunity for the Arctic island and Washington, VOA has learned.


President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in either buying or taking control of Greenland, a resource-rich semiautonomous territory of Denmark, noting its strategic importance and position in the Arctic Ocean where Russia and China are rapidly advancing. But there has been pushback from the island’s residents, political leaders, Denmark and Europe.


Greenland representatives have declined to comment to VOA on their meeting that focused on a framework that Pacific Island nations have with Washington — known as the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA. The compacts give the United States military access to three strategic Pacific Islands — the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau — in exchange for economic aid.


Jackson Soram, ambassador to the United States from the Federated States of Micronesia, told VOA that the discussions took place at the end of January and focused on "basic questions" on the "provisions of economic assistance, and also the security and defense provisions of the compacts."


Soram said he met with representatives from Greenland and the Faroe Islands, another self-ruled Danish territory.


Alexander Gray, a former National Security Council chief of staff during the first Trump administration who worked on Pacific Island issues, told VOA he encouraged the Pacific Islands’ ambassadors to conduct these meetings.


"[The Greenlanders] want independence from Denmark," Gray, who is now a managing partner of American Global Strategies, said in an emailed response. "An independent Greenland, with a tiny population and the second-least densely populated geography on the planet, will quickly become dominated and its sovereignty undermined by Beijing and Moscow."


Russia has been reopening bases in the region even as Beijing has invested more than $90 billion in infrastructure projects in the Arctic Circle. Both the United States and Denmark have military bases in Greenland.


Gray said arctic dominance by Moscow and Beijing poses "a unique strategic threat" to the United States. He said a COFA "would allow Greenland to maintain its sovereignty, while allowing the U.S. to ensure that sovereignty is truly protected."


Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly told Trump that Greenland is "not for sale." But Monday, she said Copenhagen welcomes additional U.S. military investment in the strategic island.


"So, if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward," she said.


US-Greenland defense agreement


Some analysts say that neither Washington nor Nuuk needs a COFA agreement to increase the U.S. military presence in Greenland. In 2004, the United States, Greenland and Denmark signed the Igaliku Agreement to reduce the U.S. military presence in Greenland to a single air base, the Thule Air Base, which has been renamed Pitfuffik Space Base. It provides Washington with missile defense and space surveillance.


The 2004 agreement provides for "any significant changes to U.S. military operations or facilities" in Greenland to be made through consultation between Washington, Nuuk and Copenhagen.


"Washington can already achieve its objectives through working with Greenland and Denmark," Otto Svendsen, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last month on CSIS’s website.


A Danish Institute for International Studies policy brief in 2022 pointed out that COFA has created economic dependence between the Marshall Islands and the United States, as U.S. donor money makes up 70% of the Marshall Islands’ total GDP. This is the opposite of what Greenland’s leaders say they want.


Search for independence


A 2009 law called the Act on Greenland Self-Government outlines a "road map" —-drawn up by Nuuk and Copenhagen — for an independent Greenland, which requires a successful referendum.


In his New Year’s address, Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede said, "The upcoming new election period must, together with the citizens, create these new steps," opening the door for a referendum during parliamentary elections in April.


A 2019 survey suggested that more than two-thirds of Greenlanders want independence at some point. Yet in a poll released in January by two newspapers in Denmark and Greenland, 85% say they do not want to be part of the United States. Fifty-five percent, however, see Trump’s interest in Greenland as an opportunity.


Gray told VOA that the U.S., Denmark and Greenland should enter trilateral discussions for a compact.


"Working together, Washington, Copenhagen, and Nuuk can find common ground and move forward on a post-independence arrangement that works for all parties," he said in an emailed response.


Read Greenland's 2010 letter to the United Nations


As far back as 2010, Greenland told the United Nations it was exploring the idea of negotiating independence through a "free association" with Denmark.




Egede said he is ready to meet with Trump, but, "We do not want to be Danes. We do not want to be Americans."


Soram said he is trying to get ambassadors from Palau and the Marshall Islands to attend additional meetings with Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark.

## Congressional Democrats vow to fight changes at USAID

## FCC launches media investigations, reinstates complaints

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has launched investigations over the past two weeks into three news outlets and reinstated complaints against three others. 


Earlier this week, CBS News complied with an FCC request to hand over the raw footage and transcript from an October interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. 


The FCC’s request for the material was “unusual,” according to Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC commissioner under President Bill Clinton.


“The commission doesn’t usually ask for transcripts,” he said. 


That interview is at the center of one FCC complaint — and a $10 billion lawsuit from President Donald Trump — that says CBS doctored the interview. CBS denied any wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit, but its parent company, Paramount, is now considering a settlement, according to media reports.   


The FCC complaint against CBS is one of four that former FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, dismissed earlier in January, saying the complaints “seek to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.”


Rosenworcel’s successor, Trump-appointed Republican chair Brendan Carr, revived the CBS complaint, plus complaints against NBC and ABC. He did not revive a complaint against Fox News, which Rosenworcel had also dismissed. 


In an interview with CNN, Carr defended the inquiry into CBS. 


“I don’t see how the FCC can reasonably adjudicate this claim of news distortion without seeing what was actually said,” Carr said. 


On Wednesday afternoon, CBS published the unedited transcripts on its website, showing that the shows "60 Minutes" and "Face the Nation" used slightly different parts of the same answer from Harris, which is common practice in journalism.


FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, has said the move against CBS was "designed to instill fear in broadcast stations." On Wednesday, she called on the FCC to "dismiss this fishing expedition to avoid further politicizing our enforcement actions" because the transcript and footage showed "no evidence" that CBS and its affiliates had violated FCC rules.


The “news distortion” complaint against ABC claims fact-checking by the moderators in the preelection Harris-Trump TV debate favored Harris. 


The complaint against NBC claims Harris’ appearance on the comedy show “Saturday Night Live” shortly before the election violated “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Soon after, NBC provided Trump with equal time by giving him a chance to directly address voters following a NASCAR race. 


ABC, CBS and NBC did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. 


The Center for American Rights, which filed the three complaints, told VOA it applauded Carr’s decision to reopen them.


“Broadcasters are required to serve the public interest in exchange for their access to the public airwaves,” Daniel Suhr, the group’s president, said in an emailed statement. 


“Free speech does not include blatantly distorting the news or violating long-standing commission rules,” Suhr added. “We are encouraged to see Chairman Carr addressing these serious issues.”


But Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster University in Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, told VOA she believes the three complaints don’t have any merit because NBC eventually gave Trump equal time, and the CBS and ABC complaints pertain to content. 


“It’s the idea that the FCC would punish news organizations for editorial decisions,” she said. “It challenges almost the entire history of the FCC and how the FCC looks at content.” 

The FCC has also launched investigations into NPR, PBS and the San Francisco-based radio station KCBS. 


“It is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements,” Carr wrote in a Jan. 29 letter notifying the two outlets about the investigations. 


The FCC does not directly regulate NPR, PBS or other major networks. But the independent government agency does evaluate the actions of public broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold FCC licenses to use public airwaves.


If an FCC investigation finds wrongdoing, the agency can impose a fine or revoke a station's broadcast license.


Public broadcasting stations are not allowed to run commercials, so they run corporate underwriting spots, which are similar to commercials but don’t include a “call to action” urging listeners to do things like buy a specific product. 


Both NPR and PBS have rejected any wrongdoing. 

What stood out to Zarkin about the NPR and PBS investigations is how broad they are, she said. These kinds of investigations are typically directed at specific member stations and refer to specific incidents, she said, but that’s not the case here.  


“The idea that they’re sweepingly investigating NPR and PBS just in general — that’s not how the FCC has historically done business,” said Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC. 


On Monday, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene invited the CEOs of NPR and PBS to testify at a subcommittee hearing on what she considers “systemically biased news coverage” from the outlets. NPR and PBS receive a small amount of federal funding from the U.S.-chartered Corporation for Public Broadcasting.


Their reporting should “serve the entire public,” Greene said, “not just a narrow slice of like-minded individuals.” 

In his letter to NPR and PBS, Carr said he was sharing it with lawmakers because he thought it could inform the debate about whether to cut funding to the two outlets. 


“For my own part, I do not see a reason why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS given the changes in the media marketplace,” Carr wrote.


During his campaign, Trump threatened to revoke broadcasters’ licenses if elected. The recent flurry of FCC investigations and complaints has raised press freedom concerns among media experts and current and former Democratic FCC commissioners.

## Second bird flu strain found in US dairy cattle, agriculture agency says

date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA

U.S. dairy cattle tested positive for a strain of bird flu that previously had not been seen in cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday, ramping up concerns about the persistent spread of the virus. 


The H5N1 virus has reduced milk output in cattle, pushed up egg prices by wiping out millions of hens, and infected nearly 70 people since April as it has spread across the country. 


Genome sequencing of milk from Nevada identified the different strain, known as the D1.1 genotype, in dairy cows for the first time, the USDA said. Previously, all 957 bird flu infections among dairy herds reported since last March had been caused by another strain, the B3.13 genotype, according to the agency. 


Reuters reported news of the detection of the second strain on Wednesday ahead of USDA's announcement. 


The second strain was the predominant genotype among wild birds this past fall and winter and has also been found in poultry, the USDA said. It was identified in dairy cattle through an agency program that began testing milk for bird flu in December. 


"We're seeing the H5N1 virus itself be smarter than all of us," said Beth Thompson, South Dakota's state veterinarian.  


"It's modifying itself so it's not just staying in the poultry and the wild waterfowl. It's picking up a home in the mammals."  


Wild birds likely transmitted the second strain to cattle in Nevada, said J.J. Goicoechea, Nevada's agriculture director. Farmers need to ramp up safety and security measures to protect their animals, he said. 


"We obviously aren't doing everything we can and everything we should or the virus wouldn't be getting in," he said. 


The Nevada Department of Agriculture said on Jan. 31 that herds in two counties had been placed under quarantine because of bird flu detections.  


It is important for the USDA to contain the outbreak in the state quickly, so the strain does not spread to dairy cattle elsewhere, said Gail Hansen, a veterinary and public health consultant. 


Last year, bird flu spread across the country as infected cattle were shipped from Texas after the virus first leapt to cows from wild birds. 


"We didn't get a hold on it before," Hansen said. "We want to avoid that same scenario from happening in Nevada." 


Dairy herds that were formerly infected may be at risk again from the second strain, experts said. 


"Now it looks like we have new strains of virus that may escape some of the immunity associated with the other strains of viruses that could exacerbate the epidemics among animals and wildlife," said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases.  


"It's alarming."

The U.S. state of Missouri is suing China over the coronavirus pandemic, accusing it of “unleashing COVID-19 on the world.” The lawsuit threatens to seize $25 billion in assets if Beijing refuses to pay damages. Although the state attorney general is confident in winning the case, legal experts said there are still hoops Missouri needs to jump through due to laws protecting foreign state assets in the U.S.

## VOA Mandarin: Chinese firms relocated to Mexico face new problems amid Trump tariffs

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

President Donald Trump’s 25% tariff on imports from Mexico, temporarily put on hold this week, could disrupt the strategy of Chinese companies that have relocated to northern Mexico in recent years. By moving production closer to the U.S. market, these firms have been able to bypass U.S. tariffs toward China through the USMCA trade deal. Experts warn that these companies now face two significant challenges.

## Rubio to meet with Dominican officials to close Latin America tour

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in the Dominican Republic for talks Thursday with Dominican leaders on the last stop of multination tour of Latin America.


Rubio is set to meet with Dominican President Luis Abinader and Foreign Minister Roberto Alvarez in Santo Domingo.


He traveled from Guatemala, where he announced U.S. plans to support Guatemala with new infrastructure projects and to sign waivers on foreign aid to strengthen the U.S. partnership with that country Wednesday.  


Meanwhile, the two countries have reached a new migration arrangement under which Guatemala will accept 40% more deportation flights from the United States, including both Guatemalan nationals and individuals of other nationalities.


Speaking alongside Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo in a joint news conference, Rubio said he had signed "a letter of support" pledging full State Department cooperation on a partnership between Guatemala and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.


The initiative aims to "begin preliminary planning for the expansion" of "two new port facilities," along with highway and railroad connections to position Guatemala as a regional trade hub and boost its economic opportunities.


"Today, I'll be signing waivers on foreign aid that will continue that partnership, and hope to build on it," Rubio told reporters.


He said U.S. foreign aid has contributed to the arrest and extradition of criminals, including members of transnational groups.


"Certain individuals" and "fugitives" can be extradited, and they are actually "strategic objectives" for both the U.S. and its allies, Rubio said while visiting a facility near the Guatemalan Air Force base, where deportation flights arrive.


According to the State Department, this initiative has led to the arrest of more than 1,400 criminal fugitives upon arrival in Guatemala City.


Deportation flight


President Arévalo, after talks with Rubio, said the two countries will establish working groups to finalize the details and processes for increasing deportation flights from the United States.


"In this framework, we have agreed to increase by 40% the number of flights of deportees," both of Guatemalan nationals and "deportees from other nationalities" for repatriation, said the president through a translator.


He clarified that the "safe third country" was not discussed in title or content, emphasizing that the new arrangement with the U.S. ensures safe and humane conditions for repatriation.


The United States repatriated nearly 70,000 Guatemalans in 2024.


"Along with the agreement on Monday in El Salvador, as well as the tightening of the migration accord and repatriation flights with Panama, the Trump administration is focused on choke points on the approach to the southern border. Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and maintaining migration enforcement with Mexico will likely lead to a drastic reduction in migrants at the southern border," Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA on Wednesday.


Safe third-country agreement


In 2019, former Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales signed an Asylum Cooperative Agreement, commonly known as the safe third country agreement, with the first Trump administration.


The agreement was seen as part of Trump’s strategy to curb the flow of migrants to the United States.


In 2021, the Biden administration fulfilled a campaign promise and suspended the agreement, which allowed the U.S. to deny asylum seekers at the border and deport them to a designated third country, where they would be required to apply for asylum.


Critics argued that the policy exposed asylum seekers to unsafe conditions.


Guatemala-Taiwan ties


Guatemala remains one of the few countries maintaining official ties with Taiwan. President Arévalo has reaffirmed his commitment to recognizing Taiwan throughout his term, despite China's efforts to sway Guatemala toward Beijing.


"We have stated from the first moment that we maintain our diplomatic relationship with Taiwan," Arévalo said through an interpreter during the press conference when asked about his stance on China and Taiwan. He added his government seeks to "further develop" ties with Taiwan in "economics and investment."


Secretary of State Rubio expressed U.S. support for expanding Guatemala-Taiwan ties beyond diplomacy to economic cooperation.


In recent years, several Western Hemisphere nations—Panama, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras—have switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. These switches have been influenced by China's growing economic investment in Latin America.


Speaking in Guatemala City, Rubio cautioned against what he described as China's "debt trap."


"We’ve seen case after case where the Chinese Government comes in with billions of dollars, they promise, they start a project" and "bring in their own workers to do the work" but "in the end the project is either incomplete" or countries are left with massive debts.


In Washington, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu dismissed Rubio’s remarks as "malicious slander," urging the U.S. to focus on promoting "mutually beneficial cooperation" and "common global development."


Guatemala marks the fourth stop on Rubio’s five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean, focusing on curbing illegal immigration and combating drug trafficking.


Following meetings in Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala, Rubio traveled to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, for further discussions with regional leaders.

## 10 'high-threat illegal aliens' arrive at Guantanamo Bay

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — The first undocumented migrants — described by U.S. officials as the "the worst of the worst" — are being held in jail cells at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, waiting to be sent home. 


The Pentagon Wednesday confirmed 10 "high-threat illegal aliens" arrived Tuesday at the detention facility, where they are being held under the watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.  


VOA first reported on the transfer — and arrival — of the migrants, flown from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Guantanamo Bay aboard a U.S. military C-17 cargo plane Tuesday.




According to the Pentagon, the detention of the high-threat migrants at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is a temporary measure. 


ICE "is taking this measure to ensure the safe and secure detention of these individuals until they can be transported to their country of origin or other appropriate destination" the Pentagon said in a statement. 


U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military cargo plane, calling them "the worst of the worst," and warning the effort to deport them is just getting started. 




The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on the military flight were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody.   


The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. 


Noem, posting on X on Wednesday, said her department has overseen the arrest of "convicted murderers, rapists, child abusers, drug traffickers, MS-13 gang members, cartel members," in just the past few days. 




Since President Donald Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News. 


"The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead federal agency," U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a statement on Monday. 


The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. 


"If you're a violent gang banger, and you've been taken out of our country, and we're waiting to bring you to your country, we're going to put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida," Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Fox News this week. 


In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold up to 30,000 migrants. 


"Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So, we're going to send them out to Guantanamo," Trump said. 


Closing Guantanamo      


Democratic administrations under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the administration of former President George W. Bush in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. 


Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human rights catastrophe. 


"The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility," Hendrickson said. 


At its height during the global war on terror campaign, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. 


Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.

## US deportation flight carrying illegal Indian migrants lands in Punjab

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

New Delhi — A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals accused of entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of Punjab Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump administration launched a crackdown on illegal immigrants.


The military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104 deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly manner.


New Delhi, which does not want to make illegal immigration a contentious issue with Washington, has said that it is open to the return of undocumented Indians in the United States if their nationality is verified.


President Donald Trump said last week that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him that the country would "do what's right" in taking back illegal immigrants. His comment came following a phone conversation with Modi.


In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a media briefing on Friday that India and the United States are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration and “cooperation between India and the U.S. is strong and effective in this domain. This will be evident in times to come.”




Trade and migration are expected to be key issues during a meeting that could take place next week between Trump and Modi.


“India does not want to focus on the issue of illegal migrants being deported. We know it is big business in India, sending migrants illegally. Instead, the government’s interest is in ensuring that legal migration channels to the U.S. for Indian nationals are not restricted by the Trump administration,” according to Manoj Joshi, Distinguished Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.


Those legal routes are H-1B visas for skilled workers and visas for students.


“Both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration, while also creating more avenues for legal migration from India to the U.S.,” Jaiswal has said.


The number of Indian migrants attempting to enter the U.S. unlawfully has grown in recent years, with India now accounting for the largest number of illegal immigrants to the United States from Asian countries, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.


Their overall numbers, however, are still small; Indians account for only about 3 percent of illegal crossings.


The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants to be sent back home, according to a Bloomberg report last week.


Deportation flights to India are not new — between October 2023 and September 2024, more than 1,000 Indian nationals were repatriated, but Wednesday's flight was the first time that they were sent back via military aircraft.


The deportation flight was routed to Amritsar city in Punjab, which is among the three states where much of the illegal migration from India to the U.S. originates. The others are Haryana in the north and the western state of Gujarat.


Hours before the flight landed, Punjab’s minister for NRI (Non-Resident Indians) Affairs, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, urged people in the state to avoid illegal migration and instead focus on acquiring skills and education to access global opportunities through legal channels.

## US Postal Service to accept inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong after suspension

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

HONG KONG/SEOUL/SHANGHAI — The U.S. Postal Service said on Wednesday it would accept parcels from China and Hong Kong, in a U-turn after a suspension following President Donald Trump ending a trade provision used by retailers including Temu, Shein, and Amazon AMZN.O to ship low-value packages duty-free to the U.S. 


"The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery," it said in a statement. 


The Trump administration imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods and closed the "de minimis" exemption that allows U.S. shoppers to avoid paying tariffs for shipments below $800 from China. 


USPS did not immediately comment on whether its temporary suspension had been tied to Trump's order ending de minimis shipments from China, which was announced on Saturday and came into force from one minute past midnight on Tuesday. 


"There has really been absolutely zero time for anyone to prepare for this," said Maureen Cori, co-founder at New York-based consultancy Supply Chain Compliance. "What we really need is direction from the government on how to handle this without warning or notice." 


Currently, de minimis parcels are consolidated so that customs can clear hundreds or thousands of shipments at once, but they will now require individual clearances, significantly increasing the burden for postal services, brokers and customs agents, said Cori.

## Decorated pilot Harry Stewart, Jr., one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, dies at 100

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, a decorated World War II pilot who broke racial barriers as a Tuskegee Airmen and earned honors for his combat heroism, has died. He was 100.


Stewart was one of the last surviving combat pilots of the famed 332nd Fighter Group also known as the Tuskegee Airmen. They were the nation’s first Black military pilots.


The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his death. The organization said he died peacefully at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on Sunday.


Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945. He was also part of a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying competition in 1949, although their accomplishment would not be recognized until decades later.


“Harry Stewart was a kind man of profound character and accomplishment with a distinguished career of service he continued long after fighting for our country in World War II,” Brian Smith, president and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, said.


Born on July 4, 1924, in Virginia, his family moved to New York when he was young. Stewart had dreamed of flying since he was a child when he would watch planes at LaGuardia airport, according to a book about his life titled “Soaring to Glory: A Tuskegee Airmen’s Firsthand Account of World War II.” In the wake of Pearl Harbor, an 18-year-old Stewart joined what was then considered an experiment to train Black military pilots. The unit sometimes was also known as the Tuskegee Airmen for where they trained in Alabama or the Red Tails because of the red tips of their P-51 Mustangs.


“I did not recognize at the time the gravity of what we are facing. I just felt as though it was a duty of mine at the time. I just stood up to my duty,” Stewart said of World War II in a 2024 interview with CNN about the war.


Having grown up in a multicultural neighborhood, the segregation and prejudice of the Jim Crow-era South came as a shock to Stewart, but he was determined to finish and earn his wings according to the book about his life. After finishing training, the pilots were assigned to escort U.S. bombers in Europe. The Tuskegee Airmen are credited with losing significantly fewer escorted bombers than other fighter groups.


“I got to really enjoy the idea of the panorama, I would say, of the scene I would see before me with the hundreds of bombers and the hundreds of fighter planes up there and all of them pulling the condensation trails, and it was just the ballet in the sky and a feeling of belonging to something that was really big,” Stewart said in a 2020 interview with WAMC.


Stewart would sometimes say in a self-effacing way that he was too busy enjoying flying to realize he was making history, according to his book.


Stewart had hoped to become a commercial airline pilot after he left the military, but was rejected because of his race. He went on to earn a mechanical engineering degree at New York University. He relocated to Detroit and retired as vice president of a natural gas pipeline company.


Stewart told Michigan Public Radio in 2019 that he was moved to tears on a recent commercial flight when he saw who was piloting the aircraft.


“When I entered the plane, I looked into the cockpit there and there were two African American pilots. One was the co-pilot, and one was the pilot. But not only that, the thing that started bringing the tears to my eyes is that they were both female,” Stewart said.


The Air Force last month briefly removed training courses with videos of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs in an effort to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The materials were quickly restored following a bipartisan backlash.

## Trump says US will take ownership of war-torn Gaza

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the U.S. to take ownership of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements of forcing Gazans to relocate to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. Trump made the stunning announcement Tuesday evening, as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has this report.

## Trump says US will take ownership of Gaza

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the United States to take ownership of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements of forcing Palestinians in the war-torn enclave to relocate to neighboring Jordan and Egypt.


“The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,” he said during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Tuesday evening.


In recent days hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the southern parts of Gaza have marched north toward their homes after Israel allowed people to return as part of the ceasefire for a hostage release deal with Hamas.


Trump said he wants to develop the area into what he calls “the Riviera of the Middle East.”




“Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent, in a really magnificent area,” he said.


Netanyahu said one of his war goals is to ensure that Hamas never poses a threat to Israel again. But Trump, Netanyahu said, is “taking it to a much higher level.”


“I think it’s something that could change history, and it’s worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,” he added.


Trump did not share details on how he plans to exert control over the area ravaged by 15 months of war, but he did not rule out sending U.S. troops.


“If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece, and we’re going to develop it,” he said.




Trump’s comments mark a remarkable shift from his criticism of America’s involvement in Middle East conflicts. He sees a “long-term ownership position,” for the U.S. that would bring “great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.”


“This was not a decision made lightly,” he said.


However, any discussion of relocation will certainly be met with resistance from Palestinians. Hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes in what is now called Israel: in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and during Israel’s 1967 seizure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.


There are currently 2.1 million people in Gaza, according to the United Nations.




The Palestinian Authority said Wednesday that Trump’s proposal would be “a serious violation of international law.”


Egypt’s Foreign Ministry also expressed opposition, highlighting the need to carry out post-war reconstruction “without moving the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.”


China, Australia, Turkey and France all backed the need to pursue a two-state solution for peace in the region.


It’s unclear how occupying Gaza would fit into Trump’s own stated goal of expanding the Abraham Accords to include Riyadh. He brokered the deal that normalized ties between Israel and Arab countries in 2020.


Saudi Arabia quickly reacted to Trump’s Gaza comments by saying it will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state, and that its position is nonnegotiable.


“The kingdom of Saudi Arabia also stresses what it had previously announced regarding its absolute rejection of infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their land,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement.


Trump’s statement on Gaza is his latest signaling of expansionist ambitions, following his statements to acquire Greenland from Denmark, taking over the Panama Canal, and absorbing Canada.


Ceasefire renegotiation


Speaking to reporters at the White House earlier Tuesday, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration has begun negotiations toward Phase 2 of the three-phase ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the territory.




Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.


Witkoff suggested that the administration is considering renegotiating parts of the agreement that took effect on Jan. 19, the day before Trump was inaugurated.


“Part of the problem is that it wasn’t such a wonderful agreement that was first signed. That was not dictated by the Trump administration. We had nothing to do with it,” he said. “Now we’re working within that rubric, and we’re figuring things out.”


He doubled down on Trump’s suggestion to remove Gazans, saying that the five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza as outlined in phase three is “physically impossible.”


Trump’s insistence on relocating Gazans could signal a desire to renegotiate the ceasefire deal, particularly the second phase, said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.


“The goal might be to force Hamas into choosing between relinquishing control of Gaza or leaving the Strip if it wants an Israeli withdrawal or reconstruction, or risk the entirety of the population facing forcible removal, though how that would be carried out is unknown,” he told VOA.


Also Tuesday, Trump ended support for the UN agency that helps Palestinian refugees and withdrew the U.S. from what he calls the antisemitic UN Human Rights Council.


Iran nuclear


Shortly before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump directed his aides to restore his "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran to prevent it from getting a nuclear weapon and to drive down its oil exports to zero.


“I'm unhappy to do it, but I really have not so much choice, because we have to be strong and firm, and I hope that it's not going to have to be used in any great measure at all,” he said. “It's very simple. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”




As of September 2024, U.S. intelligence concluded in a report that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. However, Iran has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses,” the report said.


In November, the Justice Department under the Biden administration announced that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential election had been thwarted. Trump said he has directed his aides to “obliterate” Tehran if the Iranian regime moves to assassinate him.


“If they did that they would be obliterated,” Trump said. “I’ve left instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be anything left.”


Pressure on Netanyahu


Trump’s meeting with Netanyahu comes as the Israeli leader faces pressure from his right-wing coalition to end the ceasefire.


Both Trump and Netanyahu share the goal of ending Hamas’ rule in Gaza and return the remaining Israeli hostages, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University. However, the two men place different priorities on different aspects of the goal.


For Netanyahu, the priority is to ensure Hamas has no political future, Rynhold told VOA, while for Trump it’s to maintain the ceasefire “so that he can move to an Israeli-Saudi Arabian normalization agreement.”


U.S. administrations under Presidents George W. Bush to Joe Biden have stated their support for Palestinian statehood under the two-state solution. In 2020 during his first term, Trump announced his Middle East peace plan that would deny Palestinians having their own state.


Trump was non-committal when asked Tuesday whether he supports the two-state solution. His plan on Gaza “doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one-state or any other state,” he said.


The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 Hamas militants.

## Senate confirms Pam Bondi as US attorney general

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as U.S. attorney general on Tuesday evening.


The vote fell almost entirely along party lines, with only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, joining with all Republicans to pass her confirmation 54-46.


Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is expected to oversee a radical reshaping of the department that has been the target of Trump's ire over the criminal cases it brought against him. She enters with the FBI, which she will oversee, in turmoil over the scrutiny of agents involved in investigations related to the president, who has made clear his desire to seek revenge on his perceived adversaries.


Republicans have praised Bondi as a highly qualified leader they contend will bring much-needed change to a department they believe unfairly pursued Trump through investigations resulting in two indictments.


"Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to their safety and their freedoms," said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.


But Bondi has faced intense scrutiny over her close relationship with the president, who during his term fired an FBI director who refused to pledge loyalty to him and forced out an attorney general who recused himself from the Justice Department's investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign.


While Bondi has sought to reassure Democrats that politics would play no part in her decision-making, she also refused at her confirmation hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump's adversaries. And she has repeated Trump's claims that the prosecutions against him amounted to political persecution, saying the Justice Department "had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it's got to stop."


Bondi's confirmation vote came just hours after FBI agents sued the Justice Department over efforts to develop a list of employees involved in the January 6 prosecutions, which agents fear could be a precursor to mass firings.


Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week ordered the acting FBI director to provide the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on the January 6 cases — which Trump has described as a "grave national injustice." Bove, who defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would carry out a "review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary."


Justice Department officials have also recently forced out senior FBI executives, fired prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team who investigated Trump and terminated a group of prosecutors in the District of Columbia’s U.S. attorney's office who were hired to help with the massive Jan. 6 investigation.


Bondi repeatedly stressed at her confirmation hearing that she would not pursue anyone for political reasons, and vowed that the public, not the president, would be her client. But her answers at times echoed Trump's campaign rhetoric about a politicized justice system.

## 'High threat' undocumented migrants sent to Guantanamo

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — A small number of migrants were transferred from Texas to a detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Tuesday via U.S. military aircraft, U.S. defense officials told VOA.


Fewer than 20 migrants, which the administration has deemed to be "high threat," are being transported on the first C-17 flight from Fort Bliss, one defense official said, speaking to VOA on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, before the flight landed in Cuba.


U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military cargo plane, calling them “the worst of the worst,” and warning the effort to deport them is just getting started.


The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on the military flight from Texas to Guantanamo Bay were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody.


The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.




Since President Donald Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News.


"The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead federal agency," U.S. Southern Command, which overseas operations in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a statement on Monday.


The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban.


"If you're a violent gang banger, and you've been taken out of our country, and we're waiting to bring you to your country, we're going to put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida," Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Fox News this week.


In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold up to 30,000 migrants.


"Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So, we're going to send them out to Guantanamo," Trump said.


Closing Guantanamo


Democratic administrations under Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001.


Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human rights catastrophe.


"The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility," Hendrickson said.


At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon.


Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.

## Analysts: American Iron Dome reduces nuclear coercion but drives arms race

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to build an American version of the Iron Dome to shield the U.S. from aerial attacks will deter China and Russia from coercing the U.S. using nuclear weapons but could drive a three-way arms race, said analysts.  

 

The U.S. government’s Missile Defense Agency on Friday asked the defense industry to identify technologies and capabilities available to construct the Iron Dome for America. The deadline is the end of February.

 

It made the request in response to Trump’s executive order signed on Jan. 27, setting forth a motion to build an American Iron Dome.

 

“The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield,” the executive order stated.


The American Iron Dome will defend the U.S. “against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries,” according to the statement.


It will ensure the U.S. has “its second-strike capability,” meaning it would be able to launch nuclear retaliation.


The Iron Dome would also include a review of missile defense posture to identify ways for U.S. allies and partners to increase cooperation on missile defense development and operations.


Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to draw up a plan in the next three months to build the missile shield.


Strengthening deterrence


Robert Peters, research fellow for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile Defense at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday via phone, the Iron Dome for America “will take away the option for nuclear coercion that an actor could try to hold over the U.S.” in addition to defending the U.S. from an actual strike.


“It is feasible for us to build an Iron Dome,” he said, “and there is no reason why we should not do so, particularly given that we are seeing the autocrats in North Korea, China, and Russia engaging in nuclear coercion.”


Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons multiple times during an ongoing war in Ukraine that began with its invasion in 2022.


In November, Putin revised the Russian threshold for using nuclear weapons in a doctrine issued after former U.S. President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-made longer-range missiles.


The doctrine announced that Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons to respond to a conventional weapons attack. Previously, Russia reserved the right to use nuclear weapons only when an attack threatened its existence.


Patrycja Bazylczyk, a research associate for the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “If implemented well, an ‘iron dome for America’ could bolster American defense and affect the strategic calculus of our adversaries.”


She told VOA on Monday, “Improving homeland air and missile defenses reduces the confidence of a potential attacker, thereby raising the threshold for attack and contributing to deterrence.”


The Iron Dome plan resembles former President Ronald Reagon's proposed dual objective of Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and nuclear disarmament, said Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).


The SDI, also came to be called Star Wars, was announced in 1983 to develop a space-based defense system to protect the U.S. from nuclear missiles.


Risk of arms race


Trump's "Iron Dome initiative, to some extent, echoes his concern about nuclear weapons," but "a stronger U.S. missile defense system would almost certainly make it more difficult to reach a nuclear agreement with Russia and China because of their concern that more effective missile defenses would increase the threat to their nuclear retaliatory capability," continued Kristensen.  


Trump said in a video message to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 23 that he wants to discuss "denuclearization" with Russia, and that China would need to come along.


Kristensen told VOA on Thursday that "FAS applauds Trump's remarks about the need for nuclear limits and eventually denuclearization and urge the administration to pursue these goals."


He added, "Nuclear deterrence can be maintained with far fewer nuclear weapons" and having nuclear reduction talks is "urgent because the New START treaty expires in about one year."


The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia, is set to expire in February 2026.


Daryl Kimball, executive director of Arms Control Association, told VOA on Friday Trump envisions "more ambitious system to thwart strategic missile attacks by Russia or China" than his efforts in 2019.


"It is not realistic to believe that an effective system would be feasible anytime soon, if ever, mainly because adversaries will respond by seeking to overwhelm missile defense systems in order to maintain their own capacity to deter U.S. conventional or nuclear attack," he said.


Kimball added, however, "We welcome Trump's interest in negotiating agreements with Russia and China to reduce the 'tremendous' costs of nuclear weapons by reducing or 'denuclearizing' with Russia and China. Without such a deal, we could see a costly three-way offensive nuclear arms races that no one can win."


The U.S. has about 5,044 nuclear warheads while Russia has over, 5,500 and China has approximately 500 nuclear warheads, according to the FAS.  


The Pentagon in its annual report released in December on China's military estimates that China will have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030.


North Korea, through its state-run KCNA, on Monday expressed opposition to the U.S. plan to build the Iron Dome, describing it as a “hegemonic attempt to maintain its military supremacy.”


The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA on Monday that it does not have any comments on the issue at this time.


A top Russia diplomat quoted by the state news agency Tass on Thursday said America’s Iron Dome “puts an end to the prospects of strategic offensive arms reduction on nuclear and missile arsenals in favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase.”


Richard Weitz, director for the Center for Political-Military Analysis at Hudson Institute, said, “The Russians and Chinese have always said that if the U.S. builds better defenses, they’re going to build better offenses so they can overcome these defenses.”


He told VOA on Thursday, the Iron Dome effort, along with Trump’s interest in having nuclear reduction talks with China and Russia, aims to reduce overall threats to the U.S., but it would be difficult to get China on board denuclearization talks.

## US judge blocks Trump from sending transgender women to men's prisons

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from moving transgender women to men's prisons and ending their gender-affirming care.


In a broad ruling temporarily halting an executive order that Trump, a Republican, signed on his first day back in office on Jan. 20, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington found that three transgender inmates who sued would likely succeed in arguing the policy was unconstitutional.


The decision marked the second time that a federal judge had sided with LGBTQ+ legal rights groups who sued to prevent the U.S. Bureau of Prisons from implementing the order.


Lamberth's order applies to all 16 transgender women currently housed in federal women's prisons. It goes further than a Jan. 26 decision by a federal judge in Boston blocking prison officials from transferring an individual transgender woman to a men's facility.


A spokesperson for the Justice Department, which defended the Trump administration in court, declined to comment. The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


The three transgender women who brought the Washington case argued transgender women would face violence and sexual assault in men's prisons, which would violate their right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.


U.S. Justice Department attorney John Robinson had argued that the Bureau of Prisons has broad authority to make inmate placement decisions. He urged Lamberth, an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, to wait for the agency to revise its policies before issuing any order compelling the continuation of medical treatment.


In his decision, Lamberth wrote that the government did not dispute the plaintiffs' assertion that transgender persons were at a higher risk of physical and sexual violence than other inmates when housed in a facility corresponding to their biological sex.


Trump's executive order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; house transgender women in men's prisons; and cease funding for any gender-affirming medical care for inmates.


Prior to Trump's order, the Bureau of Prisons had been operating under guidelines adopted in 2022 during Democratic former President Joe Biden's tenure requiring prisons to consider inmates' "current gender expression" when deciding where to house them.


Biden's policy was a reversal from earlier guidance during Trump's first term.


The lawsuit filed on Jan. 30 also argued that Trump's executive order discriminates against transgender people on the basis of sex in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment.


About 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial facilities and halfway houses, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. About two thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of whom are housed in men's prisons.

## Trump takes aim at new South African land expropriation law

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump has taken aim at a new South African law meant to address the nation’s apartheid legacy of racially unequal land distribution, threatening to withdraw funding, including to the world’s largest HIV treatment program.


Africa observers told VOA on Tuesday that some members of the U.S. Congress have jumped on this grievance to “upend the status quo in U.S.-South Africa relations as a response."


Trump fired the first volley Sunday night, in a post on his social media site.


“South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,” Trump wrote. He continued to describe the situation as “a massive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum.”


South African politicians — both the supporters and the opponents of the newly inked Expropriation Act that Trump was referring to — quickly fired back at his description of the new law, which repeals apartheid-era legislation to align land distribution with the nation’s progressive constitution.


Under the apartheid system, laws such as the 1913 Natives Land Act severely restricted Black land ownership. Other now-defunct laws determined where members of the nation’s Black majority could travel or live, what public facilities they could use, and whom they could marry.


Apartheid also denied full citizenship rights to Black people until its fall in the early 1990s. Black people first gained the right to vote in the 1994 elections that ushered in democratic rule.


“South Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement this week. “We look forward to engaging with the Trump administration over our land reform policy and issues of bilateral interest. We are certain that out of those engagements, we will share a better and common understanding over these matters.”


The new law allows for limited cases of land expropriation without compensation, and that clause alone provoked years of public consultations and debate in South African parliament and civil society before it was adopted recently by the nation’s newly sworn-in coalition government.


In her article on the website The Conversation, law professor Zsa-Zsa Temmers Boggenpoel of Stellenbosch University explained the move as “a potential tool to reduce land inequality.”


“This has become a matter of increasing urgency,” she wrote. “South Africans have expressed impatience with the slow pace of land reform.”


A government land audit in 2017 found that 72% of the country's farms and agricultural holdings were white-owned.


“I am not convinced that the act, in its current form, is the silver bullet to effect large-scale land reform — at least not the type of radical land reform that South Africa urgently needs," Boggenpoel wrote. "Understandably, the act will have a severe impact on property rights. But it still substantially protects landowners affected by expropriation. Only in very limited cases would they not be compensated.”


South Africa's opposition parties stood against the new law.


After the bill was signed last month, opposition party ActionSA , which vowed to pursue legal action, said in a statement, “While other parties assert that this bill does not compromise the ‘willing buyer, willing seller doctrine,’ it ultimately allows the government to unilaterally set the price if an agreement cannot be reached.”


The center-right Democratic Alliance party not only strenuously opposed the new law — along with ActionSA and the pro-Afrikaner Freedom Front Plus party — it also objected to Trump’s characterization, calling it “unfortunate.”


“It would be a tragedy if this funding were terminated because of a misunderstanding of the facts,” the party said in a statement. It continued: “It is not true that the Act allows land to be seized by the state arbitrarily, and it does require fair compensation for legitimate expropriations in terms of Section 25 of the Constitution.”


But these nuances may not be seized upon by the U.S. Congress, which has bristled at some of Pretoria’s moves — not least, the nation’s decision to pursue a genocide case against Israel at the U.N.’s highest court, said Michael Walsh, an Africa analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute,


The U.S. strenuously opposed South Africa’s petition to the court in late 2023, with the White House telling VOA the case was “without merit.”


“My key takeaway was [Trump's] reference to massive human rights violations,” Walsh told VOA. “That terminology will play into the hands of those interest groups who have been pushing for Magnitsky sanctions to be imposed on ANC and EFF officials prior to the G20 Johannesburg Summit," he added, referring to the African National Congress, Ramaphosa's party, and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters.


The 2012 Magnitsky Act allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on human rights violators.


"Many South African experts have assumed that any Magnitsky sanctions would be based on acts of corruption," Walsh said. "However, members of Congress are considering Magnitsky sanctions on the grounds of human rights violations as well.”


This all sets up the scene, he said, for a diplomatic showdown when world leaders converge in Johannesburg in November for the summit of G20 nations.


Host nation South Africa has set the agenda for that meeting of the world’s top 20 economies to include two issues that don’t jibe with Trump’s isolationist, pro-energy exploration, America-first approach: mobilizing climate financing and increasing debt relief for developing countries.

## US Treasury says Musk team has 'read-only access' to payment data

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday that Elon Musk's government-efficiency team has been granted "read-only access" to its payment system codes and denied that this cut off any government payments including for Social Security or Medicare.  


The confirmation of a Musk associate's access to the system codes came in a letter from a Treasury official to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden. The letters said the review was being undertaken to "maximize payment integrity for agencies and the public." 


Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has not commented on reports in recent days that Musk's informal Department of Government Efficiency had gained access to the system responsible for disbursing more than $6 trillion of annual government spending.  


Several thousand people gathered outside the Treasury on Tuesday to protest DOGE's Treasury access amid his sweeping incursion into government operations, which this week led to the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, merging its aid mission into the State Department. 




The payment system review "is not resulting in the suspension or rejection of any payment instructions submitted to Treasury by other federal agencies across the government," Jonathan Blum, principal deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Legislative Affairs wrote to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon.  


The DOGE team at Treasury conducting the review is led by technology firm chief executive Tom Krause, whom the letter described as a "Treasury employee." Krause is CEO of Cloud Software Group, which owns former independent software firms Citrix and Tibco. 


Wyden raised alarms over the weekend when reports first surfaced that a team under the direction of Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump to conduct a broad review of government operations, was at the Treasury.  


"I'm sure the Treasury Secretary and the president want to save face and downplay the risks as Elon Musk seizes power, but nothing they're saying is believable or trustworthy," Wyden said in response to Blum's letter. 


Outside the Treasury, protesters waved placards with slogans including: "Nobody Elected Musk" and "Bessent, you have 1 job!! Protect our money. You already failed." 


About three dozen Democratic members of the Senate and House of Representatives tried to enter the Treasury to confront Bessent on the issue but they said they were denied access. 


Rebecca Weiss, who lives in suburban Maryland, told Reuters that she attended the protest because she is worried about what Musk will do with the payments data. 


"He's obviously a data guy, and now he has access, potentially, to everybody's personal identifiable information, which he might take advantage of for his business purposes," she said. "The bottom line is, we didn't elect him."

## Trump reimposes 'maximum pressure' on Iran, aims to drive oil exports to zero

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday restored his "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.


Ahead of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump signed the presidential memorandum reimposing Washington's tough policy on Iran that was practiced throughout his first term.


As he signed the memo, Trump described it as very tough and said he was torn on whether to make the move. He said he was open to a deal with Iran and expressed a willingness to talk to the Iranian leader.


"With me, it's very simple: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon," Trump said. Asked how close Tehran is to a weapon, Trump said: "They're too close."


Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


Iran is accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters in December. Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon.


Trump's memo, among other things, orders the U.S. Treasury secretary to impose "maximum economic pressure" on Iran, including sanctions and enforcement mechanisms on those violating existing sanctions.


It also directs the Treasury and State Department to implement a campaign aimed at "driving Iran's oil exports to zero." U.S. oil prices pared losses on Tuesday on the news that Trump planned to sign the memo.


Tehran's oil exports brought in $53 billion in 2023 and $54 billion a year earlier, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates. Output during 2024 was running at its highest level since 2018, based on OPEC data.


Trump had driven Iran's oil exports to near-zero during part of his first term after re-imposing sanctions. They rose under Biden's tenure as Iran succeeded in evading sanctions.


The Paris-based International Energy Agency believes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other OPEC members have spare capacity to make up for any lost exports from Iran, also an OPEC member.


China does not recognize U.S. sanctions and Chinese firms buy the most Iranian oil. China and Iran have also built a trading system that uses mostly Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding the dollar and exposure to U.S. regulators.


Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy, said the Trump administration could enforce the 2024 Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum (SHIP) law to curtail some Iranian barrels.


SHIP, which the Biden administration did not enforce strictly, allows measures on foreign ports and refineries that process petroleum exported from Iran in violation of sanctions. Book said a move last month by the Shandong Port Group to ban U.S.-sanctioned tankers from calling into its ports in the eastern Chinese province signals the impact SHIP could have.


Trump also directed his U.N. ambassador to work with allies to "complete the snapback of international sanctions and restrictions on Iran," under a 2015 deal between Iran and key world powers that lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program.


Britain, France and Germany told the United Nations Security Council in December that they are ready — if necessary — to trigger a snapback of all international sanctions on Iran to prevent the country from acquiring a nuclear weapon.


They will lose the ability to take such action on October 18 when a 2015 U.N. resolution expires. The resolution enshrines Iran's deal with Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China that lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.


Iran's U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, has said that invoking the "snap-back" of sanctions on Tehran would be "unlawful and counterproductive."


European and Iranian diplomats met in November and January to discuss if they could work to defuse regional tensions, including over Tehran's nuclear program, before Trump returned.

## Former Google engineer faces new US charges he stole AI secrets for Chinese companies

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled an expanded 14-count indictment accusing former Google software engineer Linwei Ding of stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets to benefit two Chinese companies he was secretly working for. 


Ding, 38, a Chinese national, was charged by a federal grand jury in San Francisco with seven counts each of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. 


Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum 10-year term and $250,000 fine. 


The defendant, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on four counts of theft of trade secrets. He is free on bond. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 


Ding's case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden administration. 


The initiative was designed to help stop advanced technology from being acquired by countries such as China and Russia or potentially threatening national security. 


Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware infrastructure and software platform that lets Google's supercomputing data centers train large AI models. 


Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give Google an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon and Microsoft, which design their own, and reduce Google's reliance on chips from Nvidia. 


Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts three years later when he was being courted to join an early-stage Chinese technology company. 


Ding allegedly uploaded more than 1,000 confidential files by May 2023 and later circulated a PowerPoint presentation to employees of a China startup he founded, saying that country's policies encouraged development of a domestic AI industry. 


Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law enforcement. 


According to court records describing a December 18 hearing, prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed a "potential resolution" to Ding's case, "but anticipate the matter proceeding to trial." 


The case is U.S. v. Ding, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 24-cr-00141.

## Trump orders target several UN bodies

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stopped U.S. engagement with the U.N. Human Rights Council, extended a halt to funding for the Palestinian relief agency UNRWA and ordered a review of the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO.


"It's got great potential and based on the potential we'll continue to go along with it, but they got to get their act together," Trump told reporters. "It's not being well run, to be honest and they're not doing the job.


"A lot of these conflicts that we're working on should be settled, or at least we should have some help in settling them. We never seem to get help. That should be the primary purpose of the United Nations," the U.S. president said.


U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, "From day one, U.S. support for the United Nations has saved countless lives and advanced global security."


"The secretary-general looks forward to continuing his productive relationship with President Trump and the U.S. government to strengthen that relationship in today's turbulent world."


Trump said that he was not looking to take away money from the 193-member world body, though he complained that Washington had to pay a disproportionate amount.


Washington is the U.N.'s largest contributor - followed by China - accounting for 22% of the core U.N. budget and 27% of the peacekeeping budget. The U.N. has said the U.S. currently owes a total of $2.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion is for the regular budget. These payments are not voluntary.


UNRWA


Trump's order on Tuesday was largely symbolic and mirrored moves he made during his first term in office, from 2017-2021.


Since taking office for a second term on Jan. 20, Trump has ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the World Health Organization and from the Paris climate agreement - also steps he took during his first term in office.


The U.S. was UNRWA's biggest donor - providing $300 million-$400 million a year - but former President Joe Biden paused funding in January 2024 after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA staff of taking part in the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Palestinian militants Hamas that triggered the war in Gaza.


The U.S. Congress then formally suspended contributions to UNRWA until at least March 2025. UNRWA provides aid, health and education services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.


The United Nations has said that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and were fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed in September by Israel - was also found to have had a UNRWA job. The U.N. has vowed to investigate all accusations made and repeatedly asked Israel for evidence, which it says has not been provided.


Human Rights Council


The first Trump administration also quit the 47-member Human Rights Council halfway through a three-year term over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform. The U.S. is not currently a member of the Geneva-based body. Under Biden, the U.S. was re-elected and served a 2022-2024 term.


A council working group is due to review the U.S. human rights record later this year, a process all countries undergo every few years. While the council has no legally binding power, its debates carry political weight and criticism can raise global pressure on governments to change course.


Trump's executive order on Tuesday also asks Secretary of State Marco Rubio to review and report back to him on international organizations, conventions, or treaties that "promote radical or anti-American sentiment."


He specified that the U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) should be reviewed first because Washington had previously accused it of anti-Israel bias.

## The migrant workforce under Trump

date: 2025-02-05, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate the role immigrant workers play in the U.S. economy. Key industries rely on them — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/23/trump-deportation-plans-food-system-00200013">nearly half</a> of meat-processing jobs, for instance, are held by immigrants. And many work in low-wage jobs that are vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ted Genoways, a reporter with the Food and Environment Reporting Network, said Trump&#8217;s promises of mass deportations is creating fear and uncertainty for immigrant workers, both authorized and unauthorized, as well as for the massive food companies that employ them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&#8220;If history is any guide, this will probably mean increased food prices, if only for companies trying to hedge against the possibility of something disastrous happening,&#8221; said Genoways.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On today&#8217;s show, Genoways gives us a snapshot of the low-wage immigrant workforce&#8217;s role in our economy and unpacks how Trump&#8217;s deportation plans could disrupt America&#8217;s food supply. Plus, why aren&#8217;t food companies held accountable for exploiting their employees?</p>

## Congressional Democrats to Trump: Changes can't be done in secrecy

date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA

Congressional Democratic leadership warned President Donald Trump on Tuesday that they would use upcoming government funding talks as leverage to fight the administration's changes in U.S. government agencies.


Democrats' warnings come as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, moved the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under the control of the U.S. State Department earlier this week. The administration has said they are reviewing USAID’s foreign assistance activities to "ensure it is in alignment with an America First agenda.”


"Whatever DOGE is doing, it's not democracy," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Tuesday. "We know what democracy looks like. It's out in the open. It's not secret."


Democrats could push back on some of the most recent changes in the U.S. government by withholding votes on a new spending bill. A short-term continuing resolution keeping the government running is set to expire on March 14.


On Monday, congressional Democrats protested outside closed USAID offices, saying the Trump administration had overreached its authority.


"If you want to change an agency, introduce a bill and pass a law," Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said. "You cannot wave away an agency that you don't like or that you disagree with by executive order, or by literally storming into the building and taking over the servers. That is not how the American system of government works."


USAID manages tens of billions of dollars in U.S. foreign assistance programs.


"The Constitution requires that the funding be spent by the president and the administration," House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. "The Constitution requires the president has a responsibility to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. Spending agreements passed through the appropriations process are law, and when those laws are violated, the Constitution is being violated, which is why there has been a flurry of righteous litigation that has been unleashed."


Congressional Republicans have expressed support for attempts to weed out fraud and abuse in the U.S. aid system.


"I don't think they're closing an agency, but I do think they have the right to review funding and how those decisions are made and what priorities are being funded," Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday. "I think that's probably true of any administration. When they come in, there are lots of programs authorized and funded through that agency, some which I think are operating the way in which they were intended, some which aren't."


The White House criticized USAID-funded projects supporting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and other efforts it argues are a waste of taxpayer funds.


"If there's massive fraud, if the funds aren't being directed to where the Congress has appropriated and the president has signed, then we need to know about that," Roger Wicker, the Senate Armed Services chairman, told American news networks CNN and CBS Monday.


"I have felt for a long time that USAID is our way to combat the Belt and Road Initiative, which is China's effort to really gain influence around the world, including Africa and South America and the Western Hemisphere," Wicker continued. "So we need an aid program to match the Chinese effort, but it needs to be done in a way that the policymakers of the United States have decided ought to be done."

## VOA Mandarin: Trump wants 'Iron Dome' for US; can it work?

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order to establish a nationwide "Iron Dome" missile defense system has sparked debate over its feasibility, funding, and strategic implications. Unlike Israel's Iron Dome, which intercepts short-range rockets, Trump's plan aims to defend against intercontinental ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and hypersonic weapons.

## Rubio pledges US support for Costa Rica's fight against cyberattacks, drug trafficking

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday pledged U.S. support to bolster Costa Rica's cybersecurity defenses, 5G telecommunications infrastructure, and its battle against narcotics.


Rubio made the statement at a joint press conference with Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves, whose Central American nation faces more than 100 million cyberattacks annually.


"It's very serious — 110 million cyberattacks a year for a country of this size — it's extraordinary, and they have faced it very bravely," Rubio told reporters in San Jose, Costa Rica's capital.


In late 2024, local media reported that Costa Rican officials, in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, identified cyber intrusions by criminal groups in China targeting the country's telecommunications and technology system, an allegation the Chinese Embassy in Costa Rica denied.


In August 2023, Chaves issued a decree regulating 5G mobile network development, limiting involvement to companies based in signatory-states to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime — an international treaty addressing cybercrime.


San Jose should be lauded for being "very firm," Rubio said, against companies "backed by governments like the government of China that likes to threaten, that likes to sabotage, that likes to use economic coercion to punish you."


VOA has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment but has not yet received a response.


US aid waiver 


Rubio also vowed that Washington wouldn't "eliminate foreign aid" but prioritize assistance for trusted partners and allies. He pledged continued cooperation with Costa Rica, offering FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration support to investigate drug trafficking to the U.S.


"We issued a waiver today because Costa Rica" has used U.S. aid effectively to fix problems that also benefit the United States, Rubio said. "They're stopping drugs, they're stopping criminals, they're identifying terrorists."


The State Department's Office of Foreign Assistance has not responded to VOA's inquiry for further details on the waiver.


Rubio's five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean marks his first major diplomatic mission as secretary of state, with key priorities including curbing illegal immigration into the U.S. and combating drug trafficking.


On Tuesday afternoon, the secretary arrived in Guatemala following discussions with leaders from Panama, El Salvador and Costa Rica. He is scheduled to travel to the Dominican Republic on Wednesday.

## Senate committee advances Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nomination to be health secretary

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the controversial environmental lawyer turned public health critic, cleared his first hurdle on Tuesday to become the nation's top health official when the senate finance committee voted to advance his nomination for a floor vote. 


Republicans voted together to advance his nomination, while Democrats all opposed. 


His nomination now will face a full senate vote, despite concerns about the work he's done to sow doubts around vaccine safety and his potential to profit off lawsuits over drugmakers. 


To gain control of the $1.7 trillion Health and Human Services agency, Kennedy will need support from all but three Republicans if Democrats uniformly oppose him. 


Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is also a physician and sits on the finance committee, voted to advance Kennedy's confirmation. Last week, during Kennedy's hearings, Cassidy repeatedly implored Kennedy to reject a disproven theory that vaccines cause autism, to no avail. He ended the hearing by saying he was "struggling" with the vote. 


"Your past, undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments, concerns me," Cassidy told Kennedy. 


Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are all seen as potential no votes, too, because they voted against President Donald Trump's defense secretary nominee and have expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. 


In a CBS "60 Minutes" interview that aired Sunday, McConnell declined to say how he would vote on Kennedy's nomination but reiterated "vaccines are critically important." 


Democrats, meanwhile, continue to raise alarms about Kennedy's potential to financially benefit from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers if confirmed as health secretary. 


"It seems possible that many different types of vaccine-related decisions and communications — which you would be empowered to make and influence as Secretary — could result in significant financial compensation for your family," Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote in a letter sent over the weekend to Kennedy. 


Kennedy said he'll give his son all of the referral fees in legal cases against vaccine makers, including the fees he gets from referring clients in a case against Merck. Kennedy told the committee he's referred hundreds of clients to a law firm that's suing Merck's Gardasil, the human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical cancer. He's earned $2.5 million from the deal over the past three years. 


As secretary, Kennedy will oversee vaccine recommendations and public health campaigns for the $1.7 trillion agency, which is also responsible for food and hospital inspections, providing health insurance for millions of Americans and researching deadly diseases. 


Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, ran for president but withdrew last year to throw his support to Trump in exchange for an influential job in his Republican administration. Together, they have forged a new and unusual coalition made up of conservatives who oppose vaccines and liberals who want to see the government promote healthier foods. Trump and Kennedy have branded the movement as "Make America Healthy Again."

The analysis, from the Energy Transitions Commission, proposes three main priorities that need to be tackled: </p><ul><li><strong>Electrifying heating and cooking </strong>by swapping out fossil fuel-based appliances. Doing this comprehensively by 2050 could “bring annual emissions from building use close to zero” if we manage to decarbonize the grid.</li><li><strong>Boosting energy efficiency of appliances.</strong> Demand for heat pumps and air conditioners will rise as the planet heats up, so we need to find ways of squeezing more from these technologies while using less energy. That includes making our buildings more energy efficient in general.</li><li><strong>Decarbonizing construction </strong>by finding low-carbon ways to make building materials like steel and concrete, and using fewer building materials overall. We should also be better utilizing the buildings we already have. </li></ul><p>“This will require collaboration right across sector, between governments, industry bodies, and private companies,” said Stephen Hill, a sustainability and building performance expert at building design firm Arup. “We need to be ambitious, but if we get it right we can cut carbon, generate value for our economy, and improve people’s quality of life through action like improving living conditions and reducing fuel poverty.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Taliban threaten to use US arms to thwart attempts to retake them

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

ISLAMABAD  — The Taliban have warned that the military weapons left behind by the United States in Afghanistan now belong to them as "spoils of war" and will be utilized to defend against any attempts to reclaim them. 

 

The statement marks the first official response from the internationally unrecognized government in Kabul to President Donald Trump’s pledge on the eve of his Jan. 20 inauguration to retrieve U.S. arms from the de facto Islamist Afghan leaders.  

 




“The weapons that America abandoned in Afghanistan, as well as those provided to the former Afghan regime, are now in the possession of the Mujahideen [or Taliban forces] as spoils of war,” claimed Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, while participating in an X space session late on Monday.  

 

“The Afghan people now own these weapons and are utilizing them to defend their independence, sovereignty, and Islamic system. No external force can compel us to surrender these weapons, nor will we accept any demands for their surrender,” Mujahid stated. “We will use these weapons to repel invaders who dare to seize them.” 

 

U.S.-led Western troops were stationed in Afghanistan for nearly two decades to counter terrorist groups and protect the internationally backed government in Kabul at the time. They hastily and chaotically withdrew in August 2021, just days after the then-insurgent Taliban stormed back to power. 

 

A U.S. Department of Defense report in 2022 found that about $7 billion worth of military hardware was left behind in Afghanistan after the military withdrawal was completed. The equipment, including aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized by the Taliban. 




Trump stated in his pre-inauguration remarks at a rally in Washington last month that his predecessor, Joe Biden, “gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy.” He went on to warn that future financial assistance to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would be contingent upon the return of U.S. military arms.  

 

“If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re not going to give them the money unless they give back our military equipment,” Trump said then, without elaborating.  

 

Mujahid, while speaking on Monday, rejected Trump’s assertions, saying the Taliban have not received “a single penny” from the U.S. in financial aid since regaining control of the country. He stated that Kabul has neither anticipated nor sought any assistance from Washington.  

 

The Taliban have displayed U.S. military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations since returning to power in Afghanistan. 

 

The U.S. troop exit from Afghanistan stemmed from the February 2020 Doha Agreement that the first Trump administration negotiated with the then-insurgent Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military withdrawal, saying the choice he had was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban.

## Trump’s Little Coal Reprieve

And a key part of the equation should be coal. “Nothing can destroy coal — not the weather, not a bomb — nothing,” he said. “But coal is very strong as a backup. It’s a great backup to have that facility, and it wouldn’t cost much more — more money. And we have more coal than anybody.” </p><p>There is some truth there — the United States <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/coal-proved-reserves" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>does in fact</u></a> have the largest coal reserves in the world — and AI may be offering something of a lifeline to the declining industry. But with Trump now talking about coal as a “backup,” it’s a reminder that he brings up the subject much less often than he used to. Even if coal will not be phased out as an electricity source quite as quickly as many had hoped or anticipated, Trump’s first-term promise to coal country will remain a broken one. </p><p>Yet in an unusual turn of events, the anticipated explosion of demand for electricity on its way over the next few years has led some utilities to <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/110524-us-power-generators-pump-the-brakes-on-coal-plant-retirements#:~:text=Duke%20Energy%20Indiana%2C%20in%20an,and%20natural%20gas%20through%202038." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scale back</u></a> their existing plans to shutter coal-fired power plants, foreseeing that they’ll need every electron they can generate. Ironically, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/georgia-power-coal" target="_self"><u>especially in Georgia</u></a>, that need is driven by a boom in green manufacturing. </p><p>Nevertheless, coal’s decline is still remarkable. At the start of the 21st century, coal was the primary source of electricity generation in 32 states; now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/02/climate/electricity-generation-us-states.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>that number</u></a> is down to 10 and dropping. As recently as 2007, coal <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accounted</u></a> for half the country’s electricity; the figure is now 16%. Worldwide coal demand keeps <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/coal-demand-to-keep-hitting-records-through-2027-iea-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increasing</u></a>, mostly because of China and India. But here in the United States, the trajectory is only going in one direction. </p><p>Confronted with those facts, a politician could take one of two basic paths. The first is to make impossible promises to voters in coal country, telling them that the jobs that have disappeared will be brought back, their communities will be revitalized, and the dignity they feel they have lost will be returned.</p><p>That was the path Donald Trump took. He talked a lot about coal in 2016, making grand promises about the coal revival he would bring if elected. At a rally in West Virginia, he donned a hardhat, pretended to shovel some coal, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-receives-warm-welcome-in-coal-country/2016/05/06/9259c5ea-1327-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_video.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>and said</u></a>, “For those miners, get ready, because you’re going to be working your asses off.” And in Trumpian style, if he couldn’t keep the promise, he’d just say he did. “The coal industry is back,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/us/politics/trump-coal-industry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said</u></a> in 2018, a year which saw the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=40212#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20plant%20owners%20retired,15%20GW%2C%20occurred%20in%202015." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>second-most coal capacity retired</u></a> in the country’s history to that point. “We’re putting our great coal miners back to work,” <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/14/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-pa-hes-putting-our-grea/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said</u></a> on the campaign trail in 2020, when the number of coal-producing mines in the U.S. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48936" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declined by 18%</u></a>. </p><p>When Trump took office in January 2017, there were just over 50,000 coal jobs left in the country after <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES1021210001" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decades of decline</u></a>. When he left office in 2021, the number was down to 38,000. The number is slightly higher today at around 43,000, but it’s still infinitesimal as a portion of the economy. </p><p>Trump’s failure to bring back coal jobs wasn’t because his affection for the fuel source was insincere. He certainly had as coal-friendly an administration as one could imagine; his second pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency was a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-nominates-acting-epa-head-an-ex-coal-lobbyist-to-run-agency-idUSKCN1P326H/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coal lobbyist</u></a>. But the triumvirate of forces that drove those job reductions — automation, emissions-limiting regulations, and competition from fracked natural gas — were irresistible.</p><p>The second path for a politician confronting the structural decline of coal is to take concrete steps to create new opportunities in coal country that offer people a better economic future. That was what the Biden administration tried to do. As part of its clean energy push, Biden put a particular focus on siting new projects in underserved communities, including in areas where coal still defines the culture even though the jobs are long gone. The administration also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241107062156/https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-425-million-decarbonize-and-manufacture-clean-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directed</u></a> hundreds of millions of dollars in funding “to ensure former coal communities can take full advantage of the clean energy transition and continue their leading role in powering our nation,” in the words of then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Or as the Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/anchoring-clean-energy-manufacturing-investments-in-coal-country-and-beyond" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put it</u></a>, the administration was working “to strengthen the economies of coal communities and other areas that have experienced underinvestment in past decades.” These were real commitments, backed up by real dollars.</p><p>Today, the new Trump administration is committed to freezing, reversing, and clawing back as much of Biden’s clean energy agenda as it can. Whether that includes these investments in coal country remains to be seen. </p><p>There’s good reason to believe it will, however, both because of the antipathy Trump and his team hold for anything that has Biden’s fingerprints on it, and because Trump understands the fundamental truth of his political relationship to coal country: Its support for him is unshakeable, no matter the policy outcome.</p><p>Take just one example: Harlan County, Kentucky, site of the extraordinary 1976 documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County,_USA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Harlan County, USA</em></em></u></a>, which chronicled a strike by miners demanding fair wages and working conditions. Coal is still being mined in Harlan County, but <a href="https://eec.ky.gov/Energy/News-Publications/Quarterly%20Coal%20Reports/2023-Q2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as of 2023</u></a>, only 577 people there were employed in the industry, or about one in every 19 working-age people in the county. It <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/harlancountykentucky/PST045224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>remains</u></a> overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly poor — and the voters there love Trump. He got 84.9% of the vote in 2016, 85.4% in 2020, and 87.7% in 2024. </p><p>It might be fair to ask what people in Harlan County and across coal country have to show for their support for the president. The absolute best he can offer them is that while coal will continue to decline under his presidency, it might decline a bit slower than it otherwise would have. Even if escalating electricity demand offers an opportunity for the coal industry, there’s little reason to believe it will <em><em>reverse</em></em> coal’s decline in America. At most it could flatten the curve, allowing some coal plants to remain in operation a few years longer than planned. </p><p>A future where coal is at most a miniscule part of America’s energy mix with a tiny labor force producing it seems inevitable. Most people in coal country understand that, as much as they might like it to be otherwise. If only their favorite politician would admit it to them — and commit to offering them more than fables — they could start building something better. </p>

## Trump hosting Netanyahu for White House talks amid Gaza ceasefire

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump is set to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks Tuesday at the White House with Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip at the top of the agenda.


The talks come at a key phase in the ceasefire. Israel and Hamas have less than four weeks to agree on the terms of the second phase, which would include the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the territory.


“I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,” Trump told reporters Monday.


Ahead of the White House visit, Netanyahu met Monday with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was part of the push to secure the ceasefire deal.


Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the meeting was “positive and friendly,” and that he would meet with his Security Cabinet upon returning from the U.S. in order to “discus Israel’s overall positions regarding the second stage of the deal.”


Witkoff is expected to hold talks with Qatari and Egyptian officials as the three countries continue in their role of mediating the halt in fighting.


In addition to the ceasefire, Netanyahu said he and Trump would discuss countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries.


Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia.  


But Saudi Arabia has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.  


The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu's government is opposed.


Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.


The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 people hostage.


Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more than 47,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

## US tariffs on Chinese goods go into effect

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

New U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect Tuesday, with China quickly announcing tariffs on U.S. imports in response.


China said it would impose 15% tariffs on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, as well as 10% tariffs on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some automobiles.


The U.S. measures involve a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, which Trump announced in an effort to pressure China to take action to prevent fentanyl smuggling into the United States.   


The U.S. government has identified China as a major source of the precursor chemicals used by Mexican drug cartels to manufacture fentanyl.




China has said it has taken steps to crack down on the industry and illicit drug trade.


"China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher," Trump said.


White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that Trump would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days.


Trump on Monday announced a one-month pause for the 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods after he spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.


Sheinbaum said she would dispatch 10,000 National Guard troops to try to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States.




"Mexico will reinforce the northern border … to stop drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl," Sheinbaum posted on X after talking with Trump. "The United States commits to work to stop the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico."


The Mexican leader added that the two countries would continue talks on security and trade and that "the tariffs are put on pause for a month from now."


Trudeau said Canada would deploy new technology and personnel along its border with the United States to stop the flow of fentanyl.




"I just had a good call with President Trump," Trudeau said on X. "Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together."


Both Sheinbaum and Trudeau, representing two of the three biggest U.S. trading partners along with China, protested Trump’s tariff plans and vowed to retaliate.


Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown over tariffs as a trade war, despite the planned retaliations from Mexico, Canada and China and the risk of escalation.


"Read the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100% clear that this is not a trade war," Hassett said. "This is a drug war."


Trump acknowledged Sunday that the new tariffs on the three biggest U.S. trading partners could hit inflation-weary Americans with higher prices for groceries, gasoline, cars and other consumer goods, but said the higher tariffs would be “worth the price” to bolster U.S. interests.


U.S. consumers could face higher prices because companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers, rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves.


Tensions ramped up Monday with the leader of Canada's most populous province of Ontario announcing that he is ending a contract with Elon Musk's Starlink internet services in response to Trump's new tariff on Canada. Musk, possibly the world’s richest man, is a key Trump adviser seeking to sharply cut U.S. government spending and trim the ranks of 2.3 million federal civilian workforce through buyouts.


Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said he is also banning American companies from provincial contracts, signed a $68 million deal with Musk's company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote residents in rural and northern Ontario.


"We'll be ripping up the province's contract with Starlink. Ontario won't do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy," Ford said in a post on X.


Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.

## Rubio visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala on trip focused on migration and security ties

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to hold meetings Tuesday with officials in Costa Rica and later in Guatemala as part of a tour of Latin America focused on migration, security cooperation and countering Chinese influence in the region.


Rubio was in El Salvador for talks Monday with President Nayib Bukele, and he announced that Bukele had offered to accept any deportees from the United States, regardless of their nationality.


“He’s also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they’re U.S. citizens or legal residents,” Rubio said.


The U.S. government cannot legally deport U.S. citizens.


Rubio said El Salvador would fully cooperate on the repatriation of Salvadorans who are in the United States illegally, calling the deal “the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world.”


Bukele said on X that his government offered the U.S. “the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,” with El Salvador accepting a fee to hold convicted criminals in its Terrorism Confinement Center mega prison.


“The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable,” Bukele said.


The State Department said Rubio also raised strategies to counter the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the Western Hemisphere to safeguard the sovereignty and interests of both nations and the region.


His visit comes amid the restructuring of a U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid, which has sparked a showdown between congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump’s administration.


Rubio announced that he is now the acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development but has delegated his authority to another official. He stressed that the agency must align U.S. foreign aid with national interests and comply with State Department policy directives.


Late Monday, the United States and El Salvador also signed a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, on civil nuclear cooperation, expanding strategic relations between the two nations.


The State Department said the MOU marks an initial step toward building a robust civil nuclear partnership, aiming to enhance energy security and foster economic cooperation.


Curtailing illegal immigration


Bukele is regarded as a key ally of the United States in its regional efforts to address the migration crisis.


On Oct. 7, 2024, the United States and El Salvador signed a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement, further strengthening border security and facilitating trade between the two countries.


El Salvador was once the third-largest source of nationals captured at the U.S. southwest border. Today, it no longer ranks among the top 10.


Chinese influence


U.S. President Trump has maintained warm relations with Salvadoran President Bukele, who also strengthened ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping following his state visit to Beijing in December 2019.


During Bukele’s visit, China promised millions in development projects for the Central American country through a series of agreements. Among them were a soccer stadium, a national library, a tourist pier, and funding for water treatment improvements.


In April 2024, China and El Salvador began negotiations on a free trade agreement, though the United States remains El Salvador’s primary trading partner.


El Salvador formally recognized the People's Republic of China on Aug. 21, 2018, severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan.


Panama


Earlier Monday, Rubio observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama, returning dozens of undocumented Colombians to their home country. A total of 32 men and 11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal records.


The top U.S. diplomat said it sent “a clear message” that people who sought to enter the U.S. border irregularly would be stopped and sent back to their countries of origin.


On July 1, 2024, the first day of Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino’s term, the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing through Panama’s Darién region en route to the United States.


The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by the Department of Homeland Security. Monday’s deportation was carried out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a previous pause on U.S. foreign aid.


“This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,” Rubio told reporters at the Albrook International Airport.


“This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we've issued,” he added. “We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this cooperation.”


Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7 million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their countries of origin.


Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40 charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14 countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam.


Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the Darién region compared to the same period last year.


Canal controversy


On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will "take necessary measures" if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S. President Donald Trump described as China's “influence and control” over the Panama Canal.


“Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after Rubio’s talks with Mulino.


Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017 memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their official expiration dates.


"We'll study the possibility of terminating it early,” Mulino added on Sunday.


The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI “is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.”


At the United Nations, Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong dismissed the accusations against China as “totally false” and “pointless.” He said that China has never participated in the management or operation of the Panama Canal nor interfered in its affairs. He also reaffirmed respect for Panama’s sovereignty and the canal’s status as a neutral international gateway.


The Chinese ambassador further called Panama’s decision not to renew the BRI agreement “regrettable.”


After visiting Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala, Rubio’s trip closes with a stop in the Dominican Republic.

## Trump suggests Ukraine’s rare minerals as condition for continued support

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump said he would possibly be interested in continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.


“We’re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they’re going to secure what we’re giving them with their rare earth and other things,” Trump said Monday in the Oval Office.


Trump has indicated Ukraine is open to the possibility of an agreement of delivering rare earth minerals to the U.S. in exchange for the continuation of U.S. aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia, according to an Associated Press report.


“We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do it,” the U.S. president said.


Rare earth minerals like those in Ukraine, include lithium and titanium. They are essential for an array of modern high-tech products.


In his daily address Monday, before Trump’s announcement, Ukraine’s president reiterated the country’s need to defend itself against Russia’s ongoing attacks.  He said Russia is “focusing primarily” on Ukraine’s energy sector.


“They continue their attacks, constantly adjusting their strikes to the capabilities of our defense, making them more difficult to repel,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.


“There is a constant rapid evolution of electronic warfare,” the president said and urged Ukraine to “be much faster” in adjusting to the continuous changes. 


The supply of air defense systems for Ukraine is another issue for the Eastern European country. Zelenskyy said that the supplies are “critical and must not stop.”   


“We must constantly search worldwide for ways to strengthen defense, increase production of necessary equipment in Ukraine, expand localization of production and obtain licenses from our partners,” the president said. “This is a huge undertaking, and much of Ukraine’s future depends on it.” 


Zelenskyy also said in his daily address that he talked Monday with Ukraine’s military Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi about modernizing the country’s armed forces.  


As part of that discussion, the two men also talked about appointing corps commanders who “must be the most prepared, most promising officers, with combat experience and [a] modern mindset.”  


While the president said, “The army must be modern,” he also said, “most importantly, it must value its people.” 


 




Earlier Monday, Russian officials said that Ukrainian drone attacks targeted energy facilities in two regions in southwestern Russia.


Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov said falling debris from drones destroyed by Russian air defenses sparked fires at an oil refinery.


Astrakhan Governor Igor Babushkin said the Ukrainian attacks focused on fuel and energy facilities, starting a fire in his region but causing no casualties.


The officials did not give details about the sites involved in the attacks.


Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down 70 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions.


Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the attacks damaged three houses and an agricultural business.


Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 38 of the 71 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks.


The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhia regions.


Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged four residential buildings.


Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported the Russian attack damaged a school.

## Trump pauses new tariffs on Mexican, Canadian exports amid threats of trade war

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

President Donald Trump’s weekend announcement of tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico sent global markets in a downward spiral Monday. They recovered some lost ground when Trump announced he would postpone a 25% tariff on Mexican goods for a month in exchange for concessions. He later announced a similar pause with Canada. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.

## Rubio in El Salvador to push US migration crackdown, counter China's growing influence

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited El Salvador on Monday to press the country to stem the flow of illegal migration and address other strategic issues. 


His visit comes amid the restructuring of a U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid, which has sparked a showdown between congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump’s administration.


Rubio announced that he is now the acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development but has delegated his authority to another official. He stressed that the agency must align U.S. foreign aid with national interests and comply with State Department policy directives. 


The same day, Rubio also held one-on-one talks with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at Lake Coatepeque, San Salvador, as part of his five-nation Central American tour focused on curbing illegal immigration, countering China’s influence in the Western Hemisphere, and strengthening security ties.


Late Monday, the United States and El Salvador signed a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, on civil nuclear cooperation, expanding strategic relations between the two nations. 


The State Department said the MOU marks an initial step toward building a robust civil nuclear partnership, aiming to enhance energy security and foster economic cooperation.


Curtailing illegal immigration


Bukele is regarded as a key ally of the United States in its regional efforts to address the migration crisis.


On Oct. 7, 2024, the United States and El Salvador signed a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement, further strengthening border security and facilitating trade between the two countries.


El Salvador was once the third-largest source of nationals captured at the U.S. southwest border. Today, it no longer ranks among the top 10.


Chinese influence 


U.S. President Trump has maintained warm relations with Salvadoran President Bukele, who also strengthened ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping following his state visit to Beijing in December 2019.


During Bukele’s visit, China promised millions in development projects for the Central American country through a series of agreements. Among them were a soccer stadium, a national library, a tourist pier, and funding for water treatment improvements. 


In April 2024, China and El Salvador began negotiations on a free trade agreement, though the United States remains El Salvador’s primary trading partner.


El Salvador formally recognized the People's Republic of China (PRC) on August 21, 2018, severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 


Panama


Earlier Monday, Rubio observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama, returning dozens of undocumented Colombians to their home country. A total of 32 men and 11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal records.


The top U.S. diplomat said it sent “a clear message” that people who sought to enter the U.S. border irregularly would be stopped and sent back to their countries of origin.


On July 1, 2024 -- the first day of Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino’s term -- the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing through Panama’s Darién region en route to the United States. 

 

The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by the Department of Homeland Security. Monday’s deportation was carried out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a previous pause on U.S. foreign aid. 

 

“This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,” Rubio told reporters at the Albrook International Airport. 

 

“This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we've issued,” he added. “We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this cooperation.” 

 

Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7 million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their countries of origin. 

 

Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40 charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14 countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam. 


Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the Darién region compared to the same period last year.


Canal controversy


On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will "take necessary measures" if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S. President Donald Trump described as China's “influence and control” over the Panama Canal. 

 

“Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after Rubio’s talks with Mulino. 

 

Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017 memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their official expiration dates. 

 

"We'll study the possibility of terminating it early,” Mulino added on Sunday. 

 

The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI “is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.” 

 

At the United Nations, Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong dismissed the accusations against China as “totally false” and “pointless.” He said that China has never participated in the management or operation of the Panama Canal nor interfered in its affairs. He also reaffirmed respect for Panama’s sovereignty and the canal’s status as a neutral international gateway.


The Chinese ambassador further called Panama’s decision not to renew the BRI agreement “regrettable.”


After visiting Panama and El Salvador, Rubio will travel to Costa Rica on Tuesday, followed by stops in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.

## American bald eagles are having a moment, ecologically, culturally

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

WEST ORANGE, New Jersey — Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle — the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky — is having a moment.


The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000s, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.


In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered in January, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence — and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.


How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.


Their well-being was intertwined with an insecticide


The story — there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance — centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.


To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to “incubate” while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.


“They’re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so, I think now it’s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,” said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.


Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're “fairly adaptable" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey — from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.


She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town — New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans — that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.


“Those birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,” she said. “They're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?”


The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. 


There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.


A resurgence in popularity, too


Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.


She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans' groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in several Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.


The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an “umbrella species,” whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser-known wildlife.


“Americans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles," Clark said.


New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a native of Philadelphia Eagles territory, took his two young sons to the NFC championship game last week, a memory he said they won't forget. “Let's never forget that Bald Eagle was officially named America's national bird at the same time the Eagles are headed back to the Super Bowl,” he said in a text message.


Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green “Birds” cap and binoculars.


“Just the mere thrill of seeing one — a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,” he said. “It really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.”


Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: “I don’t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if... if you’re going to be able to save the species."

## 1714 Stradivarius violin could become most expensive instrument ever auctioned

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A violin made by the famed Antonio Stradivari in 1714 has the potential to become the most expensive musical instrument ever sold when it goes up for auction Friday at Sotheby's in New York.


The auction house is estimating the value of the “Joachim-Ma Stradivarius” at $12 million to $18 million. If it sells at the top end of that range, it could best the $15.9 million paid in 2011 for another Stradivarius, the “Lady Blunt,” made in 1721 and named by Guinness World Records as the most expensive instrument ever sold at auction.


Mari-Claudia Jimenez, Sotheby’s Americas president and head of global business, said Stradivari made the violin during his “Golden Period," which began around 1700 and was marked by an improvement in his craftmanship.


"So, this is the peak of his output," Jimenez said. "This is the best violin of this era.”


Sotheby's says the violin's preservation is remarkable, and its ownership history extraordinary.


It's named for two of its famed owners — violin virtuosos Joseph Joachim of Hungary, who lived from 1831 to 1907, and Si-Hon Ma, who was born in China in 1926, moved to the U.S. in 1948 and died 2009.


It is believed that legendary composer Johannes Brahms was influenced by the Joachim-Ma when he wrote his “Violin Concerto in D Major” because of its rich, resonant tone, and that Joachim played that violin during the concerto's 1879 premiere, according to Sotheby's.


Ma acquired the violin in 1969, and his estate gifted it to the New England Conservatory in Boston after his death. Ma attended the conservatory, where he earned a master's degree in 1950. The conservatory is now putting the violin up for auction, with all the proceeds going to student scholarships.

## Trump administration opens antisemitism inquiries at 5 colleges, including Columbia and Berkeley

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

The Trump administration is opening new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at five U.S. universities including Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department announced Monday.


It's part of President Donald Trump's promise to take a tougher stance against campus antisemitism and deal out harsher penalties than the Biden administration, which settled a flurry of cases with universities in its final weeks. It comes the same day the Justice Department announced a new task force to root out antisemitism on college campuses.


In an order signed last week, Trump called for aggressive action to fight anti-Jewish bias on campuses, including the deportation of foreign students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests.


Along with Columbia and Berkeley, the department is now investigating the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and Portland State University. The cases were opened using the department's power to launch its own civil rights reviews, unlike the majority of investigations, which stem from complaints.


Messages seeking comment were left with all five universities.

A statement from the Education Department criticized colleges for tolerating antisemitism after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and a wave of pro-Palestinian protests that followed. It also criticized the Biden administration for negotiating "toothless" resolutions that failed to hold schools accountable.


"Today, the Department is putting universities, colleges, and K-12 schools on notice: this administration will not tolerate continued institutional indifference to the wellbeing of Jewish students on American campuses," said Craig Trainor, the agency's acting assistant secretary for civil rights.


The department didn't provide details about the inquiries or how it decided which schools are being targeted. Presidents of Columbia and Northwestern were among those called to testify on Capitol Hill last year as Republicans sought accountability for allegations of antisemitism. The hearings contributed to the resignation of multiple university presidents, including Columbia's Minouche Shafik.


An October report from House Republicans accused Columbia of failing to punish pro-Palestinian students who took over a campus building, and it called Northwestern's negotiations with student protesters a "stunning capitulation."


House Republicans applauded the new investigations. Representative Tim Walberg, chair of the Education and Workforce Committee, said he was "glad that we finally have an administration who is taking action to protect Jewish students."


Trump's order also calls for a full review of antisemitism complaints filed with the Education Department since Oct. 7, 2023, including pending and resolved cases from the Biden administration. It encourages the Justice Department to take action to enforce civil rights laws.


Last week's order drew backlash from civil rights groups who said it violated First Amendment rights that protect political speech.


The new task force announced Monday includes the Justice and Education departments along with Health and Human Services.


"The Department takes seriously our responsibility to eradicate this hatred wherever it is found," said Leo Terrell, assistant attorney general for civil rights. "The Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism is the first step in giving life to President Trump's renewed commitment to ending anti-Semitism in our schools."

## Education Department workers put on leave over DEI order

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Dozens of employees at the U.S. Education Department were put on paid administrative leave in response to President Donald Trump’s order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, according to a labor union that represents hundreds of workers in the agency.


It's unclear how many workers were put on leave or for what reasons, said Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252. The majority of employees placed on leave do not work in DEI initiatives and span all branches of the agency, she said, from an office that sends billions of dollars to K-12 schools to an office that enforces civil rights laws.


The shakeup comes as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, pushes to cut programs and federal workers at departments across the government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development.


A DOGE team was working at the Education Department on Monday to implement Trump's executive orders and agenda, said Madison Biedermann, an Education Department spokesperson.


The department did not immediately comment on the personnel changes and would not say how many employees were placed on leave.


At least 55 Education Department workers received an email Friday saying they were being put on paid leave effective immediately pursuant to Trump's executive order. It wasn’t being done for “any disciplinary purpose,” according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated Press.


Those placed on leave lost access to their government email accounts and were told not to report to the office. They include a range of staff members and managers across the department, which employs more than 4,000 workers in Washington and regional offices across the country.


Most of those on leave appear to have taken a voluntary diversity training seminar offered by the department, Smith said. The Diversity Change Agent program has been promoted by the agency for years, including during Trump’s first term in office.


Graduates of the two-day program were expected to serve as role models and help improve the department's “capacity to attract and retain a diverse workforce,” according to an internal email from 2019 obtained by the AP.


Smith said hundreds of employees have taken the training, but it was unclear if all of them were placed on leave. She said many people were under the impression the training was strongly encouraged or required.


“It seems unfair to encourage or require people to take a training and then four or five years later place them on administrative leave,” Smith said.


Some current employees who are on leave said the action could disrupt the agency's core work, including the management of federal student loans and the FAFSA form for student financial aid. The workers spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.


Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a former teacher and member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Trump is “purging” employees for taking a training course that his administration encouraged them to take.


“This won’t help our kids learn or even save us money,” Murray said on the social media site X. “He’s just breaking services people rely on.”


Trump’s order called for all DEI staff in the federal government to be put on paid leave and eventually laid off. It’s part of a broader crackdown on diversity programs that the Republican president says are racist.


Trump campaigned on a promise to shut down the Education Department, which he says has been infiltrated by “radicals, zealots and Marxists.” He said the agency's power should be turned over to states and schools.

## US foreign aid programs face major restructuring under Trump

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which manages tens of billions of dollars' worth of U.S. foreign aid programs, was essentially closed down on Monday, with employees locked out of their offices and computer systems. Several senior figures in the agency were placed on leave as the Trump administration took steps to fold its functions into the Department of State. 


Speaking to reporters in El Salvador, where he was traveling, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he is now USAID’s acting director and would be taking steps to bring the agency’s activities in line with the policies of the administration.


Rubio described the agency as historically “unresponsive” to Congress and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to take its direction from the State Department.


“USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that there's somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,” Rubio said. “These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest.”




Rubio’s comments were less harsh than those of billionaire Elon Musk, who President Donald Trump has given significant power to overhaul the federal government, and whose newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sent representatives into USAID offices over the weekend.


“USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote on the social media platform X on Sunday. “Time for it to die.”


Democrats protest


Democrats in Washington described the effort to dismantle USAID as blatantly illegal and vowed to challenge it.




On Sunday, all 10 Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter to Rubio outlining their objections.


“Congress established the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) as an independent agency, separate from the Department of State, to ensure that we can deploy development expertise and U.S. foreign assistance quickly, particularly in times of crisis, to meet our national security goals,” they wrote.


“For this reason, any effort to merge or fold USAID into the Department of State should be, and by law must be, previewed, discussed, and approved by Congress,” the letter said.


In a news conference in front of USAID headquarters in Washington, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that he and his colleagues would prevent Trump from filling vacancies at the State Department in response to the administration’s actions. 


“We will do everything we can to block State Department nominees from going forward until this illegal action is reversed,” he said.




USAID history


USAID was created in the early 1960s, at a time when there was a widespread understanding in post-World War II Washington that U.S. aid efforts, administered by a patchwork of agencies, were inefficient, often duplicative, and sometimes contradictory.


In many cases, aid was also explicitly tied to the United States’ political priorities, rather than the objective level of need present in nations receiving assistance.


In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration undertook a broad review of U.S. aid programs, and he subsequently asked Congress for the authority to develop a new agency to coordinate foreign aid efforts.


In a message to Congress, Kennedy proposed an agency that would create country-specific teams that would operate on the ground in recipient nations to develop long-term plans. He described these as “a carefully thought-through program tailored to meet the needs and the resource potential of each individual country, instead of a series of individual, unrelated projects.”


“Frequently, in the past, our development goals and projects have not been undertaken as integral steps in a long-range economic development program,” Kennedy said. “Long-term planning and financing — the only way to make meaningful and economical commitments.”


Created by executive order


Later that year, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, requiring the abolition of several existing aid programs and directing the president to designate a new entity to take responsibility for their operations. The act also explicitly separated foreign military aid from humanitarian aid programs.


Shortly thereafter, Kennedy signed the bill into law and issued Executive Order 10973, creating the U.S. Agency for International Development.


The agency was structured such that its administrator reported directly to the Secretary of State, rather than up through the chain of command within the State Department. It was an arrangement that allowed USAID some freedom of operation, but one that would be challenged repeatedly over the years, as successive secretaries of state sought to force USAID’s priorities into closer alignment with State Department policies.


Many successes


Over the ensuing 60-plus years, USAID tallied a considerable number of successes, and also weathered numerous controversies and scandals, many of which were catalogued by journalist John Norris in a history of the agency published in 2021, the year of its 60th anniversary.


USAID-provided food aid has saved countless lives around the world, and its early focus on developing competent local governance structures was central to helping countries like South Korea and Taiwan develop flourishing industrial bases.




In the late 1960s, the agency took on a leading role in the global effort to eradicate smallpox, which had killed an estimated 300 million people since the dawn of the 20th century alone. The agency helped spearhead inoculation programs across the developing world that contributed to the first known global eradication of disease in the human population through a public health program. 


USAID also helped pioneer the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for children afflicted with diarrhea. By distributing packets of water-soluble salts and sugars, the agency has helped prevent the deaths of millions of children in developing countries.


The agency has also been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the incidence in developing countries of mothers’ deaths during childbirth and reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV.


Controversies


Despite Kennedy’s hope that the distribution of U.S. aid could be disentangled from geopolitics, USAID has, many times in its history, found itself supporting abusive or autocratic governments, frequently in Latin America, because the federal government believed doing so was in the national interest.


Public discontent with USAID grew in tandem with frustration at the war in Vietnam, where the agency had played a major role in unsuccessful “pacification” programs meant to win the “hearts and minds” of the Vietnamese people. President Richard Nixon attempted to capitalize on that discontent to abolish the agency and decentralize foreign aid programs.


Instead, Congress took steps to refocus the agency’s efforts, directing it to back away from high-level engagement with foreign governments in favor of work on rural development and aid to the neediest.


In the ensuing years, however, controversies continued to emerge, none more prominent than those arising from the agency’s activities during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Widespread questions were raised, including by members of Congress, about how the agency spent funds earmarked for reconstruction of those two countries.

When we say <em><em>often</em></em>, we mean it: some high profile examples of these plans include those used for the <a href="https://www.powermag.com/doe-loan-programs-office-publishes-community-benefits-plans-for-energy-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Holtec Palisades nuclear plant restart in Michigan</u></a> and the agency’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Community-Benefits-Plans-Training-for-DPA-Heat-Pumps-and-Advanced-Manufacturing-Grants-Applicants.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>battery materials processing and recycling awards</u></a>. </p><p>After Kolb’s edict went out, companies, states, cities, and other entities with DOE contracts that had community benefit plans embedded in them were ordered to stop all work, according to multiple letters to contract recipients reviewed by Heatmap News. “Recipients and subrecipients must cease any activities, including contracted activities, and stop incurring costs associated with DEI and CBP activities effective as of the date of this letter,” one letter reads, adding: “Costs incurred after the date of this letter will not be reimbursed.” </p><p>One <a href="https://www.cogr.edu/sites/default/files/CBP%20and%20DEI%20Notification%20to%20existing%20recipients%20-%201.27.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>such letter</u></a> was posted by the University of Michigan research department in an advisory notice. The department’s <a href="https://www.cogr.edu/sites/default/files/CBP%20and%20DEI%20Notification%20to%20existing%20recipients%20-%201.27.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a> summarizes the letter as “directing the suspension” of all work tied to “any source of DOE funding” if it in any way involved “diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs,” as well as Justice40 requirements and community benefits plans. </p><p>These letters state companies and other entities with community benefit plans in their contracts or otherwise involved in their funding awards would be contacted by DOE to make “modifications” to their contracts. They only cite President Trump’s executive orders that purportedly address Diversity, Equity and Inclusion practices; they do not cite a much-debated Office of Management and Budget <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-funding-freeze-chaos" target="_self"><u>memo freezing</u></a> all infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act spending, which has been challenged in federal court. It is altogether unclear if any outcome of the OMB memo litigation is even relevant to this other freeze. </p><p>We reached out to the Energy Department about these letters for comment on how many entities may be impacted and why they targeted community benefit plans. We will update this story if we hear back.</p><p>A lot is still murky about this situation. It is unclear how many entities have been impacted and the totality of the impacts may be unknown for a while, because a lot of these entities supposed to get money may want to keep fighting privately to, well, still get their money. It’s also hazy if all entities that received these letters are continuing to do any construction or preparatory work or other labor connected to their funding not tied to the community benefit planning, or just halting the funded labor altogether. </p><p>The blast radius from this freeze is hard to parse, said Matthew Tejada, a former EPA staffer who most recently served as the agency’s deputy assistant administrator for environmental justice under the Biden administration. Tejada, who now works for the advocacy group NRDC and remains connected to advocates in the environmental justice space, said he was very much aware of this separate freeze when he was first reached by Heatmap. But “unless you’re able to really have a network of information bottom up from the recipients, it’s a bit of a black box we’re operating around because we’re not going to get transparency and information from the administration.“</p><p>“Part of their obvious strategy here is to create enough confusion as possible to make defending as difficult as possible. But I’m fairly certain the community and various others here -- local governments, tribes -- will have plenty to say about cutting through that chaos to make sure the will of Congress and the outcomes of these programs and projects are delivered upon.” He believes that any attempts to modify these contract awards “on the pretext of canceling the contract[s] will in all likelihood meet a legal challenge.”</p><p>But the ripple effects of this other freeze are starting to surface in local news accounts. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2025/01/28/trump-federal-funding-freeze-affecting-city-of-erie-schember-witherspoon/77993701007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the </u><u><em><em>Erie Times-News</em></em></u></a>, the city of Erie, Pennsylvania currently cannot access funding for a city-wide audit for home energy efficiency. And a big road improvement project in the Mariana Islands – a U.S. territory – was nearly derailed by the freeze, according to the news outlet <a href="https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/beach-road-project-barely-escapes-funding-halt-order/article_92296652-debb-11ef-a74f-27fec0895987.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Mariana’s Variety</em></em></u></a>, which reported project developers are just going to try and move forward without the remaining money provided under contract. </p><p>We’ll have to wait and see the breadth of the impacts here and whether this freeze will produce its own legal or regulatory rollercoaster. Hang on tight. </p>

## Trump’s Tariffs Could Hurt Gas Cars More Than EVs

date: 2025-02-04, from: Heatmap News

A single spring inside a fuel pump can zig-zag across the northern and southern U.S. borders half a dozen times before making it into a vehicle. The jolt of tariffs would follow it, gathering force at each crossing before shocking car buyers with higher prices. </p><p>Electric vehicles, however, famously do not have as many parts as conventional cars. There’s no engine, transmission, exhaust system, or fuel pump. EV drivers will also not have to contend with <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>the effect of tariffs on the price of gasoline</u></a>. So does it follow that, despite Trump’s wish to undo Biden’s EV subsidies, he would actually be making battery-powered cars more competitive?</p><p>Experts I spoke with agreed that EV manufacturers might be somewhat less exposed. But the tariffs will still affect them, and the small edge could be outweighed by other Trump administration policies.</p><p>An internal combustion engine vehicle can have 20,000 to 30,000 parts, Amy Broglin-Peterson, an expert in automotive supply chains at Michigan State University, told me; an electric vehicle might have anywhere from several hundred to a few thousand. Many of these components are manufactured by independent specialists throughout North America. “They’ll be assembled utilizing cheaper Mexican labor, and then they’ll cross back into the U.S. and be put into a bigger assembly, which is then sent back down again for either more assembly work or finished vehicle production,” she said.</p><p>Electric vehicles also contain many of the same complex components as conventional cars, like seats and lights and dashboards and radios and mirrors. “That’s kind of the great equalizer amongst these different vehicles,” Mike Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility told me. “They’re all going to be in the same soup in terms of vulnerability to cross-border trade.”</p><p>But EVs lack the most complex component of all — the engine. Instead, EVs have a battery, and many automakers are either already producing their batteries in the U.S. or are building new factories to do so. As of December, there were more than 80 facilities making battery components, assembling battery packs and cells, manufacturing drive units, producing EV chargers, and doing final EV assembly in the U.S., <a href="https://www.charged-the-book.com/na-ev-supply-chain-map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to a database</u></a> maintained by Wellesley University historian Jay Turner. But that’s set to increase over the next few years due to tax incentives and grants that were part of Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, which reward domestic manufacturing of clean technology components. More than 200 additional facilities, including critical mineral extraction and processing facilities, are in various stages of development. </p><p>Broglin-Peterson told me her quick answer to my question is that EVs likely wouldn’t be hit quite as hard by tariffs as conventional cars. But she emphasized that they will still see an impact, and she wasn’t sure of the extent to which other Trump administration policies would undermine any tariff-related advantages. “The EV picture right now has become a lot more murky, obviously, since President Trump was elected,” she told me. “I do think the traditional automakers are more heavily leveraged, though, on their internal combustion engine supply chains.”</p><p>Wall agreed that EVs were somewhat less exposed, but he said it really depends on which internal combustion engine vehicle you’re comparing them to. Some engines are assembled in the U.S. and have more U.S.-manufactured components than others. Battery makers are still vulnerable, as the processing of the critical minerals that go into EV batteries is currently <a href="https://www.resources.org/common-resources/critical-minerals-for-electric-vehicles-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heavily concentrated in China</u></a>, which will also be hit by 10% tariffs on top of <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/united-states-finalizes-section-301-tariff-increases-imports-china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>existing tariffs</u></a> on Chinese goods. When you take into account the president’s plans to end the electric vehicle tax credit and leasing option, which can shave up to $7,500 off a car’s sticker price, EVs could still end up less competitive than before Trump took office, Wall said.</p><p>Some electric vehicle producers will be hit harder than others. Tesla, for instance, has one of the lowest exposures to non-U.S. content, according to <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/part-583-american-automobile-labeling-act-reports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a> collected by the Department of Transportation. But some 20% to 25% of Tesla components come from Mexico. </p><p>“There’s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs,” Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said during an earnings call last week. “Over the years, we’ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses.” The company’s stock price dropped 5% on Monday, though that may be partly because the company also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-loses-market-share-sweden-norway-musk-looms-large-2025-02-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lost market share in Europe</u></a>.</p><p>Rivian builds its EVs in Illinois and is opening a second factory in Georgia. But the company’s CEO RJ Scaringe <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/749147/rivian-ceo-trump-tariffs-mexico/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told </u><u><em><em>Inside EVs</em></em></u></a> that tariffs will still hurt. “Many, many, many hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in Mexico in production capacity for supply chains that supply to all of us,” he said. “That will need to get remapped or will just carry higher costs.” </p><p>Other manufacturers are more spread out. Ford assembles its Mustang Mach-E in Mexico and its F-150 Lightning in Michigan. GM makes its Chevy Silverado, GM Sierra, and Cadillac Escalade EVs in Michigan, but its Equinox and Blazer EVs in Mexico. Stellantis makes its electric Jeep Wagoneer in Mexico, but recently <a href="https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/september/stellantis-invests-more-than-406-million-dollars-in-three-michigan-facilities-to-execute-multi-energy-strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>invested more than $400 million</u></a> to prep three of its Michigan factories for EV assembly.</p><p>Analysts told me not to expect any sudden moves from car companies. “Revamping the automotive supply chain to be 100% U.S. based is probably not realistic,” David Whiston, an equity strategist who covers the auto sector for Morningstar, told me in an email. “Companies right now are not willing to pivot capacity on a dime — they won’t allocate capital without more certainty.”</p><p>Trump doesn’t have much interest in certainty. After threatening to put the tariffs into immediate effect last weekend, the president quickly struck agreements with Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to pause the tariffs for 30 days while the countries negotiate. He has yet to discuss next steps with China.</p>

## Judge extends block on Trump administration federal funding freeze

date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — A judge in the nation's capital kept a temporary block on a Trump administration plan for a freeze on federal funding Monday after some nonprofit groups said they're still struggling to get promised grants and loans.


U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan extended an order she issued last week that paused a sweeping plan to freeze potentially trillions in federal spending. While the memo outlining it has since been rescinded, the Republican administration has said some kind of funding freeze is still planned as part of his blitz of executive orders.


A second judge in Rhode Island has also blocked any federal spending pause in a separate lawsuit filed by nearly two dozen Democratic states.


In the Washington lawsuit, several groups reported being unable to access promised federal funding even after the memo was rescinded. They ranged from childcare in Wisconsin to disability services in West Virginia to a small business research project on neutron generation and detection.


“For many, the harms caused by the freeze are non-speculative, impending, and potentially catastrophic,” AliKhan wrote.


The Trump administration argues a brief pause in funding to align federal spending with the president's agenda is within the law, and the court lacks constitutional authority to block it.


President Donald Trump’s executive orders have sought to increase fossil fuel production, remove protections for transgender people and end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.


AliKhan though, found that “furthering the President’s wishes cannot be a blank check for OMB to do as it pleases,” she wrote, referring to the Office of Management and Budget, the White House office that doles out federal money.


Lawyers with the advocacy group Democracy Forward are representing the nonprofits. They say the sweeping funding pause breaks federal law, puts nonprofits at risk of being shuttered and violates their First Amendment rights.

## Tariff threats take aim at fentanyl trafficking; here's how drug reaches US

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China is partly aimed at combating the illicit flow of fentanyl into the U.S., where the opioid is blamed for some 70,000 overdose deaths annually. 


Mexico agreed Monday to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a deal with Trump to pause the tariffs for a month — and hold off levying its own. 


Neither Canada nor China has signaled major changes to tackle the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., and each has said it would retaliate for any U.S. tariffs. 


What role do Mexico, Canada and China play in fentanyl reaching the U.S.? And how much can their governments do? 


Where does fentanyl come from? 


The ingredients in fentanyl are largely produced by companies in China and used by pharmaceutical companies to make legal painkillers. But a portion of those chemicals is purchased by the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels in Mexico. 


Cartels make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into the U.S., largely at official land crossings in California and Arizona. The small amounts of fentanyl in any shipment — the drug is 50 times more potent than heroin — and its lack of odor make detection and seizures extremely challenging. 


Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the U.S., but to a much lesser extent. U.S. customs agents seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 9,570 kilograms (21,100 pounds) at the Mexican border. 


Seizures of fentanyl jumped by as much as tenfold under President Joe Biden, an increase that may reflect improved detection. 




What changed after Trump threatened tariffs? 


Mexico announced in December the seizure of more than a ton of fentanyl pills in what it described as the largest bust of synthetic opioids in the country's history. The haul was striking because fentanyl seizures in Mexico had fallen dramatically in the first half of 2024. 


Under President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office in October, Mexico's security forces appear to be far more aggressive than they were under her predecessor. Former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador denied that fentanyl was even produced in Mexico, contradicting officials in his own administration. 


To pause the tit-for-tat tariffs, Mexico agreed to immediately deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border to battle drug-trafficking, while the U.S. committed to do more to stop the trafficking of guns into Mexico, said Trump and Sheinbaum on social media. 


Facing tariff threats, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has highlighted his country's recent $1.3 billion investment in border enforcement, including chemical detection tools at entry ports and a new unit focused on the oversight of precursor chemicals. 


Once Trump ordered the tariffs, Trudeau rebuked the move. 


“We, too, are devastated by the scourge that is fentanyl,” Trudeau said at a press conference Sunday. “As neighbors, we must work collaboratively to fix this. Unfortunately, the actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together.” 


China defended its efforts to combat fentanyl in what has been years of touch-and-go cooperation with the U.S. China doesn't have the same fentanyl crisis among its own population, and doesn't view it as a priority, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. 




How much can Mexico, Canada and China do? 


Combating the production and movement of illicit fentanyl is particularly challenging. 


Unlike heroin and cocaine, which are produced from plants, fentanyl is made with ingredients used for legal pharmaceutical drugs, and can be made in cheap labs that can be erected relatively quickly. And despite the dangers, demand in the U.S. for the highly addictive drug remains strong. 


Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, said he was skeptical that Mexico’s extra troops at the border on their own would make much of a dent in trafficking. 


Once fentanyl leaves the labs, it’s usually well concealed in hidden compartments of vehicles or in huge cargo trucks; better detection technology is crucial, in addition to more troops, he said. The other challenge, Vigil said, is that combating the fentanyl trade will likely require more than just collaboration between the U.S. and its neighbors. 


“Even if Mexico, Canada and these other countries snap their fingers and did away with the drug trade, as long as we have that demand, there will be another country that will satisfy that demand.”

## Stars, athletes bring buzz to New Orleans before Super Bowl

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — The Super Bowl isn't just a game on Sunday, it'll involve a nearly weeklong spectacle taking over New Orleans with non-stop entertainment leading up to the big showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. 


While the Chiefs and Eagles gear up for their championship rematch, the Big Easy will be the epicenter for star-studded concerts, exclusive parties, a comedy show, and guest lists filled with A-listers. From Post Malone, Cardi B to Shaquille O'Neal, the city will be buzzing long before Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs attempt a monumental three-peat. 


“It's going to be fun. It's going to be different than other Super Bowls,” said O'Neal, who will host his popular carnival-themed Shaq's Fun House on Friday night. It's a hot ticket — starting at $199 — for the NBA legend's over-the-top festival event featuring headline performances from Ludacris, John Summit and O'Neal under his stage name DJ Diesel. 


O'Neal's event will feature several attractions including a Ferris wheel, circus performers and premium bar. This will be somewhat of a homecoming week for O'Neal, who played college hoops at Louisiana State University and visits Louisiana about four times a year. 


For Flavor Flav, he wants to help lift morale in New Orleans following the aftermath of the terror attack that killed 14 people on New Year's Day. 


“This is going to be special. I'm here to uplift spirits,” said Flav, who will perform at Guy Fieri's Flavortown Tailgate along with Diplo and Cowboy Mouth on Sunday afternoon. It's free for general admission with paid upgraded experiences for $49.99 and $349 for a VIP ticket. 


“I'm getting on the turntables to make people party and have a good time," he said. 


Along with those events, here's a look at some of the invite-only and public events during a busy Super Bowl week: 




Fanatics party 


Michael Rubin's Fanatics Super Bowl party is impossible to get into without an invite. The star-studded affair on Saturday afternoon is strictly for the who's who of sports and entertainment. 


Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, will likely be front and center, taking in performances from Post Malone, Travis Scott, Don Tolliver and many more. 


The expected attendees include big names such as Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, Lil Baby, Tiffany Haddish and Tom Brady. 


Madden Bowl 


Just like EA Sports' iconic phrase, “It's in the game,” Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton and Shaboozey will literally be in the game at the Madden Bowl. 


The trio is set to separately take the stage Friday night, bringing the hype before the competition kicks off. 


“I can't wait to keep this party going,” Shaboozey said. 


Along with performances, the event will include the Madden NFL 25 Championship Series in front of a live audience — where two of the world's best players will travel to New Orleans for their share of the $1 million prize pool. 


Double up for some, triple duties for others 


The Madden Bowl won't be the only stage where Stapleton will showcase his powerhouse vocals. The country star is set to headline the SiriusXM and Pandora concert Thursday night. 


Stapleton's performance will air on SiriusXM's Chris Stapleton Radio, an exclusive channel curated and presented by him and his band. Pandora listeners can access the Chris Stapleton Radio station. 


After Ludacris takes the stage at Shaq's Fun House on Friday, the rapper will perform Sunday at On Location's Super Bowl pregame party. He'll be joined by rock band The Revivalists at the Club 67 and Touchdown Club just outside the Caesars Superdome for One Location — a premium hospitality provider of the NFL. 


Post Malone will be making moves too. He's scheduled to perform at three different events. Along with Fanatics, the superstar artist will hit the stage at the Bud Light Backyard Tour on Friday, then he's set to headline the YouTube Tailgate Concert on Sunday near the Superdome. 


Diplo will perform at parties for Sports Illustrated and Maxim along with Guy Fieri's tailgate event. 




Gospel celebration 


Bill Bellamy and Rocsi Diaz will bring some gospel flavor to the Big Easy. 


The tandem will host the Super Bowl Soulful Celebration on Wednesday night. The lineup includes some of music's best from The Isley Brothers, Muni Long, Yolanda Adams, Tori Kelly and Jonathan McReynolds. 


Other performances include New Orleans natives Master P, Big Freedia, Lucky Daye and Trombone Shorty. The NFL Players Choir will also participate. 


“Hosting the Super Bowl Soulful Celebration is like hitting the trifecta: music, faith, and football all in one show,” Bellamy said. "I’m excited to bring some laughs, some energy and to be part of this incredible night with an amazing lineup.” 


Michael Strahan, an NFL Hall of Famer and Good Morning America co-anchor, will receive the Lifetime of Inspiration award. He called the honor “truly special.” 


New Orleans Saints player Cameron Jordan will be given the community award while Los Angeles Rams star rookie Jared Verse will be honored with the rising star award. 


Timbaland and Maxim 


Super producer Timbaland will bring his massive hits into New Orleans with the help of Maxim. 


Timbaland will perform at a special concert at the Maxim Saints & Sinners Big Game Party on Saturday. The show will include performances from DJ Loud Luxury, Plastik Funk, DJ unKommon and former NFL player Le'Veon Bell. 


DJ unKommon and Diplo will be featured performers at a pregame party Friday. 


Other concerts  


Captain Morgan will transform Bourbon Street into Rum Street with the help of T-Pain, who will headline a concert Saturday night. 


On the same night, Cardi B is expected to perform at the “Cardi Gras,” 50 Cent will hold the Super Bold Comedy Block Party with standups from Bill Bellamy, Chico Bean and DC Young Fly. 


Dom Dolla and Diplo will perform at the Sports Illustrated Party. 


On Friday, Nelly and the Chainsmokers are set to perform at h.wood Homecoming and the Draft Kings event. Shannon Sharpe and Chad “Ochosinco" Johnson will do an in-person podcast called the Nightcap NSFW Tour.

## Dramatic drop in monarch butterfly count nears record 30-year low

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

MADISON, WISCONSIN — The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.


Here's what to know:


The survey began in 1997


Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast.


The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.


The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.




Heat may have doomed western monarchs


Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.


It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.


Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 37.7 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and any temperatures above 42.2 C (108 F) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 37.7 C (100 F). Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 51.1 C (124 F) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.


Western monarchs' future looks murky


Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.


"This is bad news," Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. “But we have seen incredible recovery. This doesn’t mean we’re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.”




Federal officials working on protections


The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing them, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 1,779 hectares (4,395 acres) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.


A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.


Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.

## Trump administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000 Venezuelans

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON/MARACAIBO, Venezuela — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday moved to remove protection against deportation from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President Donald Trump's expanding immigration crackdown.


The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the program, could be deported and lose work permits in April, according to a government notice.


The notice said the protections were contrary to U.S. interests and no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela.


Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20 vowing to crack down on illegal immigration and humanitarian programs he says go beyond the intent of U.S. law. Trump tried to end most enrollment in the temporary protection program during his first term but was stymied by federal courts.


The status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event.


"I don't know what will happen," said Venezuelan migrant Ana Maria Pirela, 26, who lives in California and has temporary protected status.


"Yesterday they fired my husband from his job — he had been managing a food store for two months — and I'm two months pregnant. I don't want to go back to Venezuela," she said by phone.


Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, greatly expanded the temporary protection program. It now covers more than 1 million people from 17 nations, some in the U.S. for decades, and they could face immediate deportation if they lose the status.


Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans arrived in the U.S. during Biden's presidency, many via legal humanitarian pathways, and deporting them has been challenging due to frosty U.S.-Venezuela relations. On Saturday, Trump said Venezuela had agreed to accept all deported people but provided few details.


Last week, Noem canceled an 18-month extension of temporary protections for Venezuelans by her Biden-era predecessor, saying the Trump administration did not want to be bound by that determination. On Monday, she stopped their status from automatically renewing for six months. 


About 300,000 additional Venezuelans have Temporary Protected Status that expires in September and were not affected by Monday's decision.


The Department of Homeland Security said in the termination notice that while some challenging conditions remain in Venezuela, "there are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country."


The termination will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, the notice said, or about the first week in April.


Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government has taken some steps to control inflation, which previously was in the triple digits, but economic conditions in Venezuela remain dire for most people. The monthly minimum wage equals about $3.


Maduro was inaugurated for his third term in January, despite a six-month-long election dispute, international calls for him to stand aside and an increase in the U.S. reward offered for his capture.


The U.S. charged Maduro and several allies with drug trafficking in 2020, charges he denies. 


The Venezuelan opposition, which has faced arrests and other crackdown measures since the July election, asked the U.S. to keep the temporary protection program in place.


Opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who moved abroad after Venezuela issued an arrest warrant for him, recently said on X that the opposition was still discussing with the U.S. how to protect Venezuelans there.


Venezuelan migrant Tatiana Vazques, who lives in Atlanta, said by phone that her family submitted a U.S. asylum application but was anxious after seeing other Venezuelans arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).


"Yesterday ICE took a friend and her husband. There's anguish," she said.

## Pentagon chief travels to Mexico border as Trump cracks down on migration

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Texas on Monday to visit the southern border as President Donald Trump works to implement a hard-right agenda that includes boosting the U.S. military presence to keep out illegal immigrants.


In his first trip as Pentagon chief, Hegseth will survey operations and meet with U.S. troops who have been rushed to the region under Trump.


"Looking forward to meeting our great warriors and seeing the hard work they are doing securing our southern border. We will continue to deliver on this vital mission," Hegseth wrote on X in a post announcing his arrival.


Trump ordered 1,500 additional military personnel to the border just days after taking office, and his administration carried out highly publicized immigration raids and arrests. Some migrants have been deported using military aircraft.


Border security is a key priority for the president, who declared a national emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico on his first day in office.


The additional personnel have increased the total number of active-duty troops deployed there to around 4,000.


Ahead of his border visit, Hegseth posted on X that Trump "wants 100% operational control of the border — and we will deliver."

## US markets pare losses after Trump pauses tariff on Mexican imports

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

U.S. stock markets fell sharply in early trading Monday but pared their losses after President Donald Trump paused a planned 25% tariff on Mexican imports.


The three major U.S. stock indices — the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chip stocks, the broader S&P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ — all dropped nearly 2% or more on fears that Trump’s new tariffs targeting Canada, China and Mexico would threaten the global economy.




But the losses were cut in half after Trump paused the levy on Mexican goods for a month, even though his planned 25% tariff on Canadian goods and a 10% levy on Chinese imports were still set to take hold at midnight.


Trump was planning further discussions mid-afternoon Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.


Stock markets in Asia fell Monday amid investor concerns about the tariffs.


Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 2.66%, while South Korea’s KOSPI index finished off 2.5%. 


Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down more than 2% in early trading before rallying to close down just .07%.


Britain’s FTSE index, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC40 all dropped more than 1%.


Canada and Mexico both announced tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump’s move before Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told Trump she would send 10,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to try to curb the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. and Trump paused his tariff on Mexican imports.


China has pledged to file a protest with the World Trade Organization over the Trump tariff increase on its exports to the U.S. 


Canada, China and Mexico are the top three U.S. trade partners. 


Some information for this story came from The Associated Press and Reuters.

## Trump orders creation of US sovereign wealth fund, says it could buy TikTok

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok. 


"We're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We're going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people," he told reporters. "There'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring them out for the American people." 


Trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as a presidential candidate, saying it could fund "great national endeavors" like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports, manufacturing, and medical research.  


Details on how exactly the fund would operate and be financed were not immediately available, but Trump previously said it could be funded by "tariffs and other intelligent things." Typically such funds rely on a country's budget surplus to make investments, but the U.S. operates at a deficit. 


There are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8 trillion in assets, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. 


TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19.  


Trump, after taking office on Jan. 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. 


Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over TikTok's purchase and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in February.

## Crews return to the Potomac River to recover wreckage from DC midair collision

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

Arlington — Crews were on the scene on the Potomac River on Monday to retrieve the submerged wreckage of an airliner and an Army helicopter that collided midair in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.


Authorities have recovered and identified 55 of the 67 people killed in the crash and Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly has said they are confident all will be found.


Crews were expected to begin the work of lifting the wreckage on Monday and at daybreak they could be seen aboard a vessel with a crane. More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said.


Two Navy barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage. Divers and salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving debris if a body is found, Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday.


The "dignified recovery" of remains takes precedence over all else, he said.




Portions of the two aircraft that collided over the river Wednesday night near Reagan Washington National Airport — an American Airlines jet with 64 people aboard and an Army Black Hawk helicopter with 3 aboard — will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for investigation.


The crash occurred when the jet, en route from Wichita, Kansas, was about to land. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. There were no survivors.


On Sunday, family members were taken in buses with a police escort to the Potomac River bank near where the two aircraft came to rest after colliding. The plane's passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.


Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were in the helicopter.


Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the collision.


Full investigations typically take a year or more. Investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.


Experts stress that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan Airport can challenge even experienced pilots.

## South Africa defends itself against Trump and Musk attacks on land policy

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

JOHANNESBURG — South Africa defended itself on Monday against attacks on its land confiscation policy by Donald Trump and his South African-born billionaire backer Elon Musk after the U.S. president said he would cut off funding to the country over the issue. 


Trump said on Sunday, without citing evidence, that "South Africa is confiscating land" and "certain classes of people" were being treated "very badly." 


"I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!" he said. 


South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government had not confiscated any land, and he looked forward to engaging with Trump to foster a better understanding over the matter. 


The United States committed nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, the most recent U.S. government data showed. The lion's share of the sum, $315 million, was for HIV/AIDS. 


Ramaphosa said U.S. funding accounted for 17% of South Africa's HIV/AIDS program but it was reliant on "no other significant funding" from the United States. 


The president signed into law a bill last month to make it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest, despite objections by some parties in his ruling coalition. The law aims to address stark racial disparities in land ownership that persist three decades after the end of apartheid in 1994. 


"The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution," the presidency said. 


The question of land reform is highly politically charged in South Africa due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras, when Black people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights. 


Musk, the world's richest person and a South African-born U.S. citizen who has Trump's ear and more than 200 million followers on the X social media platform that he owns, quickly waded into the dispute. 


"Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?" he said in a post on X, responding to Ramaphosa who had posted the presidency statement. He was apparently suggesting white people were the victims of the racism he alleged. 


Ramaphosa's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya urged Musk to talk constructively with the South African president. 


"My brother, you would know that owing to a devastating legacy of centuries of oppressive and brutal colonialism and apartheid, our constitution provides for redressing the ills of the past," he said. 


Under the Expropriation Act, special conditions have to be met before expropriating land such as it having longtime informal occupants, being unused and held purely for speculation, or being abandoned. 


South Africa's rand fell nearly 2% against the dollar early on Monday after Trump's remarks. Stocks and the benchmark government bond also tumbled. 


Charles Robertson, an emerging markets specialist at FIM Partners, said that African countries were relatively well positioned to withstand an attack by Trump because the United States was a far less important investor than China and Europe. 


But any U.S. measures against South Africa would represent a serious challenge for Ramaphosa, who has been trying to boost the sluggish economy and attract foreign investors, he said. 


"The difficulty with South Africa is, do you want to set up a factory in a country where today, Trump's cutting off all aid. Maybe tomorrow, he's ripping up AGOA (a trade deal with Africa) and maybe on Wednesday, he's adding 25% tariffs because they're too close to China," he said.

## USAID staffers told to stay out of Washington headquarters after Musk said Trump agreed to close it

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters on Monday, according to a notice distributed to them, after billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.


USAID staffers said they also tracked more than 600 employees who reported being locked out of the agency's computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that "at the direction of Agency leadership" the headquarters building "will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3."




The developments come after Musk, who's leading an extraordinary civilian review of the federal government with the Republican president's agreement, said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and "he agreed we should shut it down."


"It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in," Musk said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. "What we have is just a ball of worms. You've got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It's beyond repair."


"We're shutting it down," he said.


Musk, Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid and development agency, which oversees humanitarian, development and security programs in some 120 countries, in increasingly strident terms, accusing it of promoting liberal causes.




Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk's government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday.


Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, earlier carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk's team accessing sensitive information.


Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves, saying Trump lacks constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional approval and decrying Musk's accessing sensitive government-held information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal government agencies and programs.


USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs.


"It's been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we're getting them out," Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night.


Musk's and Trump's comments came with Secretary of State Marco Rubio out of the country, in Central America, on his first trip abroad in office. Rubio has not spoken publicly about any plans to shut down USAID.


The Trump administration and Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID's aid programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency's leadership and staff in Washington..


Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump's first term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they believe that agency outsiders with visitors' badges asking questions of employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk's DOGE team.


Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump was allowing Musk to access people's personal information and shut down government funding.


"We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people from harm," the Massachusetts senator said, without giving details.

## WHO proposes budget cut after US exit, defends its work

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

London — World Health Organization member states will discuss cutting part of its budget by $400 million in light of President Trump's move to withdraw the United States, its biggest government funder, from the agency, a document released on Monday showed.


Opening the agency's annual executive board meeting, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also defended the agency's work and recent reforms and reiterated a call for the U.S. to reconsider its exit and enter into dialog with the WHO about further change.


"We would welcome suggestions from the United States, and all member states, for how we can serve you and the people of the world better," he said.


The budget cut will be discussed at the Feb. 3-11 Geneva meeting, during which member state representatives will discuss the agency's funding and work for the 2026-2027 period.


The executive board proposes cutting the base programs section of the budget from a proposed $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion, according to a document released on Monday. That is part of the wider $7.5 billion budget for 2026-2027 that was originally proposed, including money for polio eradication and tackling emergencies.


"With the departure of the biggest financial contributor, the budget could not be 'business as usual,'" the document reads. The U.S. is the WHO's biggest government donor, contributing around 18% of its overall funding. The WHO has already separately taken some cost-cutting steps after the U.S. move.


However, some board representatives also wanted to send a message that the WHO would preserve its strategic direction despite the challenges, the document adds.


The $4.9 billion is roughly the same as the base program budget for the previous period, 2024-2025.


Trump moved to exit the WHO on his first day in office two weeks ago. The process will take one year under U.S. law.

## EU leaders to huddle on defense against Russia, economy, and US

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

BRUSSELS — European Union leaders gather on Monday to discuss how to bolster the continent's defenses against Russia and how to handle U.S. President Donald Trump after his decision to impose tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China.


At a royal palace-turned-conference center in Brussels, the leaders of the EU's 27 nations will also lunch with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.


Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders, has billed the one-day gathering as a "retreat" devoted to defense policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion without any official declaration or decisions.


The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the United States, meaning Trump's sweeping weekend move on tariffs is certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon face similar measures.


Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also be a major factor in the talks on defense, as he has demanded that European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less on the United States via the NATO security alliance.


Trump's call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United States - and his refusal to rule out military action or economic pressure to force Copenhagen's hand - has also added strains to trans-Atlantic ties.


The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they might cooperate more through joint projects.


"Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defense," Costa said in a letter to the leaders. "It needs to become more resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security and defense actor."


Finding funding


The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public finances for big spending hikes.


Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint EU borrowing to spend on defense. But Germany and the Netherlands are staunchly opposed.


One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants for defense projects, according to some diplomats.


European countries have ramped up defense spending in recent years, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war to the EU's borders.


But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more. Trump has said NATO's European members should spend 5% of GDP on defense - a figure no member of the alliance including the United States currently reaches.


Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defense - about $334.48 billion, according to EU estimates.


That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also masks wide divergences among EU countries.


Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defense spenders in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according to NATO estimates. But some of the EU's biggest economies such as Italy and Spain spend much less - about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.

## Netanyahu to meet with US Middle East envoy to open US visit

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet Monday with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff during a visit to Washington focused on Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas and other regional issues.


Netanyahu’s office said he and Witkoff would discuss Israel’s ceasefire positions.


The talks come as negotiations are expected to open this week on the second phase of the ceasefire, with the two sides needing to agree on matter such as the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas and an end to the conflict that began in October 2023.


Witkoff is due to follow his Netanyahu talks by speaking with officials from Egypt and Qatar, the other two nations that have led the ceasefire negotiations.


Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.S. President Donald Trump, and said those talks would include the war against Hamas, countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries.


Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement. 


During the first phase of the ceasefire, which lasts six weeks, Hamas has freed 18 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.


Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, despite Israel saying it would not allow that to occur. The militants have said they will not release more hostages slated to go free in the second phase of the truce without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. 


Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase of the truce ends in early March. 


It's not clear where Trump stands. 


Netanyahu has said Israel is still committed to a full victory over Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants' shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Several dozen remain in Hamas hands, both living and dead. 


Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more than 47,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. 


Even with the ceasefire, periodic attacks are still occurring. 


An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement.


Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. 


But Riyadh has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. 


The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu's government is opposed. 


Even as the Gaza ceasefire has mostly held for two weeks, Israel has ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of Jenin, to the town of Tamun. 


The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

## Trump to speak with Canadian, Mexican leaders after imposing new tariffs

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to speak Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, days after announcing tariffs on goods from those countries and China that have were met with pledges of retaliatory tariffs and other actions.


The new tariffs affect the top three U.S. trading partners, but Trump said the move would be “worth the price” to bolster U.S. interests.


Despite a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy in addition to already enacted tariffs. 


Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the United States. 


In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs.


U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves. 


Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the closest U.S. allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. 


“Why? There is no reason,” Trump contended. “We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.” 


“Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!” Trump said. 


He said, “Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!” 


With the new tariffs, Trump said, "Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!) But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid." 


Trump aides had previously shied from acknowledging that tariffs could raise U.S. consumer prices. Nationwide polls in the U.S. showed that consumer frustration over rising prices during the last four years were a major factor in his November election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris. 


Trump has since acknowledged that it will not be easy to curb higher grocery prices. Trump put the new tariff on energy imports from Canada at 10%, apparently seeking to limit an increase in fuel and electricity prices. 


Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that his country would hit back with 25% percent levies of its own on select American goods worth $106.6 billion, with a first round on Tuesday followed by a second one in three weeks. 


Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of U.S. liquor purchases, and more specifically, orange juice produced in the U.S. state of Florida, whiskey in Tennessee and peanut butter in Kentucky, three states Trump won in last November’s election and all represented by Republicans, like Trump, in the U.S. Senate. 


Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., told ABC’s “This Week” show, “We’re really disappointed” and “perplexed” by Trump’s actions and said she hoped that Trump would back off before Tuesday. But she acknowledged that “it’s really in the president’s hands” whether that happens. 


She said that “less than 1% of illegal immigrants” entering the U.S. travel across its northern border with Canada. She said Canada has invested “in a lot of equipment” to curb unauthorized border crossings and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. to catch migrants. 


“It’s hard to know what more we could do,” she said. “We’re not at all interested in escalating” a trade war with the U.S., where she said 99% of the trade is currently tariff-free. “We’re eager to build on that.” 


Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had directed her economy minister to "implement Plan B," which includes yet-unspecified "tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests," without specifying what U.S. goods her government will target.  


U.S. exports to Mexico totaled more than $322 billion in 2023, Census Bureau data showed, while the U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth of Mexican products. 


Sheinbaum assailed Trump’s contention that her government had joined forces with drug cartels, a claim he made in announcing the tariff increases. 


“We categorically reject the White House’s slanderous claim that the Mexico government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempt to intervene in our territory,” Sheinbaum wrote on X. “If there is anywhere that such an alliance in fact exists, it is in the United States gun factories that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups.” 


China denounced the new tariffs on its exports, with Beijing saying it would challenge them at the World Trade Organization and take unspecified “countermeasures.” The U.S. had a $279 billion trade deficit with China in 2023, the largest figure for any of its trading partners. 


That response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had marked China’s trade showdown with Trump during his first term as president. 


China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that Trump’s move “seriously violates” international trade rules, urging the U.S. to “engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation.” 


Trump also has often threatened new tariffs against the European Union. A spokesperson for the bloc said Sunday that it would "respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs."

## Beyoncé wins album of the year at the 2025 Grammys for 'Cowboy Carter'

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Beyoncé won album of the year for “Cowboy Carter” at Sunday's Grammys, delivering her — at last — the show’s elusive top award.


The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in Grammys history, has been up for the category four times before and many feel she has been snubbed by its top honors.


In winning album of the year with “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé has become the first Black woman to win the top prize in the 21st century. The last was Lauryn Hill with “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” 26 years ago. Before her was Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston. That means Beyoncé is only the fourth Black woman to win album of the year at the Grammys.


Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the trophy, one of several times the show reflected the recent wildfires that burned thousands of homes.


“It’s been many, many years,” Beyoncé said in her speech. “I want to dedicate this to Ms. Martell,” she said, referencing Linda Martell, the performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole Opry.


“We finally saw it happen, everyone,” host Trevor Noah said, nodding to the long overdue achievement for one of music's transcendent artists.


Kendrick Lamar won song and record of the year for his diss track “Not Like Us,” taking home two of the night's most prestigious awards.


“We're gonna dedicate this one to the city,” Lamar said before shouting out Los Angeles area neighborhoods.


It is the second hip-hop single to ever win in the category. The first was Childish Gambino’s “This Is America."


The Weeknd mends fences, Chappell Roan challenges music industry

The Weeknd has mended his fractious relationship with the Grammy Awards with a surprise performance of his new single, “Cry For Me” and “Timeless” with Playboi Carti.


His decision is a direct reflection of the changes the Recording Academy has made to diversify its voting body, CEO Harvey Mason jr. said in his introduction. The Weeknd has been openly critical of the Grammys organization, dating back to 2020 when he wrote on Twitter: “The Grammys remain corrupt.”


It was just one of many pleasant surprises Sunday night. Chappell Roan was named best new artist.


She read a speech from a notebook, speaking directly to major labels and the music industry, instructing them to “offer a living wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.” She described getting signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to treat artists like "valuable employees.”


“Labels, we got you," she concluded her speech. "But do you got us?"


Beyoncé and Chappell Roan give Grammys a country theme

In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift presented the award for best country album to Beyoncé. She became the first Black woman to ever win in the category.


“Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists," she said in her speech. "I'm still in shock. Thank you so much for this honor."


Beyoncé entered the night as the leading nominee.


A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Roan brought a rocking version of her “Pink Pony Club” to the Grammy stage. Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant pink horse.


Los Angeles on the mind

In incorporating the wildfires throughout the show, the Grammys put the spotlight on the city’s resiliency.


Noah's opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires, promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also celebrates "the city that brought us so much of that music.” The Grammys have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by the fires.


As the show neared its end, Noah announced that viewers had contributed $7 million to relief efforts Sunday night so far.


On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brother/collaborator Finneas performed her hit “Birds of a Feather.” It was one of a number of ways the show seeks to salute the city. “We love you LA,” she told the crowd at the end of the set.


The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy Newman's “I Love L.A.” by Dawes — whose members were directly affected by the Eaton fire — backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.


Star studded performances and victories

The first televised award went to Doechii for best rap album for “Alligator Bites Never Heal.”


The tears were immediate. “This category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill —” she said, correcting herself. “Three women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii.”


Will Smith introduced a tribute to the late, great, legendary producer Quincy Jones. “In his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say he changed mine forever,” he said. “You probably wouldn’t even know who Will Smith was without Quincy Jones.”


Jones died in November at age 91. Kicked off by Cynthia Erivo, accompanied by Herbie Hancock on piano, the “Wicked” star sang Frank Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon.” Then came Lainey Wilson and Jacob Collier with “Let the Good Times Roll,” followed by Stevie Wonder and Hancock busting out “Bluesette” and “We Are The World.” For the latter, they were joined by student singers from two schools that were lost in the LA-area fires.


Then, Janelle Monae with an inspired rendition of “Don’t Stop 'Til You Get Enough," channeling Michael Jackson in a sparkly tuxedo and an effortless moonwalk.


The Beatles’ “Now and Then,” which used AI technology, took home best rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father John Lennon. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s the best band of all time,” he said of the Beatles.


First time winners were abundant. They included Carpenter, Roan, Doechii, Charli xcx, songwriter Amy Allen, Música Mexicana star Carin León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra Ferrell.


The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the crowd in a short singalong of their hit “Under the Bridge,” reminding the crowd to “support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their lives,” said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award to Carpenter for “Short n' Sweet.”


“I really wasn’t expecting this,” she said. “This is, woo, my first Grammy so I’m going to cry.” (She’s now won two, but the earlier award was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists don’t attend.) She also performed.


Winners use speeches to lift marginalized communities in tense political climate

Shakira won Latin pop album for “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” and gave a powerful, short speech. “I want to dedicate this award to all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” she said.


Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars teamed up for a cover of “California Dreamin’.” Later, SZA presented them with the award for best pop duo/group performance for “Die With A Smile.”


“Trans people are not invisible. ... The queer community deserves to be lifted up,” Gaga said in her speech.


Alicia Keys was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award “DEI is not a threat, it’s a gift,” she said in her speech, referencing diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have been scrapped recently by the U.S. government and several major corporations.

## FBI staff ordered to reveal their roles in Jan. 6 Capitol riot probes by Monday

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — FBI employees were ordered Sunday to answer a detailed list of questions about any work they may have done on criminal cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, stoking fear among staff about a fresh round of firings at the law enforcement agency.


"I know myself and others receiving this questionnaire have a lot of questions and concerns, which I am working hard to get answers to," Chad Yarbrough, the assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters, wrote in a weekend email seen by Reuters.


The list of questions in the memo, seen by Reuters, direct employees to give their job title, any role they played in the Jan. 6 investigations and whether they helped supervise such investigations. Yarbrough told employees the answers are due by 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on Monday


Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove on Friday fired eight senior FBI officials from agency headquarters as well as the heads of the Miami and Washington, D.C., field offices.


Another memo written by Bove on Friday also demanded that the FBI by Tuesday at noon ET (1700 GMT) turn over to him a list of every employee who worked on Jan. 6 cases, as well as a list of those who worked on a criminal case filed last year against leaders of the militant Hamas group in connection with the Gaza war.


Bove last week fired more than a dozen career Justice Department prosecutors who worked on the two now-dismissed criminal cases brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump, one involving actions taken to try to overturn the 2020 election results and the other involving classified government documents.


A FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the questionnaire.


Democrats and other critics have said Trump's team is carrying out a purge of FBI and Justice Department officials who played roles in the criminal cases against Trump and the Jan. 6 rioters.


On Trump's first day back in office on Jan. 20, he commuted the sentences of 14 people in connection with the Capitol attack and pardoned the rest — including those who violently attacked law enforcement officers.


Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, in an email Friday to staff announcing details about the order from Bove, said the request "encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts."


"I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director [Robert] Kissane," Driscoll noted.


Despite reports about other firings throughout the bureau, emails seen by Reuters from both the FBI Agents Association and from James Dennehy, the assistant FBI director in charge of the New York office, made it clear that no one else had been asked to resign.


Nevertheless, some employees started to clear out their desks Friday amid concerns they might be next, according to the FBI Agents Association email seen by Reuters.


"Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own, as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy," Dennehy wrote Friday, saying he gave credit to Driscoll and Kissane for "fighting for this organization."


Dennehy added that other than the select group of people named in Bove's memo, "NO ONE has been told they are being removed at this time."

## Late President Jimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy

date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — Former President Jimmy Carter has won a posthumous Grammy award. 


Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, died in December at age 100. Prior to his passing, Carter was nominated in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category at the 2025 Grammys for “Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration,” recordings from his final Sunday School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. Musicians Darius Rucker, Lee Ann Rimes and Jon Batiste are featured on the record. 


It’s Carter's fourth Grammy. His posthumous Grammy joins his three previous ones for spoken word album. 


If the former president won before his death, he would've become the oldest Grammy award winner in history. 


Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, received the award on his behalf. “Having his words captured in this way for my family and for the world is truly remarkable,” he said in an acceptance speech. “Thank you to the academy.” 


In the category, Jimmy Carter beat out Barbra Streisand, George Clinton, Dolly Parton and producer Guy Oldfield. 


If Streisand had won instead of Carter, it would have been her first Grammy win in 38 years. 


Currently, the oldest person to win a Grammy was 97-year-old Pinetop Perkins in 2011.

## Amid Los Angeles wildfires clean-up, residents furious over hazardous waste

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

Duarte, California — Not far from where Ceci Carroll lives, a rock-mining company has polluted the air with dust across the San Gabriel Valley, she said. 


Now, as crews clean charred remains from the Los Angeles wildfires, she worries about a new potential source of contamination: a site to process hazardous debris from the Eaton Fire. 


“I’m concerned about the community and also the school districts here, where we have children,” said Carroll, a Duarte resident of 23 years and former local school board member. 


“We’re dealing with the site with the chemicals and hazardous materials," she said. "Parents are absolutely concerned." 


Carroll is among residents from Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities opposing the Environmental Protection Agency's use of Lario Park in Irwindale as a temporary site to separate, package and transport potentially hazardous materials from the Eaton Fire. 


In ordinary times, people picnic, bike or ride horses on equestrian trails in the federally owned land. They now worry about dangerous waste that could pollute the air or seep into groundwater. 


The blazes that began on Jan. 7 charred thousands of buildings, cars and electronics across the Los Angeles area. The EPA has begun the enormous task of removing potentially hundreds of tons of hazardous materials from the Eaton and Palisades fires. That includes paints, pesticides, solvents, compressed gas cylinders, ammunition and lithium-ion batteries from electric cars that could turn toxic when burned. 


“The removal of these materials should not come at the cost of creating a toxic environment for communities already disproportionately impacted by pollution," Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said in a statement. 


The mostly Latino communities adjacent to the site are exposed to higher levels of ozone and particulate matter pollution than other areas, according to data from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. 


Experts acknowledge residents' concerns, but say hazardous waste is not necessarily harmful as long as safety measures are in place and the waste is not stored on site for years. 


Residents have questions about waste site 


At a town hall Wednesday, California Sen. Susan Rubio and local mayors opposing the site grilled state and federal officials: How was the site chosen? Why weren't we consulted or notified? Why truck toxic waste 24 kilometers from the burn zone and risk contaminating our communities? What testing will be done after it's closed? 


Hundreds of residents crammed into the performing arts center and spilled into the hall. They shouted “Shut it down!” and chanted “Leave it in Altadena!” 


EPA coordinator Tara Fitzgerald told the audience that sites closer to the Eaton burn zone were being used for emergency fire operations, including the Rose Bowl and the Santa Anita Park in Pasadena. They chose the Lario Park site because it suited their needs and was available. 


She emphasized that the EPA has done this work for years across the state. 


“We did the exact same thing" for the Woolsey, Santa Rosa and Napa fires, Fitzgerald said, and "we did not have any impacts to the community during the entire process." 


But the Eaton and Palisades fires are unprecedented. Together, they torched the largest urban area on record in California, according to an Associated Press analysis, and more than double the urban acreage consumed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. 


EPA says protective measures being taken 


The EPA said it would regularly monitor air, sample soil, use water trucks to control dust and transport waste out of the area daily. 


The agency lines areas with plastic where materials are processed and uses wattles, earthen berms and other items to control spills. The waste will be transported on surface streets, not freeways, so trucks can travel at a slower and safer speed, the EPA’s Celeste McCoy told the county Board of Supervisors. She said the site would likely be used less than six months, and more areas are being considered. 


With these protective measures, the risks of groundwater contamination, which takes a long time, are low, said Sanjay Mohanty, a UCLA associate professor who has studied wildfire effects on water and soil. 


“There’s several feet of soil that the pollutant has to pass through, and that also requires lots of water to leech from the system,” Mohanty said. "And even if there is leeching, they would not migrate far into the soil in a short time. " 


The bigger risks are soil and air pollution from possible dust emissions, he added, but those too can be mitigated. 


Residents should stay vigilant 


Duarte resident Laura Jasso did not leave the meeting reassured and remained upset about the lack of transparency from state and federal officials. 


“It’s hard to have confidence when they’ve really done this behind our backs," she said. 


While crews continue their work, residents should be vigilant to what is happening at the site and ask how materials are being handled, about emergency response plans and truck routes and schedules, said Rachael Jones, professor and director of the UCLA Center for Occupational and Environmental Health. 


“The community has the right to know that information from the EPA and the Army Corps,” Jones said. 


Jasso said her community is committed to holding the EPA accountable for ensuring safety. 


“Ultimately, we don’t want it here, and we’re going to continue to fight to not have it here,” she said of the site. “But the fact is, it’s here right now. And so, we have to just acknowledge the safety of our students, the concerns of our families.”

## Gerber recalls baby teething sticks over possible choking hazard

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

Arlington, Virginia — A baby food maker is recalling edible sticks meant to ease teething pain over a possible choking hazard.

## New Orleans Super Bowl gets beefed up security measures

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

New Orleans, Louisiana — After a New Year's Day attack struck at the heart of the French Quarter, officials in New Orleans say they are confident in the security plans they have in place for the Super Bowl.


Upwards of 125,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Big Easy beginning Feb. 5 for parties, concerts and revelry featuring artists including Post Malone and Diplo and capped off by the Feb. 9 clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome stadium to crown this season's NFL champion.


Following the truck-ramming attack early on Jan. 1 that killed 14 people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city's most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement officials insist that after more than a year of preparations they are ready to play host.


“We’re going above and beyond what we’ve seen in the past when we’ve hosted previously,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. “We know we’re safer than we’ve ever been before.”


What will the security presence look like?


Thousands of state, federal and local law enforcement officers will be on the ground during the Super Bowl, NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy Lanier said. But she and city officials remained tight-lipped about details.


Drones will be prohibited around the Superdome and downtown New Orleans throughout the week of the game and there will be flight restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal Aviation Administration.


Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city's transportation hubs scanning for suspicious people or activities and guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in charge with the Transportation Security Administration.


Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the stadium, said the Homeland Security Department's Eric DeLaune, who is leading federal coordination of Super Bowl security.


Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in rooftop snipers and BearCat armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium and across the city's historic French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune said.


No one will be allowed inside the cordoned-off area surrounding the Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium, where the perimeter will include blast barriers requiring trucks to pass through giant X-ray machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said.


Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are engaging in a days-long effort to scour the 37,161 square meters (400,000 square feet) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000 seats prior to game day, DeLaune said.


“They’re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure it’s clear and it’s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,” DeLaune said.


How the New Year's Day attack has changed security plans


Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon Street's vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police.


The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle traffic, which was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at the time of the attack, remains on track for completion before the Super Bowl, officials said.


Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks.


The NFL and federal and city agencies have “put a fresh set of eyes” on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo.


“No specific or credible threats” have surfaced targeting the Super Bowl, NFL security chief Lanier said Wednesday.


Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced the creation of an “enhanced security zone” along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and said he would deploy 350 national guardsmen.


After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter, Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering Bourbon Street zone during the Super Bowl weekend.


But in accordance with state law, firearms including permitless concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street, Louisiana State Police Sgt. Katharine Stegall said, noting they remained banned from bars.


AI and mobile apps will play security role


The Superdome’s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging threats in real time.


The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said.  


“It’s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,” Crowley said. “The faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better action.”

## 55 of 67 victims of air disaster near Washington recovered and identified, officials say

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

Authorities said Sunday they have recovered the remains of 55 of the 67 people killed in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.


Washington, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said at a news conference that divers still need to find the bodies of 12 more victims and are committed to the dignified recovery of remains as they prepare to lift wreckage from the Potomac River as early as Monday morning.


“Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us all going,” said Colonel Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers. Portions of the aircraft will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for further investigation.


They spoke hours after families of the victims visited the crash site just outside Washington, DC, walking along the banks of the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport to memorialize their loved ones.


Dozens of people arrived in buses with a police escort close to where an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard the two aircraft. Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the crash while recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.


Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry.


But he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on morning TV news programs.


“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on CNN.


The American Airlines flight with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River after colliding.


The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.


Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.


The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter.


Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.


Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 99 meters, plus or minus 7.6 meters, when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk 61 meters, the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.


The discrepancy has yet to be explained.


Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.


“That’s what our job is, to figure that out,” NTSB member Todd Inman said.


“This is a complex investigation,” investigator in charge Brice Banning said. “There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.”


Banning said the jet’s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.


“The crew had a verbal reaction,” Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed “the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.”


Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.


Inman said he has spent hours meeting with victims’ families since the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.


“Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,” Inman said. “They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.”


More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.


On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.


Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.


According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called “not normal.”


“Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,” Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump’s administration would address shortages with “bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.”


With the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person on the ground.


Also Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army helicopter had been flying higher than allowed.


“It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???” Trump wrote on Truth Social.


Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.


Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.

## More USAID staff ousted as Trump administration dismantles aid agency

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Trump administration removed two top security officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the weekend after they tried to stop representatives from billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from gaining access to restricted parts of the building, three sources said on Sunday.


The action added to the dozens of staff at USAID being removed from their positions, as President Donald Trump's team moves to abolish the agency's independence and possibly bring it under the control of the State Department.


Nearly 30 career staff in the agency's Legislative and Public Affairs bureau lost access overnight to their emails, at least five sources said, bringing the total number of senior USAID career staff who have been put on leave over the past week close to 100.


"DOGE did access the building yesterday," a senior Senate Democratic aide said, requesting anonymity to discuss the incident. USAID security officers tried to turn away DOGE personnel without security clearances.


"They (security personnel) were threatened with action by the federal Marshals Service," the aide said. Following the incident, the director of USAID security John Voorhees and his deputy were removed from their positions and put on leave, sources said.


The purge follows more than a week of changes inside USAID, Washington's primary agency funding billions of dollars' worth of life-saving aid globally. Trump ordered a freeze on almost all U.S. foreign aid, saying his administration will review spending to ensure money is distributed in line with his "America First" foreign policy.


Members of the group from DOGE were allowed to access several secure spaces, including the office of security and the agency's executive secretariat.


There was no record of what information DOGE officials were able to obtain in those areas, but the offices they accessed included classified files and personal information about Americans who work at USAID, the sources said.


Katie Miller, a DOGE spokesperson, said on social media platform X that no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.


Matt Hopson, who was appointed as chief of staff by the Trump administration, has resigned, five sources familiar with the matter said. A congressional source said his resignation followed the incident with DOGE officials. USAID did not respond to a request about Hopson.


CNN was first to report the incident between USAID and DOGE officials.


Legal battle looms


Congressional Democrats said the changes appeared to violate U.S. laws establishing USAID and funding it as a separate agency. Two senior Senate Democratic aides said lawmakers and staff had been meeting on Sunday and would meet again on Monday to consider further steps, including legal action.


Senior Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including its chair Jeanne Shaheen, on Sunday sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio seeking an explanation over the incident. Shaheen said that she was working to gather Democrats and Republicans to ask for answers.


The global freeze on most of U.S. foreign aid is already sending shockwaves around the world. Field hospitals in Thai refugee camps, landmine clearance in war zones, and drugs to treat millions suffering from diseases such as HIV are among the programs at risk of elimination.


U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Brian Mast on Sunday said that he would support moving USAID under the State Department and that there needs to be "more command and control.'


Asked on CBS' "Face the Nation" if congressional approval was needed or whether Trump could act unilaterally, Mast did not answer. The "purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies" and freezing aid were "all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America," he said.


The State Department and USAID did not respond to requests for comment.


Meanwhile, billionaire Trump ally Musk on Sunday continued to slam USAID in his posts and reposts on his X social network. Trump has assigned Musk to lead a federal cost-cutting panel with broad oversight powers. Officials from DOGE have made frequent visits to USAID headquarters in Washington, according to sources familiar with the matter.


On Sunday, Musk accused USAID of being "a criminal organization" without providing any evidence and added "Time for it to die".


Peter Marocco was appointed as head of the Office of Foreign Assistance at the State Department and is leading the agency's sweeping changes, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Marocco previously served in Trump's first administration in the Department of Defense. The State Department did not respond to questions about Marocco.


USAID's website has been down since Saturday afternoon, a sign that the end is near for the agency, whose funding goes to programs on everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work.

## VOA Uzbek: US-Uzbekistan military relationship solid, officials say

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

At a Washington event marking Uzbekistan’s 33rd Armed Forces Day, held at Uzbekistan's Embassy, Uzbek and U.S. officials — both civilian and military — recognized each other for fostering a strong relationship and maintaining close cooperation in defense and security, particularly in areas such as Afghanistan and regional stability.


Most of the American planes and helicopters flown to Uzbekistan by Afghan pilots who fled the Taliban in August 2021 were later donated to the country. Seven of the assets the Pentagon deemed suitable, including Black Hawk helicopters, have now been returned to the United States, officials confirmed.

## In US, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicting 6 more weeks of wintry weather

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa.  — U.S. groundhog Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow Sunday and predicted six more weeks of wintry weather, his top-hatted handlers announced to a raucous, record-sized crowd at Gobbler's Knob in Pennsylvania.


Phil was welcomed with chants of "Phil, Phil, Phil," and pulled from a hatch on his tree stump shortly after sunrise before a member of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club read from a scroll in which he boasted: "Only I know — you can't trust A.I."


The woodchuck's weather forecast is an annual ritual that goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 "Groundhog Day" movie to transform the event into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.




When Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. When he does see it, there will be six more weeks of winter.


The crowd was treated to a fireworks show, confetti and live music that ranged from the Ramones to "Pennsylvania Polka" as they awaited sunrise and Phil's emergence. Gov. Josh Shapiro, local and state elected officials and a pair of pageant winners were among the dignitaries at the scene.


Self-employed New York gingerbread artist Jon Lovitch has attended the event for 33 years. "I like the cold, you know, and this is probably the best and biggest midwinter party in the entire world," Lovitch said in Punxsutawney. "And it's just a really good time."


Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time. What six more weeks of winter means is subjective.


Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.


Phil communicated his forecast to Dunkel through "Groundhog-ese" with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words. "He'll like wink, he'll purr, he'll chatter, he'll — you know — nod," Dunkel said.




Attendance is free but it cost $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1.6 kilometer trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction was made, some 123 kilometers northeast of Pittsburgh.


The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.


Keith Post, his wife and a friend have watched the "Groundhog Day" movie in each of the past five years and decided this was the time to make the trip from Ohio to witness the event.


"We booked rooms almost a year in advance and we're here," Post said. "We're doing it."


A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also put up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.


"It's a holiday where you don't really owe anyone anything," said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler and held him up to loud cheers on Sunday. "You're grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that's just fun to believe in."


Jackie Handley agreed a year ago to visit Punxsutawney for the first time to help a friend check off an item on their bucket list. They were ready for the subfreezing temperatures. "It's once in a lifetime — we're probably not going to come back. And we have tons of warm clothes," said Handley, who lives in Falls Church, Virginia. After the forecast was made, club members and Phil posed for photos with people from the crowd.


Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family did not join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and sees a veterinarian at least once a year. The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an "elixir of life" that keeps him immortal. "There's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down," Dunkel said. "Just like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one."


Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, were being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces.

## Beyonce competes for the big prize - again - at Sunday's Grammys

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — The Grammy Awards take center stage in Los Angeles on Sunday at a celebration that will honor the best of music while acknowledging the deadly wildfires that scarred a hub of the industry. 


Beyonce will compete for the top Grammy prize of album of the year with her country record "Cowboy Carter." The superstar singer has never won the album trophy despite winning 32 career Grammys, more than any other musician. 


Also in the running for album of the year are megastar Taylor Swift for "The Tortured Poets Department" and Billie Eilish for "Hit Me Hard and Soft." 


The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET (0100 GMT on Monday) from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles. Comedian Trevor Noah returns to host the telecast, which will be part awards show, part fundraiser for musicians and others impacted by the recent fires. Hundreds of people in the music business were among those who lost homes in the disaster. 


"It will be a little tricky to pull off, but I'm starting to think they're going to be able to do it," said Paul Grein, awards editor at music publication Billboard. With the fires under control, "people can take a breather and express gratitude and relief that we made it through that." 


Eilish and best new artist nominees Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are among the night's scheduled performers. The show will feature a tribute to Quincy Jones, the prolific music producer who died in November. 


At last year's Grammys, Beyonce's husband and rapper Jay-Z argued that voters had not given proper recognition to Black artists including his wife. Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters, producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy. 


"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work," Jay-Z said on stage. 


"Cowboy Carter" was viewed by experts and fans as a reclamation and homage to an overlooked legacy of Black Americans within country music and culture. It became the first album by a Black woman to land at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart when it was released last spring. 


The Beyonce album was snubbed, however, by voters for the Country Music Awards in their nominations in September. 


The "Cowboy Carter" nomination is Beyonce's fifth entry in the album of the year category. Swift has won the honor a record four times, including last year for "Midnights." 


Beyonce leads all Grammy nominees this year with 11 nods, followed by Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven nominations each. Swift landed six nominations and will present one of the night's awards. 


Beyonce's other Grammy nods include record and song of the year for single "Texas Hold 'Em." 


Competitors for song of the year, an award for songwriters, are Eilish for "Birds of a Feather," Carpenter for "Please Please Please" and Roan for "Good Luck, Babe!" 


In record of the year, nominees include Carpenter's "Espresso" and Swift's duet with Post Malone, "Fortnight."

## Artists help fellow creators who lost works, archives in L.A. fires

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Anthony Obi never imagined the night of Jan. 7 would be the last time he'd step inside his safe haven. 


The Houston rapper, known professionally as Fat Tony, has lived in the Altadena neighborhood for a year and says he and his neighbors were prepared for heavy winds and perhaps a few days of power outages. 


"I totally expected, you know, maybe my windows are going to get damaged, and I'll come back in, like, a day or two and just clean it up," said the rapper. 


But residents like Obi woke up the following morning to news that thousands of homes and entire neighborhoods had been burned to ash, destroyed by flames that wiped out large areas of Pacific Palisades and Altadena. Although the neighborhoods are on opposite ends of the county, they are known hubs for many of the city's creative community, housing filmmakers, actors, musicians and artists of various mediums. 


"L.A. is not just rich, famous people who have giant mansions that were destroyed," said visual artist Andrea Bowers, who is helping artists recover. "So many members of our community lost everything. They lost all their artworks and their archives - that's irreplaceable, a lifetime of labor and a lifetime of research." 


"A lot of my collectors lost their homes," said figurative and conceptual artist Salomon Huerta, who lost his Altadena home of three years to the Eaton fire and worries the art scene in L.A. will downsize as a result of the wildfire. "Before the fire, I was in talks with certain collectors. And then, after the fire, they're not in a good place to talk. I'm hoping that there's support so that the art scene can still thrive. But it's going to be tough." 


Obi and Huerta lost not only personal treasures, business opportunities and homes but also vital equipment and professional archives, adding to their emotional burden. 


Huerta left behind slides and transparencies of past work that he had planned to digitize for an upcoming book. 


"Everything's gone," Obi said. "All of my stuff that is related to Fat Tony music that was in that house is gone, and it was the motherlode of it." 


Grief and Hope 


Kathryn Andrews never imagined she'd experience another wildfire in her lifetime. 


The conceptual artist was forced to flee her Pacific Palisades neighborhood as smoke drew near, the second time in four years she's had to escape a wildfire. 


She lost her Juniper Hills property to the 2020 Bobcat fire, which burned a large section of rural Los Angeles County. 


"I've already experienced one home being burned. I think you have a different focus after that. Maybe we become a little bit less attached to material things. And we began looking at a bigger long-term picture, thinking about, you know, how we live together in community, how we live in relation to the land and how we can work together to solve this," she said. 




Andrews is the co-founder of relief effort Grief and Hope, which aims to support creatives financially as they enter the long road ahead and was founded alongside a group of gallery directors, art professionals and artists like Bowers, Ariel Pittman, Olivia Gauthier and Julia V. Hendrickson. 


"Our primary goal is getting people triage money for just whatever the most emergent need is," said Pittman. 


The fundraising effort began shortly after the fires broke out with a Go Fund Me seeking $500,000. They have now raised over $940,000 of their new $1 million goal via The Brick, a nonprofit art space. As of Tuesday, Grief and Hope had received more than 450 inquiries, and Pittman said the funds would be evenly distributed to applicants. The deadline for artists to submit a needs survey has concluded, but the relief effort will continue fundraising until mid-March. 


Grief and Hope also has five different groups of volunteers providing peer-to-peer support, helping with medical needs, safety issues and renter's issues, and collecting survey data to better serve their creative community. 


"These are people who already have made very long-term commitments in their work, including the five of us, towards building community and building sustainability around artists and art workers in our city and beyond," said Pittman. 


For Grief and Hope, creating a more sustainable future for artists throughout the city begins with affordable studio spaces and housing. 


Long road ahead 


For photographer Joy Wong, losing her home of eight years meant losing the beauty of Altadena. She described the overall area as "a pocket of heaven." 


"I didn't want to leave," said Wong, who safely evacuated with her husband and 2-year-old daughter. "We were just so in love with this house, and it wasn't just my house. It was also my studio space." 


Many, like Obi, Wong and Huerta, have started GoFundMe accounts. Meanwhile, initiatives and relief efforts have popped up around Southern California, ready to assist with clothing donations, art supplies, professional equipment for creatives and more. 


"I'm applying to everything," said Obi, who needs to replace his instruments and recording equipment. 


Wong said she's received much support from family, friends and colleagues. 


"I think I just have to kind of lean on the community and get back into shooting," she said. "I got to get all my gear back, too. It's going to be a long road, but it'll be OK." 


Arts scene rebirth 


Superchief Gallery co-founder and director Bill Dunleavy said he believes that this is an opportunity to rebuild long-needed infrastructure for the arts throughout Los Angeles. 


"Quite a lot was lost in the areas affected by the fire. And it's going to affect rent prices and studio prices and art markets and everything else," said Dunleavy. "I've been so impressed with the amount of compassion that people feel and the sense of duty people have felt to help with this. ... I hope that continues into the coming years." 


Creative director Celina Rodriguez said she hopes freelance artists and creatives continue to work and shoot production or projects throughout the city, rather than leaving because of the wildfires. 


"Having lost so many locations that we would shoot, typically in Malibu, Topanga, the Palisades, all throughout, we will have to absolutely come together and figure out how we can continue working in Los Angeles ... and urge people to shoot productions here," she said. 


Rodriguez and Dunleavy began collecting donations at the Downtown Los Angeles gallery and within 48 hours transformed it into a bustling donation center with over 150 volunteers. The duo are now working with displaced families to make sure their daily needs are being met. 


Dunleavy said the relief effort has only encouraged him to take this work beyond just the donation center and explore the possibilities of nonprofit work for the community. 


"All of our wheels are turning now that we've seen the power that just self-organizing can have."

## Trump’s Tariffs Are a Warning

date: 2025-02-02, from: Heatmap News

	On Saturday evening, President Donald Trump signed orders placing 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a lower, 10% tariff on Canadian oil, natural gas, uranium, and other energy sources.
</p><p>
	Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on all goods imported from China.
</p><p>
	The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, giving Trump — who revels in proposing tariffs but has shown some reluctance to impose them for real — another 48 hours to maneuver. But if the new tariffs do actually bite, then they will affect nearly half of America’s imports and reshape some of the world’s most important energy and trading relationships.
</p><p>
	Every day, millions of barrels of oil and cubic feet of natural gas flow across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico borders. The three countries have developed an integrated and harmonized network of pipelines, storage tanks, and refineries that has helped turn the United States into the world’s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas.
</p><p>
	The tariffs will almost inevitably disrupt that relationship. They may also upset the millions of dollars’ worth of electricity that shuttles from Canada to the United States every day across their shared power grids.
</p><p>
	The tariffs will prove economically painful, although just how damaging is hard to know in advance. They could shrink the United States’ GDP by 0.4%, while increasing taxes by $830 per household, according to <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an analysis</u></a> by the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank. Another estimate from <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Budget Lab at Yale</u></a> says that the tariffs could push up the personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed’s chosen inflation gauge — by 0.75%, reducing the average household’s purchasing power by $1,200 over the course of a year.

These costs could worsen as Mexico, Canada, and China raise their own tariffs or trade barriers in retaliation. Late on Saturday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would impose its own 25% tariffs on CA$155 billion of goods imported from the United States.
</p><p>
	The economic hit to the U.S. economy could also be much larger than estimated if some manufacturers respond to higher costs not by hiking prices, but rather by delaying or shutting down production.
</p><p>
	We’ve been reporting on the economic impact of these tariffs at Heatmap over the past week, documenting their potential impacts for <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>oil refineries</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/canada-tariffs-electricity" target="_self"><u>the electricity grid</u></a>. But now that the details are here, a few things stand out.
</p><p>
<strong>First, the tariffs on China are qualitatively different from the tariffs on our North American neighbors — especially Canada.</strong>
</p><p>
	Chinese tariffs are not new. Trump engaged China in a trade war during his first term and ultimately reached a handshake agreement, although he has since said that China did not buy enough American agricultural products to keep up its end of the bargain. Some of the tariffs Trump placed on Chinese imports last time — including eye-watering levies on solar panels — remain in effect; the new 10% tariff will be added to those figures.
</p><p>
	What did <em><em>not </em></em>happen last time was a serious, out-and-out trade war with Canada and Mexico, America’s neighbors and biggest trading partners. Although Trump entertained the possibility of Mexican tariffs during the campaign, he did not propose tariffs on Canadian imports until after his November election.
</p><p>
<strong>Second, the tariffs are </strong><em><strong><em>quantitatively</em></strong></em><strong> different, too.</strong> The president has not yet explained why he has placed higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico, who are our allies, than on China, which is our economic frenemy at best and our geostrategic adversary at worst. During the campaign, Trump sometimes proposed a “universal tariff” of 10% to 20% on all American imported goods, regardless of their country of origin. That proposed universal tariff — which was seen by some analysts as an extreme and unlikely proposal — was at a<em><em> lower </em></em>rate than what he is now levying on North American imports.
</p><p>
<strong>Third, this trade war has apparently been concocted and planned much more haphazardly than the one during Trump’s first term.</strong> Last time, the U.S. was careful to exempt electronics — iPhones, laptops, Xboxes — from its levies, as well as other consumer products. These tariffs do not do so, at least not yet. Nor do they exempt certain minerals that are essential to manufacturing electric vehicle batteries or other high-end electronics. (<em><em>Bloomberg </em></em>has reported that as recently as Friday, Tesla <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/tesla-fights-tariffs-on-ev-graphite-putting-musk-at-odds-with-trump" target="_blank"><u>was lobbying</u></a> for an exemption for graphite, a mineral crucial to making EV anodes.)
</p><p>
<strong>Finally, what is so striking about these tariffs is how they will be good for almost nobody.</strong>
</p><p>
	The tariffs will hurt the American oil industry. As I <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>wrote earlier this week</u></a>, U.S. energy companies have spent tens of billions of dollars on special equipment that can refine the sludgy, sulfurous crude oil extracted in Canada; Canadian companies, in turn, have sold us that crude oil at a discount and built infrastructure so that it can be used by the United States.
</p><p>
	The tariffs will hurt oil refineries. The U.S. refines <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62624#:~:text=U.S.%20refining%20capacity%20increased%20this,with%20the%20start%20of%202023." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about 18 million barrels of oil</u></a> a day, but it extracts — even today, around <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its all-time high</u></a> — only <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63824#:~:text=An%20average%20of%2013.4%20million,has%20maintained%20each%20year%20since." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>13.5 million barrels</u></a> a day. Most of the difference between what it refines and what it extracts is made up by heavy crude from Canada and Mexico, which blends well with the lighter petroleum produced by U.S. fracking wells. By raising the cost of Canadian and Mexican fuel imports, the cost of all refined products will rise.
</p><p>
	The tariffs will hurt anyone who buys gasoline in the Midwest and Mountain West, where Canadian oil plays a much larger role in local markets. They will hurt diesel and jet fuel prices in those regions too.
</p><p>
	But the damage will not be limited to the fossil fuel industry.
</p><p>
	The tariffs will hurt anyone who uses electricity across the parts of the country, especially the Northeast, that import large amounts of electricity from Canada’s roaring hydroelectric plants.
</p><p>
	The tariffs will hurt home builders and construction companies because the United States gets its best building-grade lumber from Canada. That lumber — already made more expensive <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/why-climate-change-pushing-lumber-prices/621288/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by a climate change-intensified supply crisis</u></a> — will now face additional taxes at the border.
</p><p>
	The tariffs will hurt anyone who wants to buy or rent a home in the United States because the lack of lumber will worsen the housing shortage and general affordability crisis.
</p><p>
	They will hurt automakers, who in the past three decades have constructed sophisticated supply chains spanning North America — a logistical dance that allows a single vehicle’s components and parts to cross the U.S., Canadian, and Mexico borders many times on their way to becoming a final product. They will hurt autoworkers, who depend on that supply chain. They will even hurt car dealerships, who will respond to higher prices by selling less inventory.
</p><p>
	If the dollar rises to accommodate the new tariff level, as some White House officials have argued, then the tariffs will hurt <em><em>all </em></em>U.S. domestic manufacturers because their products will become more expensive, and therefore less competitive on the global market.
</p><p>
	I am not saying, to be clear, that these tariffs are an economic catastrophe. We don’t actually know their economic cost yet — perhaps it will be minimal. But even then, they will still be a stupid waste of money that will help nobody, and which will make the U.S. economy neither more complex nor more secure.
</p><p>
	The tariffs are a warning. As recently as last week, Goldman Sachs analysts <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pkrugman.bsky.social/post/3lh5rc7we2c2i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put the risk of tariffs</u></a> at only a 20% chance of actually happening. They ignored what Trump had said<em> </em>he would do because it struck them as too implausible, too unwise, too patently harmful. Perhaps in the next two days they will be proven right. But Trump has begun to blather about many unwise and harmful ideas — invading Panama (where Secretary of State Marco Rubio is headed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/rubio-panama-canal-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>right now</u></a>), annexing Greenland, making Canada (somehow) the 51st state. Many seem even more implausible than these tariffs, and yet Donald Trump says that he wants to do them, too. How much longer can Republican lawmakers and business leaders pretend that he doesn’t mean what he says? The chance of calamity has only just begun.

## US says life-saving HIV treatment can continue during aid pause

date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department said Saturday that the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) -- the world's leading HIV initiative -- was covered by a waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance during a 90-day pause in foreign aid.


Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump ordered the pause so foreign aid contributions could be reviewed to see if they align with his "America First" foreign policy. The U.S. is the world's largest aid donor.


Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially issued a waiver for emergency food aid and then Tuesday for life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter and subsistence help. However, the lack of detail in Trump's order and the ensuing waivers has left aid groups confused as to whether their work can continue.


So, Saturday the State Department's Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy issued a memo, seen by Reuters, clarifying that PEPFAR was covered by the Jan. 28 memo and spelling out what activities were allowed.


These include life-saving HIV care and treatment services, including testing and counseling, prevention and treatment of infections including tuberculosis (TB), laboratory services, and procurement and supply chain for commodities/medicines. It also allows prevention of mother-to-child transmission services.


"Any other activities not specifically mentioned in this guidance may not be resumed without express approval," it said.


More than 20 million people living with HIV, who represent two-thirds of all people living with the disease receiving treatment globally, are directly supported by PEPFAR.


Under Trump's foreign aid pause, all payments by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) stopped Tuesday — for the first time since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 — and have not resumed, according to U.S. Treasury data. On Monday USAID paid out $8 million and last week a total of $545 million.


The Trump administration is also moving to strip a slimmed-down USAID of its independence and put it under State Department control, two sources familiar with the discussions said Friday, in what would be a significant overhaul of how Washington allocates U.S. foreign aid.

## US strikes stronghold of  Islamic State affiliate in Somalia

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. warplanes took aim at the Islamic State affiliate in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold.


U.S. President Donald Trump announced the precision strike Saturday on social media, describing the main target as a "Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led."


"These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies," Trump said. "The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians."


A separate statement from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted an area in Somalia's Golis mountains, and "further degrades ISIS's ability to plot and conduct terrorist attacks threatening US citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians."


Neither Trump nor Hegseth named the IS planner, though U.S. officials said the strikes were carried out in coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia.


General Adan Abdi Hashi, commander of the Puntland Devish Forces said the airstrikes targeted at least 10 locations of the Islamic State militants in the Cal-Miskaad area, which is part of the Golis mountains.


"The strikes targeted about 10 locations in the Cal-Miskaad areas, most of them caves, and we believe that many of the militants were killed," said the general.


Residents in Qandala, a small town in Bari region of Puntland told VOA on the condition of anonymity because they feared for their lives, that they could see from the distance plumes of smoke and flames, and that they could hear at least seven huge explosions.


Officials from Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland region thanked the U.S. on social media, calling the operation a success.


"The latest airstrike, carried out today, resulted in the elimination of several high-ranking #ISIS members," according to the statement.


U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S, military efforts on the continent, said it, too, assessed multiple terror operatives had been killed.


The Islamic State, also known as IS or Daesh, has increasingly played a key role in the terror group's operations in Africa and beyond.


Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group's capabilities. As a result, IS-Somalia has become both a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa.


IS-Somalia has, at the same time, become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to now head IS' directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa.


Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as the Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure.




The U.S. previously targeted Mumin in May of last year.


Recent intelligence assessments have further warned IS-Somalia has more than doubled in size over the past year and may now boast up to as many as 1,600 fighters, bolstered by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen.


Most of IS-Somalia's manpower has been concentrated in Puntland, especially in the Golis Mountains, also known as the Cal-Miskaad mountains.


Saturday's airstrike, the first against IS in Somalia so far this year, was carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S. Truman, currently in the Red Sea, according to defense officials who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the operation.


It comes as Somali forces in Puntland continue a military offensive against ISIS militants hiding in Cal-Miskaad mountains. Puntland also thanked the United Arab Emirates which they say provided air support to the ongoing offensive.


The operations, which started in late December, drove militants from vast areas in the northeastern highlands of Somalia.


The militants, many of them foreigners, have claimed carrying out IED attacks against Puntland forces.


The fiercest clashes occurred late last week when the regional forces dislodged the militants from Turmasaale, a strategic location about 150 kilometers southeast of Bosaso.


The Somali government called Saturday's airstrikes by the U.S. "a critical step in our shared fight against terrorism."


"The Federal Government of Somalia welcomes the firm and decisive counterterrorism efforts led by the United States," it said in a statement. "Together, we will continue to dismantle extremist networks ... and build a future free from the scourge of terrorism."

## Trump places tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Saturday that places 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China starting Tuesday, the White House said.


"Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also illegal immigrants into our country," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing Friday.


Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, was not scheduled to speak to reporters.


While Canadian goods will face a 25% tariff, Trump said he would tariff Canadian crude oil imports at 10%. Mexico’s energy imports are included in its 25% tariffs. For Canada alone, Trump canceled the "de minimis" tariff exemption for shipments worth less than $800.


China’s 10% would be on top of various existing tariffs on its goods.


Under the order, there is no process to seek an exception, but there is one to escalate the tariff rates if the countries retaliate.


Mexico and Canada responded later Saturday while China denounced Trump’s action Sunday but left open the possibility for talks to avoid worsening the situation.


Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum ordered retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. move, saying in a post on X that her government would prefer dialogue but had been forced to respond.


"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and nontariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests," she wrote.


She also rejected "the White House’s slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory."


"If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do, and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population," she wrote.


Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that Canada would retaliate against the U.S. action with 25% tariffs on U.S. goods, saying that the tariffs would apply to $155 billion in U.S. goods, with those on $30 billion to go into effect Tuesday those on the other $125 billion in 21 days.




He also said Canada is looking at nontariff measures, possibly relating to critical minerals, energy and other partnerships.


China on Sunday denounced the U.S. tariff on China, saying it would challenge the move in at the World Trade Organizations and take "corresponding countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our own rights and interests."


While its Commerce Ministry said the U.S. move “seriously violates” international trade rules, it urged Washington to "engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation."


'Negative impact’ predicted


China, Mexico and Canada account for more than one-third of the goods and services imported into or bought from the United States.


Some economists warn that the tariffs could backfire.


Imports from Mexico and Canada make up around 3% of U.S. gross domestic product, while exports make up around 2.5% of U.S. GDP, Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said.


A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada amounts to a "tax hike on imports from those countries" and will "have an immediate and negative impact on the U.S. economy," he told VOA. "It's a strategy for shrinking the U.S. economy."


Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs to pressure countries to help his administration stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl. He has pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and has praised their use as an effective economic policy.


Trump believes that "tariffs are a great source of leverage," and that he will "convince Canada and Mexico to make big concessions under the threat of tariffs," Setser said. "But these measures are going to be pretty costly to the U.S."


Trump acknowledged that the tariffs might cause a "short-term disruption" for consumers but said they would lead to a long-term benefit for U.S. manufacturing.


"Tariffs don't cause inflation. Tariffs cause success," he added.


Trump had vowed Friday to impose sweeping tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel and aluminum, and oil and gas.


"All forms of medicine and pharmaceuticals," Trump said. "And we'll be doing, very importantly, steel, and we'll also be doing chips and things associated with chips."


Trump warned he would "absolutely" place tariffs on goods from the European Union.


"They're treating us so badly," he said.


In imposing the tariffs, he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House said Saturday the act was needed because of "the extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs, including deadly fentanyl, constitutes a national emergency."


Free trade agreement


During his first administration, in 2018, Trump negotiated and signed the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, in part to narrow the large U.S. trade deficit — the gap between what it exports and what it imports — with its neighbors. He once called the deal "the fairest, most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law."


However, the U.S. trade deficit in goods with Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, according to government data. The trade gap in goods with Canada has also increased, from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023.


"He's now acting like his deal caused a disaster needing an emergency fix," said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.


There is no justification for high tariffs on Canada, a market economy that is not in the top five of U.S. trade deficits, Scissors said. "Fentanyl shipments across the Canadian border are tiny," he added.


Fentanyl and illegal migration are justifications for border restrictions on Mexico, Scissors said. However, tariffs "don't stop illegal immigration and probably encourage it by threatening jobs in Mexico."


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse.

## 4 media organizations 'rotated' out of Pentagon press corps offices

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, in an unprecedented move, announced late Friday it would remove four media organizations including The New York Times from their dedicated office spaces in the Pentagon, citing a desire to make room for others. 


The memo on a "New Annual Media Rotation Program" said it would also remove National Public Radio, NBC News and Politico, which must vacate their spaces by February 14. In their place, it would give dedicated office space to the New York Post, One America News Network, Breitbart News Network and HuffPost News. 


Each year going forward, one outlet from print, online, television and radio will rotate out of the Pentagon "to allow a new outlet from the same medium that has not had the unique opportunity to report as a resident member of the Pentagon Press Corps," the memo said. 


"We're disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we've used for many decades," an NBC News spokesperson said by email. "Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has." 


The New York Times said it remained committed to covering the Pentagon "fully and fairly" despite the move. 


"Steps designed to impede access are clearly not in the public interest," The Times said in a statement. 


NPR called on the Defense Department to expand office space available so all media outlets covering the Pentagon receive equal access. 


"This decision interferes with the ability of millions of Americans to directly hear from Pentagon leadership, and with NPR's public interest mission to serve Americans who turn to our network of local public media stations in all 50 states," it said. 


Politico did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. 


More than two dozen news organizations operate out of the Pentagon, including Reuters, reporting on the daily activities of the U.S. military. 


"To be clear, the outlets that vacate the spaces loaned them by the secretary (of defense) will remain full members of the Pentagon Press Corps," said John Ullyot, acting assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs. 


"The only change will be giving up their physical workspaces in the building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident members of the Pentagon Press Corps." 


The Pentagon Press Association, which represents journalists who cover the Defense Department, said it was "greatly troubled by this unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media." 


Reuters correspondent Phil Stewart is a member of the association's four-member board of directors.

## Trump says Venezuela agrees to receive undocumented migrants captured in US

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Venezuela has agreed to receive all Venezuelan undocumented migrants captured in the United States and pay for their transport.


"Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S., including gang members of Tren de Aragua," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.


He said Venezuela has also agreed to provide transportation.


The Venezuelan government did not immediately reply to a request for comment.


U.S. envoy Richard Grenell met with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in the South American country on Friday. Hours after their meeting, six American hostages were released and returned to the United States from Venezuela.




The announcement of Venezuela's decision to accept the return of its citizens who were illegally in the United States comes one week after Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions after Colombia refused to accept military flights carrying deportees.


Colombia reversed its course and agreed to accept migrants following the threats.


"We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens from all countries," said Trump, who vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in his 2024 presidential campaign.


Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders to crack down on illegal immigration after taking office on Jan. 20, including actions aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S. without legal status.

Then the second thing that happened was I married a farmer’s daughter outside of Spokane — so a 10,000-acre wheat farm — and that got me a lot closer to agriculture than I had ever been. And the last thing, about four years ago, I looked at my father in law’s shop and said, there’s got to be a grant for a farmer to put solar on their shop. I found the Rural Energy for America Program, wrote him a grant, successfully won it, and then about six of his neighbors came by and said, “Hey, how’d you get him money? I want money to go and improve my farm.” So then I was the most experienced person in eastern Washington. And the USDA launched a contract called the <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/energy-programs/rural-energy-america-technical-assistance-grant-program" target="_blank"><u>Technical Assistance contract</u></a>, which we won in Idaho and Washington. And that's when I quit my job and started ZEN.</p><p>In rough numbers, our projects have won about $4 million worth of grant support, and that $4 million worth of grant support is matched by private capital. And then those projects are going to save $20 million over their useful life. So call it $30 million of total investment in rural communities, because the money saved on these farms doesn’t go to anything other than fertilizer for next year’s crop, and seed, wheat, and maintenance and mechanics. All of this gets reinvested in making that farm better or making that business better.</p><p><strong>How did you learn that ZEN would be impacted by Trump’s executive order? </strong></p><p>We talked to people in the government, and they have repeatedly told us that obligated grants have never been removed. So we were operating on the understanding that once a project is obligated, we can then start working and helping that farmer execute on that project. So Trump takes office, we’re still heads down doing what we’re doing — and we do have this belief that the work that we’re doing is exactly the work that Trump wants to see.</p><p>We get paid roughly about four times a year, so basically a quarterly invoice. So we haven’t been paid since October. We submitted an invoice in early January for our normal operating procedures, and the USDA processed that in the first week of the Trump administration, and said, “Cool. They’ve done everything, press pay<em><em>,</em></em>” and it didn’t go through. We were told verbally that there were back-end restrictions.</p><p>We thought it was all <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-memo-climate-programs" target="_self"><u>tied to this OMB thing</u></a>. On Tuesday night, [the OMB memo] <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-f9948b9996c0ca971f0065fac85737ce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was blocked</u></a>, and then on Wednesday, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-6d41961940585544fa43a3f66550e7be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it was rescinded</u></a>. And all of that’s happening in real time with everybody in the country — not just us citizens, but employees as well. Bureaucrats going, <em><em>we’re learning about this by tweet, too! </em></em>And then on Wednesday, we learned in real time with our partners that [the pause in funding] was actually <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>from an executive order</u></a>, not from the OMB memo. We made the decision that day to furlough our employees. If this goes for 90 days, it’ll be six months of us not getting paid on our largest source of revenue. </p><p><strong>Have the farmers and small businesses that you work with had to halt their in-process projects? </strong></p><p>It varies for each project. We have a handful of solar projects that are up, and we’re just waiting on a utility interconnection. So those projects we’re finishing. We’ve got equipment like new washing machines en route to a rural laundromat. That’s going to still happen, because he’s already bought them, but his second invoice is going to become due when those show up on site. So he doesn’t really know what’s going on and how to pause that. But if you haven’t started on your project, we’re advising people to not take on more risk by spending money and [instead] just pausing [their projects]. </p><p><strong>I know it’s only been a few days, but what efforts have you made thus far to get in touch with the federal government? </strong></p><p>I’ve got a long list of people that we’re trying to get in touch with. I’ve told all of our customers — many of whom are in the GOP in eastern Washington and northern Idaho — to call their representatives, as well as if they have Twitter, tweet at Donald Trump. So we’re trying to empower our customers to really advocate for their projects, and that’s our main focus. </p><p>I’m sure a majority of our customers voted for Donald Trump and voted for the GOP representatives, and we just want them to really explain how this is damaging their business and their farm. </p><p><strong>Given that many of your customers support President Trump, what has their reaction to this funding freeze been like? </strong></p><p>Everybody expected that funding would continue. That was the message that we were getting from the USDA — the obligated funds have been obligated, the government has signed a contract. So everybody was surprised about that. But I’ll be honest, their reactions are mixed. Some farmers are furious. They have spent this money. They have taken on a risk. They did so with the expectation that the government would honor their contract. So that’s one category. We have another category of farmer that kind of lumps this into weather — things they can’t control. There’s much more understanding if you did vote for Donald Trump. We have had a farmer say, “Maybe they’ll find some waste and it’ll filter through, and we’ll eventually get paid. We can’t control that, but this might be a good thing for our country.” To which I replied, I want the filter first, not second!</p><p>But nobody thinks that their project doesn’t fit this mold of unleashing American energy. Nobody is really doubting that they might eventually get paid, because this is aligned with what everybody wants. We’re helping farmers take control of their costs, generate onsite power, or conserve energy through upgrades that really benefit their bottom line and really improve their own farm. We’re helping them reinvest in themselves through the process. We prioritize Made in America equipment wherever possible. We want to see these tax dollars and these incentives stay in the country. So we’ve actually never had a farmer choose to go with a non-Made in America solar system. </p><p><strong>Even if this funding pause ends soon, how do you think about the future of your organization given President Trump’s apparent antipathy toward renewable energy and energy efficiency projects — or at least language that highlights any sustainability-related benefits? </strong></p><p>If we’re going to go and apply for more contracts to the USDA, one of my big concerns right now is if we’re talking about [renewable energy and energy efficiency], are we going to get blacklisted from doing the work that we do in rural Washington? We have always been, with our customer base, really focused on finance, cost savings, practicality — and then all of the decarbonization benefits of this stuff is very secondary for all of our projects. </p><p>When I named the company, all of those things were also in question, right? I called a farmer and said, “Hi, it’s David Funk from Zero Emissions Northwest.” And they said, “What? You don’t fart?” And he hung up on me. We think about, how are we being viewed by our customers? And with the politicalization of language, are we losing out on a market segment that we could be helping, just because somebody looks at our name and says, well, I’m not gonna work with them? It’s an active discussion always, how we present ourselves on paper. </p>

## Several government web pages have gone dark complying with Trump orders

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

Several U.S. government web pages changed or went dark Friday as agencies scrambled to comply with President Donald Trump's executive orders declaring his administration would recognize only two genders and ordering an end to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.


In a letter sent Wednesday, the Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to terminate grants and contracts related to “gender ideology,” ask staff to remove pronouns from their government emails and disband resource groups on the issue, too. The directive, which ordered agencies to institute changes by 5 p.m. Friday, also asked agencies to remove the term “gender” from government forms and swap it out with “sex.”




Here is a list of changes and missing pages seen so far. Several pages have popped up since being taken down, some with changes:


National Park Service pages for historic sites related to the internment of Japanese Americans, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Stonewall Uprising for gay rights were inaccessible. The Tuskegee site was back online a short time later, but the others remained down Friday evening.


The State Department removed the “X” gender marker and replaced “gender” with “sex” on online consular forms. A page with tips for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex travelers was altered. It's now titled “LGB Travelers” instead of “LGBTQIA+ Travelers."


The Census Bureau's homepage was down. Links to reports and topic pages outlining details about the gender identity, sexual orientation and characteristics of the nation’s population returned errors. A message Friday afternoon for one topic page titled “Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity” read, “The area of census.gov that you are trying to access is currently unavailable due to maintenance.” Another page titled “Mental Health Struggles Higher Among LGBT Adults Than Non-LGBT Adults in All Age Groups” also was unavailable. Archives of both pages show they were accessible within the past week. The bureau’s homepage was up Saturday morning.


Intelligence Community Inspector General reports were scrubbed from the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Trump previously fired around 17 inspectors general — known as independent government watchdogs — at multiple federal agencies.


A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled “Inmate Gender” was relabeled “Inmate Sex” on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in federal prisons was no longer included.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website took down much public health information: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems. The agency also removed its data repository, data.cdc.gov. A message said “the website will resume operations once in compliance” with Trump's executive order.


In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately stop recognizing identity months, including Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Disability Employment Awareness Month and National American Indian Heritage Month.

## Trump marks Black History Month while Pentagon declares 'identity months dead'

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Trump White House issued a proclamation Friday recognizing February as Black History Month around the same time the U.S. Defense Department issued guidance declaring "identity months dead.”


The conflicting messages came as President Donald Trump has been targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs for removal in the first weeks of his administration. He has referred to DEI initiatives as “discrimination” and insisted that the country must instead move toward a merit-based society.


The White House proclamation calls for “public officials, educators, librarians and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities," though there is no elaboration on what constitutes “appropriate.”


A news release from the Defense Department titled “Identity Months Dead at DOD" says official resources, including working hours, will no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months. Black History Month, Women's History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month were among the events listed as now barred.


“We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics,” the Defense Department release read.


In his first two weeks in office, Trump has moved to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal DEI workers be put on paid leave before eventually being laid off. On Thursday, hours after a midair collision between a military helicopter and an American Airlines plane killed 67 people just miles from the White House, Trump baselessly blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air safety, despite no evidence of that.


Gerald Ford in 1976 became the first president to issue a message recognizing February as Black History Month. Since then, presidents have made annual proclamations marking the month as a celebration of Black history, culture and education.


Trump's proclamation Friday specifically noted the contributions of abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, conservative economist Thomas Sowell and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. It said their achievements “have monumentally advanced the tradition of equality under the law in our great country” and are a continued inspiration.


The declaration also listed golfer Tiger Woods as an American great, saying he was among those who have “pushed the boundaries of excellence in their respective fields, paving the way for others to follow.”


“This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age,” the proclamation said, “I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my administration.”

## Democrats to elect leader as party struggles to regroup

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

OXON HILL, MARYLAND — Democrats, seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration, will elect a new leader Saturday in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party's future.


More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have gathered in suburban Washington for the election, which features a slate of candidates dominated by party insiders. Outgoing Chair Jaime Harrison is not seeking reelection.


Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly went wrong.


Facing an emboldened Trump presidency, however, the leading candidates are talking tough. “As we reel with shock at the horror that Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and a DNC chair who’s ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury to fight back,” said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chair and a top candidate for DNC chair.


The election comes less than two weeks after Trump's inauguration and as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate political strategy and repair the party's brand.


Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers a dramatic contrast with Trump's GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party.


The leading candidates for DNC chair, Wisconsin's Wikler and Minnesota’s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They're promising to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party's anti-Trump rapid response system. They have promised not to shy away from the party's dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day Democratic Party.


But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, is elected, as expected, either would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011.


Also in the race: Marianne Williamson, the activist and author; former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin O’Malley; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders’ last presidential campaign.


Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC. But he has struggled to gain traction. Shakir declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at this week's gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with crayons.


By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food.


Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win elections.


Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party. “As positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I’m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, ‘We’re in real trouble because I don’t see a desire to change,’” said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a candidate for DNC vice chair.

## Trump administration fires prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday fired a group of prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 criminal cases and demanded the names of FBI agents involved in those same probes so they can possibly be ousted, moves that reflect a White House determination to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees seen as insufficiently loyal.


Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the firings of the Jan. 6 prosecutors days after President Donald Trump’s sweeping clemency action benefiting the more than 1,500 people charged in the U.S. Capitol attack, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. About two dozen employees at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington were terminated, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel issues.


A separate memo by Bove identified more than a half-dozen FBI senior executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by Monday, and also asked for the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot — a list the bureau’s acting director said could number in the thousands. Bove, who has defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would then carry out a “review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.”


“As we’ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what’s in the best interest of the workforce and the American people — always,” acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll wrote in a letter to the workforce.


The prosecutors fired in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office had been hired for temporary assignments to support the Jan. 6 cases but were moved into permanent roles after Trump’s presidential win in November, according to the memo obtained by the AP. Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, said he would not “tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration.”


Any mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who investigated Trump.


The FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented “outrageous actions by acting officials” that were “fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents.”


“Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure,” the association said in a statement.


It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses that protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge.


When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees.


Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that don’t follow that standard process, Patel said, “I don’t know what’s going on right now over there, but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.”


Before he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called anti-Trump “conspirators” in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out.


Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks after his win in November.


Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: “No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after a lot of people.”


He added, “If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing, because they were very bad.”


The FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.


The Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, although Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments.


This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives — including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge of big-city field offices — have been told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday.

## Trump moves to cancel recent union agreements with federal workers

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

Donald Trump said Friday that any collective bargaining agreements reached with federal workers within 30 days of his inauguration will not be approved, the latest salvo in the U.S. president's bid to remake the federal workforce.


In a memo addressed to the heads of all executive departments and agencies, Trump said former U.S. President Joe Biden's administration purposefully finalized collective bargaining agreements with federal employees in its final days "in an effort to harm my administration by extending its wasteful and failing policies beyond its time in office."


It was not immediately clear how many agreements would be affected by the new policy, which refers to them as "lame-duck collective bargaining agreements."


Collective bargaining agreements are deals between unions and their employees that outline working conditions, pay and other policies.


The move comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a massive makeover of the U.S. government, firing and sidelining hundreds of civil servants in his first steps toward downsizing the bureaucracy and installing more loyalists.


The memo cites a U.S. Department of Education collective bargaining agreement reached three days before Trump took office that "generally prohibits the agency from returning remote employees to their offices."


Trump has signed an executive order that would require federal employees to work in-office five days a week, reversing a remote working trend that took off in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Mushers, dogs braved Alaska winter to deliver lifesaving serum 100 years ago

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the "strangling angel" for the way it suffocated children. 


Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors — the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver lifesaving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria. 


Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 "Great Race of Mercy" are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club. 


Alaskans honor 'heroic effort' 


"There's a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska," said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska's oldest newspaper, The Nome Nugget. 


"People just dropped whatever they were doing," she said. "These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail." 


Other communities are also marking the anniversary — including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum. 


Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team. 


A race to save lives


Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film on the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S. 


Nome, western Alaska's largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn't seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area. 


Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: "An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here." 


The first death was a 3-year-old boy on January 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine. 


West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle, Washington, and then onto a ship for Seward, Alaska, an ice-free port south of Anchorage, Alaska. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital. 




It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome. 


Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 1,086 kilometers (675 miles) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails. 


Thanks to Alaska's new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers — many of them Alaska Natives — with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn't see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus minus 51 degrees Celsius (60 degrees Fahrenheit).


The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke. 


Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 320 kilometers (250 miles) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound. 


After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on February 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed "Dogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome." 


The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It's likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked. 


Balto gains fame 




Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala's dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.


Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck. 


But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland, a city in Ohio. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. 




Iditarod pays homage to run 


Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1. 


"The Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska's pioneering spirit," Noonan said.

## What to know about the NTSB, the agency investigating the DC plane crash

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people brought renewed focus on the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters.


National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has described the investigation into the crash as an "all-hands-on-deck event" for the agency.


Here are some things to know about the NTSB:


What does the agency do?


The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels, pipelines and even commercial space operators.


"We're here to ensure the American people that we are going to leave no stone unturned in this investigation," Homendy said, noting the probe is in the very early stages. "We are going to conduct a thorough investigation of this entire tragedy, looking at the facts."


The agency has five board members who serve five-year terms and are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.


How will the investigation work?


For the investigation into Wednesday's crash, the NTSB will establish several different working groups, each responsible for investigating different areas connected to the accident, board member Todd Inman said.


Inman said those groups include operations, which will examine flight history and crewmember duties; structures, which will document airframe wreckage and the accident scene; power plants, which will focus on aircraft engines and engine accessories; systems, which will study the electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic components of the two aircraft; air traffic control, which will review flight track surveillance information, including radar, and controller-pilot communications; survival factors, which will analyze the injuries to the crew and passengers and crash and rescue efforts; and a helicopter group.


The investigation also will include a human-performance group that will be a part of the operations, air traffic control and helicopter groups and will study the crew performance and any factors that could be involved such as human error, including fatigue, medications, medical histories, training and workload, Inman said.


How long will the investigation take?


NTSB officials did not say Thursday how long the investigation would take, but accident investigations often take between one to two years to complete. The agency typically releases a preliminary report within a few weeks of the accident that includes a synopsis of information collected at the scene.


What is the NTSB's history?


The NTSB history dates to 1926, when Congress passed a law charging the U.S. Department of Commerce with investigating aircraft accidents. It was established as an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation in 1967 and then separated by Congress in 1974 as a stand-alone organization, fully independent from any other federal agencies. Since its creation in 1967, the agency reports it has investigated more than 153,000 aviation accidents and incidents.

## Trump’s funding block hits program for Burmese students, scholars

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block $45 million in U.S. federal funding for over 400 Burmese students has left many in shock and dismay as their scholarships were abruptly canceled.


The move also has raised concerns about the broader impact it could have on Burmese in Myanmar, a country already grappling with political turmoil and a collapsing education system under military rule.


Students in limbo


One Burmese student who studies at Chiang Mai University in Thailand told VOA that she feels completely lost after learning that her scholarship was being blocked.


"To be honest, I am lost because of this sudden loss of my scholarship. I had been studying with the goal of earning a degree, and now I don’t know what to do," she said. The student spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because she fears for her safety if she returns to Burma, which remains under military control.


She said students like her and others at different academic levels are now left without financial support.


"There are students doing two-year master’s degrees, others in four-year bachelor's programs, and even PhD students. I don’t know whether I should continue my studies, go home, or what my next step should be," she said.


An email sent to recipients of the program, which was shared with VOA’s Burmese Service, stated that USAID had "exercised its right to terminate" the Development and Inclusive Scholarship Program as of Jan. 29, 2025. The email expressed "surprise and disappointment" over the decision and assured students that officials are "looking closely at next steps." It did not confirm whether the scholarship would continue, though, for those who already had received it.


DISP originally was called the Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program but was recently renamed by USAID, replacing "Diversity" with "Development."


DISP was created to support Burmese students from marginalized and underprivileged backgrounds, giving them opportunities to study at universities across Asia, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand. The program also provided funding for online education through the University of Arizona.


For many, the initiative was their only chance to pursue higher education outside of Burma, where the junta-controlled education system has systematically restricted access for those opposing the military regime.


For some students, the immediate impact has been less severe.


Hlwan Paing Thi Ha, who has been studying at Chiang Mai University for a year, told VOA: "My education has already been paid for through the scholarship program, so it hasn’t impacted me yet. Other students pursuing bachelor’s, master’s and PhD degrees will be severely affected."


Future leaders affected


One source who has in-depth understanding of the program said the impact goes beyond just access to education and opportunities. The source spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the media.


More than a quarter of the Burmese students in the program have fled Myanmar due to the military coup, ongoing fighting and forced conscription, which has targeted youth.


"The impact is huge," the source said, adding that currently, more than 400 Burmese students are attending universities in four countries — the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand — through the USAID-funded program.


"Of these, 110 were directly recruited from Myanmar, while the rest are students who fled to border regions and Southeast Asian countries due to the military coup or boycotted Myanmar’s junta-controlled education system," the source said.


The program, which was launched in February 2024, was designed as a five-year initiative, with plans to recruit three batches of students over that period.


"The goal was to ensure that at least 1,000 Burmese students, the 'current and future leaders of the country,' could continue their studies in universities across the region. The second batch, which would include hundreds of students, is now in the final stage of the screening process," the source explained.


Debate continues


In Washington, a debate over the block and review continues.


On Tuesday, the State Department issued a waiver that exempts some humanitarian aid from the freeze. U.S. lawmakers have also voiced concerns, warning that the freeze will impact American soft power and give China an advantage.


On Wednesday, Trump defended the funding freeze, specifically calling out the $45 million allocated for diversity scholarships for Burmese students.


"We also blocked $45 million for diversity scholarships in Burma. Forty-five — that’s a lot of money for diversity scholarships in Burma. You can imagine where that money went," Trump said. "These were the types of payments and many others. I could stand here all day and tell you about things that we found, and we have to find them quickly because we want the money to flow to proper places."


Name threatens its demise?


Some note that in addition to the freeze, the name of the program may also leave it in a difficult position, with some worrying that the mention of diversity in its title could impact a substantive review of its impact.


The source with direct knowledge of the initiative for Burmese students told VOA that the program was swiftly terminated when the Trump administration began reducing foreign aid, and that its name, "Diversity and Inclusion," likely played a major role in its elimination.


"This program was one of the first to be cut as soon as the administration began making budget reductions in this area," the source said.




While all USAID-funded programs have been temporarily frozen, DISP appears to have been specifically blocked without any review, the source noted.


"USAID officials have not been able to explain why this program was halted so suddenly."


VOA reached out to the State Department to verify whether the Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was permanently blocked or still under review, and whether its name played a role in its swift termination.


In an email response to VOA, a State Department spokesperson referred to the president’s executive order on reevaluating and realigning United States foreign aid and the department spokesperson’s statement on its implementation.


The spokesperson reiterated Secretary of State’s Marco Rubio’s remarks during his confirmation hearing, emphasizing the U.S. government will ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and in the best interest of America.


The response did not clarify, however, whether DISP was individually reviewed before being blocked or if existing scholarship recipients would be allowed to complete their studies under prior funding commitments.


Lifeline for ethnic, religious minorities


The source with direct knowledge of the program also voiced concern the administration may not understand that the program has no connection to Myanmar’s military junta and was created solely to support young people who lost their education due to military oppression.


The Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was established to reflect Burma’s ethnic and religious diversity, giving equal opportunities to students from all backgrounds who have historically faced discrimination under the Burman-dominated and military-controlled education policies. Burman is the name of the main ethnic group in Myanmar.


Many recipients of the scholarship program belong to ethnic minority groups such as the Karen, Kachin, Shan, Chin and Rohingya, who have historically faced systemic discrimination in Burma’s education system.

## Health data, pages wiped from federal websites as Trump officials target 'gender ideology'

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

Public health data disappeared from websites, entire webpages went blank and employees erased pronouns from email signatures Friday as federal agencies scrambled to comply with a directive tied to President Donald Trump's order rolling back protections for transgender people.


The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip “gender ideology” from websites, contracts and emails in a memo sent Wednesday, with changes ordered to be instituted by 5 p.m. Friday. It also directed agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate grants and contracts related to the issue, and replace the term “gender” with “sex” on government forms.


Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: “The page you’re looking for was not found.” Some pages disappeared and came back intermittently.




Asked by reporters Friday about reports that government websites were being shut down to eliminate mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump said he didn’t know anything about it but that he’d endorse such a move.


“I don’t know. That doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me,” Trump said, adding that he campaigned promising to stamp out such initiatives.


Much public health information was taken down from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems.




Eliminating health resources creates dangerous gaps in scientific information, disease experts said. The Infectious Diseases Society of America, a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal of information about HIV and people who are transgender. Access is “critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic,” the organization’s leaders said.


A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled “Inmate Gender” was relabeled “Inmate Sex” on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in federal prisons was no longer included.


The State Department on Friday removed the option to select “X” as a gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants. It also replaced the word “gender” from the descriptor with the word “sex.”


All State Department employees were ordered to remove gender-specific pronouns from their email signatures. The directive, from the acting head of the Bureau of Management, said this was required to comply with Trump’s executive orders and that the department was also removing all references to “gender ideology” from websites and internal documents.


“All employees are required to remove any gender identifying pronouns from email signature blocks by 5:00 PM today,” said the order from Tibor Nagy. “Your cooperation is essential as we navigate these changes together.”


An official from the U.S. Agency for International Development said staffers were directed to flag the use of the word “gender” in each of thousands of award contracts. Warnings against gender discrimination are standard language in every such contract. The official spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, under a Trump administration gag order prohibiting USAID staffers from speaking with people outside their agency.


The official said staffers fear that programs and jobs related to inclusion efforts, gender issues and issues specific to women are being singled out and possibly targeted under two Trump executive orders.


Some Census Bureau and National Park Service pages were also inaccessible or giving error messages.


Trump's executive order, signed on his first day back in office, calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments.


Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately stop recognizing identity a day before the start of February's Black History Month, saying they “erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution.”

## Rights groups decry Trump’s plan to detain migrants in Guantanamo

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

Rights groups are pushing back against President Donald Trump’s order to detain undocumented migrants at the Migrant Operations Center at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. While migrants have been held in Guantanamo under previous administrations, these groups say what Trump is doing is different. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has this report.

## At least 7 people dead in Philadelphia plane crash, officials say

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA — At least seven people died when a medevac plane crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, including six Mexicans aboard the plane and one person who was on the ground, Mexico's president and Philadelphia's mayor said on Saturday. 


Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker told a press conference that the person who died on the ground had been in a car at the site of the crash. 


"Thus far, our count is that there are 19 injured victims," Parker said. 


Separately, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a post on X that she had asked consular officials to support the families of the six Mexican citizens who were on the plane and died when it crashed. 


Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, based in Mexico and licensed to operate in the United States, on Friday said its aircraft crashed with four crew members, one pediatric medical patient and the patient's mother on board. 


The child was a girl who had just completed treatment for a life-threatening condition at Shriners Children's Hospital and was on her way home with a destination of Tijuana, Shai Gold, who works on corporate strategy with Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, told CNN on Friday. Her mother was also aboard, he said.


Gold said the aircraft was operated by a seasoned crew and everyone involved in the company’s flights goes through rigorous training.


“When an incident like this happens, it’s shocking and surprising,” Gold told The Associated Press. “All of the aircraft are maintained. Not a penny is spared because we know our mission is so critical.”


Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at a news conference late Friday that officials expected fatalities in the “awful aviation disaster.”


A spokesperson for Temple University Hospital-Jeanes Campus, Jennifer Reardon, said they had treated six people with injuries related to the crash. Three of those people had since been released and the others were in fair condition. She wasn’t able to provide information about their injuries or where the people were when they sustained them.


The crash came just two days after the deadliest U.S. air disaster in a generation. On Wednesday night, an American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided in midair in Washington with an Army helicopter carrying three soldiers. There were no survivors.


The Philadelphia crash was the second fatal incident in 15 months for Jet Rescue. In 2023, five crewmembers were killed when their plane overran a runway in the central Mexican state of Morelos and crashed into a hillside.


In Philadelphia, a doorbell camera captured video of the plane plunging in a streak of white and exploding as it hit the ground near a shopping mall and major road.


“All we heard was a loud roar and didn’t know where it was coming from. We just turned around and saw the big plume,” said Jim Quinn, the owner of the doorbell camera.


The crash happened less than 5 kilometers from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights.


The Learjet 55 quickly disappeared from radar after taking off from the airport at 6:06 p.m. and climbing to an altitude of 487 meters. It was registered to a company operating as Med Jets, according to the flight tracking website Flight Aware.


Shortly after 6 p.m., audio recorded by LiveATC captured an air traffic controller telling “Medevac Medservice 056” to turn right when departing. About 30 seconds later it repeats the request before asking, “You on frequency?” Minutes later, the controller says, “We have a lost aircraft. We’re not exactly sure what happened, so we’re trying to figure it out. For now the field is going to be closed.”


In a post on the social media platform Truth Social, U.S. President Donald Trump said, “So sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia.”


“More innocent souls lost,” he said. “Our people are totally engaged.”


The FAA said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation. The NTSB said an investigator arrived Friday and more officials would be there Saturday.

## 'Black box' recovered from helicopter involved in Washington midair collision

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

U.S. investigators say the "black box" recorder from an Army Black Hawk helicopter was recovered Friday, as teams continue to search for clues into the midair collision that killed 67 people near Washington.


The Army helicopter and a commercial passenger jet collided late Wednesday as the jet was attempting to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.


Investigators said Friday evening that they are reviewing the flight data recorder along with two from the plane that they found Thursday as they try to understand what caused the crash over the Potomac River.


National Transportation Safety Board member J. Todd Inman told reporters Friday the helicopter’s recorder appeared to be intact.


"We saw no exterior damage that would indicate it was compromised at this time, so we have a high level of confidence we’ll have a full extraction," he said.


The NTSB is the federal agency leading the investigation into the accident.


The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of three. Officials say there were no survivors.


Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that 41 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage. Authorities said that they would likely be unable to extricate more victims from the plane without heavier equipment.




Inman said that barges from Virginia Beach will arrive Saturday to begin more extensive salvage operations. He said rescue workers will also make sure that the victims are recovered.


U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced Friday that most helicopters would not be allowed to travel through and near Reagan National Airport for the time being.


He wrote on social media platform X, "Today’s decision will immediately help secure the airspace near Reagan Airport, ensuring the safety of airplane and helicopter traffic."


Speaking Friday before the helicopter’s black box was found, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the recorder would likely determine who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash.


He said Thursday that the helicopter crew, which was conducting a night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a captain-in-training, and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor. The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them.


The defense secretary said the black box also could determine who was in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received.


Hegseth also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time of the accident was under investigation.


President Donald Trump said Friday that the Army helicopter was flying too high at the time of the crash.


"It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???" Trump said in a Friday morning post on his Truth Social platform.


Citing a government report, The Washington Post reported Thursday that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time of the collision.


A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision.


That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle both airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft.


The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is not considered optimal.


At a news conference Thursday, both Virginia U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said they had expressed concerns over the years regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but that they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting that specific concern.


During a White House news conference Thursday, Trump suggested previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, initiatives in the federal government for that.


He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last week.


The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the plane.


"We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts," the organization said.


The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of their remains to Russia.


Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.

## Venezuela frees 6 Americans after meeting between Maduro, Trump envoy

date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA

CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicolas Maduro after he met Friday with a senior Trump administration official.


U.S. President Donald Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media. Grenell posted on X a photo showing him and the men aboard an aircraft.


Grenell's trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was focused on Trump's efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the detained Americans.


"We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens," Grenell wrote on X. "They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn't stop thanking him."


The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped that Trump would continue the "maximum pressure" campaign he pursued against the authoritarian Venezuelan leader during his first term.


Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump's special envoy to Latin America, previewed Grenell's visit to Caracas in a conference call with journalists on Friday. He said Grenell, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, was in Venezuela on a "very specific mission" that in no way detracts from the Trump administration's goal of restoring democracy in the South American nation.


"I would urge the Maduro government, the Maduro regime in Venezuela, to heed special envoy Ric Grenell's message," said Claver-Carone, himself a former top national security aide to Trump during his first administration. "Ultimately there will be consequences otherwise."


The visit comes less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro's claim to victory.


Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro speaking in the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, the capital, and said the meeting had been requested by the U.S. government.


Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an administration that the Trump White House hasn't official recognized.


"No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I've been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro," Trump responded. "They've treated us not so good, but they've treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly."


Some Republicans criticized the visit.


"This is terrible timing," said Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. "A meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could've done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas."


Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans. Neither the White House nor Maduro's government immediately released the names of the six who were freed Friday.
