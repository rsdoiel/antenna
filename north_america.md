## Trump’s race for the world’s rare earth minerals

date: 2025-03-26, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The United States and Ukraine are weighing a deal that would give the U.S. a cut of revenues from Ukraine&#8217;s rare earth minerals. But Gracelin Baskaran, mining economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said rare earths aren&#8217;t all that rare. So why is the Trump administration scrambling to get its hands on these minerals from other countries? On the show today, Baskaran explains what rare earths are, why mining them isn&#8217;t always economically attractive, and what the U.S. is doing to try to catch up with China&#8217;s rare earth production. Plus, why recycling is only part of the solution.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll get into why Canadians are boycotting American vacations. And, how easy is it to get someone to dream about a tree or supply chain economics?</p>

## The Trump administration’s big group chat fail

date: 2025-03-24, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most of us can only wonder what goes on in U.S. national security leaders’ group chats, but The Atlantic’s Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg doesn&#8217;t have to. Last week, Goldberg was accidentally included in a Signal group chat with high-ranking members of the Donald Trump administration, in which they discussed imminent war operations. Yes, this actually happened. Plus, the whopping $2.1 billion verdict you might&#8217;ve missed over Roundup weed killer. And, we smile over what&#8217;s happened since congestion pricing went into effect in Manhattan — all while dropping some Latin vocab.</p>
