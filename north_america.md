## Trump nominates former aide Kash Patel to head FBI

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

Donald Trump’s nomination of Kash Patel, a loyalist of the U.S. president-elect, to be director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has added to the list of Trump’s unconventional appointments to top-level jobs in his nascent administration.


Trump named Patel, 44, to lead the country’s top criminal investigative agency on late Saturday, saying he “is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people.”


Patel held three defense, intelligence and national security posts in the first Trump administration but has endeared himself to the incoming chief executive by vowing to clean out the “deep state” at the FBI. He also said he would launch a campaign of retribution against Trump’s adversaries, including FBI agents who have investigated the once-and-future president, journalists and others. 


During his first term, Trump suggested naming Patel as the deputy FBI director, but then-Attorney General William Barr, now a Trump critic, said the appointment would only occur “over my dead body.” 


Patel has vowed to close the FBI headquarters in Washington and dispatch many of its agents across the country to fight crime, not launch more intelligence-gathering operations.


Trump’s first hurdle in installing Patel as the FBI director is that there already is an FBI director, Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump and whose 10-year term extends to 2027.  


Trump would have to fire Wray or Wray would have to resign before Patel could take over. FBI directors are appointed to decade-long terms by design, so that their tenures and investigative directives are not subject to the political whims of the moment. But Trump already fired one FBI director, James Comey, in 2017, before naming Wray. 


Trump says the FBI is “badly broken” and has “lost the confidence of America.” 


Patel faces a Senate confirmation hearing and is likely to face tough questioning about how he would run the agency and oversee its more than 10,000 criminal investigative agents and another 25,000 staff members.  


Patel’s appointment comes on top of other unconventional Trump appointments: vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to oversee the health and human services department, talk show host Pete Hegseth, a decorated military officer with scant managerial experience, to be the Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic-congresswoman-turned-staunch-Trump-defender, as director of national intelligence. 


Trump’s first nominee to be attorney general, former Congressman Matt Gaetz, dropped out after eight days as he faced widespread scrutiny of his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; charges Gaetz has denied.   


Some Republican senators praised Patel’s appointment. Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate next year, meaning Patel could lose the support of three senators and still be confirmed, with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote if needed. 


Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Patel "represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI. ... The entire agency needs to be cleaned out." 


“There are serious problems at the FBI,” Hagerty said. “The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel's just the type of person to do it."  

Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said Patel was a "very strong nominee" and he thought Patel would be confirmed. 


"All of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI," Cruz told CBS' "Face the Nation." 


A third Republican, Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said, "Every president wants people that are loyal to themselves." But he called Wray "a very good man,” adding, "I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now." 


Democrats are almost certain to oppose the nomination. 


Senator Chris Murphy told NBC, "Patel's only qualification is that he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should punish, lock up and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents."

## 'Moana 2' has record $221 million opening, Hollywood celebrates moviegoing feast

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

New York — Christmas came early at the box office this year. “Moana 2” brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with “Wicked” and “Gladiator II,” made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of blockbusters more like what’s often found in late December.


Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” but the film — originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to the big screen — blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for “Frozen 2” in its second week of release in 2019.) “Moana 2” added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year.


At the same time, the sensation of “Wicked” showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, “Wicked” is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over “Grease.” (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)


“Gladiator II,” meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott’s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, “Gladiator II” has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.


Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore — more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood’s blockbuster machine. Before “Wicked,” “Moana 2” and “Gladiator II” arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.


Michael O’Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners, said the weekend showed what’s possible when “all the pieces of the puzzle come together” in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle.


“We’re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,” he said. "The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We’re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.”


Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar — 2023's much-ballyhooed “Barbenheimer" — the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, “Venom: The Last Dance," for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful.


“For a long, long time in Hollywood, there’s been a belief that you don’t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,” said O'Leary. “But the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It’s good for the movies. It’s good for the studios. It’s good for the theater owners. But it’s particularly good for the moviegoing public.”


“Moana 2” was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original “Moana," after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of “Moana 2," with Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.


“It just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “Whoever made that decision to go big screen globally with ‘Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.”


And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two animated November releases — “Strange World” and “Wish” — fizzled in theaters. “Moana 2” may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for the studio in 2024, along with “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool & Wolverine.” Though reviews for “Moana 2" have only been 65% “fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an “A-” CinemaScore.


“Moana 2” is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing. According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined.


After such large debuts, “Moana 2” and “Wicked” are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be if this year's Christmas movies — historically a much bigger holiday period for theaters — can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup. Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney's “Mufasa: The Lion King,” Paramount's “Sonic the Hedgehog 3" and Searchlight's “A Complete Unknown,” with Timothee Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan.


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:

1. "Moana 2," $135 million.

2. “Wicked,” $80 million.

3. “Gladiator II” $30.7 million.

4. “Red One,” $12.9 million.

5. “The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,” $3.3 million.

6. “Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin,” $2.4 million.

7. “Venom: The Last Dance,” $2.2 million.

8. “Heretic,” $956,797.

9. “The Wild Robot,” $670,000.

10. “A Real Pain,” $665,000.

## Heavy snow and numbing temperatures keep parts of the US in deep freeze

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

LOWVILLE, N.Y.  — Heavy snowfall and numbing temperatures kept parts of the U.S. in a deep freeze Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday weekend draws to a close. Despite the Arctic-type weather, however, snowmobilers and skiers are reveling in their respective wintry terrains, and weather forecasters gave possible good news ahead of the NFL game in Buffalo.


In the remote Tug Hill region of upstate New York, where lake-effect snow off Lake Ontario can dump several centimeters of snow at a time, there was up to 117 centimeters in the Barnes Corners area.


“We just keep digging out,” Kevin Tyo, a local businessman, said Sunday. “We were out all day yesterday, plowing.”


Like many locals, he has a plow attached to the front of his truck for much of the winter, “and I have a tractor with a bucket, and a snowblower.”


His advice? “If you’re not used to it, stay home. If you’re out, slow down.”


Buffalo Bills kickoff set for Sunday night 


In Buffalo, officials with the NFL’s Bills had sought stadium snow shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night’s game against the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and provide food and hot drinks.


A lake-effect storm began hitting the area Saturday near the Bills’ stadium in Orchard Park, New York. Snow was continuing to fall near the stadium just hours ahead of the game, according to the State Weather Risk Communication Center in New York.


“Snowfall totals will be highly dependent on whether the current lake effect snow shifts just south of the stadium, or remains in place over the stadium longer,” the center said in a post on the social media site X.


Some motorists stuck for hours along New York-Pennsylvania border


Christine Schintzius, her 4- and 8-year-old sons and 12- and 15-year-old nieces had set out on clear roads Friday from Wales, New York, southeast of Buffalo. The family planned to attend a travel hockey tournament in Cleveland but instead found themselves snowbound for 19 hours, stuck inside Schintzius' Honda Pilot.


The family ran into seemingly endless lines of stopped traffic, first on Interstate 90 near the New York-Pennsylvania border for 9 hours, and again on Route 5 in Pennsylvania for 10 hours, until being plowed out by some residents.


“There were lines and lines of cars. It was packed, there was tons of people, tons,” Schintzius said by phone Sunday.


While stuck on Route 5, Schintzius never turned off her car, afraid it wouldn’t start again in the frigid cold. Two truckers stopped to check on them during the night. In the morning the police checked in, along with a local resident who walked the line of cars with a basket of muffins, handing them out and making sure the stranded drivers had water.


“Thankfully, all of my kids, my nieces, all travel well,” said Schintzius, who had packed a cooler with lunch meats, snacks, yogurt and fruit. "And luckily I had still basically a full tank of gas.”


When they were finally free of the backup Saturday, Schintzius turned around and took a roundabout route home, avoiding the worst of the snow that was still falling.


“We went completely around the storm because I was worried, like I’m not getting stuck in that ever again,” she said.


Arctic air late last week brings bitter temperatures


A blast of Arctic air late last week brought bitter temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 degrees Celsius to minus 7 degrees Celsius) below average to the Northern Plains, the National Weather Service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees (minus 12 degrees Celsius) below average.


Officials in Erie, Pennsylvania, said Sunday that the heavy lake-effect snow has produced “treacherous” conditions that are causing even snowplows to get stuck as they work around the clock to try to clear city roads.


The city estimated Sunday morning that there were “about 100 cars throughout the city that are blocking roads and need to be towed out of the way so plows can get through.”


Commercial vehicles remained banned in both directions of I-90 in western New York along a nearly 216-kilometer stretch to the Pennsylvania line. The National Weather Service said lake-effect snow was expected to continue east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on Sunday, with additional snowfall of 30 to 60 centimeters possible.


New York, Pennsylvania declare emergencies


In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state to assist.


“I know it’s something they’re all accustomed to and they can handle, but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy holiday weekend,” she said.


Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation Saturday and said parts of Erie County in the northwest received nearly 61 centimeters of snow with more expected through Monday night.


Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania.


Michigan battered by lake-effect snow


Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 61 centimeters or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan.


Motorists were warned of potentially dangerous road conditions for holiday travel on Sunday. 


“Expect rapid changes in traveling conditions in and out of snow bands, including snow covered, slick roads, and reduced visibility,” the National Weather Service said Sunday.


There were 69 centimeters of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, and another 61 centimeters in Munising, in the eastern area. 


Lake-effect snow could add more than 30.5 centimeters over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 15 to 25 centimeters or higher to the west, Chapman said Saturday.


Gaylord, Michigan, received 63 centimeters of snow Friday, setting a new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger of the weather service’s Gaylord office. The previous record of 43 centimeters was set March 9, 1942.


Joseph Delizio, a weather service meteorologist based in Gaylord, said heavy snow, especially lake-effect snow, isn’t unusual this time year, “but that magnitude certainly is not.”


“We’ve got more snow in the forecast, believe it or not,” he added.


The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 32 hectares of ski hill terrain among its 809 hectares. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort's season opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said.


“Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,” Hoeh said.

Los Angeles has approved a so-called sanctuary city ordinance. It’s a response to President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations when he assumes the presidency in January. The ordinance won’t stop federal officials from deporting undocumented immigrants, but it reinforces the city’s vow to protect its immigrant population. Angelina Bagdasaryan has the story, narrated by Anna Rice. Camera: Vazgen Varzhabetian

## US will not return nuclear weapons to Ukraine

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.


Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he leaves office.


"That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not [giving them] nuclear capability," he told ABC.


Last week, Russia said the idea was "absolute insanity" and that preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.


Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.

## Biden to spotlight Angola’s Lobito Corridor, his legacy to counter China in Africa

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — When U.S. President Joe Biden visits Angola on Wednesday, he will put into focus his legacy infrastructure project aimed at securing crucial supply chains on the African continent. Called the Lobito Corridor, the project is the centerpiece of his administration’s strategy to counter China’s clout in global development.


The Lobito Corridor is a $5 billion investment across multiple sectors that is intended to revitalize and extend the 1,300-kilometer Benguela railway line. It will connect the 120-year-old Angolan port of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in its second phase, to Zambia.


Announced in September 2023, much of the corridor’s financing comes from the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The PGI is a Biden-led 2022 initiative from the Group of Seven wealthiest economies that evolved from his Build Back Better World plan launched in 2021 as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.




Once operational, it will boost access to critical minerals for the United States and its partners, including cobalt and copper, that are essential in electric vehicle manufacturing. According to a U.S. congressional report, 80% of the DRC’s copper mines are Chinese owned. China is responsible for mining 85% of the DRC’s rare earth minerals, including 76% of its cobalt.




The Lobito Corridor is expected to cut transportation costs, open access to arable agricultural land and drive climate-resilient economic growth, Helaina Matza, acting special coordinator for the PGI at the U.S. Department of State, said Tuesday in a briefing to reporters.


The PGI’s investments will “amplify the impact of that infrastructure” with projects such as developing solar energy, local electricity networks and desalination efforts, she said.


The project is championed by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Angola owes about $17 billion to China, more than a third of its total debt. The debt is mostly in the form of infrastructure development loans, backed by oil, that funded the country’s economic recovery following three decades of civil war that ended in 2002.


PGI to counter BRI


Since launching the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, in 2013, China has become the main backer of global development financing. In Africa, Beijing has signed loan commitments with 49 African governments and seven regional institutions.


From 2013 to 2021, China provided $679 billion for infrastructure projects around the world, according to a U.S. government analysis, while the U.S. provided $76 billion.


The U.S., alongside G7 partners, announced in 2022 that the PGI aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 as an alternative to infrastructure financing models that are “often opaque, fail to uphold environmental and social standards, exploit workers and leave the recipient countries worse off.”


That’s a lot of financing to catch up to in a few years, and Lobito is “the first and the most developed” project in that effort, said Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.


“That's the A+ project, but I don’t see a whole lot of other projects,” Schneidman told VOA.


The PGI’s other project, the Luzon Corridor, was launched in April to support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in the Philippines.


In Lobito, the U.S. works mostly with European partners. In Luzon, the U.S. is teaming up with Japan to secure critical industries such as semiconductors.


The White House pushed back against the notion that Biden has scaled back his global infrastructure ambitions to the two corridors.


“We’ve mobilized more than $60 billion, just the U.S., and that’s a part of the larger G7,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA during a briefing last month.


“And that’s not just been for two corridors,” he said. “That’s been for investments across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.”


US-Africa strategy


In August 2022, the Biden administration launched an Africa strategy that “reframes the region’s importance to U.S. national security interests,” the strategy says.


Later that year, Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where he pledged the U.S. to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years.


“We are overdelivering on that thus far,” Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said in a briefing Tuesday. “We’ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.”


But much of that $55 billion was allocated under existing programs and does not bring the kind of megaproject that is “visible to the average African that says the United States financed that in the way that the Chinese do,” said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


Which is why the Lobito Corridor stands out, Dizolele told VOA. It is the “one palpable project that people can look at and say, ‘If this is implemented, then maybe it would move things forward.’”


On a continent where the presence of Chinese financing, businesses and migrants are so prevalent that many African countries teach Mandarin in schools and incorporate Chinese characters in public signage, that’s a start.


Moving forward, activists hope the U.S. will not set aside social and environmental concerns that have besieged projects under Chinese financing.


“We have to ensure that we can hear all stakeholders engaging in the process,” said Sergio Calundungo, founder of the Social Observatory of Angola.


So far, civil society groups have not been invited to the table, but they are ready to ensure that local communities can “share as much as possible the prosperity through this important infrastructure,” he told VOA.


Will it continue?


President-elect Donald Trump will enter office in January. While some are concerned that the U.S. commitment to Africa might falter under his America First doctrine, analysts point to initiatives taken under his first administration.


In 2018, the Trump administration launched Prosper Africa, an initiative that brings together U.S. government services to help investors do business on the continent. In 2019, it launched the Blue Dot Network, an international certification mechanism to ensure infrastructure projects meet environmental and social standards.




They were aware that infrastructure investments needed “to foster economic growth, to foster stability, but also for U.S. interests globally when competing with China,” said Joseph Lemoine, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center. “I'm hopeful that they will continue those efforts,” he told VOA.


Trump also launched the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in 2020. The DFC is an agency that functions as America’s development bank, with $60 billion in lending capacity.


DFC’s first CEO, Adam Boehler, a college roommate of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke openly of linking development aid to foreign policy goals. In a 2020 interview, he admitted promising $2 billion for Indonesia should the country agree to join the Trump administration's Abraham Accords and recognize Israel.


“If you listen to all the Trump people, they want a foreign policy that's transactional,” Schneidman at Brookings said.


Trump has promised to take a confrontational approach to China. Analysts say aligning infrastructure financing needs with Trump’s foreign policy goals may be an element in the U.S.-China rivalry that developing nations can leverage.

## Eggs are available but pricier as the holiday baking season begins

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

U.S. egg prices are rising once more as a lingering outbreak of bird flu coincides with the high demand of the holiday baking season.


But prices are still far from the recent peak they reached almost two years ago. And the American Egg Board, a trade group, says egg shortages at grocery stores have been isolated and temporary so far.


"Those are being rapidly corrected, sometimes within a day," said Emily Metz, the Egg Board's president and chief executive officer.


The average price for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities was $3.37 in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was down slightly from September, and down significantly from January 2023, when the average price soared to $4.82. But it was up 63% from October 2023, when a dozen eggs cost an average of $2.07.


Sometimes, supermarkets may be to blame for price spikes. During testimony in August in the Federal Trade Commission's case seeking to block Kroger's merger with Albertsons, Kroger's senior director for pricing acknowledged that the company has raised the cost of milk and eggs beyond the levels of inflation.


But there are other factors behind the price increases. Metz said the egg industry sees its highest demand in November and December, for example.


"You can't have your holiday baking, your pumpkin pie, your stuffing, without eggs," she said.


Avian influenza is another big reason for the higher prices. The current bird flu outbreak that began in February 2022 has led to the slaughter of more than 111 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens. Anytime the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease.




More than 6 million birds have been slaughtered just this month because of bird flu. They were a relatively small part of the total U.S. egg-laying flock of 377 million chickens. Still, the flock is down about 3% over the past year, contributing to a 4% drop in egg production, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.


The latest wave of bird flu is scrambling supplies of cage-free eggs because California has been among the hardest hit states. California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon all require eggs sold in their states to be cage-free.


"We're having to move eggs from other areas of the country that are producing cage-free to cover that low supply in those states, because those states only allow for cage-free eggs to be sold," Metz said.


Cage-free requirements are set to go into effect in Arizona, Colorado and Michigan next year and in Rhode Island and Utah in 2030.


Demand for such specialty eggs may also be contributing to avian flu, which is spread through the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past farms. Allowing chickens to roam more freely puts them at greater risk, said Chad Hart, a professor and agricultural economist at Iowa State University.


"It's really hard to control that interaction between domesticated birds and wild birds," Hart said. "Some of those vectors have been opened up because we're asking the egg industry to produce in ways that we didn't ask them to before."


Metz said climate change and extreme weather are also blowing some wild birds off course.


"We have birds that have been displaced by hurricanes, by wildfires, and those birds are now circulating in areas that they otherwise might not circulate or at times of the year that they otherwise may not be circulating," she said. "And those are all new variables that our farmers are having to deal with."


Hart said the egg industry is trying to rebuild the flock, but that also can limit supplies, since farmers have to hold back some eggs to hatch into new chickens.


Still, there is some good news on U.S. poultry farms. The price of chicken feed — which represents 70% of a farmer's costs — has fallen significantly after doubling between 2020 and 2022, Hart said.

## More sand is in sight for a Jersey Shore resort town's deteriorating beaches

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

NORTH WILDWOOD, NEW JERSEY — A decade-long conflict over the condition of a New Jersey resort town's beaches, involving tens of millions of dollars in litigation and fines, could come to an end soon.  


Patrick Rosenello, the mayor of North Wildwood, says his town has reached an agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to drop claims on both sides and move forward with measures to widen beaches in the community, popular with tourists from the Philadelphia area.  


The agreement, which is up for a vote Tuesday by North Wildwood's council, would resolve all outstanding disputes between the parties, the Republican mayor said. The tentative timing of the replenishment is sometime in 2025, he said.  


The agreement includes canceling the $12 million New Jersey has fined North Wildwood for unauthorized beach repairs that the state says could actually worsen erosion. It also calls for the city to drop a lawsuit against the state seeking reimbursement for the $30 million it has spent trucking in sand for emergency repairs to eroded sections of its beach over the past decade.   




“We agreed that we will concentrate on protecting our beaches instead of suing each other,” Rosenello said Wednesday.  


At the root of the dispute is the fact that North Wildwood is virtually the only Jersey Shore community that has yet to receive a full beach replenishment project from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Officials say difficulty in getting easements from affected property owners has contributed to the delay.  


Erosion had become so bad in parts of North Wildwood that protective sand dunes were obliterated, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to flooding and wave damage in the event of a major storm, At one point in January, Rosenello posed for photos on the beach with what was left of a dune barely reaching his knees.  


The state Department of Transportation did an interim replenishment project last summer after Democratic Governor Phil Murphy called the erosion in North Wildwood “shocking.” Rosenello said that work has held up well in the ensuing months.  


The environmental department declined to comment on the proposed agreement. Rosenello predicted it will be approved by the council and signed and sent to the state Tuesday.  


In addition to ending the litigation, North Wildwood will contribute $1 million to the eventual cost of the federal beach replenishment project once it arrives in the city, and will pay $700,000 into a state water pollution control fund, the mayor said.  


The agreement also lays out a clear regulatory path for North Wildwood to obtain the environmental permits it needs to carry out other shore protection work including extension of a sea wall.  


On several occasions, North Wildwood carried out emergency repairs, including construction of an earlier bulkhead without approval from the state. Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environment protection commissioner, warned the town in 2023 that unauthorized work could have more serious consequences if it continues, including potential loss of future shore protection funding.

## US proposes new habitat protections in southern Rockies for Canada lynx

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

BILLINGS, MONTANA — U.S. wildlife officials finalized a recovery plan for imperiled populations of Canada lynx on Wednesday and proposed new habitat protections in the southern Rocky Mountains for the forest-dwelling wildcats that are threatened by climate change.


The fate of the proposal is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump: Officials during the Republican's first term sought unsuccessfully to strip lynx of protections that they've had since 2000 under the Endangered Species Act.


Almost 20,000 square kilometers of forests and mountains in Colorado and northern New Mexico are covered under the habitat proposal. That's different from a previous plan that left out the southern Rockies and concentrated instead on recovery efforts elsewhere, including Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota and Maine.


"This is a significant change and a good one," said Matthew Bishop, an attorney for Western Environmental Law Center who has been involved in efforts to protect lynx through court actions. "They weren't really committing to conserve lynx in Colorado anymore, and now they are."


Areas of protected habitat also are being added in Idaho and Montana. Protected areas in Wyoming would be sharply reduced under Wednesday's proposal.


Wildlife officials said they were removing locations where they consider lynx unlikely to thrive in the future, while adding new areas that the latest science suggests are more suitable to their long-term survival.


Lynx are elusive animals that live in cold boreal forests and prey primarily on snowshoe hares.


They originally received federal protections because the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management didn't have sufficient regulations in place to shield their populations from potential harm. Those protective rules are now in place, but climate change has emerged as a new, worsening threat.




Warmer temperatures are melting away the lynx's snowy habitat and could decrease the availability of snowshoe hares. Declines for lynx are expected across the contiguous U.S. under even the most optimistic warming scenario that officials have considered.


Most areas suitable for lynx are in Canada and Alaska, where the animals are widespread and hunting and trapping of them is allowed.


Their numbers never were great in the contiguous U.S., which is at the southern fringe of the species range, but the hope is to maintain some population strongholds so they can persist in a warmer world.


The changes announced Wednesday follow a 2016 court ruling that faulted federal wildlife officials for not designating protections for lynx habitat in Colorado and some parts of Montana and Idaho.


There are more than 1,100 lynx in the contiguous U.S., according to estimates from scientists. Those numbers are expected to plummet in some areas, and officials are aiming for a minimum contiguous U.S. population of a combined 875 lynx over a 20-year period.


More than 200 lynx were reintroduced in Colorado beginning in 1999 and at the time their prospects were considered uncertain.


"There were concerns about whether it would stick," said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lynx biologist Jim Zelenak. "But they do seem to be hanging on."


Now that area could become one of the future population strongholds, with the southern Rockies in Colorado and the region around Yellowstone National Park are most likely to have temperatures favorable to lynx for the longest time, he said.


Maine has the most lynx currently but is expected to be hit harder by climate change.


"We've got this overarching threat of climate warming, and so we want to do everything we can to minimize the effects that we can control," Zelenak said. "So we don't want to put roads in the wrong places. We don't want to permanently convert very much of the habitat at all in the hopes that we can keep these populations viable coming into a warming future."


Habitat protections in Maine and Minnesota would remain unchanged under the proposal.


A final decision is expected late next year.

## President-elect Trump has sought Orban's take on Ukraine war, sources say

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has held multiple phone conversations with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban since winning the November 5 presidential election, according to sources who spoke to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service.


Hungarian government sources said Trump has sought Orban’s opinion on ending the Ukraine war, which has continued to drag on since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022.


On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the billions of dollars that the United States has poured into Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion.


He has also said he could end the war within 24 hours of retaking the White House, a statement that some have interpreted as meaning that Ukraine would have to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.


Orban, who has maintained friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, has been critical of EU aid for Ukraine and has obstructed the bloc’s sanctions regime against Moscow.


Preparations reportedly are under way for Orban to take a second crack at a peace mission in December to bookend Hungary’s rotating EU presidency after his first attempt in July when Budapest’s tenure started.


In a move criticized by several EU leaders, Orban traveled to Moscow to meet Putin in July after a trip to Kyiv with a mystery ceasefire proposal for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He then traveled to China and finally the United States to meet Trump, who was then on the presidential campaign trail.


Details of a potential peace mission in December are not clear, but sources suggested to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service that it may involve delivering Trump’s messages to Zelenskyy, Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

## Trump set to nominate former prosecutor to head FBI

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he wanted former National Security official and loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI, signaling an intent to replace the bureau's current director, Christopher Wray.


Patel, who during Trump's first term advised both the director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense, has previously called for stripping the FBI of its intelligence-gathering role and purging its ranks of any employee who refuses to support Trump's agenda.


"The biggest problem the FBI has had, has come out of its intel shops. I'd break that component out of it. I'd shut down the FBI Hoover building on day one and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state," Patel said in a September interview on the conservative "Shawn Ryan Show."




"And I'd take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops. You're cops. Go be cops."


With the nomination of Patel, Trump, a Republican, seems to be preparing to oust Wray, a Republican first appointed by Trump. Wray's 10-year term at the FBI does not expire until 2027.


Asked about Patel's nomination, which will need Senate confirmation, an FBI spokesperson said on Saturday: "Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for."


FBI directors by law are appointed to 10-year terms as a means of insulating the bureau from politics.


Wray, whom Trump tapped after firing James Comey in 2017 for investigating his 2016 campaign, has been a frequent target of Trump supporters' ire.


During Wray's tenure, the FBI carried out a court-approved search at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to look for classified documents. He also has faced criticism for his oversight role of a directive by Attorney General Merrick Garland aimed at working to protect local school boards from violent threats and harassment.


Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions against Trump for his role in subverting the 2020 election and retaining classified documents, asked on November 25 the judges overseeing those cases to dismiss them before Trump takes office on January 20, citing a Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.


Wray had previously signaled no intention of stepping down early and was busy planning events well into his 2025 calendar, according to a person familiar with the matter.




Patel, 44, previously worked as a federal public defender and a federal prosecutor.


He was instrumental in working to lead House Republicans' probe into the FBI's 2016 investigation into contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia during his time as an aide to former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes.


Later, during Trump's first impeachment trial, ex-National Security Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned Patel was secretly serving as a back channel between Trump and Ukraine without authorization.


Patel denied those allegations.


After Trump left office in January 2021, Patel was one of several people Trump designated as a representative for access to his presidential records. He was one of the few former Trump administration officials who claimed, without evidence, that Trump had declassified all of the records in question.


He was later subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in connection with the probe.


Also Saturday, Trump named Chad Chronister, the sheriff of Hillsborough County, Florida, as his choice for administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency. In that role, Chronister would work closely with Trump's choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.


Bondi is from the Tampa area that Chronister serves.




"As DEA Administrator, Chad will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES," Trump wrote on his social-media platform Truth Social.


Trump also named real estate mogul Charles Kushner to serve as U.S. ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.


"He (Charles Kushner) is a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker, who will be a strong advocate representing our Country & its interests," Trump said in a post on Truth Social announcing the pick.

## Biden makes historic first visit by US president to Angola

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden is "excited" to make his first trip to the African continent next week and will first stop briefly in the small island nation of Cabo Verde before making landfall in the Southwest African nation of Angola, a top White House official told VOA Friday.


"He is excited and really looking forward to the trip," Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, told VOA at the White House. "I think the president really sees this as a way to sum up all that he's tried to put forward during this administration on our Africa strategy."


While there, she said, he will work on three objectives: on bolstering regional security, notably in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo; on growing economic opportunities in the region; and on improving technological and scientific cooperation.




"He sees Angola as the perfect place for this," she said.


Some analysts say the fulfillment of Biden's vow to visit Africa — made in 2022 — is well overdue. Biden originally planned to visit Angola in October; he postponed that trip because Hurricane Milton was bearing down on the eastern United States.


"I think coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of his involvement in Africa, that I think the visit will ring rather hollow," Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA.


The main attraction of the short visit is a major U.S.-financed development project: the 1,300-kilometer Lobito rail corridor, which connects the mineral-rich African interior to the southwestern port. The U.S. says it has pulled together more than $4 billion in U.S. investment on the project.


When asked by VOA if Biden will attempt to discuss Angola's many documented human rights problems, Brown repeated a refrain often voiced by Biden administration officials, saying: "he never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts."


The short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde could be seen as a way to balance this concern, Michael Walsh, a visiting researcher at the Lasky Center of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, told VOA.


"They're trying to, you know, add a stop that provides an opportunity for the Biden administration to say, look, we actually are visiting a flawed democracy as well as a hybrid regime," he said.


He added, "That provides them with an opportunity to try to, I guess, mitigate some of the criticism that would be forthcoming during the visit by saying that the Biden administration isn't just stopping in one African country. They actually stopped in two and one of those is on the other side of the democracy spectrum."


Angola's president, Joao Lourenco, is a prominent figure on the African continent, using his status as leader of a subcontinental oil giant to build his influence and to work to settle conflicts near and far, both in neighboring Congo and in the West African "coup belt." This, Brown said, ties into one of Biden's core beliefs as he prepares to leave office: That the U.S. sees African nations as partners and problem-solvers.


While there, she said, Biden plans to deliver remarks on how he sees the future of relations between Washington and the continent.


"I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that's why he'll be amplifying Angola's role mediating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere," she said. "And I think he wants to convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-African relationship over many centuries."

## Trump names pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner for US ambassador

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.


Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, calling Charles Kushner “a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker."


Kushner is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. Jared Kushner is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka.


The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations.


Prosecutors alleged that after Charles Kushner discovered his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation.


Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden camera and the recording sent to his own sister, the man’s wife, prosecutors said.


Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion and witness tampering. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison — the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought.


Christie has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump’s transition team in 2016, and has called Charles Kushner’s offenses "one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was U.S. attorney."


Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009.

## Activists: Mexico breaks up 2 migrant caravans heading to US

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

TAPACHULA, Mexico — Mexican immigration authorities have broken up two small migrant caravans headed to the U.S. border, activists said Saturday. 


Some migrants were bused to cities in southern Mexico, and others were offered transit papers. 


The action comes a week after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican products unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. 


On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day that "migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border." 


Migrant rights activist Luis Garcia Villagran said the breaking-up of the two caravans appeared to be part of "an agreement between the president of Mexico and the president of the United States." 


The first of the caravans started out from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, on November 5, the day Trump was elected. At its height it had about 2,500 people. In almost four weeks of walking, it had gone about 270 miles (430 kilometers) to Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca. 


In Tehuantepec, Mexican immigration officials offered the tired migrants free bus rides to other cities in southern or central Mexico. 


"They took some of us to Acapulco, others to Morelia, and others from our group to Oaxaca city," said Barbara Rodriguez, an opposition supporter who left her native Venezuela after that country's contested presidential elections earlier this year. 


Rodriguez said by telephone she later caught a bus on her own to Mexico City. 


The second caravan of about 1,500 migrants set out on November 20 and made it about 140 miles (225 kilometers) to the town of Tonala, in Chiapas state. There, authorities offered a sort of transit visa that allows travel across Mexico for 20 days. 


Sheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. But her statement — the day after she held a phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. 


Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way, though some individual members have made it. 


For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border.

## Snow blankets parts of US during busy holiday travel weekend

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

BUFFALO, NEW YORK — The first big snowfall of the season blanketed towns along Lake Erie on Saturday in the middle of the hectic holiday travel and shopping weekend. Numbing cold and heavy snow are forecast to persist into next week and cause hazards in the Great Lakes, Plains and Midwest regions. 


The heavy snow led to a state of emergency declaration in parts of New York and a disaster declaration in Pennsylvania, with officials warning of dangerous conditions for Thanksgiving travelers trying to return home. 


"Travel will be extremely difficult and hazardous this weekend, especially in areas where multiple feet of snow may accumulate very quickly," the National Weather Service said. 


Part of I-90 in Pennsylvania was closed, as were westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Nearly 2 feet (61 centimeters) of snow fell in parts of New York, Ohio and Michigan, and 29 inches (73 centimeters) was recorded in Pennsylvania's northwestern tip. 


With roads in some parts impassable in northwestern Pennsylvania, scores of people took refuge overnight in the lobby and hallways of a fully booked Holiday Inn near I-90. Hotel staffer Jeremiah Weatherley said dozens of people rolled in as the snow piled up, and workers opened the conference room and gave them blankets to sleep on the floor. 


"It was hard to manage, but we had no choice," he said. "They just showed up, and we don't want to turn people away." 


Weatherley was handing out bagels, juice and cereal Saturday morning as people helped one another dig out their cars from the snow. 


"Everyone helped each other," he said. "It was pretty cool." 


This week's blast of Arctic air also brought temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the weather service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. 


Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the United States by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average. 


Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow that have been rolling off Lake Superior for the past three days buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61 centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's office in Marquette, Michigan. 


Twenty-seven inches (69 centimeters) of snow was on the ground just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula's western reaches, she said. Another 2 feet (61 centimeters) fell in Munising, in the eastern part of the peninsula. 


Chapman said continued lake-effect snow could add more than a foot (30.5 centimeters) over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) or higher to the west. 


Meanwhile steady winds that trained snow bands Friday on Gaylord, Michigan, dumped 24.8 inches (63 centimeters), setting a new single-day record for the city, which sits in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger, a meteorologist with the weather service's Gaylord office. The previous record of 17.0 inches (43 centimeters) was from March 9, 1942. 


The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80 acres (32 hectares) of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres (809 hectares), said Doug Hoeh, the resort's director of recreation. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will be adding to in the coming days before the resort opens for the season next weekend. 


"Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it's great for the snow hills, but it's bad for the parking lots, so we're kind of digging out," Hoeh said. "But we're close to being ready to pull the trigger on skiing, and the natural snowfall definitely helps." 


In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro signed a proclamation of disaster emergency and said parts of Erie County in the state's northwest had already received nearly 2 feet (1 meter) of snow with more expected through Monday night. 


State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said.

## Trump threatens BRICS nations with 100% tariff if they replace US dollar

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs Saturday against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. 


His threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRICS alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. 


Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members of the alliance, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. 


While the U.S. dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America's dominance of the global financial system. 


Trump, in a Truth Social post, said, "We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy." 


At a summit of BRICS nations in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of "weaponizing" the dollar and described it as a "big mistake." 


"It's not us who refuse to use the dollar," Putin said at the time. "But if they don't let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives." 


Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network, SWIFT, and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. 


Trump said there is "no chance" BRICS will replace the U.S. dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen "should wave goodbye to America."

## What to know about plastic pollution crisis as treaty talks conclude

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA — The world’s nations will wrap up negotiating a treaty this weekend to address the global plastic pollution crisis.


Their meeting is scheduled to conclude Sunday or early Monday in Busan, South Korea, where many environmental organizations have flocked to push for a treaty to address the volume of production and toxic chemicals used in plastic products.


Greenpeace said it escalated its pressure Saturday by sending four international activists to Daesan, South Korea, who boarded a tanker headed into port to load chemicals used to make plastics.


Graham Forbes, who leads the Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said the action is meant to remind world leaders they have a clear choice: Deliver a treaty that protects people and the planet, or side with industry and sacrifice the health of every living person and future generations.


Here’s what to know about plastics:


Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic.


The use of plastics has quadrupled over the past 30 years. Plastic is ubiquitous. And every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world’s oceans, rivers and lakes, the U.N. said. Most nations agreed to make the first global, legally binding plastic pollution accord, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024.


Plastic production could climb about 70% by 2040 without policy changes.


The production and use of plastics globally is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, according to the intergovernmental Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.


Panama is leading an effort to address the exponential growth of plastic production as part of the treaty, supported by more than 100 countries. There’s just too much plastic, said Juan Carlos Monterrey, head of Panama’s delegation.


“If we don’t have production in this treaty, it is not only going to be horribly sad, but the treaty may as well be called the greenwashing recycling treaty, not the plastics treaty,” he said in an interview. “Because the problem is not going to be fixed.”


China, the United States and Germany are the biggest plastics players.


China was by far the biggest exporter of plastic products in 2023, followed by Germany and the U.S., according to the Plastics Industry Association.


Together, the three nations account for 33% of the total global plastics trade, the association said.


The United States supports having an article in the treaty that addresses supply, or plastic production, a senior member of the U.S. delegation told The Associated Press Saturday.


Most plastic ends up as waste


Less than 10% of plastics are recycled. Most of the world’s plastic goes to landfills, pollutes the environment or is burned.


Sarah Dunlop, head of plastics and human health at the Minderoo Foundation, said chemicals are leaching out of plastics and “making us sick.”


The International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Plastics held an event about the impact of plastics Saturday on the sidelines of the talks. They want the treaty to fully recognize their rights and the universal human right to a healthy, clean, safe and sustainable environment.


Juan Mancias of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation in Texas spoke about feeling a spiritual connection to the land.


“Five hundred years ago, we had clean water, clean air, and there was no plastics,” he said. “What happened?”


Many plastics are used for packaging


About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations. This includes single-use plastic food and beverage containers — water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, straws and shopping bags — that often end up polluting the environment.


U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen told negotiators in Busan the treaty must tackle this problem.


“Are there specific plastic items that we can live without, those that so often leak into the environment? Are there alternatives to these items? This is an issue we must agree on,” she said.

## Taiwan's president arrives in Hawaii as part of South Pacific visit

HONOLULU, HAWAII — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te arrived Saturday in Hawaii to begin a two-day transit in the U.S. as part of a trip to the South Pacific, his first since assuming office. 


The stopover in Hawaii and one planned for the territory of Guam have drawn fierce criticism from Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and objects to official exchanges between the self-ruled democracy and the U.S., the island's biggest backer and military provider. 


There were no high-ranking U.S. or Hawaii state officials to greet Lai at the Honolulu hotel where supporters cheered in Mandarin, some waving Taiwanese flags. He visited the Bishop Museum, Hawaii's leading museum of natural history and Native Hawaiian culture. Later, he was expected to attend a banquet with supporters. 




Lai is on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island in the Pacific. Though Taiwan retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, it has only 12 formal diplomatic allies. 


Bishop Museum CEO Dee Jay Mailer presented Lai with a red lei hulu, or feather garland, made by master featherwork artist Kawika Lum-Nelmida. Lai gave Mailer a headdress made by Paiwan Indigenous people of Taiwan, and neck and shoulder decorative pieces made by Atayal Indigenous people, also of Taiwan. 


Lai's visit shows that Taiwan and the United States have a very strong relationship, said Arthur Chen, the president of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce of North America. He flew to Hawaii from his home near Dallas, Texas, to welcome the president to the United States.


Chen said he understood the U.S. has its own foreign policy but he said Lai should be treated as a head of state during his stay. 


Taiwan and the U.S. share common values such as a belief in democracy and human rights, Chen said. "So we should help each other," he said. 


Lai didn't make any public remarks at his initial engagements in Hawaii, but he spoke before his departure from Taiwan. 


"I want to use the values of democracy, peace, and prosperity to continue to expand our cooperation with our allies, to deepen our partnership and let the world see Taiwan not just as a model of democracy, but a vital power in promoting the world's peace and stability, and prosperous development," he said at Taoyuan International Airport. 


It is unclear whether Lai will meet with any members of the incoming U.S. administration during his transit. 


President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. 


Trump evaded answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. On Friday, the U.S. State Department said it approved the sale of $385 million in spare parts and equipment for a fleet of F-16s, as well as support for tactical communication system to Taiwan. 


While the U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act, it has maintained a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. 


A second Trump administration is expected to test U.S.-China relations even more than the Republican's first term, when the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese products. 


Taiwan is one of the main sources of tension in the bilateral relationship. 


Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday if the U.S. wanted to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the Taiwan issue "with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China's peaceful reunification." 


She also said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, including visits by Taiwan's leaders to the U.S. for any reason. 


China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.

## Intimate documentary captures the Beatles goofing around as they take America by storm in 1964

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Likely most people have seen iconic footage of the Beatles performing on "The Ed Sullivan Show." But how many have seen Paul McCartney during that same U.S. trip feeding seagulls off his hotel balcony?


That moment — as well as George Harrison and John Lennon goofing around by exchanging their jackets — are part of the Disney+ documentary "Beatles '64," an intimate look at the English band's first trip to America that uses rare and newly restored footage. It streams Friday.


"It's so fun to be the fly on the wall in those really intimate moments," says Margaret Bodde, who produced alongside Martin Scorsese. "It's just this incredible gift of time and technology to be able to see it now with the decades of time stripped away so that you really feel like you're there."


"Beatles '64" leans into footage of the 14-day trip filmed by documentarians Albert and David Maysles, who left behind 11 hours of the Fab Four goofing around in New York's Plaza hotel or traveling. It was restored by Park Road Post in New Zealand.


"It's beautiful, although it's black and white and it's not widescreen," says director David Tedeschi. "It's like it was shot yesterday and it captures the youth of the four Beatles and the fans."


The footage is augmented by interviews with the two surviving members of the band and people whose lives were impacted, including some of the women who as teens stood outside their hotel hoping to catch a glimpse of the Beatles.


"It was like a crazy love," fan Vickie Brenna-Costa recalls in the documentary. "I can't really understand it now. But then, it was natural."


The film shows the four heartthrobs flirting and dancing at the Peppermint Lounge disco, Harrison noodling with a Woody Guthrie riff on his guitar and tells the story of Ronnie Spector sneaking the band out a hotel back exit and up to Harlem to eat barbeque.


The documentary coincides with the release of a box set of vinyl albums collecting the band's seven U.S. albums released in '64 and early '65 — "Meet The Beatles!," "The Beatles' Second Album," "A Hard Day's Night" (the movie soundtrack), "Something New," "The Beatles' Story," "Beatles '65" and "The Early Beatles." They had been out of print on vinyl since 1995.


The Beatles' U.S. visit in 1964 also included concerts at Carnegie Hall, a gig at the Washington Coliseum in Washington, D.C., and a visit to Miami, where the band met Muhammad Ali. The documentary shows members of the band reading newspaper coverage of themselves.


Viewers may learn that the Beatles — now revered — were often met with ridicule or rudeness from the older generation. At the British Embassy in New York, the four were treated as lower class, while renowned broadcaster Eric Sevareid, doing a piece for CBS, compared the reaction to the Beatles to the German measles.


"You're nothing but four Elvis Presleys," one reporter told them during a press conference, to which the boys good-naturedly started gyrating as Ringo Starr screamed "It's not true!"


"Why the establishment was against them is sort of a mystery to me," says Tedeschi. "I think older people believed that music would go back to the big bands."


Musicians like Sananda Maitreya, Ron Isley and Smokey Robinson also discuss the Fab Four and what they took from Black music. There also are interviews with residents of Harlem, critic Joe Queennan and filmmaker David Lynch, who saw the Beatles play the Washington Coliseum.


"Beatles '64" tries to explain why young people were so besotted by John, Paul, George and Ringo. Their visit came just months after the assassination of President John. F. Kennedy and Tedeschi argues Beatlemania was a salve for a nation in mourning.


"Part of it is I think that the light was just off. They were depressed. Everything was dark. And 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' lit them up," says Tedeschi.


As McCartney says in the documentary: "Maybe America needed something like the Beatles to lift it out of mourning and just sort of say 'Life goes on.'"

## Will Trump's return lead to a new wave of bestselling books?

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — As she anticipates her estranged uncle's return to the White House, Mary Trump isn't expecting any future book to catch on like such first-term tell-alls as Michael Wolff's million-selling Fire and Fury or her own blockbuster, Too Much and Never Enough.


"What else is there to learn?" she says. "And for people who don't know, the books have been written. It's all really out in the open now."


For publishers, Donald Trump's presidential years were a time of extraordinary sales in political books, helped in part by Trump's legal threats and angered tweets. According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the hardcover and paperback market, the genre's sales nearly doubled from 2015 to 2020, from around 5 million copies to around 10 million.


Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's A Higher Loyalty, former national security adviser John Bolton's The Room Where it Happened and Bob Woodward's Fear. Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series.


But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family — they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's Who Could Ever Love You and Woodward's War were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration.




"We've been there many times, with all those books," HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books — perhaps analyzing the recent election — because "there's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way," one that would welcome "an intelligent voice."


"It's like the reboot of any hit TV show," says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. "You're not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it's replacing."


In the days following Trump's victory, The Handmaid's Tale and George Orwell's 1984 returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny, a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s The Real Anthony Fauci and Hegseth's The War on Warriors — and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate.


First lady Melania Trump's memoir, Melania, came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website.


"The Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought," says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. "After Election Day, we sold everything we had of it."


Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers — most recently Hachette Book Group — have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists — if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works.


A new Fire and Fury is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a "known peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened."


A publicist for Wolff declined to comment.


Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller Rage, told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how "out of control he gets," Woodward said, and how far he is able to go.


"He wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way," Woodward said. "He's run into some brick walls in the past and there may be more brick walls. I don't know what will happen. I'll be watching and doing some reporting, but I'm still undecided."


5 bestselling Trump-related books, per Circana



	Too Much and Never Enough, by Mary Trump: 1,248,212 copies
	Fire and Fury, by Michael Wolff: 936,116 copies
	Fear, by Bob Woodward: 872,014 copies
	The Room Where It Happened, by John Bolton: 676,010 copies
	Rage, by Bob Woodward: 549,685 copies


These figures represent total sales provided by Circana, which tracks about 85% of the print market and does not include e-book or audiobook sales.

## Foreign smartphone sales in China drop 44% in October, data show

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

New data released Wednesday from a Chinese government-affiliated research firm showed sales of foreign-branded smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone, fell 44.25% year-on-year in China in October, while overall phone sales in China have increased 1.8%, Reuters reported.


The data released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology revealed sales of foreign-branded phones in China decreased to 6.22 million units last month, down from 11.149 million units a year earlier.


The decrease of foreign phone sales comes in the wake of Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei’s rise to the top of the phone market in China.


Huawei was widely popular in China’s smartphone market last year when it released the Mate 60 Pro, a phone with a tiny computer chip more advanced than any other chip previously made by a Chinese company.


Chinese consumers have eagerly embraced Huawei's smartphones, drawn to the appeal of locally made technology — an option that has swayed many who might have previously chosen iPhones.


On Tuesday, the Chinese phone maker launched the next generation of the Mate 60 Pro, the Mate 70 series. The smartphone was described by Huawei’s consumer group chairman Richard Yu as the “smartest” Mate phone, The New York Times reported.


The Mate 70 series features hardware and software that are the most independent from Western influence to date. Highlights of Huawei’s newest phone include artificial intelligence-enabled functions and improved photography. The phone uses an operating system of HarmonyOS, which allows the smartphones to connect with smart devices.


Huawei’s ability to self-supply the chips required for its hardware and software represents a notable development, following previous U.S. measures to restrict the company’s access to key partners and suppliers.


AI technology relies on advanced semiconductor chips, a critical resource that has received attention amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, as both countries compete to dominate the advanced technology industry.


Apple’s iPhone 16 features AI capabilities, but these features have yet to be implemented in iPhones in China.


Apple, which considers China its second-most important market, has seen its market share decrease substantially. Apple CEO Tim Cook is traveling to China this week for the third time this year to attend an industry conference.

## Biden plans to highlight investment, partnership during Africa trip

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden will make his first presidential trip to Africa next week, visiting Angola and making a stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde, a top White House official told VOA.


Biden's visit will center around the Lobito Corridor, a 1,300-kilometer rail line that brings resources from the continent’s rich interior to Angola’s busiest port.


VOA’s Philip Alexiou spoke exclusively with Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.




VOA: How is the president feeling about this trip and what does he want to accomplish?


Frances Brown, White House director for African affairs: He is excited and really looking forward to the trip. The president often talks about how it's impossible to meet today's global challenges without African leadership and African partnership, and we really see Angola as exhibit A.


We are working with Angola on a few really important things. One is bolstering peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Another is growing economic opportunities in the region. A third is technological and scientific cooperation.


VOA: What are the deliverables? Are they going to be substantial?


Brown: You will see a lot of announcements and deliverables on the Lobito Corridor. Already the U.S. has mobilized billions of dollars toward the corridor. I think you can expect the president to engage with various components of that infrastructure effort.


I think you can expect to hear more as well on the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which recently signed a compact in Zambia. And I think you'll hear a lot of new deliverables on global health security, on agribusiness, on new forms of security sector cooperation.


VOA: With so many moving parts in these efforts, what level of transparency can the U.S. ensure? What kind of accountability can it offer the people in the region?


Brown: This is something that's really important to the president. The Lobito Corridor is about investment, it's about infrastructure, but it's also about ensuring that it benefits communities more broadly. It's part of the broader initiative, the Partnership on Global Investment and Infrastructure, that the president has laid out. And this is really signaling how under President Biden's administration, we've gone from an aid-driven model on engagement with Africa to an investment-driven model, and how we're thinking creatively about how to demonstrate that value proposition.




When we think about the Lobito Corridor, it's all about sustainable economic development; it's all about a transparent contracting process. It's about ensuring that it boosts regional trade, that it creates quality jobs and improves lives.


VOA: Is President Biden going to bring up human rights issues with Angolan President Joao Lorenzo?


Brown: President Biden never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts. And I think that's pretty consistent with the way he's been throughout his long career in public service.


VOA: Focusing now on Sudan, President Biden has called for peace. It’s one of the worst crises that we've seen in a long time. The U.N. is saying it's a neglected and ignored crisis, the worst humanitarian situation in recent history. Does the administration see it that way? And what can be done?


Brown: President Biden has been really outspoken on Sudan. You might have seen in his big speech at the U.N. General Assembly, he talked about the level of suffering in Sudan. He talked about how it was essential that the generals silence the guns and that we avert a wider famine. He's also been pretty forthright on calling for those who are obstructing humanitarian assistance to let that aid in. He's also talked about outside actors being an important part of this equation.


This month, every member of the Security Council at the U.N., except for Russia, voted in favor of a resolution that would have further called for humanitarian assistance, protections for civilians and an end to the violence. The president has instructed his team to work this hard. Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken, in the last couple of weeks, has continued to engage regional states and other actors to press for unhindered humanitarian access.


VOA: Moving on to the Sahel, a number of Francophone countries are forming new regional blocs, shifting away from the West and sort of aligning themselves with Russian mercenaries, the Wagner Group, and groups of this nature. How concerning is this to the administration?


Brown: Even though there have been those changes that you've mentioned in the Sahelian states — particularly Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali — other West African partners, including those along the coast, have been really clear to us that they want the durability and longevity of U.S. security engagement in the region. So, we continue to work very closely on that.


I'd also say more broadly that President Biden has made it really clear that he thinks it's important we continue to engage particularly with democratic partners. And on this trip that is forthcoming, the president will be stopping as well in West Africa, in Cabo Verde, which is a key democratic partner on the continent.


VOA: Is there anything that the U.S. can do to counter extremism on the continent, especially since U.S. influence has been sort of downgraded since they've had to leave Niger?


Brown: It’s worth remembering that we don't have a military footprint in the majority of countries on the continent. And that's been the case always. We make security arrangements with host countries, with partners based on specific shared interests. And through the administration, we've worked to foster mutually beneficial security partnerships by working by, with and through African partners. So that's how we see those collaborations.


VOA: Finally, the continent is very young — the median age around 19 years old. And its leaders are really old. How does the U.S. leadership deal with that?


Brown: You’re absolutely right. It is an extremely young continent, and it is the future. President Biden often talks about how by 2050, one in four humans on Earth will be from Africa. So that's very much guiding President Biden's engagement with the continent. I think the way the administration takes that forward is by thinking about how no challenge that we're trying to solve globally, we can solve without African partnership and African leadership.


That's why we've championed African voices at the U.N. Security Council, on the boards of the international financial institutions, at the G20 — we successfully got the African Union seat there. So, I think from the administration's perspective, just continuing to elevate and champion African voices so they can be part of shaping the future is how we think that's best approached.


VOA: What does the president want to leave behind when he departs the continent and he winds down as president?


Brown: I think the president wants to leave, first, the recognition of U.S. leadership and partnership, particularly on trade, investment and a new approach to the continent that's not defined by assistance, but instead by investment and partnership.


I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that's why he'll be amplifying Angola's role mediating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere.


And I think he wants to convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-African relationship over many centuries.

## As US faces Iran threats, Trump’s security picks favor ‘maximum pressure’

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

Iran is likely high on the foreign policy agenda of the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The Islamic Republic has engaged in a major escalation of conflict with U.S. ally Israel while advancing its nuclear program to the point it could rapidly produce enough fissile material for a bomb. VOA’s Michael Lipin looks at what Trump and his prospective team members have said should be done about these threats.

## Who were the prisoners in US-China swap?

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — This week’s rare prisoner swap between the United States and China saw each side claim victory and accuse the other of wrongfully detaining its citizens, while Beijing has kept quiet about the identities of the returned Chinese.


China confirmed the repatriation of at least three Chinese nationals convicted of espionage and other crimes in the U.S. Among them was a person whom Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, speaking at a regular briefing Thursday, described as “a fugitive who fled to the U.S. many years ago.”


Some media reports indicated four people were returned to China. Mao did not name those who were returned and did not confirm a prisoner swap, or the release of any Americans detained in China.


But media reports, including one from the Financial Times, cited unnamed U.S. government officials as saying three Americans were exchanged for three Chinese.




Released Chinese


Xu Yanjun


Although U.S. officials have not confirmed their identities, NBC News cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying the prisoner swap included Xu Yanjun, a Chinese intelligence officer sentenced to 20 years in prison for attempting to steal aviation trade secrets from GE Aviation. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons show that Xu's status is now listed as "not in federal custody."


Ji Chaoqun


NBC reported that those returned to China also included Ji Chaoqun, a naturalized U.S. citizen convicted in 2022 of providing classified defense information to Chinese intelligence.


Jin Shanlin


The Financial Times on Thursday reported the third Chinese released was Jin Shanlin, a former doctoral student at Southern Methodist University in northern Texas, who was sentenced in 2021 for possessing and distributing child pornography, with his sentence set to end in 2027. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons also show Jin’s status as "not in federal custody."


Jin's case has sparked controversy because of his crime and his family's alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The FBI testified that his family had "important political connections," The Dallas Morning News reported in 2022, raising questions about why he was chosen for the exchange over other Chinese nationals in U.S. custody.


Released Americans


The White House National Security Council said Wednesday in a statement that it had secured the release of three Americans it said were “wrongfully detained” in China, although it did not confirm a prisoner swap. Their detentions had drawn international condemnation.


Mark Swidan


Swidan, a Texas businessman, was arrested in 2012 in Dongguan. Despite a lack of direct evidence — no drugs or incriminating records were ever found — he was sentenced to death for drug trafficking but granted a reprieve in 2019. His mother, Katherine Swidan, led a tireless campaign for his release. “I feared I would never see my son again,” she told VOA, recounting his years in a Guangdong prison marked by overcrowding, intense heat and deteriorating health.


Kai Li


Li, a Chinese American businessman, was arrested in 2016 in Shanghai on charges of stealing state secrets. His family has consistently denied the allegations, calling his 10-year sentence politically motivated. “We thank President [Joe] Biden for prioritizing my father’s case,” said his son, Harrison Li. “But we also urge the administration to stand firm against such detentions in the future.”


John Leung


Leung, 79, a Hong Kong-based American citizen, was arrested in 2021 on espionage charges. His case saw minimal public advocacy, and his family remained largely silent throughout his detention.


John Kamm, founder of the San Francisco-based rights group Dui Hua, meaning “dialogue” in Chinese, said his organization played a role in the prisoner swap in negotiations that took years to complete.


“We submitted 54 lists with Mark Swidan’s name to the Chinese government and received 10 responses,” Kamm told VOA Mandarin Serevice. “The process was arduous but ultimately effective.”


A spokesperson for the National Security Council hailed the release of the three Americans as a significant diplomatic achievement for Biden, emphasizing that all Americans classified as “wrongfully detained Americans” in China have now been brought home.


While the move brought relief to the families of the freed Americans, it has sparked concerns about its implications for U.S.-China relations and the growing trend of “hostage diplomacy.”


Kamm cautioned against declaring the issue resolved. “There are at least 200 American citizens under coercive measures in China. Many face exit bans or detentions with little transparency,” he said.


Critics such as Peter Humphrey, a former detainee in China and a nonresident associate at Harvard University’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, argue that no Americans held in China should be considered normal prisoners. He noted to VOA Mandarin that China’s legal processes are fundamentally flawed, as prisoners do not have fair and transparent trials.


"They have never had a trial where they were able to defend themselves properly and freely. They were under tremendous pressure in detention cells, and that pressure amounts to torture,” Humphrey said.


Humphrey called this week’s prisoner swap “capitulation to hostage diplomacy” and warned it could incentivize Beijing to detain more Americans.


Diplomatic balancing act


The prisoner exchange occurred amid strained U.S.-China relations, with both nations navigating a complex mix of strategic competition and occasional cooperation, and just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump is to return to the White House promising to impose hefty tariffs on Beijing.


The U.S. on Wednesday lowered its travel advisory for China from Level 3 (“Reconsider Travel”) to Level 2 (“Exercise Increased Caution”), raising questions about the advisory's role in the negotiations.


Kamm told VOA, “The lowering of the travel warning was part of the deal, as I understand it.”


Humphrey expressed concerns about the change in travel advisory. “China did not suddenly become safer for Americans, or any other foreigners actually, to travel to China,” he told VOA. “It has not become safer.”


Bo Gu contributed to this report.

## Canada's Trudeau meets with Trump after tariffs threat

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew to Florida on Friday to have dinner with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club after Trump threatened to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.


Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don’t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the United States from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.


A person familiar with the details called it a "positive wide-ranging dinner that lasted three hours.” The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said topics included trade, border security, fentanyl, defense, Ukraine, NATO, China and pipelines, as well as the Group of Seven meeting in Canada next year.


Although Trump once called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest” during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the G7 countries to visit Trump since the November 5 election.


Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary; North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department; Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives.


Also at the dinner were David McCormick, newly elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump; Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security; and Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff.


Trump’s transition team did not respond to questions about what they had discussed or whether the conversation alleviated Trump’s concerns about the border.


A smiling Trudeau declined comment upon returning to his West Palm Beach hotel late Friday.


Trudeau said earlier Friday that he would resolve the tariffs issue by talking to Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday after speaking with Trump that she is confident a tariff war with the United States will be averted.


“We’re going to work together to meet some of the concerns,” Trudeau told reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. “But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.”


Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries, but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products including potatoes from Prince Edward Island.


“It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There’s no question about it,” Trudeau said.


“Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for Americans citizens, as well and hurting American industry and business,” he said.


Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully renegotiate the deal, which he calls a “win win” for both countries.


“We can work together as we did previously,” Trudeau said.


Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.


The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone — and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.


Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.


Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security.


Trudeau called Trump after he made his social media posts on the border.


When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.


Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the U.S. should Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official told The Associated Press this week.


A government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.


Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian, or U.S. $2.7 billion, in goods and services cross the border each day.


About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.


Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.


Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.

## SunFed recalls cucumbers in US, Canada due to potential salmonella

date: 2024-11-29, from: VOA News USA

Cucumbers shipped to 13 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces have been recalled because of potential salmonella contamination, the Food and Drug Administration said this week.


SunFed Produce, based in Arizona, recalled the cucumbers sold between October 12 and November 26, the FDA said Thursday.


No illnesses were immediately reported. People who bought cucumbers during the window should check with the store where they purchased them to see if the produce is part of the recall. Wash items and surfaces that may have been in contact with the produce using hot, soapy water or a dishwasher.


Salmonella can cause symptoms that begin six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria and include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people recover without treatment within a week, but young children, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems can become seriously ill.


Earlier this summer, a separate salmonella outbreak in cucumbers sickened 450 people in the United States.

## Holiday discounts are a delicate dance

date: 2024-11-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>It all depends on how much consumers are willing or able to spend, and how much retailers are willing or able to discount. Some years the discounting is deeper, and this is expected to be one of those years. While disposable income rose last month, people put a little more of it into savings. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that consumer spending, while still growing, slowed down last month. So shoppers are being a bit more careful in how they spend this holiday season.</p>

## Iran to enrich uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges, UN says

date: 2024-11-29, from: VOA News USA

Iran will begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges at its two main nuclear facilities at Fordo and Natanz, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Friday, further raising tensions over Tehran's program as it enriches at near weapons-grade levels.


The notice from the International Atomic Energy Agency mentioned Iran enriching uranium with new centrifuges to only 5% purity, far lower than the 60% it currently does — likely signaling that it still wants to negotiate with the West and the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.


However, it remains unclear how Trump will approach Iran once he enters office, particularly as Iran continues to threaten to attack Israel amid Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and just after a ceasefire started with Hezbollah in Lebanon.


Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the IAEA's report. Tehran had threatened to rapidly advance its program after the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemned Iran at a meeting in November for failing to cooperate fully with the agency.


In a statement, the IAEA outlined the plans Iran informed it of, which include feeding uranium into multiple cascades of its advanced IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges.


Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. Each of these advanced classes of centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran’s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country’s atomic program.


The IAEA did not elaborate on how many machines would be in each cascade, but Iran has put around 160 centrifuges into a single cascade in the past.


It's unclear if Iran has begun feeding the uranium yet into the centrifuges. Tehran so far has been vague about its plans. But starting the enrichment at 5% gives Tehran leverage at negotiations with the West and another way to dial up the pressure if they don't like what they hear. Weapons-grade levels of enrichment are around 90%.


Since the collapse of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers following the United States’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, it has pursued nuclear enrichment just below weapons-grade levels. U.S. intelligence agencies and others assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program.


Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has pledged to allow the IAEA to visit its atomic sites to ensure its program is peaceful. Tehran also had agreed to additional oversight from the IAEA as part of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw sanctions lifted in exchange for drastically limiting its program.


However, for years Iran has curtailed inspectors’ access to sites while also not fully answering questions about other sites where nuclear material has been found in the past after the deal's collapse.


Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, had signaled in recent months a willingness to negotiate with the West. But Iran also has launched two large-scale missile attacks on Israel amid the war.


Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian diplomat, said in a post on a social media platform that he met with EU diplomat Enrique Mora and criticized Europe as being “self-centered" while having "irresponsible behavior.”


“With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility,” Gharibabadi wrote.


For his part, Mora described having a “frank discussion” with Gharibabadi and another Iranian diplomat. Those talks included “Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights,” he wrote on X.

## Prices might be coming down today, but keep your guard up

date: 2024-11-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>If you&#8217;re among the 183 million people expected to be shopping between now and Monday — or if you&#8217;re leaving it to the last minute — watch out for scams. From fake delivery texts to ads for nonexistent products, now is the time to be especially careful and to remember that when a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is. Also: the podcast industry is bouncing back, with creators turning to video to help boost revenue. With listeners in the U.S. increasingly watching podcasts rather than listening to them, podcasters are becoming full-blown content creators, no longer relying solely on their voice.</p>

## Canada sues Google

date: 2024-11-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>From the BBC World Service: Canada&#8217;s competition watchdog files a lawsuit against Google, accusing it of unfairly dominating the online advertising market. They’re even asking Google to break up parts of its ad business. Australia passes a law banning kids under the age of 16 from using social media. And &#8217;tis the season for advent calendars. But gone are the days of a small picture behind a cardboard door, because just about any type of product now helps consumers count down the days to Christmas.</p>

## Auden Schendler Wants to Ruin the Way You Think About Modern Environmentalism

date: 2024-11-29, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDg4OTg3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTM0MTg2MX0.wmMkJAlXAUIhXbsN1POaA-yrA-xnqS7tme0t7emMIQs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">When I scheduled this interview with Auden Schendler back in August, I’d picked what at the time felt like an arbitrary time closer to his book’s publication date. It wasn’t until much later that I realized we’d agreed to speak exactly one week after the results of the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Schendler, of course, didn’t write <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781647829759" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Terrible Beauty: Reckoning with Climate Complicity and Rediscovering Our Soul</em></em></u></a> knowing that President Trump would win reelection, but his book feels all the more vital given the new context <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/donald-trump-2024-climate-energy" target="_self"><u>of climate policy in America</u></a>.</p>
<p><em><em>Terrible Beauty</em></em> is a memoir, but it also functions as a practical roadmap to attaining climate consciousness, both for companies and for consumers — an unusual blend. In it, Schendler draws on his more than two decades of sustainability work at the Aspen Skiing Company, which owns one of the most iconic ski resorts in the world, to urge by example that we need to get uncomfortable with the big upheavals necessary to combat climate change. The modern environmental movement has failed, he argues, by focusing on the kinds of small-scale changes that have businesses touting <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/offsets-study-clean-stoves" target="_self"><u>flawed carbon credit programs</u></a> and paper straws — pursuits that are complicit with fossil fuel interests. </p>
<p>Schendler insists that instead, we should be swinging for the fences: Companies that are serious about climate and sustainability ought to use their lobbying powers and legal teams to put pressure on the government, and parents who want a better future for their children should be getting involved in local politics, no experience required. It might be lead to awkward conversations at the water cooler or in the cereal aisle — what Schendler calls the “supermarket problem” — but when everything is at stake, you have to try, even if it means losing.</p>
<p>Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the stakes of your book have changed between when you began writing it and now, when it’s finally hitting shelves?</strong></p>
<p>On one hand, the stakes have changed because it’s even harder to get to the climate fix than before. A major theme of the book is the idea that we’re not playing a uniquely American game of winning and losing; we’re involved in a practice and trying to make things better. We’re not going to “solve” climate change. We’ve already, you could argue, failed because it’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68110310" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>beyond 1.5 [degrees] Celsius warming</u></a>. The stakes have changed, but the methodology is the same — and possibly more important now because we are in a long struggle that we might not see the end of in our lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Something I’ve been hearing since the election is that climate advocates need to play small ball during the Trump administration — keep moving progress forward, even in inches. This is an idea you grapple with quite directly in the book. From your perspective, what is the highest-value target an average person can take on?</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not advocating for small ball — my book is a critique of modern environmentalism going all-in on small ball. It didn’t work, and that’s not surprising. </p>
<p>Historically, we say, <em><em>I care about climate and I'm going to plug in on all the things everyone has said I’m supposed to do: recycle, drive a Prius, insulate my house, take the blame for the problem myself</em></em>. And what I’m saying in <em><em>Terrible Beauty</em></em> is, all that hasn’t worked, and it’s actually complicit with a fossil fuel economy. </p>
<p>The thing you need to do is get a six-pack of beer and say, <em><em>Where am I powerful? What is my power?</em></em> When people do that, people who don’t appear to have power show that they do. Greta Thunberg is a great example because she was just a high school girl, and look what she did. But if you’re a <em><em>business</em></em>, your power is different than you think it is — it’s not cutting your carbon footprint and buying offsets. It’s wielding political power. </p>
<p>I’m asking people to become citizens. Being a citizen is difficult — it’s messy, it’s tricky, you get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>If somebody wants to get involved interacting with their local government, how do they get past the discomfort of what you call the supermarket problem?</strong></p>
<p>The supermarket problem is one of my favorite illustrations: It’s that if a person is given a choice between being a material part of saving civilization — speaking out publicly on climate, that’s one side of the balance — then you’re going to have a really awkward encounter in the cereal aisle in the supermarket with someone who disagrees with you. Most people will say, <em><em>Yeah, I really do want to save civilization, but I’d rather not have that awkward encounter</em></em>. </p>
<p>I don’t think that’s actually the problem in public office. I think what keeps people out is the perception that they don’t know enough — that there’s some secret to being a town council person. Speaking as an ex-town council person, we had no skills at all. It was shocking how bottom of the barrel we were. There’s this mystique, and people have to get over it. The United States was created to enable citizens to govern the country, and so as a citizen, you have an obligation. People shouldn’t be scared off by that.</p>
<p><strong>What is your suggestion for someone who has a corporate sustainability role and reads your book and feels inspired to pursue meaningful, large-scale change, but then runs into resistance or skepticism? How do you get the bigwigs on your side?</strong></p>
<p>My experience was years and years of spoon feeding, and spoon feeding in a way that is not righteous. One approach would be, <em><em>Hey, I’ve been doing these carbon footprints for five years. Obviously, we care about climate. Have we talked to the Government Affairs Department about how this company can wield power?</em></em></p>
<p>You have to become a trusted employee by doing your work well. Corporations are made up of human beings that have great loves and epic tragedies and they care about the world. You have to think that if you bring a reasonable offer to do something next level — and by the way, it also helps the brand — then you’re going to get some traction. Another message of the book is, you might not win, but you try again. And you try again. You try again.</p>
<p><strong>Like what you’ve done with including an appendix on how to sue ExxonMobil. You couldn’t put that lawsuit into motion at Aspen Skiing Company, but now you’ve put it out into the world for someone else to try.</strong></p>
<p>Right. The idea is that fighting losing battles is a worthy cause. That is how humans make progress, whether it’s a fight or an invention or a business model. You try, and it doesn’t work, and then the next person learns from your mistakes and tries, and then the next and the next. And this was true of all the great movements, like civil rights. It was a series of attempts and a series of bad losses over many, many years, and then we won more and more and more.</p>
<p><strong>What, if anything, do you think corporations owe the environment? </strong></p>
<p>One of the things I’ve been thinking about recently is that, historically, corporations have opposed regulations. The reality I think we’re coming into is that business is starting to say, <em><em>Oh my gosh, climate actually is threatening us. It’s threatening our supply chain, our factories, our customers, everything</em></em>. I’m inclined to think that businesses will start to say, actually, we need to fix this problem because it’s getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>What does business owe the environment? There is a long history of thought and writing that says the source of all wealth comes from the environment. I think the real question is, is business capable of acknowledging that? Can we count on business as designed to help us solve these problems? </p>
<p>My answer is that we don’t have a lot of tools for climate. We have the vote, we have the legal system, we have NGOs, we have government, we have faith groups, we have philanthropy. Business is pretty powerful. We should at least try to use this lever versus just saying, huh, we can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>The Aspen Skiing Company, as you acknowledge, often ends up serving the kind of clientele who </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/20/richest-1-account-for-more-carbon-emissions-than-poorest-66-report-says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>disproportionately contribute to carbon emissions</strong></u></a><strong>. How do you square that with the work that you do? Why is corporate sustainability at a luxury level still — or perhaps especially — important?</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to look at that question, which is ultimately an accusation of hypocrisy. I think one response is, if we are trying to wield power and drive change, where are the powerful people? They’re <em><em>right here</em></em>. Those are the rich people spraying champagne on each other. If you said, <em><em>We’re just going to change our light bulbs and reduce our carbon footprint</em></em>, then you’d be missing the opportunity to access power. So from one perspective, we have the obligation to see if we can lean on those people and get them conscripted into the movement. I would accept criticism that said, you’re not doing that well enough. That’s fair, but we should be trying. </p>
<p>But then the second piece of that is this: Should they — or we — be guilty for using fossil fuels? The short answer to that is that American citizens asked for the affordably provided services that energy gives us: mobility, heat, cold beer, hot showers. We didn’t say, can you provide that in a way that will destroy civilization? We shouldn’t feel guilty for living in a fossil fuel system we didn’t create.</p>

## What Black Friday's history tells us about holiday shopping in 2024

date: 2024-11-29, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The holiday shopping season is about to reach full speed with Black Friday, which kicks off the post-Thanksgiving retail rush this week.


The annual sales event no longer creates the midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem of recent decades, in large part due to the ease of online shopping and habits forged during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Hoping to entice equivocating consumers, retailers already have spent weeks bombarding customers with ads and early offers. Still, whether visiting stores or clicking on countless emails promising huge savings, tens of millions of U.S. shoppers are expected to spend money on Black Friday itself this year.


Industry forecasts estimate that 183.4 million people will shop in U.S. stores and online between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation and consumer research firm Prosper Insights & Analytics. Of that number, 131.7 million are expected to shop on Black Friday.


At the same time, earlier and earlier Black Friday-like promotions, as well as the growing strength of other shopping events (hello, Cyber Monday), continue to change the holiday spending landscape.


Here's what you need to know about Black Friday's history and where things stand in 2024.


When is Black Friday in 2024?


Black Friday falls on the Friday after Thanksgiving each year, which is November 29 this year.


How old is Black Friday? Where does its name come from?


The term “Black Friday” is several generations old, but it wasn't always associated with the holiday retail frenzy that we know today. The gold market crash of September 1869, for example, was notably dubbed Black Friday.


The phrase's use in relation to shopping the day after Thanksgiving, however, is most often traced to Philadelphia in the mid-20th century — when police and other city workers had to deal with large crowds that congregated before the annual Army-Navy football game and to take advantage of seasonal sales.


“That’s why the bus drivers and cab drivers call today 'Black Friday.' They think in terms of headaches it gives them,” a Gimbels department store sales manager told The Associated Press in 1975 while watching a police officer try to control jaywalkers the day after Thanksgiving.


Earlier references date back to the 1950s and 1960s.


Jie Zhang, a professor of marketing at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, points to a 1951 mention of “Black Friday” in a New York-based trade publication — which noted that many workers simply called in sick the day after Thanksgiving in hopes of having a long holiday weekend.




Starting in the 1980s, national retailers began claiming that Black Friday represented when they went from operating in the red to in the black thanks to holiday demand. But since many retail companies now operate in the black at various times of the year, this interpretation should be taken with a grain of salt, experts say.


How has Black Friday evolved?


In recent decades, Black Friday became infamous for floods of people in jam-packed stores. Endless lines of shoppers camped out at midnight in hopes of scoring deep discounts.


But online shopping has made it possible to make most, if not all, holiday purchases without ever stepping foot inside a store. And while foot traffic at malls and other shopping areas has bounced back since the start of the pandemic, e-commerce isn't going away.


November sales at brick-and-mortar stores peaked more than 20 years ago. In 2003, for example, e-commerce accounted for 1.7% of total retail sales in the fourth quarter, according to Commerce Department data.


Unsurprisingly, online sales make up a much bigger slice of the pie today. For last year's holiday season, e-commerce accounted for about 17.1% of all nonadjusted retail sales in the fourth quarter, Commerce Department data show. That's up from 12.7% seen at the end of 2019.


Beyond the rise of online shopping, some big-ticket items that used to get shoppers in the door on the Black Friday — like a new TV — are significantly cheaper than they were decades ago, notes Jay Zagorsky, a clinical associate professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business.


“There is less need to stand in line at midnight when the items typically associated with doorbuster sales are now much cheaper,” Zagorsky told The Associated Press via email. He pointed to Bureau of Labor Statistics data that show the average price for a TV has fallen 75% since 2014.


While plenty of people will do most of their Black Friday shopping online, projections from the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights indicated that most Black Friday shoppers (65%) still planned to shop in stores this year.


Black Friday ‘month’ and the rise of Cyber Monday


It's no secret that Black Friday sales don't last just 24 hours anymore. Emails promising holiday deals now start arriving before Halloween.


“Black Friday is no longer the start of the holiday shopping season. It has become the crescendo of the holiday shopping season” during what now feels like “Black Friday month,” Zhang said. Some retailers have updated their official marketing to refer to “Black Friday week.”




Retailers trying to get a head start on the competition and to manage shipping logistics helps explain the rush, Zhang said. Offering early holiday deals spreads out purchases, giving shippers more breathing room to complete orders. Zhang therefore doesn't expect the five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year to cause significant strain because retailers would have taken them into account.


Linking pre-Thanksgiving sales with Black Friday is also a marketing technique since it's a name consumers recognize and associate with big, limited-time bargains, Zhang said.


Multiple post-Thanksgiving sales events keep shoppers enticed after Black Friday, including Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday, which the National Retail Federation's online arm designated in 2005.


U.S. consumers spent a record $12.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, and $15.7 million per minute during the day's peak sales hour, according to Adobe Analytics. On Black Friday, they spent $9.8 billion online, Adobe Analytics said.


Enough people still enjoy shopping in person after Thanksgiving that the activity is unlikely to become extinct, Boston University's Zagorsky said.


While Black Friday's significance “is being slightly diminished" over time, the shopping event is still “a way to connect with others," he said. "This social aspect is important and will not disappear, ensuring that Black Friday is still an important day for retailers.”

## Democratic lawmakers from Connecticut report Thanksgiving bomb threats

date: 2024-11-29, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — At least five Democratic members of Congress from Connecticut were targeted by bomb threats on their homes Thursday, the lawmakers or their offices said.


Senator Chris Murphy and Representatives Jim Himes, Joe Courtney, John Larson and Jahana Hayes all reported being the subject of such threats. Police who responded said they found no evidence of explosives on the lawmakers' properties.


There was no immediate word whether Representative Rosa DeLauro, the fifth Democratic House member from the state, and Connecticut's other Democratic senator received threats.


The bomb threats against Democrats came a day after a number of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks and appointees reported that they had received such threats, as well as "swatting attacks," in which perpetrators initiate an emergency law enforcement response against a victim under false pretenses.


Murphy's office said his Hartford home was the target of a bomb threat, "which appears to be part of a coordinated effort involving multiple members of Congress and public figures." Hartford Police and U.S. Capitol Police determined there was no threat.


Hayes said the Wolcott Police Department informed her Thursday morning that it had received "a threatening email stating a pipe bomb had been placed in the mailbox at my home." State police, U.S. Capitol Police, and the House sergeant at arms were notified, Wolcott and state police responded, "and no bomb or explosive materials were discovered."


Courtney's Vernon home received a bomb threat while his wife and children were there, his office said.


Himes said he was told of the threat against his home during a Thanksgiving celebration with his family. The U.S. Capitol Police, and Greenwich and Stamford police departments responded.


Hines extended his family's "utmost gratitude to our local law enforcement officers for their immediate action to ensure our safety." Echoing other lawmakers who were threatened, he added: "There is no place for political violence in this country, and I hope that we may all continue through the holiday season with peace and civility."


Larson said Thursday that East Hartford Police responded to a bomb threat against his home.


The threats follow an election season marked by violence. In July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing his ear and killing one of his supporters. The Secret Service later thwarted a subsequent assassination attempt at Trump's West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course when an agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through a perimeter fence while Trump was golfing.


Among those who received threats Wednesday were New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Trump's pick to serve as the next ambassador to the United Nations; Matt Gaetz, Trump's initial pick to serve as attorney general; Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, whom Trump chose to lead the Department of Labor, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, who has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

## Drone sightings over US bases prompt British troop deployments

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

LONDON — British and American authorities are investigating after several drones were spotted in recent days flying over four U.S. military bases in England. Britain has deployed dozens of troops around the bases amid concerns the overflights could be acts of deception or sabotage by an adversary such as Russia.


In a statement issued Wednesday, U.S. Air Forces in Europe said that “small unmanned aerial systems continue to be spotted in the vicinity of and over Royal Air Force Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, RAF Feltwell and RAF Fairford since Nov. 20.” It said the number of drones sighted has fluctuated and has ranged in size and configurations.


“To date, installation leaders have determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets. The air force is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard the aforementioned installations and their residents,” the statement said.




RAF Lakenheath in the east of England is home to the U.S. Air Force 48th Fighter Wing, a cornerstone of its combat capability in Europe and home to several F-35 stealth fighter jets, among other aircraft. Four American B-52 strategic bombers are currently based at RAF Fairford in the west of the country.


The Pentagon said this week it is actively monitoring the situation. “The bottom line is it's something that we're going to take seriously. We're continuing to look into it. But as of right now, [it] has not had any significant mission impact,” Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters Tuesday, adding that small drones have become “relatively common now across the landscape.”


Britain has deployed about 60 soldiers around the U.S. bases. British Defense Minister Maria Eagle said they are using “multilayered force protection measures.”


“We will be making sure that anybody that we manage to catch for engaging in this behavior is shown the full force of the law,” Eagle told lawmakers Wednesday.


The nature of the sightings suggests the drones are not being operated by hobbyists, said David Dunn, a professor of international politics at Britain’s University of Birmingham, who has written extensively on the dangers posed by drones.


“It's particularly alarming in this context that actually talked about there [being] several different sizes of drones. It does seem to be a coordinated and planned activity. The most obvious thing is that these are disruptive practices and that they actually force the airfield to operate in a different way, to suspend air operations,” Dunn told VOA.


The drones can also be used for other purposes.


“They can gather intelligence on how many planes are operating, where they're based, what the movements are. And, actually, they can also do that for individuals,” Dunn said.


Drones have been sighted above the U.S. base at RAF Feltwell, which primarily serves as living quarters for U.S. military personnel — a “particularly sinister” development, according to Dunn.


“Because in an age where you have highly sophisticated fifth-generation aircraft that operate stealthily and invisibly in the electronic spectrum when they're flying — and are highly protected on the airbase in hardened aircraft shelters — the most vulnerable part of the overall system is actually the aircrew,” Dunn told VOA.


“And so, if you can identify where they live by following them home onto their married quarters, you can identify where you can actually break the weakest part of that chain,” he said.


The Times of London newspaper reported that authorities have not ruled out Russia as the culprit. Dunn said there’s evidence of Moscow seeking to step up hybrid attacks, meaning a nonmilitary form of warfare that can still be destructive.


“Whether that be the disruption of undersea cables or of incendiary parcels being sent to the city I live in, Birmingham — there was an incendiary parcel found in Birmingham airport. There’s another [example] of a warehouse being burned down, which stored material going to Ukraine. These things are typically, it seems, done at third party, whereby the Russian state, it seems, has employed criminals in the U,K.,” Dunn said.


The Russian Embassy in London had not responded to VOA requests for comment by the time of publication. Moscow has previously denied any involvement in hybrid attacks on the West.

## Three Americans arrive in Texas following prisoner swap with China

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

Three American citizens jailed for years in China arrived in the United States late Wednesday as part of a prisoner swap between Washington and Beijing.


The swap, which the White House announced earlier Wednesday, marked a rare diplomatic agreement between the United States and China as U.S. President Joe Biden’s tenure comes to a close.


Beijing announced Thursday that the United States has returned four people to China, including at least three Chinese citizens whom Beijing said were held for “political purposes.” The fourth was an individual sought by Beijing for crimes who had been living in the United States.


The Chinese government did not identify the four people.




The three Americans released in the swap — Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung — landed Wednesday night at a military base in San Antonio, Texas.


Biden told reporters Thursday morning that he has spoken to all of them.

“I’m really happy they are home,” he said.


All three Americans had been designated as wrongfully detained. Swidan was facing a death sentence on drug charges, and Li and Leung were jailed on espionage charges.


In a separate but connected move, the State Department Wednesday lowered its travel warning to China to “level two” from “level three,” now advising American citizens to “exercise increased caution” when traveling to China.


Previously, the State Department advised Americans to “reconsider travel” to China, partially due to the risk of wrongful detention of Americans.




The prisoner swap comes two months after China released David Lin, a Christian pastor from California who had spent nearly 20 years jailed in China after being convicted of contract fraud.


And in August, the United States engaged in a separate historic prisoner swap.


That one, between the United States and Russia, included the release of American journalists Alsu Kurmasheva and Evan Gershkovich, as well as ex-U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and U.S. permanent resident and Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza.


Some information in this report came from the Associated Press and Reuters.

## ‘Tis the season to shop

date: 2024-11-28, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Tomorrow is Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year and what we think of as the official start of the holiday shopping season. The National Retail Federation expects over 183 million people to shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And by the end of the season, consumers are expected to spend a record $902 per person on gifts, food and decorations. Plus, are U.S. Treasurys still &#8220;risk-free&#8221; investments? A new paper makes the case that U.S. government debt is riskier than many people think.</p>

## Century-old Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off in steady rain

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicked off Thursday morning in New York City with a steady rain that added ponchos and umbrellas to the lineup of balloons, floats and star-studded performances.


The annual holiday tradition features new Spider-Man and Minnie Mouse balloons, zoo and pasta-themed floats, an ode to Big Apple coffee and bagels, performances from Jennifer Hudson, Idina Menzel, Kylie Minogue and others.


The lineup is a far cry from the parade’s initial incarnation a century ago, which featured floats showing scenes from Mother Goose, Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, Miss Muffet and the Spider, and other fairy tales and nursery rhymes.




Some things remain the same, though. As in 1924, there are plenty of marching bands and lots of clowns, followed by the grand finale of Santa Claus riding through Manhattan and ushering in the holiday season.


This year's parade features 17 giant, helium-filled character balloons, 22 floats, 15 novelty and heritage inflatables, 11 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups, award-winning singers and actors, and the WNBA champion New York Liberty.




Other highlights include reality TV star Ariana Madix, hip-hop’s T-Pain, country duo Dan + Shay, The War and Treaty, The Temptations, Jimmy Fallon and The Roots, Broadway veteran Lea Salonga, and “Glow” actor and Macy's spokesperson Alison Brie.


One new float spotlights the Rao’s food brand, featuring a knight and a dragon in battle made with actual pasta elements. Another celebrates the Bronx Zoo’s 125th anniversary with representations of a tiger, a giraffe, a zebra and a gorilla.




“The work that we do, the opportunity to impact millions of people and bring a bit of joy for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning is what motivates us every day,” said Will Coss, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade executive producer.


The parade began at 8:30 a.m. on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and ends 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away around noon at Macy’s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which serves as a stage and backdrop for performances.


The rain isn't stopping anything — the parade has been canceled only three times, from 1942 to 1944 during World War II — but organizers are monitoring wind speeds throughout the festivities to make sure it’s safe for the big balloons to fly.


The parade airs on NBC with hosts Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker and streams on the network's Peacock service. Carlos Adyan and Andrea Meza will host a Spanish simulcast on Telemundo.

## Wrongfully detained Americans return from China

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

Three U.S. citizens imprisoned by China were on their way home late Wednesday, U.S. officials said, culminating years of U.S. diplomatic efforts to free Americans Washington says were wrongfully detained by Beijing.


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke to Kai Li, Mark Swidan and John Leung "as they traveled home to the United States just in time for Thanksgiving."


"I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they’ll soon be reunited with their loved ones," Blinken posted on X, formerly Twitter.


The White House announced the release of the Americans on Wednesday.


"We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People’s Republic of China," a National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement.


The development is a diplomatic win for President Joe Biden, who will be leaving office in January. With the men’s release, "all of the wrongfully detained Americans" in China have been returned, the spokesperson added.


Biden and his aides have raised the issue of the three Americans with Beijing repeatedly, according to U.S. officials. In his last in-person meeting on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru earlier this month, Biden also spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping to press for their return.


China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Thursday three Chinese nationals "wrongfully imprisoned" by the United States had been returned to China.


Mark Swidan had been held since 2012 and received the death sentence in 2019. He maintained his innocence.


John Leung was sentenced last year to life in prison. A U.S. citizen who also holds permanent residency in Hong Kong, he was detained on April 15, 2021, by the local bureau of China’s counterintelligence agency in the southeastern city of Suzhou, according to The Associated Press.


Kai Li, a naturalized U.S. citizen who owned an export business and worked in New York, was arrested after flying into Shanghai in September 2016. He was placed under surveillance, interrogated without a lawyer and accused of providing state secrets to the FBI. In 2018, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage, a charge that he has denied.


The release comes just two months after China freed a Christian pastor from California, David Lin, who had been held since 2006. He was convicted of contract fraud.


Revised travel warning


On Wednesday, the State Department lowered its travel warning for China to "reflect a shift to Level 2," according to the department’s website.


The current advisory warns travelers, "Exercise increased caution when traveling to Mainland China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans."


The alert had previously been at Level 3, telling Americans they should "reconsider travel" to China in part because of the "risk of wrongful detention" of Americans.


VOA Senior White House Correspondent Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report. Information from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Press was also used in this report.

## Former US diplomat discusses Trump’s Africa policy, China and Russia competition, trade, and security

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — As President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term as president of the United States, questions arise about what this means for U.S.-Africa relations. In this interview with VOA English to Africa’s Paul Ndiho, Tibor Nagy, the former assistant secretary of state for African Affairs in the first Trump administration, shares insights into the administration's past approach. Nagy shares his perspective on U.S. competition with China and Russia, trade policies, including the extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, commonly known as AGOA, which provides eligible sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to U.S. markets and the ongoing crises in the Sahel and other regions on the continent.


This interview, which aired on VOA’s Africa 54 TV program on Wednesday, November 27, from VOA headquarters in Washington, D.C., has been edited for clarity and brevity.




Paul Ndiho: As the former top diplomat for African affairs, what should we expect when it comes to President-elect Donald Trump’s second term for Africa?


Tibor Nagy: I’m very optimistic. I don’t think people should worry about the slogan “America First” because that doesn’t mean “America only.” There are many areas where interests between the U.S. and Africa intersect. China, we very much see as a long-term existential threat, and so I think we’ll be a little bit more honest in saying that part of our Africa relations is about China. Then there’s the very important issue of critical minerals. Why should China monopolize all the critical minerals in Africa when it would do much better if Western, i.e., American companies were also involved? So, I think Africans should be optimistic — I think they’ll have a lot more deals and a lot fewer lectures.


VOA: Many argue that China and Russia have an edge over the U.S. in Africa. What can the incoming Trump administration do better to compete with those two countries?


Nagy: I think you would agree that what Africans want more than anything else, especially young Africans, and everyone knows that there are millions and millions and millions of young Africans, are jobs. Frankly, yes, China has done an awful lot of infrastructure projects, but how many jobs did the African young people get out of that? I think the truth is that American and Western types of investments, do lead to the kind of jobs that young Africans are looking for. And I think that will be a successful foreign policy. And I think that that will be the true kind of win-win for both sides.


VOA: President-elect Trump is proposing a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the United States, obviously with AGOA, Africans are supposed to bring goods to the United States free of tariffs. What should we expect?


Nagy: What we should expect is to see what happens, aside from during campaigns, a lot of things are said, and then what the actual policy is might be a little bit different. I mean, AGOA is a law passed by Congress and I’m sure that the United States of America will comply with that law. And as you also well know that law will be going out soon and everybody’s kind of looking forward and wondering what kind of a new AGOA there will be.


VOA: How about the issue of the Sahel? There is a crisis in the Sahel. There are wars in Sudan, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. How can the incoming Trump administration do better on this front?


Nagy: The “three Cs” — crises, conflicts, and coups — have been really horrible. Again, here, U.S. engagement needs to be different. Lecturing, for example, the military government in Niger, I think had a lot to do with us being kicked out of some very valuable air bases that where we had agreements with and the whole issue of coups, I think it’s important for the United States to look at coups individually. When a coup happens and we say it’s a coup, then we have to cut certain ties and engagements. What we do is we call some coups, coups, and other coups, not coups, as it happened, for example, in Gabon, we didn’t call it a coup. We just need to be a little bit more honest and say we really need to be much more flexible in how we engage with those governments because often the military government really needs engagement more to kind of help them see the way forward, especially those that are very popular with the people when they happen.


VOA: What would you do differently if you got your old job back?


Nagy: I’m not looking to get my old job back because being Assistant Secretary once — is enough. I would look differently to be a little bit less hypocritical, to drop the megaphone, to engage with African governments where they are, not where we want them to be, and to see the world as it is and especially put so much more energy into Sudan, Ethiopia, Sahel, those kinds of conflicts.

## Trump seeks to have civil fraud ruling quashed

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Donald Trump has sought to have a civil judgment against him for fraud and a $464 million penalty set aside "for the greater good of the country" as he prepares to return to power. 


Trump's lawyers filed a letter Tuesday with New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought the proceeding against the president-elect for manipulating his assets when applying for loans and insurances. 


Judge Arthur Engoron ruled against Trump in February, going on to order the mogul-turned-politician pay $464 million, including interest, while his sons Eric and Don Jr. were told to hand over more than $4 million each. 


Trump subsequently sought to challenge the civil ruling as well as the scale and terms of the penalty, which has continued to accrue interest while he appeals. 


"We write to request that you completely dismiss the above-referenced case against President Donald J. Trump, his family, and his businesses, and stipulate to vacate the Judgment and dismiss all claims with prejudice," said the letter from attorney John Sauer, Trump's nominee for solicitor general. 


"In the aftermath of his historic election victory, President Trump has called for our Nation's partisan strife to end, and for the contending factions to join forces for the greater good of the country.  


"This call for unity extends to the legal onslaught against him." 


In the letter, reported by U.S. media, Sauer pointed to recent moves to end or suspend proceedings in several of the criminal cases that Trump had faced. 


"This case warrants the same treatment. As detailed in our appellate briefing, this action exceeds the New York Attorney General's authority under Executive Law ... the dismissal of the case would restore (her) power to its more legitimate scope," the letter said. 


Sauer suggested that if James does not dismiss the case outright, he might seek to argue that the case is unconstitutional, as it interferes with Trump's role as president.  


Sauer did not respond to an AFP request for comment.

## New missile plan by US-Japan eyes Chinese invasion of Taiwan

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A U.S. plan to deploy sophisticated missiles on a Japanese island chain close to Taiwan is prompting angry responses from both China and its close ally Russia.


The United States is drawing up a joint military plan with Japan to deploy High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other weapons to Japan’s Nansei Islands, according to a Sunday report by Kyodo News, which cited unnamed sources. The plan is expected to be completed by December.


The island chain stretches from Japan’s main islands to within 200 kilometers of Taiwan and includes Okinawa,which has a major U.S. military presence. The U.S. could use the missiles to defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island, which Beijing claims as a renegade province.


The plan, the first joint operation by the U.S. and Japan to prepare for a war between Taiwan and China, will involve sending a U.S. Marine Corps regiment that possesses HIMARS and setting up temporary bases on the Nansei Islands to station them, said Kyodo. The Japan Self-Defense Forces would be expected to provide logistic support, including fuel and ammunition.


A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson criticized the reported plan at a press conference on Monday, saying, “China opposes relevant countries using the Taiwan question as an excuse to strengthen military deployment in the region, heighten tensions and confrontation, and disturb regional peace and stability.”


Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova responded with a stronger statement, warning that her country would respond to the deployment with “necessary and proportionate steps” to strengthen its defense capabilities, according to the Russian news agency Tass on Wednesday.


“We have repeatedly warned the Japanese side that if, as a result of such cooperation, U.S. medium-range missiles emerge on its territory, this will pose a real threat to the security of our country,” Zakharova said.


Tass also quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov urging Washington to reconsider the deployment of missiles to the Asia-Pacific. He warned that Moscow will not rule out stationing shorter- and intermediate-range missiles in Asia in response to the U.S. deployment.


Earlier in November, Russian President Vladimir Putin said China is Russia’s ally and “Taiwan is part of China,” and that China conducting wargames near the island is “a completely reasonable policy” while Taipei is escalating tensions.


While Russia and China have no formal military treaty, Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have spoken of having a “no limits” partnership, and the United States accuses China of supporting Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine.


U.S. Secretary Antony Blinken said at a press conference held at the G7 meeting in Italy on Tuesday that China’s support for Russia’s defense industry is “allowing Russia to continue the aggression against Ukraine.”


US-Japan missile plan


Despite Moscow’s alarming rhetoric, analysts say the deployment of HIMARS to the region is primarily aimed at protecting Taiwan from Chinese warships.


“The most important purpose of HIMARS” would be “an anti-ship capability” and to “protect the island and base itself,” said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.


Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said last week at a forum held by the Brookings Institution that China this past summer conducted its largest rehearsal to date for an invasion of Taiwan involving 152 vessels. He cautioned that the U.S. “must be ready.”


The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy possesses the world’s largest naval force with over 370 ships and submarines while the U.S. has about 290 vessels.


Eye on Chinese invasion


Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corp., said HIMARS on the Nansei islands “could help sink amphibious landing ships as well as destroyers and other PLA Navy ships that might approach the island from the north” and also “target concentrations of PLA troops on beaches near Taipei.”


Heath continued, “The fielding of these weapons systems shows that the U.S. and its allies are learning lessons from the Ukraine theater, where HIMARS have been effectively deployed against Russia.”


The U.S. is also planning to deploy the Multi-Domain Task Force’s (MDTS) long-range firing units to the Philippines, said Kyodo news on Sunday. The MDTS uses HIMARS as long-range firing units.


“The deployment of HIMARS to Nansei islands and long-range firing units to the Philippines will impose greater costs on China,” said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, an associate professor at Tokyo International University Institute for International Strategy and a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Indo-Pacific Security Initiative.


“Both locations are vital to deter China’s aggressive moves in not only the Taiwan Strait and East China Seas, but also Beijing’s ambitions in the Pacific. Still, one can expect China to do more to outdo such measures by enhancing their military readiness and conducting more assertive activities in the coming years,” he said.


Taiwan and the Philippines, as well as Japan and Indonesia, make up what China calls the first island chain potentially blocking its military access to the Pacific.


U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin concluded a nine-day trip to the Indo-Pacific on Monday after a series of meetings with the defense heads of countries in the region, including Japan, the Philippines, Australia and South Korea.


At the meetings, Japan agreed to increase its participation in annual trilateral amphibious training with the U.S. and Australia. The Philippines agreed to share military intelligence by signing a General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with the U.S.

## Mexico, Canada warn Trump against raising tariffs

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday that Mexico would retaliate if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump followed through with his proposed 25% across-the-board tariff, a move her government warned could kill 400,000 U.S. jobs and drive up prices for U.S. consumers.


"If there are U.S. tariffs, Mexico would also raise tariffs," Sheinbaum said during a news conference, in her clearest statement yet that the country was preparing possible retaliatory trade measures against its top trade partner.


Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard, speaking alongside Sheinbaum, called for more regional cooperation and integration instead of a war of retaliatory import taxes.


"It's a shot in the foot," Ebrard said of Trump's proposed tariffs, which appear to violate the USMCA trade deal between Mexico, Canada and the U.S.


Ebrard warned the tariffs would lead to massive U.S. job losses, lower growth, and hit U.S. companies producing in Mexico by effectively doubling the taxes they paid. "The impact on companies is huge," he said.


The proposed tariffs would hit the automotive sector's top cross-border exporters especially hard, Ebrard added, namely Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.


Mexico's automotive industry is the country's most important manufacturing sector, exporting predominantly to the United States. It represents nearly 25% of all North American vehicle production.


Analysts at Barclays said they estimate the proposed tariffs "could wipe out effectively all profits" from the Detroit Three automakers.


Gas prices


Canada is also looking at a coordinated response with the federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces agreeing to work in a united way against a threat by Trump, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said Wednesday.


One area affected by the proposed tariffs is Canada’s oil sector.


Even as record oil output has made the U.S. the world's largest producer in recent years, more than a fifth of the oil processed by U.S. refiners is imported from Canada.


In the landlocked U.S. Midwest, where refineries process 70% of the more than 4 million barrels per day of Canadian crude imports, consumers could see pump prices jump by 30 cents per gallon or more, or about 10%, based on current prices, GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan said.


Migration and the border


Sheinbaum and Trump spoke by phone later on Wednesday, the Mexican president said on social media platform X, adding the two discussed "strengthening collaboration on security issues" and that the conversation was "excellent."


In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Sheinbaum "agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border." He described the conversation as "very productive."


Sheinbaum's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.


Trump has previously said the tariffs would remain in effect until the flow of drugs -- particularly fentanyl -- and migrants into the U.S. was controlled.


Sheinbaum added migrant caravans are no longer arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border "because they are attended to" in Mexico.


A caravan of several thousand migrants had been heading through southern Mexico but numbers have dwindled in recent days.

## Microsoft faces antitrust investigation in US

date: 2024-11-28, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.


The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.


The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.


The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.


Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.


Competition complains about practices 


Competitors have criticized Microsoft's practices they say keep customers locked into its cloud offering, Azure. The FTC fielded such complaints last year as it examined the cloud computing market.


NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies such as Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft's licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.


"Given that Microsoft is the world's largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary," the group said.


Google in September complained to the European Commission about Microsoft's practices, saying it made customers pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators, and gave them later and more limited security updates.


The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.


The agency had already claimed jurisdiction over probes into Microsoft and OpenAI over competition in artificial intelligence and started looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI.


Other companies faced accusations


Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators' recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.


Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.


Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.


Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google's trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.


It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.


Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.


In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

## The renter-homeowner wealth gap

date: 2024-11-28, from: Market Place

<p>It&#8217;s probably unsurprising that homeowners are typically wealthier than renters. But a new report from the Aspen Institute shows how wide that gap is: $400,000 median net worth, compared to $10,400, respectively. How do renters catch up? Also in this episode: Older Americans move south to be near family, companies spend more on intellectual property, and a chocolatier in Maine preps for the holiday season.</p>

## From VOA Mandarin: American survivor recounts Battle of Chosin Reservoir

Wednesday marks the 74th anniversary of the start of the battle of Chosin Reservoir, a key moment in the Korean War. On November 27, 1950, Chinese forces launched a surprise attack on American troops that lasted 17 days in freezing weather.


VOA Mandarin has an exclusive interview with Robert Harlan, one of the survivors of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir (Lake Changjin). Harlan’s experience is different from what was depicted in a Chinese epic movie: “The Battle on Lake Changjin,” commissioned by China’s Communist Party in 2021.

## US lawmaker calls for release of Vietnamese political prisoner

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A top U.S. lawmaker has pledged to work with rights groups as a special advocate for Dang Dinh Bach, a Vietnamese climate activist and political prisoner, and called on Hanoi to immediately release Bach from jail.


Representative Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, announced that he will advocate for Bach through the Defending Freedoms Project, part of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, according to a statement exclusively obtained by VOA Mandarin Service.


“Vietnam’s communist government maintains its clutch on power by crusading hard against good faith dissenters like Dang Dinh Bach, breaching the fundamental political, social and civil rights of their people,” Raskin said in the statement.


“Mr. Bach’s continued unjust detainment is an affront to global human rights law and climate activism around the world, and I am honored to sponsor his case through the Lantos Commission’s Defending Freedom Project. Mr. Bach should be released immediately,” Raskin said.




VOA asked the Vietnamese Embassy in the U.S. for comment about Bach's case but has not received a response.


Bach is an environmental lawyer and co-founder and former executive director of the Law and Policy of Sustainable Development Research Center. The LPSD is a Vietnamese nonprofit organization that works with local communities to protect the environment and promote human rights.


Bach was arrested in 2021 and convicted of tax evasion a year later. He was allowed to meet with his lawyers only 10 days prior to the trial and is serving a five-year sentence at a prison in Vietnam’s Nghe An Province. Human rights advocates call the tax invasion charge fraudulent. Authorities shut down LPSD after Bach’s arrest.


The Defending Freedoms Project was launched in 2012 in collaboration with the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and Amnesty International USA. It has since expanded to include Reporters Without Borders, Freedom House, Freedom Now, Scholars at Risk, PEN America and the Senate Human Rights Caucus.


According to DFP, members of Congress sponsoring a prisoner receive a detailed toolkit for advocacy, which includes writing letters to prisoners and their families, giving speeches and publishing op-eds. They can also initiate legislative actions, hold discussions or hearings and petition executive departments such as the State Department and the White House for support.


By taking on a case, lawmakers can help secure releases, reduce sentences, improve prison conditions and raise awareness of unjust laws.


In Vietnam, more than 160 political prisoners are in jail, according to Human Rights Watch.


Bach is one of several climate activists imprisoned in Vietnam after advocating for the country’s move away from coal-based energy. His case has received widespread attention from human rights groups and environment groups.


“Dang Dinh Bach is a dedicated rights defender focused on climate issues, currently serving a five-year prison sentence in Vietnam on dubious charges of ‘tax evasion,’” said Kat Cosgrove, deputy director of policy and advocacy at Freedom House.


“Since 2021, Vietnamese authorities have frequently used this charge to target and silence local activists, and these charges appear aimed solely at stopping Mr. Bach’s vital work and weakening civil society,” she said.


Maureen Harris, senior adviser for International Rivers and coordinator of the Vietnam Climate Defenders Coalition, called on the international community to speak out for Bach.


“Environmental human rights defenders like Bach are critical to the battle against climate change. Vietnam's government should stop persecuting climate leaders. I hope that the international community stands up for Bach and calls on the Vietnamese government to end his wrongful incarceration,” she said.


The U.S. State Department, the European Union and the United Nations have previously issued statements calling not only for Bach’s release but other climate activists wrongfully imprisoned in Vietnam.


In May 2023, the U.N. Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding Bach's imprisonment in "violation of international law."


The group called for his immediate release and expressed concern about a "systemic problem with arbitrary detention" of environmental defenders in Vietnam.

## Trump to name retired Army lieutenant general as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he will nominate retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg to serve as assistant to the president and special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.


Kellogg was chief of staff on Trump’s National Security Council during his first administration and was the national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence.


“Together, we will secure peace through strength, and make America, and the world, safe again,” Trump said in a statement naming Kellogg as envoy.


Kellogg spoke exclusively with VOA’s Ukrainian service in July about his vision for ending the war in Ukraine, published as part of the book, “An America First Approach to U.S. National Security.” At the time he said he had not presented the plan to Trump nor was he a formal adviser but said the plan would be one option to consider.




He recommended then that the U.S. begin a formal policy "to seek a ceasefire and negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict."


"Over time, all conflicts end in some type of negotiation. So you want to make sure that the Ukrainians do not come from a position of weakness, but also from a position of strength. So the question is how to do it? How to put the right components in their places," Kellogg told VOA in July.




The U.S. would continue to arm Ukraine to deter Russia from attacking during or after a deal is reached, under the condition that Kyiv agrees to enter into peace talks with Russia.


To persuade Russia to participate in the negotiations, Kellogg wrote that the U.S. and other NATO partners would delay Ukraine's membership in the alliance for an extended period in exchange for a "comprehensive and verifiable deal with security guarantees."


Under the imagined deal, Ukraine would not be asked to give up its ambition to regain all land seized by Russia, but Kyiv should agree to use diplomatic means only and realize that it might take a long time to regain all of the territories. The strategy proposes partial lifting of sanctions on Russia to encourage the Kremlin to take steps toward peace and establish levies on Russian energy imports to fund Ukraine's reconstruction.


"You either have to find a way to stop the war or you want it to continue with no clear end in sight. ... This does not mean that Ukraine surrenders, it does not mean that they give up territory, nothing like that,” he said in July.

Each year, the nonprofit recommends <a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/top-climate-change-nonprofit-donations-recommendations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a set of nonprofits</u></a> that are trying to solve the climate problem effectively and efficiently, and get the world closer to decarbonization.</p><p>Giving Green, in other words, is somewhat like the climate-specific version of <a href="https://givewell.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Givewell</u></a>, an uber-utilitarian group that identifies which global charities maximize the number of lives saved per dollar spent. But it’s much more difficult— or at least much less clear — to identify which nonprofits might best fight climate change than it is which nonprofits might save the most lives through targeted interventions. </p><p>Climate change is a globe-spanning sociotechnical problem, a political quandary baked into humanity’s largest-scale engineering systems. Even when a government or technology has seemingly pushed the world forward, it can be unclear <em><em>why </em></em>the improvement happened, or whether, in the long run, it will make a meaningful difference. The Paris Agreement, after all, has been around for nearly a decade, the European Union’s cap-and-trade scheme for nearly two. Yet academics, experts, and politicians can (and do) disagree about whether either policy has ultimately helped — and even why they happened in the first place.</p><p>To resolve this problem, Giving Green reviews <a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/giving-green's-research-process" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the historical record</u></a> to identify <a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/climate-change-mitigation-strategies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>philanthropic strategies</u></a> that seem like they have a good shot of leading to emissions reductions. This year, it has focused on eight, including next-generation geothermal, decarbonizing aviation and marine shipping, advancing nuclear energy, and speeding the energy transition in low- and middle-income countries. Then it looks for groups that are working on those problems in time-proven ways. This year, it also started a grant fund so that it could support some of these groups itself.</p><p>I spoke with <a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/about-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Daniel Stein</u></a>, Giving Green’s director, earlier this week. Our interview has been edited and condensed for readability.</p><p><strong>What is Giving Green’s goal with these recommendations? </strong></p><p>The main goal — the problem we are trying to solve — is that we believe that there are lots of people who want to do something about climate, and there’s a lot of money that’s paralyzed by indecision and sits on the sidelines. So we provide a comprehensively researched guide with a systematic approach to try and determine where the high leverage points are in climate philanthropy — and by high-leverage, I’m thinking most greenhouse gas reductions per dollar.</p><p>We focus in on what we call philanthropic strategies, specific things that people could be doing. Then we find organizations working on those strategies that are doing a great job and promote them. </p><p><strong>Can you tell me about a few of the organizations that you have chosen?</strong></p><p>We have some that we’ve recommended for a few years, such as <a href="https://www.catf.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Clean Air Task Force</u></a>. Last year, one of our big pushes was geothermal energy, and so we’ve recommended <a href="https://projectinnerspace.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Project Innerspace</u></a>, who are a big advocate for geothermal and work a lot with both private industry and the government.</p><p>Another big area of focus for us over the past few years has been heavy industry. The case for philanthropic support for heavy industry is really, really clear. Depending on what estimate you use, heavy industry accounts for roughly a quarter of carbon emissions, but something like less than 5% of philanthropic spending. There’s very little policy teeth almost anywhere in the world on industry, and basically nothing in the U.S., but there are pathways to solving it. We kind of know how to make green steel and green aluminum, and at least have ideas on concrete and plastic. There’s a lot nonprofits can do to pave the way forward in terms of: What does policy look like? How do we get from where we are today — where we kind of know the technology but no one’s using it — to a place where there’s actually supply and demand in the future? So our top recommendations for that is an organization called <a href="https://industriouslabs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Industrious Labs</u></a> in the U.S. and an organization called <a href="https://fcarchitects.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Future Cleantech Architects</u></a> in Europe. </p><p><strong>Over the past five years, I feel like I’ve seen your mission evolve and your strategies evolve. At the beginning, you recommended giving to a mix of high-end research and policy-development groups, and then also to more grassroots, movement-type groups. But over time, your set of recommendations have become much more focused on groups that are like CATF, that are providing nonpartisan, highly expert information and analysis.</strong></p><p>I think that’s right, but it is not necessarily that we have just changed our mind on what works. I think different moments in time call for different approaches. And in those heady years leading up to the Inflation Reduction Act — where there was hope for a Democratic trifecta, and then it happened — there was a major opportunity for a left-driven, all-of-government push on climate. That was what we thought these grassroots groups were in a good position to push forward.</p><p>I think when you look back, you see groups like Sunrise having a really powerful influence. Obviously people disagree on what forces got the IRA to happen. But I really do think that you can draw a direct line from this progressive advocacy to the Democrats believing that they had to do something about climate to please their base.</p><p>But our view is that that moment has passed. Especially post-IRA, this opportunity for a more progressive-led legislative process has ended. Even if the Democrats were still in control, I think you weren’t going to get big bills like the IRA. We moved to a point where we need to focus on the wonky details of implementing these bills and then passing more technical, focused policy in the future. Our view is that in the U.S., the big opportunities have shifted to what we would call the “insider” groups. But I think that could change again, and it could change based on geography.</p><p><strong>Are there any big climate strategies nobody is working on right now — where you identified a place where money could be spent, but you couldn’t find a nonprofit focused on it? </strong></p><p>One of our high-level strategies is solar radiation management. That was something that was new for us this year. And within that, we would look at very specific substrategies. Should we be funding research? Should we be funding governance? And within those little sub-elements, we occasionally found stuff where we were like, wow, we really wish there was a group working on this, but we didn’t find anything. </p><p>But one of the nice things about having a [grant-making] fund this year, for the first time ever, is that we could help get things started that didn’t exist before. We’re super excited about industry, and so much industry is happening in developing countries. But when you ask,<em><em> Who is focused on reducing steel emissions in Indonesia?</em></em>, there were very few organizations. We made a grant to an organization called Climate Catalyst — they were already working on steel in India, and we helped them expand into emissions reduction in Indonesia.</p><p><strong>I think some people might see your list and go, </strong><em><strong><em>Wow, these are a bunch of high-end research and elite advocacy organizations, but what’s actually going to solve the climate crisis is local organizing</em></strong></em><strong>.</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>How would you reply to that?</strong></p><p>I think that’s a reasonable point. We are open to all of these things, and we have considered them, and I think there is a time and place for grassroots approaches and activism. But looking at the historical research and our own research, I believe that the approaches that work on this are ones where the activism is tied to clear policy demands — that are <em><em>good</em></em> policies, that can have big, systematic decreases in emissions and seem to have some sort of feasible pathway to success.</p><p>What I’ve seen in a lot of grassroots movements in recent years are things like throwing soup at paintings, or blocking streets, which have not had this direct policy connection, and we are pretty skeptical of those approaches. But if grassroots approaches came on our radar that have a super viable theory of change to altering policy, we are very open.</p><p><strong>This is the fifth year you’ve put out recommendations like this, right? What have you learned or changed your mind about during that time? </strong></p><p>One of the things that’s really crystallized in our mind is that we really think the big levers are in systems. And that can mean a lot of things, but to us, it really means three things — it means policy, technology, and markets.</p><p>To solve the climate crisis, you need to change the rules of the game, such that everyday actors — people making decisions, businesses — everybody changes their behavior because some technology got cheaper, or some policy changed. We really use that to focus ourselves to think about, What are the big changes that need to happen, and how do we work backward to the actions that get us there? </p><p>So I think that might be why you see some of these more insider, techno-analysis-driven approaches. Because when you step back and you think, alright, we need this market to change in this way, or we need this technology to develop that doesn’t currently exist, and you think about how you get there, a lot of times you need advocacy to change policy, and you need research to make that policy change possible.</p><p><em><em>This year, Giving Green has recommended six top groups fighting climate change. They are:</em></em></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.catf.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Clean Air Task Force</u></a>, an American nonprofit that focuses on researching and advocating technologies essential to decarbonizing the economy, including next-generation geothermal, zero-carbon fuels, and shipping</li><li><a href="https://fcarchitects.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Future Cleantech Architects</u></a>, a German think tank that focuses on economic activities — such as cement-making and shipping — where “sustainable solutions are still in very early stages”</li><li><a href="https://gfi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The Good Food Institute</u></a>, a global nonprofit that wants to make non-animal proteins equal in taste and price to animal equivalents</li><li><a href="https://industriouslabs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Industrious Labs</u></a>, an American nonprofit that wants to organize efforts to decarbonize heavy industry</li><li><a href="https://www.opportunitygreen.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Opportunity Green</u></a>, a British nonprofit that focuses on decarbonizing aviation and shipping</li><li><a href="https://projectinnerspace.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Project Innerspace</u></a>, an American nonprofit that wants to expand geothermal energy as quickly as possible</li></ul>

## Cabinet nominees targeted with threats, Trump spokesperson says

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Several of Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees and appointees were targeted with "violent threats," including bomb threats and "swatting," a spokesperson for the U.S. president-elect said Wednesday.


The threats were made Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, and law enforcement and authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those targeted, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.


Leavitt did not say who was targeted, and she did not elaborate on the nature of the apparent threats. Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


Leavitt said the attacks "ranged from bomb threats to 'swatting'" — when a false crime is reported to induce a heavy, armed police response at someone's home.

## Trump’s EPA pick vows to restore US energy dominance

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

Washington — When U.S. President-elect Donald Trump nominated former Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Trump described him as a “True fighter for America First policies.” 


Zeldin, the statement added, spent eight years in Congress as a vocal advocate on foreign policy, border security, military affairs, combating antisemitism, environmental issues and energy policy. 


Shortly after the announcement was made, Zeldin, a native from Long Island, New York who is married with twin daughters, took to the X social media platform, leaving no doubt about his priorities for his new role. He promised to “restore US energy dominance, revitalize the auto industry, bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI.”


Environmental record 


Zeldin, who has a law degree from Albany Law School, has vowed to protect access to clean air and clean water. While in Congress, he voted in favor of limiting the presence of toxic substances known as PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” in drinking water. 


He stood against offshore drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to protect coastal communities and marine wildlife from oil spills. Environmental organizations have also highlighted Zeldin’s support for the Great American Outdoors Act, which increased funding for maintenance of public lands and waters. 


The League of Conservation Voters, or LCV, however, noted in reaction to Zeldin’s nomination that during his four terms in Congress, he voted in favor of environmental legislation just 14% of the time. 


The LCV’s voting tracker shows Zeldin rejected most of the legislative proposals related to climate change. The Republican never served on committees with oversight of environmental policy, but he was part of the House Climate Solutions Caucus, a short-lived bipartisan effort tasked with building a constructive dialogue on climate change. 


WATCH: US climate changes regulations to be scaled back under Trump's EPA pick




Change of priorities 


At this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres renewed his call for countries to move away from burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of global warming. 


"The sound you hear is the ticking clock. We are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and time is not on our side," Guterres said. 


Under Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration, the EPA has set limits on the production of oil and gas and prioritized the production of clean and renewable power in a bid to fight climate change. 


The EPA’s website currently states that “understanding and addressing climate change is critical to the agency’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.” 


President-elect Trump’s economic vision for the country will now take precedence. "We will blast through every bureaucratic hurdle to issue rapid approvals for new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new electric plants and reactors of all types,” Trump told attendees at The Economic Club of New York on September 5. 


Zeldin expressed similar views when running for New York governor in 2022. “We should reverse the state’s ban on the safe extraction of natural gas. Approve new pipeline applications,” he said during a campaign event. 


If confirmed to the Cabinet post, Zeldin says he will move swiftly to implement Trump’s economic agenda and roll back a wide range of Biden-era environmental protections on Day One. 


"There are regulations that the left wing of this country have been advocating through regulatory power that ends up causing businesses to go in the wrong direction,” he told Fox News on November 11. 


Climate action in US  


The Trump administration will have broad power to reverse several EPA rules including those curbing carbon emissions from power plants or vehicles. However, climate action in the United States won’t come to a complete halt, according to Carbon Direct policy analyst Zara Ahmed. 


"Consumers can choose to purchase a low-emissions vehicle. States can choose to enact their own regulations about emissions,” she told the Reuters news agency. 


Some information is from AP, AFP and Reuters.

## US imposes sanctions on 21 top Venezuelan officials over election crackdown

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 21 security and Cabinet-level officials aligned with Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro for what the Biden administration says are anti-democratic actions and violation of human rights perpetrated since the country’s July 28 election.


The group includes 15 leaders of the Bolivarian national guard, national police, national intelligence service members and the general directorate of military counterintelligence, who according to a high-level representative of the administration have targeted innocent civilians for repression and reprisals.


In a statement Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States is “acting again today to hold Nicolas Maduro and his representatives accountable for undermining the electoral process in Venezuela and repressing the Venezuelan people.”


Blinken said Maduro and his representatives continue to falsely claim victory in the election while his security apparatus “has engaged in widespread abuses, including killings, repression and mass detention of protesters.”


International election observers have cast doubt on official results from the July 28 election. The U.S. and Venezuelan opposition parties maintain that Maduro lost the election to opposition candidate Edmundo González, who fled to Spain after Venezuelan authorities issued a warrant for his arrest.


The U.S. says it has now sanctioned 180 current or former Venezuelan officials for “repressing and intimidating the democratic opposition in a desperate and illegitimate attempt to cling to power.”


The State Department said it also has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on nearly 2,000 people for their role in undermining the electoral process or in acts of repression in Venezuela.


The Biden administration, according to a senior official who spoke to reporters on Wednesday, has given “Nicholas Maduro and his representatives every opportunity to do the right thing.”


Instead, the official said, “Maduro and [his] representatives decided to use violent repression and defeat power at all costs. This is not something the United States will stand for, and nor will other countries in the region.”


The U.S. has not yet imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil production or energy sector – something that has shown in the past to bring the government to the negotiating table.


“As for the possibility of imposing energy sanctions, just because we have not taken an action so far does not mean that we will not take an action in the future,” explained a senior administration official Wednesday.

## US inflation gauge ticks higher with price pressures still stubborn

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Consumer price increases accelerated last month, the latest sign that inflation's steady decline over the past two years has stalled.


According to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, consumer prices rose 2.3% in October from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That is up from just 2.1% in September, though it is still only modestly above the Fed's 2% target.


Yet excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called “core” prices also picked up, climbing 2.8% last month from a year earlier, up from 2.7% in September. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.  


Inflation has fallen sharply since it peaked at 7% in mid-2022, according to the Fed's preferred measure. Yet yearly core inflation has been stuck at 2.8% since February. Price increases have remained elevated in services, including apartment rents, restaurant meals, and car and home insurance.


Wednesday's report also underscored that Americans' incomes and spending remained healthy, a key reason the economy has kept growing this year despite widespread fears of a slowdown. Incomes grew 0.6% from September to October, faster than economists had expected, while consumer spending rose by a solid 0.4% last month.

## Walmart rethinks DEI

date: 2024-11-27, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Walmart is the latest company to rollback its commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, following legal challenges from conservative activists. Those lawsuits allege that these kinds of programs are themselves discriminatory. The nation&#8217;s largest retailer joins a growing list of companies that just a few years ago were showing off their efforts to address racial disparities. Then, we&#8217;ll look into the impact of tariffs on consumer spending and the opening of Greenland&#8217;s new international airport.</p>

## 3 Americans released by China

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Three Americans detained in China for years have been released and will be returning to the United States, the White House announced Wednesday.


“We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People’s Republic of China,” a National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement.  


It’s a diplomatic win for President Joe Biden who will be leaving office in January. With the men’s release, “all of the wrongfully detained Americans” in China have been returned, the spokesperson added.


The three had been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained. Swidan had been facing a death sentence on drug charges while Li and Leung were imprisoned on espionage charges. 


“Soon they will return and be reunited with their families for the first time in many years,” the spokesperson said.


Biden and his aides have raised the issue of the three Americans with Beijing repeatedly, according to U.S. officials. In his last in-person meeting on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru earlier this month, Biden also spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping to press for their return.


During his term Biden has brought home over 70 Americans unjustly detained around the world. Rights groups say more than 40 others are still being held hostage or wrongfully detained in over a dozen countries.

## EV sales have been hitting records … and speedbumps

date: 2024-11-27, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Electric vehicle sales are growing, and are on track for another record year. But that growth is slowing down. A McKinsey study from earlier this year found that 46% of EV owners in the U.S. were likely to switch back to combustion engines for their next car. Among them, is Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino. On a recent episode of &#8220;Marketplace Tech,&#8221; she explained why she decided to sell her EV and not buy another to replace it. Also on the show, how Instacart&#8217;s new SNAP eligibility tool works and why farmers are working extra jobs.</p>

Less than half – 44% – of the experts polled by CREA said China’s emissions have already peaked, or will peak next year. Two years ago, just 15% of experts believed that to be the case. And 36% of experts said China’s coal consumption has peaked, up from 20% who said that last year.

Nearly 85% of the staffers who responded reported that climate change – and especially extreme heat – is affecting their patients’ health. Many said extreme weather events were harming their clinic’s ability to provide care due to effects like power outages and staff shortages. About 16% of respondents said extreme weather contributed to loss or spoilage of vaccines. But just one-third of respondents said they’d spoken to patients about the increasing health risks associated with climate change, saying they had more important topics to discuss in the limited amount of time available during consultations. And 61% cited their own lack of knowledge about the connection between climate change and health. Interestingly, just 34% said politics or polarization were stopping them from bringing up climate change when discussing health risks.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>How are you thinking about Ford and GM right now? Because they have basically totally reversed their position since the first time we started talking.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Corey Cantor: </strong>I hope I’m not too corny today, but I was thinking Missy Elliott — another New Jerseyan — “flip it and reverse it,” in terms of how people feel about Ford and GM. I think GM’s approach … don’t forget this is their second platform at the rodeo here, meaning GM had the Bolt and the Chevy Volt before it, and a good amount of experience with EVs. And really, what they were trying to do with Ultium was to build a battery and EV platform that could work with a variety of different vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
And so the struggle, as we’ve outlined before, and many publications have outlined was they just couldn’t get the battery production working. They had issues with automation. They had issues with ensuring that they were setting up the necessary suppliers. And I’d say, about maybe nine months ago or so, a favorite EV journalist of mine, John Voelcker 
	<a href="https://insideevs.com/features/709703/gm-ultium-problems-software-batteries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a> in, I believe, <em><em>InsideEVs</em></em>, around this idea that GM had finally cracked Ultium and were finally kind of … He had got the head of Ultium at the time on record saying that they had resolved a lot of the issues, and really, you’ve seen it in the sales volume, as well as the fact that EVs like the Cadillac Lyric continue to sell pretty consistently.<br/>
<br/>
Then GM ran into a software issue with the Blazer, and fixed that software issue, and that had slowed things down. And then since, really, June of this year has been off to the races. And so we’ll see how the fourth quarter goes, right? I think you don’t want to get too high on any kind of automaker, but GM is clearly in a better spot because they’re approaching making a profit on each of the EVs sold.
	<br/>
<br/>
Now, I’ll caveat that with, we don’t know if the EV tax credit itself, you know, at the federal level, plays a role in the fact that they’ll be gross margin profitable, but that is a pretty big turning point. Because at that point, you’re no longer losing money on those EVs, and so you are kind of geared to go more high-volume. Where if you look at Ford, Ford has been losing thousands of dollars on every electric vehicle, really had not been building a platform for the current sales of the Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning, hoping to kind of just price them where they’d be losing little enough on each that they can make their bridge to that next platform.
	<br/>
<br/>
And then earlier this fall, Ford basically announced pushing back those EV models to 2027, along with the new platform. So Ford kind of runs into the issue that we discussed on the 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>previous conversation with Tesla</u></a>, in that they’re going to have only really two EVs in the U.S. market for the next couple of years. So GM will have the Bolt back next year and some other Cadillacs. There’s a lot of exciting things on the way for GM.

## Long-sought court ruling restores Oregon tribe's hunting, fishing rights

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

LINCOLN CITY, Ore.  — Drumming made the floor vibrate and singing filled the conference room of the Chinook Winds Casino Resort in Lincoln City, on the Oregon coast, as hundreds in tribal regalia danced in a circle.


For the last 47 years, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians have held an annual powwow to celebrate regaining federal recognition. This month’s event, however, was especially significant: It came just two weeks after a federal court lifted restrictions on the tribe's rights to hunt, fish and gather — restrictions tribal leaders had opposed for decades.


“We're back to the way we were before,” Siletz Chairman Delores Pigsley said. “It feels really good.”


The Siletz is a confederation of over two dozen bands and tribes whose traditional homelands spanned western Oregon, as well as parts of northern California and southwestern Washington state. The federal government in the 1850s forced them onto a reservation on the Oregon coast, where they were confederated together as a single, federally recognized tribe despite their different backgrounds and languages.


In the 1950s and ‘60s, Congress revoked recognition of over 100 tribes, including the Siletz, under a policy known as “termination.” Affected tribes lost millions of acres of land as well as federal funding and services.


“The goal was to try and assimilate Native people, get them moved into cities,” said Matthew Campbell, deputy director of the Native American Rights Fund. “But also I think there was certainly a financial aspect to it. I think the United States was trying to see how it could limit its costs in terms of providing for tribal nations.”


Losing their lands and self-governance was painful, and the tribes fought for decades to regain federal recognition. In 1977, the Siletz became the second tribe to succeed, following the restoration of the Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin in 1973.


But to get a fraction of its land back — roughly 1,457 hectares of the 445,000-hectare reservation established for the tribe in 1855 — the Siletz tribe had to agree to a federal court order that restricted their hunting, fishing and gathering rights. It was only one of two tribes in the country, along with Oregon’s Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, compelled to do so to regain tribal land.


The settlement limited where tribal members could fish, hunt and gather for ceremonial and subsistence purposes, and it imposed caps on how many salmon, elk and deer could be harvested in a year. It was devastating, tribal chair Pigsley recalled: The tribe was forced to buy salmon for ceremonies because it couldn’t provide for itself, and people were arrested for hunting and fishing violations.


“Giving up those rights was a terrible thing,” Pigsley, who has led the tribe for 36 years, told The Associated Press earlier this year. “It was unfair at the time, and we’ve lived with it all these years.”


Decades later, Oregon and the U.S. came to recognize that the agreement subjecting the tribe to state hunting and fishing rules was biased, and they agreed to join the tribe in recommending to the court that the restrictions be lifted.


“The Governor of Oregon and Oregon’s congressional representatives have since acknowledged that the 1980 Agreement and Consent Decree were a product of their times and represented a biased and distorted position on tribal sovereignty, tribal traditions, and the Siletz Tribe’s ability and authority to manage and sustain wildlife populations it traditionally used for tribal ceremonial and subsistence purposes,” attorneys for the U.S., state and tribe wrote in a joint court filing.


Late last month, the tribe finally succeeded in having the court order vacated by a federal judge. And a separate agreement with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has given the tribe a greater role in regulating tribal hunting and fishing.


As Pigsley reflected on those who passed away before seeing the tribe regain its rights, she expressed hope about the next generation carrying on essential traditions.


“There’s a lot of youth out there that are learning tribal ways and culture,” she said. “It’s important today because we are trying to raise healthy families, meaning we need to get back to our natural foods.”


Among those celebrating and praying at the powwow was Tiffany Stuart, donning a basket cap her ancestors were known for weaving, and her 3-year-old daughter Kwestaani Chuski, whose name means “six butterflies” in the regional Athabaskan language from southwestern Oregon and northwestern California.


Given the restoration of rights, Stuart said, it was “very powerful for my kids to dance.”


“You dance for the people that can’t dance anymore,” she said.

## Trump announces picks for economic, health posts

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced a set of economic advisers he wants to appoint for his administration, including international trade attorney Jamieson Greer as his pick to be the U.S. trade representative.


Greer served in Trump’s first administration as the chief of staff to the trade representative, and Trump said Tuesday that Greer played a key role in both imposing tariffs on China and in the creation of a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico.


Trump said Kevin Hassett is his choice to lead the White House National Economic Council.


Hassett led the Council of Economic Advisers during Trump’s previous term. Trump said in the new role, Hassett would work to “renew and improve” a set of tax cuts implemented in 2017 and “will play an important role in helping American families recover from the inflation that was unleashed by the Biden Administration.”


Trump also announced Tuesday several health-related nominees, including his choice of health economist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health.


Bhattacharya was a sharp critic of lockdowns and vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Trump said Bhattacharya will work with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), “to direct the Nation’s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.”


“Together, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America’s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease," Trump said.


Another nomination announced Tuesday was Trump’s pick of former HHS official Jim O’Neill to serve as the agency’s deputy secretary.


Trump also said he was nominating private investor John Phelan to serve as secretary of the Navy.


Earlier Tuesday, Trump’s transition team announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Biden administration about the process of starting to work with federal agencies.


A statement from Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, said, “This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power.”


Wiles’ announcement said the transition will use only private funding, and the donors will be disclosed to the public.


The Trump-Vance transition team will not use government offices or technology, Wiles said. She added that the transition has an existing ethics plan and “security and information protections built in, which means we will not require additional government and bureaucratic oversight.”


The signing of the MOU means that teams from the transition will “quickly integrate directly into federal agencies and departments with access to documents and policy sharing,” Wiles’ announcement said.


Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.

## Can China hit its 5% growth target under Trump’s tariffs?

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

The prospect of punishing new U.S. tariffs will hang over the deliberations at China's highest-level economic meeting when the Central Economic Work Conference of the Chinese Communist Party convenes for its annual session next month.


A key function of the meeting will be to set the nation’s growth target for 2025, a task made more challenging by the prospect of tariffs that could stunt the crucial export sector.


U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened repeatedly during his election campaign to swiftly impose a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods. He wrote on his Truth Social account late Monday that he will impose “an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of [China’s] many products coming into the United States of America.” 


Most of the Chinese government advisers interviewed for a Reuters report this month recommended that Beijing maintain an economic growth target of 5.0% for next year, the same target as 2024.


Some said the country would have to launch stronger fiscal stimulus measures to offset the impact of new U.S. tariffs after Trump takes office in January.


Cai Shenkun, an independent commentator in the United States, told VOA Mandarin that Beijing’s “5% target” is clearly based on political necessity, rather than a market perspective.


After securing an extraordinary third term as president last year, Chinese leader Xi Jinping "will have to give the CCP an explanation and a vision,” Cai said. “He must make a good gesture. If he does not maintain the 5% target, his ruling position will be greatly threatened.”


Si Ling, a financial scholar in Australia, said in a phone interview with VOA Mandarin that if China wants to achieve its goal of doubling the size of its economy from 2020 to 2035, the annual economic growth rate must reach 4%.


“China has taken into account the uncertainty factors, like external shocks when Trump pledged to impose high tariffs. China must face the sudden decline in GDP growth,” said Si.


Reuters reported last month that China's economy is likely to expand 4.8% in 2024, missing the government's 5% growth target, and could slow to 4.5% in 2025. 


Si said the growth of China's current GDP is dependent on exports and investments. If Trump fulfills his promise to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods, the impact on China's economy will be profound, he said.


“China's advantages in industrial products exports, brought by high state subsidies, will be completely wiped out due to high tariffs," Si said. "Can the domestic market digest the industrial products intended for export? Many of these industrial enterprises have already begun to reduce their production scale. This means more people will lose their jobs.”


Local debt and real estate woes


Independent commentator Cai warned that overreliance on stimulus measures may exacerbate local government debt problems.


“Private capital does not dare to invest anymore. State-owned enterprises can no longer play the role of investment pioneers," Cai said. "‘Maintaining the 5% target’ means printing a lot of cash, pouring it into the market, issuing a lot of treasury bonds and increasing the fiscal deficit. This is the only way. But it will have a great negative impact on the stability of the RMB currency value.”


A new wave of property market challenges will likely occur in the next 10 years, Cai said.


“In the past, people saw property as a means of asset appreciation or value preservation. Now the future housing market looks dark to everyone. If we continue to build houses, who will buy them? In the end, it may only lead to an avalanche-like bubble, which will burst completely."


Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last month that unless China's economy shifts from an export and investment-driven model to a consumer demand-driven model, its economic growth may slow to “well below 4%.”

## China state media dismiss Trump's tariff vow, focus on fentanyl

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — China's state media shrugged off U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods in editorials late on Tuesday, accusing the former president of blaming China for the country's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.


Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said on Monday he would impose "an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs" on imports from China. He previously said he would introduce tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods.


The tariff threat is rattling China's industrial complex, which sells goods worth more than $400 billion annually to the U.S. and hundreds of billions more in components for products Americans buy from elsewhere.


Economists have begun downgrading their growth targets for the $19 trillion economy for 2025 and 2026.


Editorials in Chinese communist party mouthpieces China Daily and the Global Times focused squarely on the reason Trump gave for imposing the tariffs: fentanyl.


"Scapegoating others can't end U.S.' drug crisis," read the headline of a China Daily editorial on Tuesday, while the Global Times urged the "U.S. not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation after Trump's remarks."


"The excuse the president-elect has given to justify his threat of additional tariffs on imports from China is farfetched," China Daily said. "The world sees clearly that the root cause of the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. lies with the U.S. itself," it added.


"There are no winners in tariff wars. If the U.S. continues to politicize economic and trade issues by weaponizing tariffs, it will leave no party unscathed."


Trump's team maintains China is “attacking” the U.S. with fentanyl.


China is the dominant source of chemical precursors used by Mexican cartels to produce the deadly drug. Trump on Monday also pledged 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada until they clamp down on drugs and migrants crossing the border.


Trump is threatening Beijing with far higher tariffs than the 7.5%-25% levied on Chinese goods during his first term.


S&P Global on Sunday lowered its growth forecast for China for 2025 and 2026 by 0.2 and 0.7 percentage point, respectively, to 4.1% and 3.8%, citing the impact Trump's tariffs could have.


"What we assumed in our baseline is an across-the-board increase from around 14% now to 25%. Thus, what we assumed is a bit more than the 10% on all imports from China," said Louis Kuijs, Chief Asia Economist at S&P Global Ratings. "For now, the only thing we know for sure is that the risks in this area are high."

## Promise and peril for Southeast Asia in Trump’s tariff talk

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

BANGKOK — Southeast Asia could see a new wave of factories moving in from China to evade the soaring tariffs U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has proposed to impose on the world’s second-largest economy, trade experts tell VOA.


But the trade surpluses the region has built up with the United States and its heavy use of Chinese inputs for its own exports may blunt the benefits, they add.


A number of firms with factories in China, both Chinese and foreign owned, moved their plants to Southeast Asia to skirt the tariffs Trump imposed on the country — as high as 25% on some goods — during his first term from 2017 to 2021. For his second term, which starts in January, Trump has threatened to push tariffs on all imports from China up to 60%.


If that happens, “the speed of relocation will increase, and we will almost certainly now be looking at a world of bifurcated supply chains,” said Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.


“What that means is a world where most important manufactured goods are produced not once but twice using two sets of supply chains,” he added, one for the U.S. and possibly European markets and another for everyone else.


And whereas the first wave of relocations mostly brought Southeast Asia factories hungry for lots of cheap labor, he said the second could bring in factories that rely more on equipment, technology and other capital for making machines, electronics, cars and the like.


“Countries that can closely replicate the costs and conditions in China will benefit, and at the moment a lot of those countries are in Southeast Asia,” Menon said. “Other countries can benefit if they respond to this opportunity, but at the moment Southeast Asia is the closest competitor.”


Aat Pisanwanich, an associate professor at Thailand’s Center for International Trade Studies, agreed.


Facing even higher U.S. tariffs than before, factories in China will “come to Thailand and other ASEAN countries more than [during] Trump 1,” he said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and to Trump’s first term.


Memon said most of the factories that left China for Southeast Asia after Trump’s first round of tariffs settled in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam and that those fleeing a second would follow suit. He added that Cambodia and Laos — both very close with China — as well as Indonesia could start to attract more interest as well.


Some of the sub-region’s largest industrial park developers and operators have reportedly begun preparing for an expected influx already by expanding their sales teams and hiring more Chinese speakers.


But trade experts say Trump’s take on tariffs, and on international trade in general, also poses risks for Southeast Asia that could dull, or even outstrip, the potential rewards.


Trump has repeatedly railed against the trade surpluses many countries besides China have built up with the U.S. and suggested bringing them down with higher tariffs on their goods as well, or with other trade restrictions.


That could prove problematic for many countries in Asia, and Vietnam especially, says Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, a Singapore-based research group focused on sustainable global trade.


Trump called Vietnam “almost the single worst abuser” of the global trade system in 2019, when the country’s annual trade surplus with the U.S. stood at $55.8 billion. It has soared well past $100 billion since then.


“That’s put Vietnam quite high up in the crosshairs for retaliation this time, and that makes it a less popular location for firms because you don’t want to move out of China into Vietnam, only to find yourself hit with more tariffs and other kinds of trade restrictions because you’re now in Vietnam and they’re trying to reset the trade balance,” said Elms.


Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand all now have trade surpluses with the U.S. in the tens of billions of dollars as well.


The other major risk the region faces, experts say, is the growing attention the United States is paying to imports not only from China but from anywhere else with a large share of Chinese inputs, and the added trade curbs they too might face in Trump’s second term.


“That would present a real problem for Southeast Asia, because you can move manufacturing — you can sew a T-shirt in the region, you can make a phone case in the region, whatever, that goes to the United States — but a lot of the raw materials, parts and components in those products, whether it's fabrics or plastics or screws or whatever it is that’s in the product, is imported from China,” said Elms.


Aat, of the Center for International Trade Studies, said factories that move to Southeast Asia to make exports but continue to draw heavily on Chinese inputs also crowd out producers across the sub-region that could be supplying them instead, leaving local economies with little to gain from their arrival.


And even if Southeast Asian countries avoid the added U.S. tariffs or trade curbs many fear, they may still face the 10%-20% levy Trump has proposed imposing on all U.S. imports across the board.


Elms says it’s also not clear how much of what Trump has said about tariffs he will actually follow through on, and how quickly, making the choice firms will face on whether to move out of China all the more difficult.


Some of them will be “dusting off” the relocation plans they shelved after Trump left office in 2021 for another look now that he is headed back to the White House, she said.


“Whether they execute those is still, I think, an open question,” she added. “There are so many factors that matter, but there’s a reason why firms are so heavily located in China, and it’s because China just continues to have a speed and a scale that is hard for anywhere else to match.”


Rather than move, Elms said some of those firms may end up choosing instead to absorb higher tariffs, if they can, or to focus on other markets besides the U.S.


While that could give regional trade within Asia a boost, Aat and others fear it will flood Southeast Asia with cheap Chinese goods that undercut local producers.


All three experts said Trump’s tough talk on tariffs ultimately holds more peril than promise for the countries of the region.


“In the short term, of course they will benefit from the massive relocation, if there’s an increase in this relocation,” said Menon. “But eventually, as these things work themselves out, this is not going to be very beneficial.”

## Biden applauds Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire

date: 2024-11-27, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday welcomed a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. However, there is no indication the deal will hasten a truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza, where Israel is battling the Palestinian militant group Hamas. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports.

## Biden Never Wrote Carbon Capture Rules. That’s a Big Opening for Trump.

date: 2024-11-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDU2NzgzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MTg3Njk3NX0.d7FsYDGUfQFWpQrfSwafwywtMMnzJIpCZs7VzVfkPsg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">When Trump enters the Oval Office again in January, there are some climate change-related programs he could roll back or revise immediately, some that could take years to dismantle, and some that may well be beyond his reach. And then there’s carbon capture and storage.</p><p>For all the new regulations and funding the Biden administration issued to reduce emissions and advance the clean energy economy over the past four years, it did little to update the regulatory environment for carbon capture and storage. The Treasury Department never clarified how the changes to the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture under the Inflation Reduction Act affect eligibility. The Department of Transportation has not published its <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2137-AF60" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposal for new safety rules</u></a> for pipelines that transport carbon dioxide. And the Environmental Protection Agency has yet to determine whether it will give Texas permission to regulate its own carbon dioxide storage wells, a scenario that <a href="https://castro.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/castro-doggett-urge-epa-to-reject-texas-railroad-commissions-application-for-primacy-of-class-vi-carbon-dioxide-sequestration-wells" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>some of the state’s own representatives</u></a> advise against.</p><p>That means, as the BloombergNEF policy associate Derrick Flakoll put it in an analysis published prior to the election, “the next administration and Congress will encounter a blank canvas of carbon capture infrastructure rules they can shape freely.” </p><p>Carbon capture is unique among climate technologies because it is, in most cases, a pure cost with no monetizable benefit. That means the policy environment — that great big blank canvas — is essential to determining which projects actually get built and whether the ones that do are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/acbed9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actually useful</u></a> for fighting climate change.</p><p>The next administration may or may not decide to take an interest in carbon capture, of course, but there’s reason to expect it will. Doug Burgum, Trump’s pick for the Department of the Interior who will also head up a <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/trump-national-energy-council" target="_self"><u>new National Energy Council</u></a>, has been a <a href="https://www.governor.nd.gov/news/burgum-applauds-350m-doe-grant-awarded-minnkota-carbon-capture-demonstration-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vocal supporter</u></a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/summit-carbon-pipeline-burgum-trump-wright" target="_self"><u>of carbon capture projects</u></a> in his home state of North Dakota. Although Trump’s team will be looking for subsidies to cut in order to offset the tax breaks he has promised, his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/climate/oil-gas-donations-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>deep-pocketed supporters</u></a> in the oil and gas industry who have made major investments in carbon capture based, in part, on the 45Q tax credit, will <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/big-oil-urges-trump-not-to-gut-bidens-climate-law-795dc597" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not want to see it on the chopping block</u></a>. And carbon capture typically enjoys bipartisan support in Congress.</p><p>Congress first created the carbon capture tax credit in 2008, under the auspices of cleaning up the image of coal plants. Lawmakers updated the credit in 2018, and then again in 2022 with the Inflation Reduction Act, each iteration increasing the credit amount and expanding the types of projects that are eligible. Companies can now get up to $85 for every ton of CO2 captured from an industrial plant and sequestered underground, and $180 for every ton captured directly from the air. Combined with grants and loans in the 2021 <a href="https://carboncapturecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BIL-2022-Roadmap.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</u></a>, the changes have driven a surge in carbon capture and storage projects in the United States. More than 150 projects have been announced since the start of 2022, according to a <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/ccus-projects-database" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>database maintained by the International Energy Agency</u></a>, compared to fewer than 100 over the four years prior. </p><p>Many of these projects are notably different from what has been proposed and tried in the past. Historically in the U.S., carbon capture has been used on coal-fired power plants, ethanol refineries, and at natural gas processing facilities, and almost all of the captured gas has been pumped into aging oil fields to help push more fuel out of the ground. But the new policy environment spurred at least some proposals in industries with few other options to decarbonize, including cement, hydrogen, and steel production. It also catalyzed projects that suck carbon directly from the air, versus capturing emissions at the source. Most developers now say they plan to sequester captured carbon underground rather than use it to drill for oil.</p><p>Only a handful of projects are actually under construction, however, and the prospects for others reaching that point are far from guaranteed. Inflation has eroded the value of the 45Q tax credit, Madelyn Morrison, the government affairs director for the Carbon Capture Coalition, told me. “Coupled with that, project deployment costs have really skyrocketed over the past several years. Some folks have said that equipment costs have gone up upwards of 50%,” she said. </p><p>Others aren’t sure whether they’ll even qualify, Flakoll told me. “There is a sort of shadow struggle going on over how permissive the credit is going to be in practice,” he said. For example, the IRA says that power plants have to capture 75% of their baseline emissions to be eligible, but it doesn’t specify how to calculate those baseline emissions. The Treasury solicited input on these questions and others shortly after the IRA passed. Comments raised concerns about how projects that share pipeline infrastructure should track and report their carbon sequestration claims. Environmental groups sought <a href="https://collaborative.evergreenaction.com/memos/public-money-is-funding-carbon-sequestration-irs-must-demand-oversight-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>updates to the reporting and verification requirements</u></a> to prevent taxpayer money from funding false or inflated claims. A 2020 <a href="https://legacy-assets.eenews.net/open_files/assets/2020/04/30/document_gw_07.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>investigation by the inspector general for tax administration</u></a> found that during the first decade of the program, nearly $900 million in tax credits were claimed for projects that did not comply with EPA reporting requirements. But the Treasury never followed up its request for comment with a proposed rule.</p><p>Permitting for carbon sequestration sites has also lagged. The Environmental Protection Agency has issued final permits for just one carbon sequestration project over the past four years, with a total of two wells. Fifty-five applications are currently under review. </p><p>Carbon dioxide pipeline projects have also faced opposition from local governments and landowners. In California, where lawmakers have generally supported the use of carbon capture for achieving state climate goals, and where more than a dozen projects have been announced, the legislature placed a moratorium on CO2 pipeline development until the federal government updates its safety regulations.</p><p>The incoming Congress and presidential administration could clear away some of these hurdles. Congress is already expected to get rid of or rewrite many of the IRA’s tax credit programs when it opens the tax code to address other provisions that expire next year. The Carbon Capture Coalition and other proponents are advocating for another increase to the value of the 45Q tax credit to adjust it for inflation. Trump’s Treasury department will have free rein to issue rules that make the credit as cheap and easy as possible to claim. The EPA, under new leadership, could also speed up carbon storage permitting or, perhaps more likely, grant primacy over permitting to the states. </p><p>But other Trump administration priorities could end up hurting carbon capture development. The projects with the surest path forward are the ones with the lowest cost of capture and multiple pathways for revenue generation, Rohan Dighe, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie told me. For example, ethanol plants emit a relatively pure stream of CO2 that’s easy to capture, and doing so enables producers to access low-carbon fuel markets in California and Washington. Carbon capture at a steel plant or power plant is much more difficult, by contrast, as the flue gas contains a mix of pollutants. </p><p>On those facilities, the 45Q tax credit is too low to justify the cost, Dighe said, and other sources of revenue such as price premiums for green products are uncertain. “The Trump administration's been pretty clear in terms of wanting to deregulate, broadly speaking,” Dighe said, pointing to plans to axe the EPA’s power plant rules and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s climate disclosure requirements. “So those sorts of drivers for some of these projects moving forward are going to be removed.”</p><p>That means projects will depend more on voluntary corporate sustainability initiatives to justify investment. Does Amazon want to build a data center in West Texas? Is it willing to pay a premium for clean electricity from a natural gas plant that captures and stores its carbon? </p><p>But the regulatory environment still matters. Flakoll will be watching to see whether lax monitoring and reporting rules for carbon capture, if enacted, will hurt trust and acceptance of carbon capture projects to the point that companies find it difficult to find buyers for their products or insurance companies to underwrite them. </p><p>“There will be a more of a policy push for [CCS] to enter the market,” Flakoll said. “But it takes two to tango, and there's a question of how much the private sector will respond to that.”</p>

## Trump’s Tariff Threats Will Soon Be Tested

It’s my favorite word.” In case anyone doubted his sincerity, before Thanksgiving he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/25/politics/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> his intention to impose 25% tariffs on everything coming from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods. </p><p>This is just the beginning. If the trade war he launched in his first term was haphazard and accomplished very little except costing Americans money, in his second term he plans to go much further. And the effects of these on clean energy and climate change will be anything but straightforward. </p><p>The theory behind tariffs is that by raising the price of an imported good, they give a stronger footing in the market; eventually, the domestic producer may no longer need the tariff to be competitive. Imposing a tariff means we’ve decided that a particular industry is important enough that it needs this kind of support — or as some might call it, protection — even if it means higher prices for a while. </p><p>The problem with across-the-board tariffs of the kind Trump proposes is that they create higher prices even for goods that are not being produced domestically and probably never will be. If tariffs raise the price of a six-pack of tube socks at Target from $9.99 to $14.99, it won’t mean we’ll start making tube socks in America again. It just means you’ll pay more. The same is often true for domestic industries that use foreign parts in their manufacturing: If no one is producing those parts domestically, their costs will unavoidably rise. </p><p>The U.S. <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/us-international-transactions-4th-quarter-and-year-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imported</u></a> over $3 trillion worth of goods in 2023, and $426 billion <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>from China</u></a> alone, so Trump’s proposed tariffs would represent hundreds of billions of dollars of increased costs. That’s before we account for the inevitable retaliatory tariffs, which is what we saw in Trump’s first term: He imposed tariffs on China, which responded by choking off its imports of American agricultural goods. In the end, the revenue collected from Trump’s tariffs went <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/92-percent-trumps-china-tariff-proceeds-has-gone-bail-out-angry-farmers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>almost entirely</u></a> to bailing out farmers whose export income disappeared.</p><p>The past almost-four years under Joe Biden have seen a series of back-and-forth moves in which new tariffs were announced, other tariffs were increased, exemptions were removed and reinstated. For instance, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-tariffs-electric-vehicles-evs-solar-2024ba735c47e04a50898a88425c5e2c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>this May</u></a> Biden increased the tariff on Chinese electric vehicles to over 100% while adding tariffs on certain EV batteries. But some of the provisions didn’t take effect right away, and only certain products were affected, so the net economic impact was minimal. And there’s been nothing like an across-the-board tariff. </p><p>It’s reasonable to criticize Biden’s tariff policies related to climate. But his administration was trying to navigate a dilemma, serving two goals at once: reducing emissions <em><em>and</em></em> promoting the development of domestic clean energy technology. Those goals are not always in alignment, at least in the short run, which we can see in the <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-tariffs-us-china" target="_self"><u>conflict within the solar industry</u></a>. Companies that sell and install solar equipment benefit from cheap Chinese imports and therefore oppose tariffs, while domestic manufacturers want the tariffs to continue so they can be more competitive. The administration has attempted to accommodate both interests with a combination of subsidies to manufacturers and tariffs on certain kinds of imports — with exemptions peppered here and there. It’s been a difficult balancing act.</p><p>Then there are electric vehicles. The world’s <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/719284/world-top-automotive-groups-sales-2024q1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>largest</u></a> EV manufacturer is Chinese company BYD, but if you haven’t seen any of their cars on the road, it’s because existing tariffs make it virtually impossible to import Chinese EVs to the United States. That will continue to be the case under Trump, and it would have been the case if Kamala Harris had been elected.</p><p>On one hand, it’s important for America to have the strongest possible green industries to insulate us from future supply shocks and create as many jobs-of-the-future as possible. On the other hand, that isn’t necessarily the fastest route to emissions reductions. In a world where we’ve eliminated all tariffs on EVs, the U.S. market would be flooded with inexpensive, <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-quality</u></a> Chinese EVs. That would dramatically accelerate adoption, which would be good for the climate.</p><p>But that would also deal a crushing blow to the American car industry, which is why neither party will allow it. What may happen, though, is that Chinese car companies may build factories in Mexico, or even here in the U.S., just as many European and Japanese companies have, so that their cars wouldn’t be subject to tariffs. That will take time. </p><p>Of course, whatever happens will depend on Trump following through with his tariff promise. We’ve seen before how he declares victory even when he only does part of what he promised, which could happen here. Once he begins implementing his tariffs, his administration will be immediately besieged by a thousand industries demanding exemptions, carve-outs, and delays in the tariffs that affect them. Many will have powerful advocates — members of Congress, big donors, and large groups of constituents — behind them. It’s easy to imagine how “across-the-board” tariffs could, in practice, turn into Swiss cheese.</p><p>There’s no way to know yet which parts of the energy transition will be in the cheese, and which parts will be in the holes. The manufacturers can say that helping them will stick it to China; the installers may not get as friendly an audience with Trump and his team. And the EV tariffs certainly aren’t going anywhere. </p><p>There’s a great deal of uncertainty, but one thing is clear: This is a fight that will continue for the entirety of Trump’s term, and beyond.</p>

## Tariffs on Day One

date: 2024-11-26, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>President-elect Donald Trump says he&#8217;ll put tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on his first day in office. In a post on Truth Social, Trump singled out Mexico and Canada — the U.S.&#8217;s two largest trading partners — saying he&#8217;d impose 25% tariffs on goods from those countries until they do more to stop fentanyl and migrants from crossing the border illegally. Plus, a shortage of accountants. We look into how some accounting educators and associations are rethinking CPA requirements in an effort to attract more young people to the profession.</p>

## The New Electric Cars Are Boring, and That’s Okay

date: 2024-11-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDk2ODk5Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTgyMDI3NX0.lhrah1-mXi29l-DVLD6yvoVmxTC5T5o5piqtVAeigLk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The star of this year’s Los Angeles Auto Show was the Hyundai Ioniq 9, a rounded-off colossus of an EV that puts Hyundai’s signature EV styling on a three-row SUV cavernous enough to carry seven.</p><p>I was reminded of two years ago, when Hyundai stole the L.A. show with a different EV: The reveal of Ioniq 6, its “streamliner” aerodynamic sedan that looked like nothing else on the market. By comparison, Ioniq 9 is a little more banal. It’s a crucial vehicle that will occupy the large end of Hyundai's excellent and growing lineup of electric cars, and one that may sell in impressive numbers to large families that want to go electric. Even with all the sleek touches, though, it’s not quite <a href="https://heatmap.news/the-most-interesting-evs-are-the-weird-ones" target="_self"><u><em><em>interesting</em></em></u></a>. But it is big, and at this moment in electric vehicles, big is what’s in.</p><p>The L.A. show is one the major events on the yearly circuit of car shows, where the car companies traditionally reveal new models for the media and show off their whole lineups of vehicles for the public. Given that California is the EV capital of America, carmakers like to talk up their electric models here. </p><p>Hyundai’s brand partner, Kia, debuted a GT performance version of its EV9, adding more horsepower and flashy racing touches to a giant family SUV. Jeep reminded everyone of its upcoming forays into full-size and premium electric SUVs in the form of the Recon and the Wagoneer S. VW trumpeted the ID.Buzz, the long-promised electrified take on the classic VW Microbus that has finally gone on sale in America. The VW is the quirkiest of the lot, but it’s a design we’ve known about since 2017, when the concept version was revealed. </p><p>Boring isn’t the worst thing in the world. It can be a sign of a maturing industry. At auto shows of old, long before this current EV revolution, car companies would bring exotic, sci-fi concept cars to dial up the intrigue compared to the bread-and-butter, conservatively styled vehicles that actually made them gobs of money. During the early EV years, electrics were the shiny thing to show off at the car show. Now, something of the old dynamic has come to the electric sector. </p><p>Acura and Chrysler brought wild concepts to Los Angeles that were meant to signify the direction of their EVs to come. But most of the EVs in production looked far more familiar. Beyond the new hulking models from Hyundai and Kia, much of what’s on offer includes long-standing models, but in EV (Chevy Equinox and Blazer) or plug-in hybrid (Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wrangler) configurations. One of the most “interesting” EVs on the show floor was the Cybertruck, which sat quietly in a barely-staffed display of Tesla vehicles. (Elon Musk reveals his projects at separate Tesla events, a strategy <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-suv-r2-r3-r3x" target="_self"><u>more carmakers</u></a> have begun to steal as a way to avoid sharing the spotlight at a car show.)</p><p>The other reason boring isn’t bad: It’s what the people want. The majority of drivers don’t buy an exotic, fun vehicle. They buy a handsome, spacious car they can afford. That last part, of course, is where the problem kicks in.</p><p>We don’t yet know the price of the <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/11/20/hyundai-ioniq-9-looks-awesome-but-nothing-like-concept-interior/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ioniq 9</u></a>, but it’s likely to be in the neighborhood of Kia’s three-row electric, the EV9, which starts in the mid-$50,000s and can rise steeply from there. Stellantis’ forthcoming push into the EV market will start with not only pricey premium Jeep SUVs, but also some fun, though relatively expensive, vehicles like the heralded Ramcharger extended-range EV truck and the <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2024/11/the-dodge-charger-daytona-is-already-the-ev-to-beat-when-it-comes-to-resale-values/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Dodge Charger Daytona</u></a>, an attempt to apply machismo-oozing, alpha-male muscle-car marketing to an electric vehicle.</p><p>You can see the rationale. It costs a lot to build a battery big enough to power a big EV, so they’re going to be priced higher. Helpfully for the car brands, Americans have proven they will pay a premium for size and power. That’s not to say we’re entering an era of nothing but bloated EV battleships. Models such as the overpowered electric Dodge Charger and Kia EV9 GT will reveal the appetite for performance EVs. Smaller models like the revived Chevy Bolt and Kia’s EV3, already on sale overseas, are coming to America, tax credit or not.</p><p>The question for the legacy car companies is where to go from here. It takes years to bring a vehicle from idea to production, so the models on offer today were conceived in a time when big federal support for EVs was in place to buoy the industry through its transition. Now, though, the automakers have some clear uncertainty about what to say. </p><p>Chevy, having revealed new electrics like the Equinox EV elsewhere, did not hold a media conference at the L.A. show. Ford, which is having a hellacious time losing money on its EVs, used its time to talk up combustion vehicles including a new version of the palatial Expedition, one of the oversized gas-guzzlers that defined the first SUV craze of the 1990s.</p><p>If it’s true that the death of federal subsidies will send EV sales into a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/trump-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slump</u></a>, we may see messaging from Detroit and elsewhere that feels decidedly retro, with very profitable combustion front-and-center and the all-electric future suddenly less of a talking point. Whatever happens at the federal level, EVs aren’t going away. But as they become a core part of the car business, they are going to get less exciting.</p>

## New day, new tariffs

date: 2024-11-26, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>President-elect Donald Trump says on his first day in office, he’ll put tariffs on goods coming from China, Mexico and Canada. Those three countries are the largest U.S. trade partners — Canada buys the most U.S. exports, followed by Mexico and then China. Plus, why U.S. soybean exports are growing and how digital currencies are weaving their way into politics.</p>

Specifically, Trump threatened Canada and Mexico each with a 25% tariff, and China with a 10% hike on existing levies. Such moves against three key U.S. trade partners would have major ramifications across many sectors, including the auto industry. Many car companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/companies-that-might-be-affected-by-trumps-promised-tariffs-2024-11-26/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8BigVNV4NNq_IBGaxEnQFM2c8ZC4p3_eQCirlOktkmTzxqZZtxgfRUYZOlHuUoA0FoSLfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">import vehicles and parts</a> from plants in Mexico.

## China sends naval, air forces to shadow US plane over Taiwan Strait

date: 2024-11-26, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — China's military said on Tuesday it deployed naval and air forces to monitor and warn a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft that flew through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, denouncing the United States for trying to "mislead" the international community.


Around once a month, U.S. military ships or aircraft pass through or above the waterway that separates democratically governed Taiwan from China - missions that always anger Beijing.


China claims sovereignty over the island of Taiwan and says it has jurisdiction over the strait. Taiwan and the United States dispute that, saying the strait is an international waterway.


The U.S. Navy's 7th fleet said a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft had flown through the strait "in international airspace," adding that the flight demonstrated the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.


"By operating within the Taiwan Strait in accordance with international law, the United States upholds the navigational rights and freedoms of all nations," it said in a statement.


China's military criticized the flight as "public hype," adding that it monitored the U.S. aircraft throughout its transit and "effectively" responded to the situation.


"The relevant remarks by the U.S. distort legal principles, confuse public opinion and mislead international perceptions," the military's Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.


"We urge the U.S. side to stop distorting and hyping up and jointly safeguard regional peace and stability."


Taiwan's defense ministry said the P-8A flew in a northerly direction through the strait and that the Taiwanese military monitored it, adding the "situation was as normal."


In April, China's military said it sent fighter jets to monitor and warn a U.S. Navy Poseidon in the Taiwan Strait, a mission that took place just hours after a call between the Chinese and U.S. defense chiefs.

## US telecom worker who was Chinese agent sentenced to 4 years in prison

date: 2024-11-26, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A former U.S. telecom company employee who provided information about Chinese dissidents and Falun Gong members to China was sentenced to four years in prison on Monday, the Justice Department said.


Ping Li, 59, of Wesley Chapel, Florida, admitted in a plea agreement to acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, the department said in a statement.


Li, who emigrated to the United States from China, provided corporate information to China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and personal details about an individual affiliated with the Falun Gong spiritual movement who lived in Florida.


The Falun Gong movement is banned in China.


The U.S. Justice Department said Li worked for a major U.S. telecom company and an international information technology company. The companies were not identified in court documents, but according to press reports, they were Verizon and InfoSys, respectively.


"From at least as early as 2012, [Li] served as a cooperative contact working at the direction of officers of the MSS to obtain information of interest to the [Chinese] government," the Justice Department said. "Li obtained a wide variety of information at the request of the MSS, including information concerning Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy advocates, members of the Falun Gong religious movement, and U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations."


A 71-year-old Chinese man was sentenced to 20 months in prison in California last week for taking part in a plot targeting the Falun Gong in the United States.


John Chen, of Los Angeles, was also convicted of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government.


China calls the Falun Gong movement, founded in 1992, an evil cult, outlawing it in 1999 after 10,000 members peacefully demonstrated outside a government building in Beijing.

## Analysis: Trump's win powered by improved performance across electorate

date: 2024-11-26, from: VOA News USA

Nearly three weeks after the 2024 election, with almost all of the votes counted, it has become clear that Donald Trump won his second term in the White House by orchestrating a nationwide rightward shift in voting patterns that largely persisted across most of the 50 states, whether their electoral votes went to Trump or to his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.


The main force behind Trump's victory was strong support from his base, which is generally made up of white Americans without a college degree. His win would not have been possible, however, had the president-elect not improved his showing among groups who tend to support Democratic candidates.


Trump won larger shares of the vote in parts of the country with large Hispanic and Asian American populations, many of whom appeared to respond to his criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the economy and of immigration. Many areas of the country with a large concentration of Black voters, who have historically favored Democrats, saw lower turnout than in past years, creating a further disadvantage for Harris.


The shift in favor of Trump was apparent in an overwhelming majority of communities across the country. An analysis of county-level data updated by CNN on November 22 demonstrated that in nearly nine of 10 U.S. counties, Trump's 2024 vote share had improved over that of 2020.


'He did much better'


Drew McCoy, president of Decision Desk HQ, an organization that gathers data on elections in the United States, told VOA that Trump's improvement with the electorate had been broad and cut across several demographic groups.


"We definitely have a lot of data on how Trump did, and across the board, he did much better," McCoy said, mentioning that the president-elect had improved among white voters, Hispanic voters and Asian American voters.


Meanwhile, while many had predicted a sharp increase in the gender gap in favor of Harris, it never materialized.


While female voters appear to have favored Harris decisively, McCoy said the margin was "essentially flat" compared with Trump's last two runs for the presidency.


"It wasn't the blowout across the board with women that many people were expecting," McCoy said.


The shift in the Hispanic vote was especially noticeable, he said. For example, in the heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley, just north of the border with Mexico, Trump's share of the vote surged. In Florida's Miami-Dade County region, which Hillary Clinton won by 30 percentage points in 2016, Trump won by 13 points.


Popular and electoral vote tally


Trump became the first Republican candidate in two decades to win the popular vote.


As of November 25, The Associated Press tally had Trump with precisely 50% of the vote and Harris at 48.4%, with the remainder scattered among third-party candidates.


In total, Americans cast more than 151 million votes for president, about 4 million fewer than were cast in 2020, when Trump lost to Joe Biden. However, Trump won approximately 77 million votes, nearly 3 million more than he did in 2020.


Each U.S. state has a specified number of votes in the Electoral College, which is the body that officially elects the president. Each state allocates its votes to candidates based on the popular result in that state, in most cases on a winner-take-all basis.


Trump needed 270 electoral votes to win. He received 312, or 58% of the total available. Historically, that is not a large percentage. Many presidents have won well over 75% of the electoral vote. However, in the seven presidential elections held since 2000, only Barack Obama, in 2008 and 2012, won more than 58% of electoral votes.


Swing state sweep


In the months leading up to the election, the American public's attention was focused on seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.


In 2020, Trump lost all of them, except for North Carolina, to Biden. This time, Trump won them all, in some cases by larger margins than Biden enjoyed in 2020.


In Arizona, which Biden won by just over 10,000 votes in 2020, Trump won by nearly 200,000 votes. Much of the swing was attributable to a shift in the Hispanic vote toward Trump. He trimmed Biden's advantage considerably, in both more diverse Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, as well as the heavily Hispanic counties along the state's southern border with Mexico.


In Georgia, Harris' chance for victory hinged on running up her margins in the city of Atlanta and its densely populated suburbs, which represent the core of Democratic support in an otherwise reliably Republican state. In the end, she failed to do so, winning by a slimmer margin than Biden did in populous Fulton, Gwinnett and DeKalb counties.


In Michigan, many of the same dynamics at play across the country remained in force, but Harris' performance was further hindered by the presence of large Arab American voting blocs in several metropolitan areas.


The Biden administration's support for Israel in its ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon greatly angered many Arab Americans, and helped hand the state to Trump. In some precincts in the majority Arab American city of Dearborn, where Biden received 88% of the vote in 2020, Harris not only lost to Trump, but came in third, behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein.


Betting on Las Vegas


In Nevada, some 7 in 10 voters live in Clark County, in and around the city of Las Vegas. Nearly 1 in 3 voters in Clark are Hispanic, and the county also has Nevada's largest share of Black and Asian American voters. Biden beat Trump by more than nine percentage points four years ago, but Harris won by less than three, a difference that appears to have been driven by Hispanic and Asian American voters switching to the Republican candidate.


Democrats in North Carolina may have been hopeful that the presence of a popular Democratic gubernatorial candidate on the ticket on the ticket would give Harris a shot at a pickup there. However, Trump improved his margin in the state, winning with 51% of the vote.


One of the things that harmed Harris in North Carolina was earning fewer votes than Biden in majority-Black counties. For example, in majority-Black areas like Bertie and Hertford counties, her winning margin fell by six and seven percentage points, respectively. She also performed worse among college-educated white voters.


In Pennsylvania, which put Biden over the top in 2020, Harris also underperformed. In the city of Philadelphia, she garnered 50,000 fewer votes than Biden had four years earlier. Trump won a much higher share of the vote in several communities with high concentrations of Hispanic voters than he had in 2020 and remained dominant in the state's more rural areas.


Finally, in Wisconsin, Trump triumphed by increasing his vote totals in counties across In some counties in the rural southwestern part of the state, where the white population exceeds 95%, he won by as much as six percentage points more than he did in 2020.


Safe and sound


In the days and weeks leading up to the election, there had been considerable concern about whether the balloting would be disrupted in any way. Trump frequently claimed that fraud was likely, and there was also considerable evidence that non-U.S. actors were using social media to sow doubts about the safety and soundness of the process.


Also, after 2020, when the counting of ballots took several days in a number of key states, there were questions about how long it would take to name a winner.


Several weeks after the polls closed, groups that monitor elections in the U.S told VOA that in terms of its administration, the election had been an unqualified success.


David Becker, executive director and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research, called the election "a triumph of public service."


"The election ended up being safe and secure, even with massive amounts of disinformation, even with foreign adversaries like Russia circulating fake videos, even with bomb threats and [the] firebombing of a couple of drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest. All of those things were handled, and largely, everything went very well," he said.


"We had clear results, with a winner declared by the media less than 12 hours after the polls closed," Becker said. "We had no certification challenges. That's just a remarkable success by the professionals who run elections around the country."


Mark Lindeman, policy and strategy director for Verified Voting, an organization that works to ensure the responsible use of technology in elections, agreed.


"The 2024 election went very smoothly, thanks to a lot of preparation and hard work by election officials," Lindeman said.


"Over the last eight years since 2016, the entire country has wrapped its head around election-related cybersecurity. And the level of training and the level of resources both have improved quite substantially," he said.

## Trump announces signing of paperwork starting next phase of transition

date: 2024-11-26, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday the next phase of his administration’s transition: the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Biden administration.


A statement from Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, said, “This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power.”


Wiles’ announcement said the transition will use only private funding, and the donors will be disclosed to the public.


The Trump-Vance transition team will not use government offices or technology, Wiles said. She added that the transition has an existing ethics plan and “security and information protections built in, which means we will not require additional government and bureaucratic oversight.”


The signing of the MOU means that teams from the transition will “quickly integrate directly into federal agencies and departments with access to documents and policy sharing,” Wiles’ announcement said.


On Monday, Trump announced another move his administration intends to take on its first day. He pledged to quickly impose tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada — the country’s top three trade partners — raising the prospect of trade wars and higher prices for U.S. consumers.


Trump used a series of posts on his Truth Social account to announce the moves, including saying that on his first day in office he will “sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 percent tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders.”


He said the tariffs would remain in place until “Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!” Trump said Mexico and Canada have the ability to “easily solve this long simmering problem.”


He also complained about what he said was China’s role in “the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States.”


“Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America,” Trump wrote.


China responded by saying “no one will win” a trade or tariff war.


"China believes that China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature," Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for China's embassy in the United States, said.


The United States, Mexico and Canada signed a new trade deal during Trump’s previous term in office, a deal that will be up for review in 2026.


The deal does allow for national security exemptions for restrictions.


Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed trade and border security after Trump announced his plans Monday, a Canadian source familiar with the situation said.


The new U.S. leader does not take office for two months, leaving space for negotiations and potential changes to the Trump administration’s plans.


Trump’s nominee to lead the Treasury Department, Scott Bessent, wrote in a Fox News op-ed last week that tariffs can be “a useful tool for achieving the president’s foreign policy objectives,” including getting another government to boost defense spending or take action on drug trafficking.


Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc issued a joint statement late Monday stressing the close ties between the U.S. and Canada, including Canadian energy exports to the U.S. and cooperation on stopping drug trafficking.


"Our relationship today is balanced and mutually beneficial, particularly for American workers. Today, Canada buys more from the United States than China, Japan, France and the UK combined," the statement said.


Tariffs are paid by companies that import the products, meaning that if implemented, those costs could be passed on in the form of higher prices for people buying a range of goods including gas, cars and food


Trump used tariffs as part of his economic agenda during his previous administration, with a particular focus on goods from China. The Chinese government responded with its own tariffs on U.S.-made products.


He also focused on security at the U.S.-Mexico border, ordering the construction of a more extensive network of border walls and demanding the Mexican government take steps to remove migrants from areas near the U.S. border.


Trump’s latest demands come at a time when arrests for illegal crossings at the border have been declining, with figures from October showing arrests were near four-year lows.

## Democrats plan to elect new party leader days after Trump's inauguration

date: 2024-11-26, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The chair of the Democratic National Committee informed party leaders on Monday that the DNC would choose his successor in February, an election that will speak volumes about how the party wants to present itself during four more years of Donald Trump in the White House.


Jaime Harrison, in a letter to members of the party’s powerful Rules & Bylaws Committee, outlined the process of how the party would elect its new chair. Harrison said in the letter that the committee would host four candidate forums — some in person and some virtually — in January, with the final election on February 1 during the party’s winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland.


The race to become the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, while an insular party affair, will come days after Trump is inaugurated for a second term. Democrats' selection of a leader after Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 loss will be a key starting point as the party starts to move forward, including addressing any structural problems and determining how to oppose Trump.


Members of the Rules & Bylaws Committee will meet on December 12 to establish the rules for these elections, which beyond the chair position will include top party roles such as vice chairs, treasurer, secretary and national finance chair. The committee will also use that meeting to decide the requirements for gaining access to the ballot for those top party roles. In 2021, candidates were required to submit a nominating statement that included signatures from 40 DNC members, and that will likely be the same standard for the 2025 campaigns.


“The DNC is committed to running a transparent, equitable, and impartial election for the next generation of leadership to guide the party forward,” Harrison said in a statement. “Electing the Chair and DNC officers is one of the most important responsibilities of the DNC Membership, and our staff will run an inclusive and transparent process that gives members the opportunity to get to know the candidates as they prepare to cast their votes.”


Two Democrats have announced campaigns for chair: Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and a vice chair of the national party, and Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor and current commissioner of the Social Security Administration.


Other top Democrats are either considering a run to succeed Harrison or are being pushed by party insiders, including former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke; Michael Blake, a former vice chair of the party; Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin; Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan and a former Chicago mayor; Sen. Mallory McMorrow, majority whip of the Michigan Senate, and Chuck Rocha, a longtime Democratic strategist.


The next chair of the committee will be tasked with rebuilding a party demoralized by a second Trump victory. They will also oversee the party’s 2028 nominating process, a complex and contentious exercise that will make the chair central to the next presidential election.


Harrison, of South Carolina, made clear in his letter to the rules committee that the four forums hosted by the party would be live streamed and the party would give grassroots Democrats across the country the ability to engage with the process through those events. He also said he intends to remain neutral during the chair election.

## Biden to attend Trump inauguration, White House says

date: 2024-11-26, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden will attend Donald Trump's inauguration in January, the White House said Monday, calling it a "commitment to our democratic values" despite Trump's skipping Biden's own swearing-in.


Then-President Trump refused to attend Biden's inauguration in 2021, after falsely claiming Biden’s election win was fraudulent and whipping up a mob of supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol.


"The president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whoever won the election," deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters flying with Biden on Air Force One.


"He and the first lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration."


Bates added: "He views that as an important demonstration of commitment to our democratic values and to honoring the will of the people, as we continue to provide an orderly and effective transition."


Despite repeatedly describing Trump as a threat to democracy during the 2024 campaign, Democrat Biden has made a point of providing Trump with the smooth transition that the Republican denied him.


Biden invited President-elect Trump to the White House the week after the November 5 vote, in which Trump beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to win a historic comeback.


Biden, 82, dropped his own bid for a second term in July and endorsed Harris after a disastrous debate performance against Trump triggered fears among Democrats about his age and mental acuity.

## Court agrees with ban on medical marijuana advertising in Mississippi

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

JACKSON, Mississippi — Medical marijuana businesses in the southern U.S. state of Mississippi don't have the right to advertise on billboards or other places because marijuana itself remains illegal under federal law, an appeals court says. 


The owner of a medical marijuana dispensary argued that the First Amendment protects the right to advertise because Mississippi law permits the sale of cannabis products to people with debilitating medical conditions. The state enacted its law in 2022. 


A three-judge panel of 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the arguments about advertising. They cited the federal Controlled Substances Act, which since 1970 has prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of marijuana. 


The federal law applies in all states, and Mississippi “faces no constitutional obstacle to restricting commercial speech relating to unlawful transactions,” the judges wrote. 


The Mississippi attorney general's office praised the court decision for upholding "Mississippi’s reasonable restrictions on advertising for medical marijuana dispensaries by print, broadcast and other mass communications,” said the office spokesperson, MaryAsa Lee. 


Clarence Cocroft II operates Tru Source Medical Cannabis in the northern Mississippi city of Olive Branch. He sued the state in 2023 to challenge its ban on medical marijuana advertising on billboards or in print, broadcast or social media or via mass email or text messaging. 


“Upholding this ban makes it incredibly difficult for me to find potential customers and to educate people about Mississippi’s medical marijuana program,” Cocroft said in a statement Monday. “I remain committed to continuing this fight so my business can be treated the same as any other legal business in Mississippi.” 


The state allows medical marijuana businesses to have websites or social media accounts that provide information about their retail dispensing locations and a list of products available. It allows them to be listed in phone books or business directories and to display cannabis in company logos. The businesses can also sponsor not-for-profit charity or advocacy events. 


Cocroft is represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm. The firm said Monday that it was considering its next steps in the lawsuit, including possibly asking the entire appeals court to reconsider the case or an appeal to the Supreme Court. 


“Mississippi cannot on the one hand create an entire marketplace for the sale of medical marijuana, and on the other hand rely on an unenforced federal law to prohibit buyers and sellers from talking about it,” said Ari Bargil, an Institute for Justice attorney.

## Trump's candidate picks include some firsts, but diversity down from Biden

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Republican President-elect Donald Trump's picks for his Cabinet include some historic firsts, though women and people of color make up less of the overall number than they did when Democratic President Joe Biden first took office. 


Historic firsts 


Florida political operative Susie Wiles, who ran Trump's 2024 campaign, is set to be the first woman to hold the high-profile position of White House chief of staff. 


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, would be the first person of Hispanic origin to hold that role if confirmed by his fellow senators. 


Hedge fund executive Scott Bessent, nominee for Treasury secretary, could become the first openly gay Republican Cabinet member confirmed by the Senate. The investor lives in South Carolina with his husband and two children.  


Former U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, with roots in both Samoan and Hawaiian cultures, would be the first director of national intelligence from the Pacific Islander community, according to Inclusive America, a nonprofit that tracks diversity in government. 


Gender gap 


Trump has chosen eight women so far for his Cabinet, doubling the number from his first-term cabinet selection. This is less than Biden's first Cabinet, made up of 11 women, which then rose to 13, a historic high for women serving concurrently, according to the Center for American Women and Politics.  


That compares with eight women during Barack Obama's presidential cabinet, five for George W. Bush and nine for Bill Clinton, according to the center's data.  


Race breakdown 


Trump has so far picked four people of color for his Cabinet, representing about a fifth of it. That number is in line with his first term but trails the roughly 40% share of minorities in the full U.S. population, according to the U.S. Census. 


The number is also well below Biden's Cabinet, which included 13 people of color, as well as Obama's with 10, Bush's with six and Clinton's with eight, according to Inclusive America. 


Generational breakdown 


While Trump will be the oldest president to take office at age 78 -- about five months older than Biden was at his Jan. 20, 2021 inauguration -- the president-elect has chosen millennial and Gen Z women for top roles.  


Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, 40, the nominee for United Nations ambassador, will be the youngest person to hold this position if confirmed by the Senate. 


Karoline Leavitt, 27, is also set to be the youngest White House press secretary ever, taking the highly visible job after working on Trump's 2024 campaign.  


Experience 


At least 16 of Trump's cabinet picks so far have experience in state or federal government, but not all in the direct field or department that they could oversee. 


Three of the picks come from the industries that the secretaries will regulate: Bessent, Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick and Energy Secretary nominee Chris Wright.  


Sexual misconduct claims 


Two of Trump's cabinet picks have been accused of sexual misconduct. 


Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's Health and Human Services secretary nominee, was accused by his family's live-in babysitter of groping her in 1999, when she was 23. Kennedy has said he does not recall the incident. No charges were filed. 


Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a conference in California in 2017. No charges were filed, and Hegseth's attorney has said the encounter was consensual. Hegseth and the woman entered into a confidential monetary settlement afterward to avoid a lawsuit. 


Linda McMahon, the nominee to run the Department of Education, is a defendant in a sexual abuse lawsuit that alleges that as CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment in the 1980s, she failed to stop a former ringside announcer from sexually grooming and abusing five boys who worked for him. McMahon has denied the allegations, and she herself is not accused of sexual abuse. 


Didn’t I see you on TV? 


Many of the cabinet selections have been TV regulars in recent years advocating on air for Trump's agenda. But for at least four high-level selections, television has been their recent day job.  


This includes Dr. Mehmet Oz, who used to have his own medical talk show and has now been tapped to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Trump's picks also include three recent Fox News employees: Hegseth, Transportation Secretary nominee Sean Duffy and Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, Trump's pick for U.S. Surgeon General.

## Google's US antitrust trial over online ad empire winds down

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — The U.S. Justice Department told a federal judge that Google illegally dominated online advertising technology in seeking a second antitrust win against the company. 


The closing arguments in Alexandria cap a 15-day trial held in September in which prosecutors sought to show Google monopolized markets for publisher ad servers and advertiser ad networks and tried to dominate the market for ad exchanges, which sit between buyers and sellers. 


“Google rigged the rules of the road,” said DOJ lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum, who asked the judge to hold Google accountable for anti-competitive conduct and added that Google is "once, twice, three times a monopolist." 


Another DOJ lawyer, Julia Tarver Wood, compared the case to the Charles Dickens novel A Tale of Two Cities and said U.S. Judge Leonie Brinkema had to decide whether to adopt the DOJ or Google version of the state of the ad market. 


Google lawyer Karen Dunn said the DOJ had not met its legal burden and was asking Brinkema to overrule key precedents. "The law simply does not support what the plaintiffs are arguing in this case," Dunn said. 


She argued the DOJ was ignoring Google's legitimate business decisions and the robust quality of the online advertising market. The company argues the government had cherry-picked a narrow slice of the online market and did not account for aggressive competition. 


Shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, were up 1.4% in afternoon trading. 


Publishers testified at the trial that they could not switch away from Google, even when it rolled out features they disliked, since there was no other way to access the huge advertising demand within Google's ad network. 


In 2017, News Corp estimated losing at least $9 million in ad revenue that year if it had switched away, one witness said. 


If Brinkema finds that Google broke the law, she would consider prosecutors' request to make Google at least sell off Google Ad Manager, a platform that includes the company's publisher ad server and its ad exchange. 


Google offered to sell the ad exchange this year to end a European Union antitrust investigation, but European publishers rejected the proposal as insufficient, Reuters first reported in September. 


Analysts view the ad tech case as a smaller financial risk than the case in which a judge ruled Google maintains an illegal monopoly in online search, and in which prosecutors have argued the company must be forced to sell its Chrome browser.

## California governor says state could offer electric vehicle rebates if Trump eliminates federal tax credit

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA  — California could offer rebates for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration eliminates a federal tax credit for people who buy electric cars, Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday.


Newsom, a Democrat, proposed creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which was phased out in 2023 after funding 594,000 cars and saving 456 million gallons of fuel, Newsom’s office said.


“Consumers continue to prove the skeptics wrong — zero-emission vehicles are here to stay," Newsom said in a statement. "We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future — we’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute.”


Newsom’s proposal is part of his plan to protect California's progressive policies ahead of Republican President-elect Donald Trump's second term. He called the state Legislature to convene in a special session to help “Trump-proof” state laws by giving the attorney general’s office more funding to fight federal challenges.


But a budget shortfall could complicate California’s resistance efforts. Early budget projections show the state could face a $2 billion deficit next year, according to a report released last week by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. That’s an improvement from an estimated $46.8 billion deficit the state faced last year, but the shortfall could still curtail the state’s ability to expand new programs and fight federal legal challenges. Legislative leaders in both chambers have said the state needs to stay prudent in anticipation of future budget deficits.


Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said the president-elect would deliver on his campaign promises, “including stopping attacks on gas-powered cars.”


“When he takes office, President Trump will support the auto industry, allowing space for both gas-powered cars AND electric vehicles,” she said in a statement.

Money for the new rebate system could come from the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is funded by polluters under the state’s cap-and-trade program, the governor's office said.


Officials didn’t say how much the program would cost or how the rebates would work.


California has surpassed 2 million zero-emission vehicles sold, according to Newsom's office. The state has passed policies in recent years to transition away from fossil fuel-powered, cars, trucks, trains and lawn mowers.


Trump previously vowed to end federal electric vehicle tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new zero-emission vehicles. There’s also a $4,000 credit for used ones. But Trump later softened his stance as Tesla CEO Elon Musk became a supporter and adviser.


Newsom's proposed rebates could exclude Tesla and other automakers in an effort to promote more market competition and innovation, according to the governor's office. But that is subject to negotiation with the state Legislature.


Musk called Tesla's possible exclusion “insane” in a post on X. About 42% of rebates went to people buying or leasing Tesla vehicles under the state's previous clean vehicle rebate program, according to data from the California Air Resources Board.


Trump criticized Newsom on social media after the governor called for a special session, calling out the high cost of living in California and the state’s homelessness crisis. Trump said Newsom was “stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to ‘Make California Great Again.’”


Newsom said on his podcast earlier this month that he reached out to Trump after the election. He said at a news conference last week that he still hadn’t heard back from the president-elect.


California's defunct Clean Vehicle Rebate Program offered rebates on electric cars as high as $2,500.

## Biden opens final White House holiday season with turkey pardons

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden kicked off his final holiday season at the White House on Monday by issuing the traditional reprieve to two turkeys who will bypass the Thanksgiving table to live out their days in southern Minnesota.


Biden welcomed 2,500 guests to the South Lawn under sunny skies as he cracked jokes about the fates of “Peach” and “Blossom” and sounded wistful tones about the last weeks of his presidency after a half-century in Washington power circles.


“It’s been the honor of my life. I’m forever grateful,” Biden said, taking note of his impending departure on January 20, 2025. That's when power will transfer to Republican President-elect Donald Trump, the man Biden defeated four years ago and was battling again until he was pressured to bow out of the race amid concerns about his age and viability. Biden is 82.


Until Inauguration Day, the president and first lady Jill Biden will continue a busy run of festivities that will double as their long goodbye. The White House schedule in December is replete with holiday parties for various constituencies, from West Wing staff to members of Congress and the White House press corps.


Turkey talk


Biden relished the brief ceremony with the pardoned turkeys, named for the official flower of the president's home state of Delaware.


“The peach pie in my state is one of my favorites,” he said during remarks that were occasionally interrupted by Peach gobbling atop the table to Biden's right. “Peach is making a last-minute plea,” Biden said at one point, drawing laughter from an overflow crowd that included Cabinet members, White House staff and their families, and students from 4H programs and Future Farmers of America chapters.


Biden introduced Peach as a bird who “lives by the motto, ‘Keep calm and gobble on.’ ” Blossom, the president said, has a different motto: “No fowl play. Just Minnesota nice.”


Peach and Blossom came from the farm of John Zimmerman, near the southern Minnesota city of Northfield. Zimmerman, who has raised about 4 million turkeys, is president of the National Turkey Federation, the group that has gifted U.S. presidents Thanksgiving turkeys since the Truman administration after World War II. President Harry Truman, however, preferred to eat the birds. Official pardon ceremonies did not become an annual White House tradition until the administration of President George H.W. Bush in 1989.




Separately Monday, first lady Jill Biden received the official White House Christmas tree that will be decorated and put on display in the Blue Room. The 18.5-foot (5.64-meter) Fraser fir came from a farm in an area of western North Carolina that recently was devastated by Hurricane Helene.


Cartner’s Christmas Tree Farm lost thousands of trees in the storm “but this one remained standing and they named it ‘Tremendous’ for the extraordinary hope that it represents,” Jill Biden said at the event.


The Bidens were also traveling to New York City on Monday for an evening “Friendsgiving” event at a Coast Guard station on Staten Island.


Biden began his valedictory calendar Friday night with a gala for hundreds of his friends, supporters and staff members who gathered in a pavilion erected on the South Lawn, with a view out to the Lincoln Memorial.


Cabinet secretaries, Democratic donors and his longest-serving staff members came together to hear from the president and pay tribute, with no evidence that Biden was effectively forced from the Democratic ticket this summer and watched Vice President Kamala Harris suffer defeat on November 5.


Even as the first couple avoided the context surrounding the president's coming exit, those political realities were nonetheless apparent, as younger Democrats like Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Biden's Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg not only raised their glasses to the president but held forth with many attendees who could remain in the party's power circles in the 2028 election cycle and beyond.

## Dow hits another record as stocks rise on treasury secretary pick

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

New York — U.S. stocks rose Monday, with those benefiting the most from lower interest rates and a stronger economy leading the way. 


The S&P 500 climbed 0.3% to pull closer to its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 440 points, or 1%, to its own record set on Friday, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. 


Treasury yields also eased in the bond market amid what some analysts called a "Bessent bounce" after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager, to be his treasury secretary. 


Bessent has argued for reducing the U.S. government's deficit, which is how much more it spends than it takes in through taxes and other revenue. Such an approach could soothe worries on Wall Street that Trump's policies may lead to a much bigger deficit, which in turn would put upward pressure on Treasury yields. 


After climbing above 4.44% immediately after Trump's election, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell back to 4.26% Monday, down from 4.41% late Friday. That's a notable move, and lower yields make it cheaper for all kinds of companies and households to borrow money. They also give a boost to prices for stocks and other investments. 


That helped stocks of smaller companies lead the way, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped 1.5%. It finished just shy of its all-time high, which was set three years ago. Smaller companies can feel bigger boosts from lower borrowing costs because of the need for many to borrow to grow. 


The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks the market's expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with overnight interest rates, also eased sharply. 


The Fed began cutting its main interest rate just a couple months ago from a two-decade high, hoping to keep the job market humming after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. But immediately after Trump's victory, traders had reduced bets for how many cuts the Fed may deliver next year. They were worried Trump's preference for lower tax rates and higher spending on the border would balloon the national debt. 


A report coming on Wednesday could influence how much the Fed may cut rates. Economists expect it to show that an underlying inflation trend the Fed prefers to use accelerated to 2.8% last month from 2.7% in September. Higher inflation would make the Fed more reluctant to cut rates as deeply or as quickly as it would otherwise. 


Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle expects that to slow by the end of next year to 2.4%, but he said inflation would be even lower if not for expected tariff increases on imports from China and autos favored by Trump. 


In the stock market, Bath & Body Works jumped 16.5% after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The seller of personal care products and home fragrances also raised its financial forecasts for the full year, even though it still sees a "volatile retail environment" and a shorter holiday shopping season this year. 


Much focus has been on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain, given high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates. Last week, two major retailers sent mixed messages. Target tumbled after giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook. 


Another big retailer, Macy's, said Monday that its sales for the latest quarter were in line with its expectations, but that it would delay the release of its full financial results. It found a single employee had intentionally hidden up to $154 million in delivery expenses, and it needs more time to complete its investigation. 


Macy's stock fell 2.2%. 


Among the market's leaders were several companies related to the housing industry. Monday's drop in Treasury yields could translate into easier mortgage rates, which could spur activity for housing. Builders FirstSource, a supplier of building materials, rose 5.9%. Homebuilders, D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar all rose at least 5.6%. 


All told, the S&P 500 rose 18.03 points to 5,987.37. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 440.06 to 44,736.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 51.18 to 19,054.84. 


In stock markets abroad, indexes moved modestly across much of Europe after finishing mixed in Asia. 


In the crypto market, bitcoin was trading below $95,000 after threatening to hit $100,000 late last week for the first time.

## Trump cleared of federal indictments before he takes office

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will no longer be under federal indictment when he is inaugurated as the country’s 47th president on January 20.


U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington quickly dismissed charges Monday that Trump illegally tried to upend his 2020 reelection loss. She did so after U.S. special counsel Jack Smith acknowledged in a court filing that long-standing Justice Department policy precluded prosecution of a sitting president.


In another court filing, Smith also asked an appellate court in Atlanta to remove Trump from a pending appeal. The prosecutor had originally filed the appeal seeking to reinstate dismissed charges that Trump hoarded hundreds of classified national security documents at his oceanside estate in Florida when he left the presidency in 2021.


The prosecutor said he stood behind the merits of both indictments against Trump, even as he said the charges should be dropped.


Trump, on the Truth Social media platform, declared, "These cases, like all of the other cases I have been forced to go through, are empty and lawless, and should never have been brought."


He said that more than $100 million in taxpayer money "has been wasted in the Democrat Party’s fight against their Political Opponent, ME. It was a political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country that such a thing could have happened, and yet, I persevered, against all odds, and WON."


During his campaign, Trump vowed that if he was elected for a second nonconsecutive term, he would fire Smith "within two seconds" of assuming the presidency again. But U.S. news accounts say Smith plans to leave the Justice Department ahead of Trump's taking office.


In the Washington case, Trump, a Republican, was accused of pressuring state officials after the 2020 election to change election results that showed Democrat Joe Biden had defeated him and of spreading lies that Biden won only because of massive vote fraud and election irregularities.


The prosecutor asked Chutkan to dismiss the case "without prejudice," leaving open the possibility that the charges could be renewed after Trump leaves office a second time in January 2029.


As Smith’s lengthy investigations have wound on without the cases going to trial, some U.S. legal analysts have said Trump, when he assumes office again, could try to pardon himself to end his legal jeopardy with certainty, an action no president has ever tried before.




In Atlanta, Smith asked a federal appellate court to drop Trump as a co-defendant from the special counsel’s appeal of a ruling by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon.


Cannon, a Trump appointee, had dismissed the classified documents case on the ground that Smith had been illegally appointed as special counsel.


The decision by Cannon broke with legal precedent, which sanctioned the appointment of special counsels, to agree with Trump’s lawyers that Smith was unlawfully appointed.


Trump was accused in the case overseen by Cannon of hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, his home and private club alongside the Atlantic coastline in Florida.


Trump and co-defendants Carlos De Oliveira and Waltine (Walt) Nauta were accused of trying to obstruct government efforts to retrieve the documents, which U.S. law mandated be turned over to the National Archives as Trump left office in January 2021.


Smith asked the appeals court to remove Trump from the case but to leave his co-defendants in the case, which could allow the appeal of Cannon’s dismissal to continue after Trump assumes power again.


In his filing in Washington, Smith said the Justice Department’s prohibition on taking sitting presidents to trial "is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind."


The cases being heard by Chutkan in Washington and Cannon in Florida had dragged on for months, with Trump’s lawyers filing numerous legal challenges to the charges.


Trump eventually won a broad ruling from the Supreme Court earlier this year, saying that Trump and all former presidents were immune from prosecution for any official actions they had taken while president but not for unofficial acts.


Until Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election and foreclosed Smith’s prosecution of the 2020 election interference indictment, the prosecutor was recasting his election interference case against Trump to account for the restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court.


In a statement after Smith’s two court filings, Trump’s running mate in the election, Vice President-elect JD Vance, cited Trump’s legal peril as he ran for a new four-year term in the White House.


"If Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison," Vance said on social media, adding, "It’s time to ensure what happened to President Trump never happens in this country again."

## First Comes the Hurricane. Then Comes the Fire.

The <a href="https://www.nifc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National Interagency Fire Center</u></a>’s forecast of fire-risk conditions for the coming months has the <a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/weather/hurricane/helene/hurricane-helene-storm-path-track-map/67-0dcefd0d-5e64-43cc-8366-2766ae103256" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>footprint</u></a> of Helene highlighted in red, with the heightened concern stretching into the new year.</p><p>While the flip from intense precipitation to wildfire warnings might seem strange, experts say it speaks to the <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/climate-whiplash-wild-swings-in-extreme-weather-are-on-the-rise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>weather whiplash</u></a> we’re now seeing regularly. “What we expect from climate change is this layering of weather extremes creating really dangerous situations,” Robert Scheller, a professor of forestry and environmental resources at North Carolina State University, explained to me. </p><p>Scheuller said North Carolina had been experiencing drought conditions early in the year, followed by intense rain leading up to Helene’s landfall. Then it went dry again — according to the <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?NC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>U.S. Drought Monitor</u></a>, much of the state was back to some level of drought condition as of mid-November. The NIFC forecast <a href="https://www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/predictive/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> says the same is true for much of the region, including Florida, despite its having been hit by Hurricane Milton soon after Helene. </p><p>That dryness is a particular concern due to the amount of debris left in Helene’s wake — another major risk factor for fire. The storm’s winds, which reached more than 100 miles per hour in some areas, wreaked havoc on <a href="https://gatrees.org/forest-management-conservation/natural-disaster-recovery/hurricane-helene-recovery-assistance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>millions</u></a> of acres of forested land. In North Carolina alone, the state’s <a href="https://www.ncforestservice.gov/forest_health/pdf/HurricaneHelene_DamageAssessment_10_25_FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Forest Service</u></a> estimates over 820,000 acres of timberland were damaged. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>“When you have a catastrophic storm like [Helene], all of the stuff that was standing upright — your trees — they might be snapped off or blown over,” fire ecologist David Godwin told me. “All of a sudden, that material is now on the forest floor, and so you have a really tremendous rearrangement of the fuels and the vegetation within ecosystems that can change the dynamics of how fire behaves in those sites.”</p><p>Godwin is the director of the Southern Fire Exchange for the University of Florida, a program that connects wildland firefighters, prescribed burners, and natural resources managers across the Southeast with fire science and tools. He says the Southeast sees <a href="https://southernwildfire.net/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>frequent, unplanned fires</u></a>, but that active ecosystem management helps keep the fires that do spark from becoming conflagrations. But an increase like this in fallen or dead vegetation — what Godwin refers to as fire “fuel” — can take this risk to the next level, particularly as it dries out. </p><p>Godwin offered an example from another storm, 2018’s Hurricane Michael, which rapidly intensified before making landfall in Northern Florida and continuing inland, similar to Hurricane Helene. In its aftermath, there was a <a href="https://www.stateforesters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hurricane-Michael-TPs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>10-fold increase</u></a> in the amount of fuel on the ground, with <a href="https://www.stateforesters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hurricane-Michael-TPs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>72 million tons of timber</u></a> damaged in Florida. Three years later, the <a href="https://www.newsherald.com/story/news/local/2022/03/11/wildfire-update-bertha-swamp-fire-size-panama-city-lynn-haven-bay-county/6999790001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bertha Swamp Road Fire</u></a> filled the storm’s Florida footprint with flames, which consumed more than 30,000 acres filled with dried out forest fuel. One Florida official <a href="https://www.kezi.com/news/florida-wildfire-that-has-scorched-over-34-000-acres-endangers-community-previously-hit-by-hurricane/article_18a4ce52-6af7-578a-97be-0c26a1ed0ca5.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called</u></a> the wildfire the “ghost” of Michael, nodding to the overlap of the impacted areas and speaking to the environmental threat the storm posed even years later. </p><p>Not only does this fuel increase the risk of fire, it changes the character of the fires that do ignite, Godwin said. Given ample ground fuel, flame lengths can grow longer, allowing them to burn higher into the canopy. That’s why people setting prescribed fires will take steps like raking leaf piles, which helps keep the fire intensity low. </p><p>These fires can also produce more smoke, Godwin said, which can mix with the mountainous fog in the region to deadly effect. According to the NIFC, mountainous areas incurred the most damage from Helene, not only due to downed vegetation, but also because of “washed out roads and trails” and “slope destabilization” from the winds and rain. If there is a fire in these areas, all these factors will also make it more challenging for firefighters to address it, the report adds. </p><p>In addition to the natural debris fire experts worry about, Helene caused extensive damage to the built environment, wrecking homes, businesses, and other infrastructure. Try imagining four-and-a-half football fields stacked 10 feet tall with debris — that’s what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkebQIJPs5U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officials have removed</a> so far just in Asheville, North Carolina. In Florida’s Treasure Island, there were piles <a href="https://www.aol.com/florida-towns-50-foot-tall-191337038.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>50 feet high</u></a> of assorted scrap materials. Officials have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCjxwHTpnGo/?img_index=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warned</u></a> that some common household items, such as the lithium-ion batteries used in e-bikes and electric vehicles, can be particularly flammable after exposure to floodwaters. They are also <a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=21815" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advising against</u></a> burning debris as a means of managing it due to all the compounding risks.</p><p>Larry Pierson, deputy chief of the Swannanoa Fire Department in North Carolina, told <a href="https://www.bpr.org/bpr-news/2024-11-12/higher-risk-of-wildfire-as-downed-trees-dry-weather-follows-hurricane-helene" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Blueridge Public Radio</u></a> that his department’s work has “grown exponentially since the storm.” While cooler, wetter winter weather could offer some relief, Scheuller said the area will likely see heightened fire behavior for <em><em>years</em></em> after the storm, particularly if the swings between particularly wet and particularly dry periods continue. </p><p>Part of the challenge moving forward, then, is to find ways to mitigate risk on this now-hazardous terrain. For homeowners, that might mean exercising caution when dealing with debris and considering wildfire risk as part of rebuilding plans, particularly in more wooded areas. On a larger forest management scale, this means prioritizing safe debris collection and finding ways to continue the practice of prescribed burns, which are utilized more in the <a href="https://southernwildfire.net/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Southeast</u></a> than in any other U.S. region. Without focused mitigation efforts, Godwin told me the area’s overall fire outlook would be much different. </p><p>“We would have a really big wildfire issue,” he said, “perhaps even bigger than what we might see in parts of the West.”</p>

## $300B COP29 climate deal sparks outrage, hope

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

BAKU, AZERBAIJAN  — Anger and frustration from developing nations vulnerable to climate impacts are likely to linger following the conclusion of the climate change summit in Azerbaijan, COP29, as nations adopted a $300 billion global finance target to help poorer nations cope with climate change, a deal that many recipient nations slammed as severely insufficient.


Global North countries, often historic emitters responsible for global warming, agreed on Sunday to pledge $300 billion a year until 2035 for their developing counterparts to stave off the direst effects of climate change — less than a quarter of the acknowledged $1.3 trillion needed annually to reduce emissions and build resilience in vulnerable countries.


The $300 billion figure, also, is an increase by $200 billion each year, compared to the agreement in place since 2009, which is expiring.


Spirited disappointment and rage from Global South countries was expressed at the closing plenary, with some national representatives calling adoption of the new funding package “insulting.”


“We are extremely disappointed,” said Indian negotiator Chandni Raina, who called the figure “abysmal.”


Her Cuban counterpart, Pedro Luis Pedroso, described the deal as “environmental colonialism,” pointing out that, when factoring in today’s inflation, the pledged funding is lower than the $100 billion agreed to in 2009. Bolivia’s negotiator called the deal “insulting” to developing nations.


Some Western representatives were more upbeat.


“COP29 will be remembered as a new era of climate finance,” top EU climate negotiator Wopke Hoekstra said, calling the target amount “ambitious” and “achievable.”


Some experts told VOA that the structure and composition of the $300 billion deal was more important than the actual monetary figure. The final deal allows for both public and private sources of funds to be tapped to bolster climate preparation efforts in the developing world.


Negotiators for developing countries expressed concern that private sources of funding could come in the form of more loans, which could lead to challenging debt accumulation by poorer nations, rather than funding in the preferred form of grants.


Global South countries argued for a new target for green finance and have consistently called for such climate finance to come in the form of public grants. The tense and fraught negotiations of the past week dragged on for two extra days and included at least one episode of negotiators from small island nations and some of the poorest nations in the world walking out of a meeting room with wealthy nations in protest. They asserted that their voices and perspectives were not heard.


”This COP has been a disaster for the developing world,” said Mohammed Adow, director of Kenya-based climate and energy research group Power Shift Africa. ”It’s a betrayal of both people and planet, by wealthy countries, who claim to take climate change seriously.”


The adopted finance package also stated that a further roadmap is set to be discussed at the next conference – likely COP30, set for Belem, Brazil in late 2025 — on how to reach the trillion-dollar figure.


Independent South African climate consultant Gillian Hamilton called the $300 billion core funding target “insufficient,” particularly for building resilience against climate impacts — also known as climate adaptation.


“Developed nations should have shown more leadership and transparency,” Hamilton told VOA. “The biggest emitters need to rapidly decrease their emissions so that adaptation costs for developing countries don’t increase exponentially.”


Campaigners staged multiple environmental protests each day here during the past week-plus of meetings.


Though negotiators for developing nations repeatedly asked for climate finance in the form of grants instead of loans, in the final deal, developed countries stopped short of guaranteeing that could be done.


Adaptation finance 


The deal adopted Sunday acknowledges that funding sources for adaptation finance should be public and transparent.


With 2024 going down as the hottest year in history, the world has experienced a slew of climate disasters, ranging from devastating floods in Nepal and Spain, to Hurricane Helene in the Americas, droughts in the Mediterranean and typhoons in the western Pacific region.


Despite the disasters and renewed calls to finance climate-resilient infrastructure across the Global South to guard against rising sea levels and wildfires, funding has been falling short for years, according to a November report from the U.N. Environment Program. 


The so-called adaptation projects include developing more advanced disaster warning systems, reforestation, and building catchment mechanisms to ensure water security in regions most affected by climate change.


At COP29, Germany pledged $62 billion, to the adaptation fund; France highlighted its 2023 pledge of $2.9 billion, in adaptation; the U.S. said it pays $3 billion into it each year. A total of 14 Global North countries including Spain, Sweden, South Korea and Switzerland promised to provide $300 million this year, according to a separate negotiation text in the conference.


Despite pledges in recent years, countries didn’t completely deliver on promises. This year, for example, more than $122 million of pledged financial support to poor nations for adapting to climate risk is still up in the air, even though this assistance has been a stated priority at recent COP meetings.


What to expect in Belem? 


Countries will be tasked at the Brazil meeting next November with ironing out the details of a global carbon trade system governed by a centralized U.N. regulatory body. They also will try to find a path for wealthy, developed countries to reach the target of $1.3 trillion to support efforts in the Global South to address the consequences of climate disasters. A major component will be reviewing national climate plans, which are due to be submitted in February. Britain, Brazil and the UAE are among the nations that this past week aimed to get ahead of the February deadline and shared some of the goals in their national climate preparation plans.


Harjeet Singh, global engagement director of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, said it is likely that ‘most’ nations will not meet the February deadline to submit their updated plans to address climate change.


The future participation of Argentina is unclear, after hardline President Javier Milei — who has called climate change a hoax — reportedly told his government delegates here to pack their bags and leave the negotiations on the third day of the summit.


Singh was asked by VOA whether wealthy nations would deliver on their promises to lead the effort toward $300 billion in climate finance support, and he responded that the key lies in their ‘willingness, as the money has always been there.’

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
1. COP29 ends with $300 billion climate finance goal
</h3><p>
	The UN COP29 climate summit came to a close Sunday – two days behind schedule – after delegates reached 
	<a href="https://cop29.az/en/media-hub/news/breakthrough-in-baku-delivers-13tn-baku-finance-goal?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a deal</a> on a sum for a new climate finance goal. Developed countries pledged to give at least $300 billion annually by 2035 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and transition away from fossil fuels. That’s up from the previous goal, set in 2009, of $100 billion, but well below the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/new-report-recommends-cop29-negotiations-on-climate-finance-should-focus-on-mobilising-1-trillion-per-year-for-developing-countries-by-2030/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd#:~:text=Negotiations%20about%20climate%20finance%20at,than%20China%20to%20deliver%20the" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1 trillion economists say</a> will be needed. That a deal was reached at all was seen as a success after two weeks of stalemate. But many from developing nations found it insufficient. Here are some reactions:
</p><ul>
<li>“This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives. But like any insurance policy, it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.” –UN climate chief <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/wealthy-countries-back-raising-cop29-climate-deal-300-billion-sources-say-2024-11-23/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Simon Stiell</a>.</li>
<li>“The goal is too little. Too distant. The proposed goal shall not solve anything for us.” –<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/11/23/fractious-cop29-lands-300bn-climate-finance-goal-dashing-hopes-of-the-poorest/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chandni Raina</a>, an adviser with India’s Ministry of Finance.</li>
<li>“While wealthy, polluting countries should have committed to a higher amount, this is a floor not a ceiling. The pressure to increase funding will only grow over time, as the economic and security rationale for delivering more international climate finance is clear.” –<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/cop-29-countries-agree-increase-investments-developing-world-confront-climate-crisis?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Manish Bapna</a>, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.</li>
<li>“This finance goal comes with no assurance that it will not be delivered through loans or private finance rather than the grant-based public finance developing countries desperately need.” –<a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/71474/cop29-ends-weak-climate-finance-goal-eyes-turn-belem/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tracy Carty</a>, a climate politics expert with Greenpeace International. </li>
</ul><p>
	Beyond the climate finance deal, the summit did not result in a clear plan for how countries will transition away from fossil fuels, as pledged at last year’s COP28, nor details on tripling renewable energy capacity.
</p><h3>2. Final meeting on global plastics treaty kicks off</h3><p>
	As one UN summit winds down, another begins. This week delegates from 175 countries will <a href="https://www.unep.org/inc-plastic-pollution/session-5?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" target="_blank">gather in Busan, South Korea</a>, with a goal of cementing a global treaty on reducing plastic pollution.

	Tesla’s massive EV production plant in Austin, Texas, spewed environmental toxins into the surrounding air and water for months back in 2022, according to an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-tesla-environment-1263cd60?mod=hp_lead_pos1&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" target="_blank">investigation</a> by <em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em>. The hazards were not addressed even after managers were made aware of them, and employees felt pressured by CEO Elon Musk to put production goals ahead of regulatory compliance. “Across his business empire, Musk’s companies show a pattern of breaking environmental rules again and again, federal and state government filings and documents show,” the <em><em>Journal</em></em> said. It noted that as co-head of the new “Department of Government Efficiency” under the Trump administration, Musk is likely to try to cut environmental regulations that apply to his own companies.

	A recent <a href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/replacing-an-ev-battery-less-than-fixing-a-gas-engine?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" target="_blank">report</a> finds that the cost of replacing an EV battery pack will soon be lower than the cost of replacing an internal combustion engine. The analysis comes from Recurrent, a startup focused on helping buyers understand battery health in used EVs. (As CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/this-startup-is-figuring-out-how-much-used-evs-are-worth-by-analyzing-their-batteries.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gDDcCfL8H_Pcu7Zy9Skj5h3iSmLQtrD3ljl6PVlf_PLht2lhA1yPWI8JJ38BiogZwpBLd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> earlier this year, “Recurrent aims to do for electric vehicle batteries what odometers do for fuel-powered cars: show the wear and tear on the battery and its future value.”) While it’s unlikely that an EV driver would need to replace a battery, this possibility remains a nagging concern, especially among those who might consider buying a used EV. The report found that, as the price of lithium-ion batteries falls, so will the cost of replacing them. By 2030, the cost will be at parity with that of replacing an ICE, and at the same time, used batteries could be sold on. “The takeaway? It will no longer be the case that a 10+ year old EV is worthless,” the report said. “It will be very feasible for someone to buy an inexpensive EV and replace the battery pack for a few thousand dollars.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Geothermal Could Be the Big Winner of This Election Cycle

date: 2024-11-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDk2ODIxNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDU2NjQyOH0.JEZ3h799nyHM_y0qrW3Cc56YhhJfFYsCY9gpyThfq2I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">As the 118th Congress prepares to clear the way for a new set of legislators who will be responsible for confirming cabinet picks, passing tax legislation, and whatever else the President-reelect throws at them, it is also quietly working on bills to ease the development path for the one form of clean, firm power that Republicans and Democrats can peaceably unite around: geothermal.</p><p>Geothermal has something to offer for everyone in Washington. “It’s a source of clean energy, which makes it appealing to Democrats,” Aidan Mackenzie, a fellow at the science and technology policy group the Institute for Progress, told me. It can also generate electricity 24 hours a day with no greenhouse gas emissions, thus potentially making it a key part of the decarbonized grid of the future.</p><p>For Republicans, it does all this while also employing the people, skills, and sometimes the actual gear of the oil and gas industry to drill deep into pockets of trapped heat, which are often in states Republicans control. For this reason, it “fits very well with ‘drill baby drill’ Republican ethos,” Mackenzie added.</p><p>This overlap has opened up space for bipartisan cooperation, especially on tailoring and rewriting permitting rules for the industry. This week, the House passed two bills with essentially unanimous Republican and some Democratic support: the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7409" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>HEATS Act</u></a>, which exempts some geothermal exploration activity from permitting requirements, and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CLEAN Act</u></a>, which mandates more geothermal lease sales by the Department of the Interior.</p><p>At the same time, a group of moderate Democrats have pressed House and Senate leadership to pass the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, proposed by Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso. That bill includes several policies either borrowed from the Senate’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/geothermal-energy-bill-new-mexico" target="_self"><u>bipartisan GEO Act</u></a> or mirroring the new House bills, including measures to exempt some geothermal development from environmental reviews and establish an ombudsman to coordinate permitting. The bill has already passed the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, of which Manchin and Barrasso are the co-chairs, and negotiations to get a bill that could pass the House and a full Senate vote are <a href="https://x.com/SiegelScribe/status/1859968587248947308/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ongoing</u></a>. </p><p>Traditionally, geothermal has been limited by the availability of the resource, namely extremely hot water or steam trapped in the Earth’s surface, which is then tapped through drilling. Next generation technologies bring fluid to hot rocks underground, vastly expanding the potential of the technology.</p><p>“The U.S. electricity market is desperate for 24/7 new power,” Jeremy Harrell, chief executive officer of the conservative environmental group ClearPath, told me. The Department of Energy has estimated that so-called next generation geothermal could provide some <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/LIFTOFF_DOE_NextGen_Geothermal_v14.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>90 gigawatts of continuous clean energy generating capacity</u></a> by 2050, which could help unlock truly decarbonized grids.</p><p>All of this makes the case for bipartisanship pretty clear. The HEATS and CLEAN Act were sponsored by Republicans Young Kim of California and Russ Fulcher of Idaho, while the GEO Act was sponsored by two Republicans, James Risch of Idaho and Mike Lee of Utah, alongside two Democrats, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. Two of those sponsors, Lee and Heinrich, will be the chair and ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, respectively, in the upcoming Congress.</p><p>“Scaling our investments in research, development, and demonstration, and reforming the way we permit geothermal projects on our public lands are bipartisan priorities,” Heinrich told me in an emailed statement. “As we approach the next Congress, I remain committed to putting geothermal projects on an equal footing with oil and gas projects on public lands and accelerating the deployment of advanced geothermal energy systems nationwide.”</p><p>Those oil and gas companies are also sometimes investors in geothermal projects, and in the case of enhanced geothermal technology, share workers, drilling techniques, and equipment. Enhanced geothermal startup Fervo, for instance, counts the fracking company Liberty Energy among its investors. <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy" target="_self"><u>Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Energy</u></a>, Chris Wright, is Liberty’s CEO.</p><p>Something else that may benefit geothermal in the years to come: It received <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2024-1-spring/feature/geothermal-renewable-energy-moment-finally-arrived" target="_blank"><u>relatively few benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act</u></a> compared to other clean energy sectors, and therefore isn’t closely associated with a law passed on a partisan basis. “We notoriously got left out of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the IRA. That’s well documented,” Jeanine Vany, the co-founder of the closed-loop advanced geothermal company Eavor, told me.</p><p>Geothermal did get <em><em>some</em></em> money from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-launches-84-million-program-demonstrate-enhanced-geothermal-energy-systems" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including $84 million for pilot demonstration projects</u></a>, Harrell pointed out. But that “wasn’t a ton,” he said, and there’s still a “a need for reasonable but targeted investments.” And while Republicans and Democrats may be able to play nice on reforming regulatory requirements for geothermal, agreeing to spend more money may be more difficult.</p><p>“The question is, are the two parties willing to strike a deal?” Mackenzie said. “For Democrats, it’s accepting permitting changes. For Republicans, it’s a question of whether they are willing to spend any money on this.”</p><p>Senator Heinrich has called on Senate appropriators to include $100 million for next-generation geothermal demonstration projects, an effort that was notably <a href="https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/final_fy24_geothermal_letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>joined only by his fellow Democrats</u></a>.</p><p>The Institute for Progress and Employ America, an economic policy group,  <a href="https://ifp.org/the-policy-interventions-that-could-boost-geothermal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have proposed funding</u></a> the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to help advance geothermal. The Office has already shelled out billions for advanced nuclear and carbon capture programs.</p><p>“It’s a question in an era where there’s a big focus of cutting back and not expanding,” Mackenzie told me. “Is there any actual room to get money out there?” </p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that Employ America is a partner on the proposal for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.</em><br/></p>

## Foreign ministers meet in Italy for the last G7 of the Biden administration

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

ROME — Foreign ministers from the world’s leading industrialized nations are meeting Monday, with the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East entering decisive phases and a certain pressure to advance diplomatic efforts ahead of the new U.S. administration taking over.


Hopes for brokering a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon are foremost on the agenda of the Group of Seven meeting outside Rome that is gathering ministers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.


On the first day of the two-day gathering Monday, the G7 will be joined by ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as the Secretary General of the Arab League.


“With partners will be discussed ways to support efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, initiatives to support the population and the promotion of a credible political horizon for stability in the region,” the Italian foreign ministry said.


The so-called “Quint” grouping of the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the UAE has been working to finalize a “day after” plan for Gaza, and there is some urgency to make progress before the Trump administration takes over in January. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to pursue a policy that strongly favors Israel over the aspirations of the Palestinians.


Host Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani added another item to the G7 agenda last week after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief.


Italy is a founding member of the court and hosted the 1998 Rome conference that gave birth to it. But Italy’s right-wing government has been a strong supporter of Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, while also providing humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza.


The Italian government has taken a cautious line, reaffirming its support and respect for the court but expressing concern that the warrants were politically motivated.


“There can be no equivalence between the responsibilities of the state of Israel and the terrorist organization of Hamas,” Premier Giorgia Meloni said, echoing the statement from U.S. President Joe Biden.


Nathalie Tocci, director of the Rome-based Institute for International Affairs think tank, said Italy would be seeking to forge a united front on the ICC warrants, at least among the six G7 countries that are signatories of the court: everyone but the U.S.


But in an essay this weekend in La Stampa newspaper, Tocci warned it was a risky move, since the U.S. tends to dictate the G7 line and has blasted the ICC warrants against Netanyahu as “outrageous.”


“If Italy and the other (five G7) signatories of the ICC are unable to maintain the line on international law, they will not only erode it anyway, but will be acting against our interests,” Tocci wrote, recalling Italy’s recourse to international law in demanding protection for Italian U.N. peacekeepers who have come under fire in southern Lebanon.


The other major talking point of the G7 meeting is Ukraine, and tensions have only heightened since Russia attacked Ukraine last week with an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile that escalated the nearly 33-month-old war.


Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is expected at the G7 in Fiuggi on Tuesday, and NATO and Ukraine are to hold emergency talks the same day in Brussels.


Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strike was retaliation for Kyiv’s use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory.


The G7 has been at the forefront of providing military and economic support for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and G7 members are particularly concerned about how a Trump administration will change the U.S. approach.


Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.


Italy is a strong supporter of Ukraine and has backed the U.S. decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russia with U.S.-made, longer-range missiles. But Italy has invoked the country’s constitutional repudiation of war in declining to provide Ukraine with offensive weaponry to strike inside Russia and limiting its aid to anti-air defense systems to protect Ukrainian civilians.


The G7 foreign ministers’ meeting, the second of the Italian presidency after ministers gathered in Capri in April, is being held in the medieval town of Fiuggi southeast of Rome, best known for its thermal spas.


On Monday, which coincides with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, ministers will attend the inauguration of a red bench meant to symbolize Italy’s focus on fighting gender-based violence.


Over the weekend, tens of thousands of people marched in Rome to protest gender-based violence, which in Italy so far this year has claimed the lives of 99 women, according to a report last week by the Eures think tank.

## Record dryness in US Northeast should change water behavior, experts say

date: 2024-11-25, from: VOA News USA

Denver, Colorado — It hasn't been a typical fall for the northeastern United States. 


Fires have burned in parks and forests around New York City. Towns and cities in a stretch from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to south of Philadelphia had their driest three months on record, according to the Applied Climate Information System. Some reservoirs in the region are near historic lows. 


Major changes need to happen to avoid critical shortages of water in the future, even if that future isn't immediate. As the climate warms, droughts will continue to intensify and communities should use this one as motivation to put in place long-term solutions, experts say. 


"This is the canary in the coal mine for the future," said Tim Eustance, executive director of the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission. "People should stop watering their lawns yesterday." 


Eustance wants New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to issue a drought emergency to increase people's sense of urgency. 


Here are some ways to stretch water experts said could become necessary in the Northeast. 


Replenishing more water underground 


One important place water is stored is under our feet. Groundwater has dropped significantly over the years in parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. 


Groundwater makes up about half of New Jersey's drinking water. Sprawl and concrete can make it tough for rain to replenish the water underground. 


"New Jersey is 'mall-landia.' We have these giant parking lots that could be ways to reclaim water instead of having runoff," Eustance said. 




In some other parts of the country, there is increasing use of permeable asphalt, concrete and pavers that allow water to percolate into the ground and back into the aquifer. It would be up to municipalities to require that, he said. 


A faster way to replenish the aquifer is by injecting highly treated wastewater into it, something Los Angeles has been doing for years. It is dramatically adding to the city's available water. 


Virginia Beach, Virginia, is also pumping highly treated water back into its aquifer, and Anne Arundel County in Maryland is trying to pass legislation that would allow the same. 


Paying people to conserve 


In some places in the western U.S., getting paid to save water has long been an option. Some cities and counties pay dollars for every square foot of lawn torn out and replaced with native landscaping. 


Those policies are not nearly as widespread in the Northeast, said Alan Roberson, CEO of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators. 


"The abundance has created a different perspective," he said. This can make it hard to get people on board with conservation. 


Upgraded water meters can give customers details about their water use and help them see where they can save money when drought doesn't feel as urgent, said Beth O'Connell, chief engineer for Anne Arundel County, Maryland. 


Reusing water could become more common 


The concept is simple: capture water from the sink, clothes washer, shower and toilet, treat it to a high standard and use it again for nonpotable purposes: It can be sent back through pipes to flush toilets, cool buildings, water yards or help raise water levels in a river or aquifer. 


"One of the crimes I think, in America, is we use drinking water to water our lawns and flush our toilet," Eustance said. 


Zach Gallagher is CEO of Natural Systems Utilities, which designs, builds and operates water recycling systems. He also is the father of three kids and lives in New Jersey, so this drought hits close to home. 


"I feel like I'm doing something that is going to be meaningful and leave something beyond for my children, and their children," he said. 


Reuse can be a tool for both drought and flood, he explained. When a building can reuse its own wastewater and discharge it directly into a body of water, it eases stress on a city's fragile sewer system, which is a common vulnerability in old coastal cities. It also reduces demand on new water. 


Once open this summer, the company's redesign of the old Domino Sugar Refinery on New York's East River will be able to treat 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of wastewater a day, enough to cover a football field in nearly 15 inches (38 centimeters) of water. The cleaned water will be piped back into the new mixed-use buildings for flushing toilets, cooling and landscaping, with some of it discharged back into the river. 


Nonpotable reuse has a growing footprint in the eastern U.S., but scaling it to a regional level should be the next focus, O'Connell said. 


A new mindset 


Planning for a future that includes extended drought can be costly. It could also require a shift in mindset from one of abundance to conservation, said Del Shannon, dam engineer and member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. 


He has worked on water projects around the world and said many developing countries are focused on getting reliable water for crops and drinking. 


"We need to treat our water and guard it as gently as those countries are."

## Trump ‘incredibly concerned’ about escalation of munitions in Russia-Ukraine conflict, aide says

date: 2024-11-24, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is “incredibly concerned” about the escalating use of different types of weaponry in Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine, his designated choice for national security adviser said Sunday.


Michael Waltz, now a Florida congressman, told “Fox News Sunday” that the decision by the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use anti-personnel land mines to try to halt Russia’s battlefield ground troop advances has turned the fight in eastern Ukraine into something akin to “World War I trench warfare.”




Waltz said the decision “needs to be within a broader framework to end this conflict.”


“It is just an absolute meat grinder of people and personnel on that front,” he said.


U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week the United States is sending the anti-personnel mines to Ukraine because of the changing nature of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the main battlefield.




He said Russian ground troops, rather than forces more protected in armored carriers, are leading Moscow’s advance, so Ukraine has “a need for things that can help slow down that effort.”


Waltz said Trump, who takes office January 20, is concerned about the carnage but said that in the broad picture, the question that must be preeminent is, “How do we restore deterrence and how do we bring peace?”


“We need to, we need to bring this to a responsible end,” he added.


Trump has often claimed that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war even before he is inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president. Trump has never said how and refused to say during a campaign debate in September that he wants Ukraine to win.


Biden gave Ukraine authority to launch Washington-supplied missiles with a 300-kilometer range deep into Russia in response to North Korea’s dispatch of 10,000 troops to fight alongside Moscow’s forces. Within two days, Kyiv targeted weapons warehouses in Russia’s Bryansk region with the missiles.


Then, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a new experimental rocket, targeting Dnipro in Ukraine’s eastern region.




“This is a clear escalation,” Waltz said. “Where is this escalation going? How do we get both sides to the table” for peace negotiations?


Waltz, whose appointment does not require Senate confirmation, said he has been meeting with Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser. Waltz said that any U.S. adversary “is wrong” if it thinks it can “play one side off against the other” with the switch in power in Washington from Biden, a Democrat, and his long-time political foe, Trump, a Republican.


Waltz said he is “confident” Trump will restore peace “in pretty short order” in the multiple conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel fighting Iran-funded militants — Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.


But months of cease-fire talks on the conflict in Gaza are stalemated and talks to reach a halt in the Hezbollah-Israel fighting have yet to produce a deal.

## Forecasts warn of possible winter storms across US during Thanksgiving week

date: 2024-11-24, from: VOA News USA

WINDSOR, CALIFORNIA — Forecasters throughout the U.S. issued warnings that another round of winter weather could complicate travel leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, while California and Washington state continue to recover from storm damage and power outages. 


In California, where a person was found dead in a vehicle submerged in floodwaters on Saturday, authorities braced for more precipitation while grappling with flooding and small landslides from a previous storm. Thousands in the Pacific Northwest remained without power after multiple days in the dark. 


The National Weather Service office in Sacramento, California, issued a winter storm warning for the state's Sierra Nevada for Saturday through Tuesday, with heavy snow expected at higher elevations and wind gusts potentially reaching 88 kph. Total snowfall of roughly 1.2 meters was forecast, with the heaviest accumulations expected Monday and Tuesday. 


The Midwest and Great Lakes regions will see rain and snow Monday and the East Coast will be the most impacted on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, forecasters said. 


A low pressure system is forecast to bring rain to the Southeast early Thursday before heading to the Northeast. Areas from Boston to New York could see rain and strong winds, with snowfall possible in parts of northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks. If the system tracks further inland, there could be less snow and more rain in the mountains, forecasters said. 


Deadly 'bomb cyclone’ on West Coast 


Earlier this week, two people died when the storm arrived in the Pacific Northwest. Hundreds of thousands lost power, mostly in the Seattle area, before strong winds moved through northern California. A rapidly intensifying “bomb cyclone” that hit the West Coast on Tuesday brought fierce winds that resulted in home and vehicle damage. 


Rescue crews in Guerneville, California recovered a body inside a vehicle bobbing in floodwaters around 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Sonoma County Sheriff’s Deputy Rob Dillion said, noting the deceased was presumed to be a victim of the storm but an autopsy had not yet been conducted. 


Santa Rosa, California, saw its wettest three-day period on record with about 32 centimeters of rain by Friday evening, the National Weather Service in the Bay Area reported. Vineyards in nearby Windsor, California were flooded on Saturday. 


Tens of thousands without power in Seattle area 


Some 80,000 people in the Seattle area were still without electricity after this season’s strongest atmospheric river, a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows over land. 


The power came back in the afternoon at Katie Skipper’s home in North Bend, about 50 kilometers east of Seattle, after being out since Tuesday. She was tired from taking cold showers, warming herself with a wood stove and using a generator to run the refrigerator, but Skipper said those inconveniences paled in comparison to the damage other people suffered, such as from fallen trees. 


“That’s really sad and scary,” she said. 


Northeast gets needed precipitation 


Another storm brought rain to New York and New Jersey, where rare wildfires have raged in recent weeks, and heavy snow to northeastern Pennsylvania. The precipitation was expected to help ease drought conditions after an exceptionally dry fall. 


“It’s not going to be a drought buster, but it’s definitely going to help when all this melts,” said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York. 


Heavy snow fell in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains. Higher elevations reported up to 43 centimeters, with lesser accumulations in valley cities including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Fewer than 80,000 customers in 10 counties lost power. 


Precipitation in West Virginia helped put a dent in the state’s worst drought in at least two decades and boosted ski resorts preparing to open their slopes in the weeks ahead.

## How a viral, duct-taped banana came to be worth $6.2 million

date: 2024-11-24, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Walk into any supermarket and you can generally buy a banana for less than $1. But a banana duct-taped to a wall? That sold for $6.2 million at an auction at Sotheby's in New York.


The yellow banana fixed to the white wall with silver duct tape is a work entitled "Comedian," by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. It first debuted in 2019 as an edition of three fruits at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair, where it became a much-discussed sensation.


Was it a prank? A commentary on the state of the art world? Another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it. A backup banana was brought in. Selfie-seeking crowds became so thick, "Comedian" was withdrawn from view, but three editions of it sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to Perrotin gallery.


Five years later, someone has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby’s auction. Or, more accurately, they have purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives them the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it “Comedian.”


Bidding started at $800,000 and within minutes shot up to $2 million, then $3 million, then $4 million, as the auctioneer joked, “It’s slipping through the auction room.” The final hammer price announced in the room Wednesday was $5.2 million, which didn't include the about $1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.


Sotheby’s calls Cattelan “among Contemporary Art’s most brilliant provocateurs.”


“He has persistently disrupted the art world’s status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways,” the auction house said in a description of “Comedian.”


"What Cattelan is really doing is turning a mirror to the contemporary art world and asking questions, provoking thought about how we ascribe value to artworks, what we define as an artwork," Galperin said.


The banana that was on display in Miami is long gone. Sotheby's says the fruit always was meant to be replaced regularly, along with the tape.


"What you buy when you buy Cattelan's 'Comedian' is not the banana itself, but a certificate of authenticity that grants the owner the permission and authority to reproduce this banana and duct tape on their wall as an original artwork by Maurizio Cattelan," Galperin said.


The very title of the piece suggests Cattelan himself likely didn't intend for it to be taken seriously. But Chloé Cooper Jones, an associate professor at the Columbia University School of the Arts, said it is worth thinking about the context.


Cattelan premiered the work at an art fair, visited by well-off art collectors, where "Comedian" was sure to get a lot of attention on social media. That might mean the art constituted a dare, of sorts, to the collectors to invest in something absurd, she said.


If "Comedian" is just a tool for understanding the insular, capitalist, art-collecting world, Cooper Jones said, "it's not that interesting of an idea."


But she thinks it might go beyond poking fun at rich people.


Cattelan is often thought of as a "trickster artist," she said. "But his work is often at the intersection of the sort of humor and the deeply macabre. He's quite often looking at ways of provoking us, not just for the sake of provocation, but to ask us to look into some of the sort of darkest parts of history and of ourselves."


And there is a dark side to the banana, a fruit with a history entangled with imperialism, labor exploitation and corporate power.


"It would be hard to come up with a better, simple symbol of global trade and all of its exploitations than the banana," Cooper Jones said. If "Comedian" is about making people think about their moral complicity in the production of objects they take for granted, then it's "at least a more useful tool or it's at least an additional sort of place to go in terms of the questions that this work could be asking," she said.


"Comedian" hits the block around the same time that Sotheby's is also auctioning one of the famed paintings in the "Water Lilies" series by the French impressionist Claude Monet, with an expected value of around $60 million.


When asked to compare Cattelan's banana to a classic like Monet's "Nymphéas," Galperin says impressionism was not considered art when the movement began.


"No important, profound, meaningful artwork of the past 100 years or 200 years, or our history for that matter, did not provoke some kind of discomfort when it was first unveiled," Galperin said.

## People on breathing machines struggle without power after weather disasters

date: 2024-11-24, from: VOA News USA

HOUSTON — Kimberly Rubit had one priority in mind as Hurricane Beryl ripped through Houston this summer: her severely disabled daughter.


The 63-year-old worked nonstop to prevent Mary, 42, from overheating without air conditioning, water or lights after Beryl knocked out power to their home for 10 days. At least three dozen other people suffered heat-related deaths during the extended outage.


"It was miserable," Rubit said. "I'm sick of it."


Electric grids have buckled more frequently and outages have become longer across the U.S. as the warming atmosphere carries more water and stirs up more destructive storms, according to an AP analysis of government data. In the Pacific Northwest this week, a "bomb cyclone" caused roughly half a million outages.


People with disabilities and chronic health conditions are particularly at risk when the power goes out, and many live in homes that lack the weatherizing and backup power supplies needed to better handle high temperatures and cold freezes, or can't pay their electricity bills, said Columbia University sociomedical sciences professor Diana Hernandez, who studies energy instability in U.S. homes.


At any given time, 1 in 3 households in the U.S. is "actively trying to avoid a disconnection or contending with the aftermath of it," Hernandez said.


In Texas, as another winter approaches, people can't shake fears of another blackout like the one during a cold freeze in 2021 that left millions without power for days and killed more than 200 people. Despite efforts to create more resilience, a winter storm that powerful could still lead to rolling blackouts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages most of the state's power grid.




Beryl also knocked out power to millions for days, sickening many in the sweltering July heat. Local and state officials showered criticism on CenterPoint Energy, Houston's power utility, saying it should have communicated more clearly, taken more preventive measures such as tree trimming before the storm hit and repaired downed power lines more quickly. The utility's response remains under investigation by the Texas attorney general.


CenterPoint says it is focused now on improving resiliency, customer communications and community partnerships with the one defining goal: "to build the most resilient coastal grid in the country that can better withstand the extreme weather of the future."


Texas lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating whether assisted living facilities need more regulation. One suggestion: requiring them to have enough emergency generator fuel to power lifesaving equipment and keep indoor temperatures safe during an extended blackout, as Florida did after a scandal over hurricane-related nursing home deaths.


The legislative panel also reviewed emergency responses this month. Regulated facilities and nursing centers fared better than places such as senior communities that aren't subject to strict oversight, according to city and state officials. This meant hundreds of apartment complexes catering to older adults, as well as private homes, were likely more susceptible to losing power and going without food.


"We've got to find a way to mark these facilities or get it entered into the computer dispatch systems," said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. "There are so many places in our own city that we have no idea until that 911 call comes into that facility," he said.


Texas energy companies have been required since 2003 to provide advance notice of scheduled outages to medically vulnerable households that submit a form with physician approval. But that law didn't require the utilities to share these lists with state or local emergency management agencies.


Numerous states have similar regulatory requirements and 38 have policies aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Colorado, medically vulnerable residents are protected from disconnection for up to 90 days. In Arkansas, utilities can't disconnect power to people who are 65 or older if temperatures are forecast to reach above 34 degrees Celsius.


In Houston, Rubit and her daughter share one of the roughly 3,000 households where unreliable power can quickly spiral into a life-and-death issue because at least one person requires a medical device powered by electricity, according to public filings from CenterPoint. The utility offers such households payment plans to keep the electricity on when they fall behind on their bills.


The utility's efforts bring little solace to community members at a Houston living center for seniors, Commons of Grace, where outages have become a haunting facet of life for more than 100 residents, said Belinda Taylor, who runs a nonprofit partnered with the managing company.


"I'm just frustrated that we didn't get the services that we needed," Taylor said. "It's ridiculous that we have had to suffer."


Sharon Burks, who lives at Commons of Grace, said it became unbearable when the power went out. She is 63 and uses a breathing machine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes shortness of breath. She had to resort to her battery-powered breathing pump, which isn't meant to be used for long periods.


"I didn't expect anything from CenterPoint," Burks said. "We're always the last to get it."

## Has a waltz written by composer Frederic Chopin been discovered in an NYC museum?

date: 2024-11-24, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The brooding waltz was carefully composed on a sheet of music roughly the size of an index card. The brief, moody number also bore an intriguing name, written at the top in cursive: "Chopin."


A previously unknown work of music penned by the European master Frederic Chopin appears to have been found at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan.


The untitled and unsigned piece is on display this month at the opulently appointed institution, which had once been the private library of financier J. P. Morgan.


Robinson McClellan, the museum curator who uncovered the manuscript, said it's the first new work associated with the Romantic era composer to be discovered in nearly a century.


But McClellan concedes that it may never be known whether it is an original Chopin work or merely one written in his hand.


The piece, set in the key of A minor, stands out for its "very stormy, brooding opening section" before transitioning to a melancholy melody more characteristic of Chopin, McClellan explained.


"This is his style. This is his essence," he said during a recent visit to the museum. "It really feels like him."


Curator finds composition in collection


McClellan said he came across the work in May as he was going through a collection from the late Arthur Satz, a former president of the New York School of Interior Design. Satz had acquired it from A. Sherrill Whiton Jr., an avid autograph collector who had been director of the school.


McClellan then worked with experts to verify its authenticity.


The paper was found to be consistent with what Chopin favored for manuscripts, and the ink matched a kind typical in the early 19th century when Chopin lived, according to the museum. But a handwriting analysis determined the name "Chopin" written at the top of the sheet was penned by someone else.


Born in Poland, Chopin was considered a musical genius from an early age. He lived in Warsaw and Vienna before settling in Paris, where he died in 1849 at the age of 39, likely of tuberculosis.


He's buried among a pantheon of artists at the city's famed Pere Lachaise Cemetery, but his heart, pickled in a jar of alcohol, is housed in a church in Warsaw, in keeping with his deathbed wish for the organ to return to his homeland.


Artur Szklener, director of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw, the Polish capital city where the composer grew up, agreed that the document is consistent with the kinds of ink and paper Chopin used during his early years in Paris.


Chopin expert calls piece 'little gem'


Musically, the piece evokes the "brilliant style" that made Chopin a luminary in his time, but it also has features unusual for his compositions, Szklener said.


"First of all, it is not a complete work, but rather a certain musical gesture, a theme laced with rather simple piano tricks alluding to a virtuoso style," Szklener explained in a lengthy statement released after the document was revealed last month.


He and other experts conjecture the piece could have been a work in progress. It may have also been a copy of another's work, or even co-written with someone else, perhaps a student for a musical exercise.


Jeffrey Kallberg, a University of Pennsylvania music professor and Chopin expert who helped authenticate the document, called the piece a "little gem" that Chopin likely intended as a gift for a friend or wealthy acquaintance.


"Many of the pieces that he gave as gifts were short – kind of like 'appetizers' to a full-blown work," Kallberg said in an email. "And we don't know for sure whether he intended the piece to see the light of day because he often wrote out the same waltz more than once as a gift."


David Ludwig, dean of music at The Juilliard School, a performing arts conservatory in Manhattan, agreed the piece has many of the hallmarks of the composer's style.


"It has the Chopin character of something very lyrical and it has a little bit of darkness as well," said Ludwig, who was not involved in authenticating the document.


But Ludwig noted that, if it's authentic, the tightly composed score would be one of Chopin's shortest known pieces. The waltz clocks in at under a minute long when played on piano, as many of Chopin's works were intended.


"In terms of the authenticity of it, in a way it doesn't matter because it sparks our imaginations," Ludwig said. "A discovery like this highlights the fact that classical music is very much a living art form."


The Chopin reveal comes after the Leipzig Municipal Libraries in Germany announced in September that it had uncovered a previously unknown piece likely composed by a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in its collections.
