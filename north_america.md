## Are you shopping veteran-owned businesses this holiday season?

date: 2024-11-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Veterans own about 5.4% of businesses in this country, generating more than $900 billion in revenue. Those who have served are pretty good at starting and running businesses, thanks to the skills they learned in the military. We&#8217;ll hear more. Plus, how U.S. fiscal policy will fare under a second Trump term and what a GOP-controlled Congress would mean for tax policy.</p>

## Trump taps Stefanik to be UN Ambassador

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Donald Trump has chosen Republican Representative Elise Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, the president-elect said in a statement shared with Reuters on Monday.


"I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter," Trump said.


Stefanik, a New York representative and House Republican Conference chair, has been a fierce Trump ally.


She could not be immediately reached for comment.


Trump said Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration.




Haley served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump during his previous term and had endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries.


Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his Jan. 20 inauguration as president.


Reuters reported Friday that Trump has also met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee.

## What to Expect from COP29

date: 2024-11-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDQ2MDgxNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2Mzc3NDk3M30.TUsr6IqYlkMQEAEFg87O6BvMxaXgLYa29Y1neSv5_5I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Outdoor activities are banned in Pakistan’s Punjab province as air pollution worsens • An atmospheric river is hammering the Pacific Northwest • The Taurid meteor shower will peak today and tomorrow.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. COP29 kicks off in Azerbaijan </h3><p>
	The UN COP29 climate summit starts today in Baku, Azerbaijan. It’s being <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a7e2874-3ecb-45f8-bcae-379ab82d79ac?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> “the toughest climate talks in almost a decade,” as countries work to set a new finance target to help developing nations adapt to climate change. In 2022, industrialized nations pledged to provide $100 billion annually for climate finance, and the new goal could run into the trillions of dollars. Clashes are expected over how much money should be paid and by whom, plus the mechanisms for managing and structuring the funding. Donald Trump’s election win looms large at the event, with the world’s largest economy and the second largest greenhouse gas emitter expected to slow climate action under the next administration. Still, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev said the finance target was the meeting’s top priority. Negotiators are also likely to put the finishing touches on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which calls for the creation of a global carbon credit market. And there will be a big push to get nations to outline their new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), or emissions reduction plans, well ahead of the February deadline.
</p><h3>2. Who’s going to COP29 – and who is not</h3><p>
	More than 100 heads of state are expected to be in attendance at COP29, but this year’s event has already been defined by the long list of important people who <em>aren’t</em> attending. Absent are President Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. A bunch of banking bigwigs have also bowed out. So who <em>is</em> going?
</p><ul>
<li><strong>U.S. climate envoy John Podesta, as well as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse</strong> (D-R.I.), the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, who last week <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-cop-climate-confrence-summit-joe-biden-politics-donald-trump-climate/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he would head to Baku to “reassure the international community that large swaths of the U.S. remain committed to steering the planet away from climate catastrophe.”</li>
<li><strong>Chinese climate spokesperson Liu Zhenmin</strong>. There will be pressure on China to contribute to the climate finance pool. “China could step up and take a leadership role on climate now that the U.S. looks likely to relinquish its crown,” <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-11/cop29-trump-win-upends-climate-cash-fight-in-baku?srnd=phx-green&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. “Conversely, it could use Trump’s victory as an excuse for it to take less action to curb fossil fuels.” </li>
<li><strong>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband</strong>. They will unveil the UK’s NDC and try to steady the ship as U.S. climate commitments wobble.</li>
<li><strong>Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados</strong>, who will be “a linchpin for developing countries seeking climate justice in the face of inaction by the worst greenhouse gas emitters,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/10/whos-who-at-cop29-the-world-leaders-and-others-who-will-attend?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>The Guardian</em>. </li>
<li><strong>Brazil’s environmental minister, Marina Silva. </strong>Brazil is host to next year’s COP30. The nation recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/brazil-announces-new-climate-change-pledge-ahead-cop29-summit-2024-11-09/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upped</a> its climate pledge.</li>

<li>EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra; World Bank President Ajay Banga; Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; UN chief António Guterres.</li>
</ul><h3>3. Trump eyes Burgum for ‘energy czar’</h3><p>
	President-elect Donald Trump is considering North Dakota’s Republican governor Doug Burgum for a position as “energy czar,” the <em><em>Financial Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c390cc1-f5b8-4096-a361-c53d8145b85a?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" target="_blank">reported</a>. The role would replace that of National Climate Advisor – created by President Biden and currently occupied by Ali Zaidi – and “coordinate Trump’s deregulatory agenda across a patchwork of agencies including the Department of Energy, Department of Interior, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Environmental Protection Agency.” North Dakota is a major oil producer, and Burgum is an “oil industry favorite” for the role, the <em><em>FT</em></em> said.<span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span>
</p><h3>4. Fires plague tri-state area amid drought</h3><p>
	An 18-year-old New York State parks employee died over the weekend while fighting a fire in Orange County, New York. Dariel Vasquez died when a tree fell and struck him as he was working to clear a wooded area, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/nyregion/orange-county-fire-sterling-forest.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" target="_blank">according to</a> <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. The blaze, which is also burning in Passaic County, New Jersey, has charred at least 3,000 acres and is 10% contained. It’s one of several recent fires in the drought-stricken region. A brush fire ignited in Prospect Park Friday and burned 2 acres. Air quality warnings were in place over the weekend for the tri-state area. Some rain fell on Sunday but didn’t do much to relieve the dry conditions.<span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span>
</p><h3>5. Climate-related weather losses surpass $2 trillion over 10 years</h3><p>
	A recent <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/25285058-2024-icc-oxera-the-economic-cost-of-extreme-weather-events/?embed=1&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" target="_blank">report</a> from the International Chamber of Commerce found that extreme weather related to climate change has cost the global economy more than $2 trillion over the last 10 years. The biggest losses, totaling about $935 billion, were felt in the U.S. And the costs have been growing faster in more recent years. For example, in 2022 and 2023 alone, the economic damages reached $451 billion, up nearly 20% compared to the annual average of the 8 years that came before. And the number of climate-related extreme weather events between 2000 and 2019 was 83% higher than in the years between 1980 and 2000. “Our findings indicate that without enhanced climate action and mitigation efforts, the economic burden of climate-related extreme weather events will persist and likely grow,” the report said. The ICC is a business organization “championing the global economy as a force for economic growth, job creation and prosperity.”<span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span>
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>
<em><em>“Trump winning again, this time even the popular vote, has thrown radical uncertainty into America’s international standing — particularly when it comes to climate change and the green economy.

It may be time for the Pentagon to rethink its outdated discharge system. A new system—one that uses objective metrics—could help ensure that more veterans get access to critical benefits.

## Trump’s Gift to China

date: 2024-11-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDI5MDMzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDM3Njg0MX0.toBu6GeYxIN0OWhwAh8dhb48D-2Wt_dkJNDsFHJrIdI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">For decades now analysts of various stripes have been predicting the end of America’s reign as the dominant world power. Some thought the war on terror, in which the U.S. spent on the order of <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$6 trillion</u></a> turning half the Middle East into a Stygian wasteland, would crack it. Others thought the financial crisis of 2008 would sour the world on America-centered financial capitalism.</p><p>Yet nothing of the sort happened. America is simply so rich that it absorbed the burden of 20 years of war without even raising taxes. There was and is simply no alternative to the U.S. dollar for settling international transactions. The 2008 crash caused a run <em><em>towards</em></em> dollars, not away from them, and the U.S. Federal Reserve became the lender of last resort for half the planet — a role it replayed during the initial panic of the pandemic.</p><p>And under the Biden administration, American preeminence seemed to have gotten another lease on life. Thanks to his stimulus and industrial policy, the U.S. economy has recovered much faster than any other rich nation. The European Union is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/european-union-risks-sad-bad-future-2024-09-16/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stagnating</u></a>, struggling to escape from its lack of a coherent fiscal system and its decision to depend heavily on imported Russian fossil gas. China’s growth model has crashed into the middle income trap, as it <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-economic-woes-give-markets-week-forget-public-little-cause-opti-rcna174466" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>struggles to pivot</u></a> from an investment-driven model to a consumption-driven one.</p><p>That all changes with the second election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Him winning again, this time even the popular vote, has thrown radical uncertainty into America’s international standing — particularly when it comes to climate change and the green economy. It’s a golden opportunity for China, if it cares to seize it.</p><p>It has been obvious for years now that renewable energy and green industry are going to be the growth engines of the world economy for the rest of this century at least. Every fossil fuel power plant must be replaced with some combination of wind, solar, batteries, geothermal, or nuclear, and every power grid must be overhauled and upgraded to deal with the intermittency of renewables. All carbon-based industry and agriculture must be modified or replaced with electric-powered versions, requiring a lot more generation capacity.</p><p>It will be a transformation on par in significance with the original Industrial Revolution, requiring trillions in investment per year. Indeed, it is already happening around the world and, given the price trends of renewable energy, it is practically inevitable at this point.</p><p>China already has manifold advantages in this area. It is already the workshop of the world, accounting for almost a third of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.CD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>global manufacturing</u></a>. It produces <a href="https://worldsteel.org/wp-content/uploads/World-Steel-in-Figures-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than half</u></a> of the world’s steel and <a href="https://www.harboraluminum.com/en/top-aluminum-producing-countries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two-thirds of its aluminum</u></a>. It is also far ahead of anyone else in most green industry. It produces <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd8e7175-9423-4042-a6f7-c404afdfcda4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80%</u></a> of global solar panels, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-breaking-china-ev-supply-chain-dominance/?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80%of lithium-ion batteries</u></a>, about <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/how-china-became-the-worlds-clean-tech-giant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>60%of wind turbines</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/20/are-chinese-evs-taking-over-the-car-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>58%of EVs</u></a>. It also has installed more <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/installed-solar-pv-capacity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solar</u></a> and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1421763/global-wind-energy-generation-leading-countries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wind</u></a>, both onshore and offshore, than any other country by far.</p><p>Frankly, China was already positioned to more or less dominate the green energy and industry space. But under Biden, America has belatedly attempted to stand up a competing green manufacturing base, and it is working. Solar and battery investment is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/soaring-us-tax-credit-deals-boost-solar-storage-build-2024-09-06/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>skyrocketing</u></a>, as is <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/C307RC1Q027SBEA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>manufacturing</u></a>.</p><p>Trump has promised to flush all that down the toilet. He has promised to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed4b352b-5c06-4f8d-9df7-1b1f9fecb269" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>repeal the Inflation Reduction Act</u></a>, the keystone Biden climate law, and gut the entire environmental protection apparatus. It’s an open question whether or not he will go that far, but if markets are any judge, the stocks of many American renewable and green industry companies <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/trump-market-ishares-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>plunged</u></a> on the news of his victory. If Republicans win the House (which is not yet counted at time of writing), then I suspect at least a partial repeal of Biden’s climate achievements. That is basically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>what Trump did</u></a> during his last term.</p><p>It might not even take that much. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/opinion/trump-electric-vehicles-china.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Robinson Meyer outlines</u></a>, Trump already strangled an incipient transition to EVs among U.S. automakers during his first term simply with some regulatory adjustments. The ongoing transition has been rocky for some companies, particularly Ford, and it would not take much to tip them back towards traditional cars.</p><p>If that happens then China will not have even a potential peer competitor — it will own more or less the whole green economy going forward. European, Japanese, and Korean companies might carve out a modest niche, but Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia will by and large be decarbonized and powered by Chinese products.</p><p>China has an even bigger opportunity when it comes to diplomacy. The keystone of American dominance is its alliance system. Its relationships through NATO and with New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, and so on provides a public good of security in which those countries feel less need to spend hugely on defense, in return to submitting to U.S. control of global financial pipelines and other international institutions.</p><p>Electing a madman as president back in 2016 led many to question whether America was not too politically rotten to be trusted as world hegemon, and sure enough Trump, with his arrogant, erratic, and supremely transactional diplomacy, deeply alienated much of the EU, the most important ally. Biden successfully patched up the relationship, but a second Trump election could be the final straw. One election could be a fluke, but two is a pattern, and in any case Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has suggested</u></a> he might unilaterally tear up NATO. Frankly you’d be a fool to trust American diplomatic promises of any kind from now on, and a huge military buildup among jittery American allies is all but certain. As French President Emanuel Macron <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-german-coalition-collapse-loom-large-european-leaders-meet-budapest-2024-11-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently said</u></a> at an EU summit, “We cannot delegate our security to the Americans forever.”</p><p>This in turn threatens international financial pipelines, either owned or regulated by the U.S. government, like Fedwire, CHIPS, Nacha, and SWIFT, that the U.S. uses for power projection. Sanctions against Russia, for instance, rely on other nations complying with American rules and surveillance on these systems.</p><p>Many, many countries are not going to be happy about the prospect of Donald Trump being able to set the rules and conditions on their international transactions. It will be a ripe opportunity for China to step in with an alternative system, and thereby knock out another pillar of American global power.</p><p>Let me emphasize that none of this is going to happen automatically. China, with its opaque and autocratic regime, has many serious domestic problems. As noted above, its domestic economy is struggling to rebalance towards consumption, and its population is rapidly aging. That said, the government recently announced a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2feba22-5064-4eb1-84b1-3003cac36def" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major stimulus package</u></a>, which should boost consumption to some degree.</p><p>If China wanted to replace the dollar as reserve currency, it would have to give up capital controls and currency management, which would require even more wrenching reforms. Similarly, if it wants a lot of uptake on an alternative payments system, it would be well advised to not give in to its usual habit of totalitarian police state surveillance. </p><p>But the opportunity still remains. America has been one of the luckiest countries in world history — blessed in its geographic position, resource base, and with a 160-year record of not suffering major wars on its territory. But with sufficient stupidity, even the largest advantages can be canceled out. Electing one of the worst people in the country to the presidency, again, might just do it.</p>

## 'I got my life back': Veterans with PTSD making progress thanks to service dog program

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

KANSAS CITY, Kan.  — After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.


A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet.


Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.


“A lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,” said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. “They’re isolated. They’re very nervous. They won’t make eye contact. Some won’t leave the house at all.”


The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.


The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.


O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.


"When I got out of the military, I just assumed that you’re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,” O’Brien said.


O’Brien’s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.


Now, O’Brien said she can get back out in public — she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, “things that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.”




Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.


Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi on chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.


“I don’t really like leaving the house because I’m safe there, you know?" Atkinson said. “And having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.”


Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.


“We come from the same backgrounds, different branches,” Atkinson said. “Same issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they’re all very welcoming as well. There’s no judgment.”


O’Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.


“The best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,” O’Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.


“I have to decide to walk out and just deal with life," O'Brien said. "And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it’s it’s getting manageable.”


Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.


“I’m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,” Atkinson said. “Or even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.”


Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and Army, deploying 18 times.


“You’re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness," Siebenmorgen said. "So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can’t do it on your own.”


Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.


“I got my life back,” O’Brien said.

## Trump and trade worries cloud COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

Baku, Azerbaijan — The annual U.N. climate summit kicks off Monday with countries readying for tough talks on finance and trade, following a year of weather disasters that have emboldened developing countries in their demands for climate cash.


Delegates gathering in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku are hoping to resolve the summit's top agenda item – a deal for up to $1 trillion in annual climate finance for developing countries.


The summit's negotiating priorities, however, are competing for governments' resources and attention against economic concerns, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and last week's U.S. re-election of Donald Trump, a climate-change denier, as president of the world's biggest economy.


COP29 host Azerbaijan will be tasked with keeping countries focused on agreeing to a new global finance target to replace the current $100 billion pledge expiring this year.


The Caspian Sea nation, often proud of being home to the world's first oil wells, will also be under pressure to show progress from last year's COP28 pledge to transition away from fossil fuels.


The country's oil and gas revenues accounted for 35% of its economy in 2023, down from 50% two years prior. The government says these revenues will continue to decline, to roughly 32% of its GDP this year and 22% by 2028.


Before the summit talks can even begin, countries will need to agree on an agenda by consensus – including an 11th-hour proposal by China to bring trade disputes into the mix.


The Chinese proposal - made on behalf of the fast-developing "BASIC" group of countries including Brazil, India and South Africa - asked for the summit to address "restrictive trade measures" such as the EU's carbon border tariffs going into effect in 2026.


Those concerns have been compounded by Trump's campaign promise to impose 20% tariffs on all foreign goods – and 60% on Chinese goods.


China's request showed it was flexing power following Trump's re-election, which signaled the United States' likely disengagement from global climate cooperation, said Li Shuo, director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.


Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the global treaty to reduce planet-warming emissions.


The European Union, along with current U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, have been pressing China and Gulf oil nations to join the pool of climate finance donor countries.


"If the EU wants to talk about climate finance with China, if it wants to talk NDCs, part of the conversation should be how to resolve our differences on trade and your tariffs," Shuo said.


Extreme pressure


With this year on track to be the hottest on record, experts noted that climate extremes were now challenging rich and poor countries alike – from flooding disasters in Africa, coastal Spain and the U.S. state of North Carolina, to drought gripping South America, Mexico and the U.S. West.


Most countries are not prepared.


"Election results don't alter the laws of physics," said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.


"Unless the world collectively steps up its efforts, the impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe and frequent and will be felt by an increasing number of people in all countries, including in the United States."


Many in Baku were worried that a U.S. disengagement could lead other countries to backpedal on past climate pledges or to scale back future ambitions.

## Trump pressures candidates for Senate Republican leader to fill Cabinet quickly

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote.


Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.


Trump has not endorsed any candidate in the race, but Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader "must agree" to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.


"Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner," Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled "IMMEDIATELY!"


The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president's power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief "pro-forma" sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.


But with Trump's approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, "100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible." And Thune said in a statement that they must "quickly and decisively" act to get nominees in place and that "all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments."


Cornyn said that "It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump 's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent." He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution.


The social media exchange Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term.


Trump's relationship with Congress — especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations — was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections.


Trump also posted Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year — a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold most of the votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that "Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE."


With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux.


Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott — a longtime friend of Trump's and fierce ally — has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump's endorsement.


Senators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and other people who have Trump's ear.


"We have to be the change," Scott said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures." "That's what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change."


All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a "despicable human being" behind closed doors.


As the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump's Cabinet, many of his allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC's "This Week" that there are "a couple of great options on the table." Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS's "Face the Nation" that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas. He said he would advance "the positions that President Trump has articulated."


"I'll do that in whatever role necessary," said Hagerty, who has endorsed Scott in the leadership race.


While Trump has made only one personnel move public so far, naming Susie Wiles his chief of staff, he has already ruled out two names for top positions.


Trump said Saturday that he would not be inviting Mike Pompeo, his former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as his U.N. ambassador and challenged him for the Republican nomination. Pompeo rallied with Trump on the night before Election Day.


"I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country," Trump posted on his network Truth Social.


Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., reposted on X a message by podcaster Dave Smith suggesting to put pressure to "keep all neocons and war hawks out of the Trump administration."


"The 'stop Pompeo' movement is great, but it's not enough," Smith posted on X. "America First: screw the war machine!"

## 1 dead, 16 hurt after shooting at Alabama’s Tuskegee University

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Atlanta, Georgia — A shooting early Sunday that marred homecoming weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama left one person dead and left 16 others injured, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said. One arrest was announced hours later.


The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Jaquez Myrick, 25, of Montgomery, was taken into custody while leaving the scene of the campus shooting and had been found with a handgun with a machine gun conversion device.


The agency's statement said Myrick faces a federal charge of possession of a machine gun. It did not say whether he was a student at the historically Black university, where the shooting erupted in the early hours on Sunday as the school's 100th Homecoming Week was winding down. Authorities said an 18-year-old man who died was not a university student but that some of the injured were students.


It was not immediately known if Myrick had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.


Twelve people were wounded by gunfire, and four others sustained injuries not related to the gunshots, the state agency said earlier. Their conditions were not immediately released.


The FBI joined the investigation and said it is seeking tips from the public, as well as any video witnesses might have. It set up a site online for people to upload video.


Tuskegee University announced that classes Monday have been canceled. Grief counselors will be available to help students in the university's chapel.


The parents of the victim were notified, and several of the injured were being treated at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist South Hospital in Montgomery, the university said in a statement.


An autopsy on the 18-year-old was planned at the state's forensic center in Montgomery, Macon County Coroner Hal Bentley told The Associated Press on Sunday.


Tuskegee city's police chief, Patrick Mardis, said the injured included a female student who was shot in the stomach and a male student who was shot in the arm.


City police were responding to an unrelated double shooting off campus when officers got the call about the university shooting at the West Commons on-campus apartments, Mardis said.


"Some idiots started shooting," Mardis told the news site Al.com. "You couldn't get the emergency vehicles in there, there were so many people there."


A person who answered the phone at the office of Tuskegee's police chief said no other information was available.


"Special Agents are still in the process of gathering and examining information relative to the sequence of events which ultimately led to the shooting," the state law enforcement agency said in a statement.


In his 37 years as coroner, Bentley said he couldn't recall any shootings during the school's past homecoming celebrations. The mood around the small town of around 9,000 people was somber, he said.


The shooting left everyone in the university community shaken, said Amare' Hardee, a senior from Tallahassee, Florida, who is president of the student government association.


"This senseless act of violence has touched each of us, whether directly or indirectly," he said at the school's homecoming convocation Sunday morning.


A pastor who leads the Tuskegee National Alumni Association told those at Sunday's convocation service that the shooting is a reminder of the fragility of life.


"It is in moments like these that we need to be reminded not to stand on our own understanding because in a moment like this, I don't have understanding," said the Rev. James Quincy III.


"I can only rely on my faith, and my prayer for our entire family, this community, as we close out this marvelous family reunion that we shared this week," Quincy said, "and most importantly because of that faith walk and that trust in God, that we have resilience, resilience in the time of trouble."


Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama — the school's opponent for Tuskegee's homecoming football game on Saturday — released a statement expressing sympathy.


"Today, our hearts are with the Tuskegee family as they face the tragic aftermath of the recent shooting on campus," the college said. "We extend our deepest condolences to those impacted and pray for healing and justice. Miles College stands with you in this difficult time."


Sunday's shooting comes just over a year after four people were injured in a shooting at a Tuskegee University student housing complex. In that shooting, two visitors to the campus were shot and two students were hurt while trying to leave the scene of what campus officials described as an "unauthorized party" in September 2023, the Montgomery Advertiser reported.


About 3,000 students are enrolled at the university about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Alabama's capital city of Montgomery.


The university was the first historically Black college to be designated as a Registered National Landmark in 1966. It was also designated a National Historic Site in 1974, according to the school's website.


Norma Clayton, chairwoman of the board of the trustees, said at the Sunday morning service that "we will get through this together because in tough times, tough people band together and they survive."

## Biden to lobby Trump not to walk away from Ukraine

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss top domestic and foreign policy priorities with President-elect Donald Trump when the two meet Wednesday, and will urge him not to abandon Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.


Republican Trump will take office on Jan. 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said.


In an interview on CBS News' "Face the Nation" show, Sullivan said Biden's top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what's happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East.


"The president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand, and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these issues when he takes office," Sullivan said.


While Sullivan did not specify which topics the two would discuss, their conversation will almost certainly feature Ukraine's war with Russia, which Trump has pledged to end swiftly, although he did not say how.


"President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe," Sullivan said.


When asked if that means Biden will ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred.


"I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term," Sullivan said.


Ukraine funding


Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars' worth of U.S. military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February of 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticized and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers.


Sullivan's comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war.


Trump insisted last year that Russian President Vladimir Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the time. He told Reuters Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject, and Biden has never suggested.


Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday he was not aware of any details of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to end the Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail major concessions for Kyiv.


According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take control of the U.S. Senate with a 52-seat majority.


Control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the next Congress is not yet clear with some votes still being counted. Republicans have won 213 seats, according to Edison Research, just shy of the 218 needed for a majority. If Republicans win both chambers, it will mean most of Trump's agenda will have a significantly easier time passing through Congress.


Republican U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state, criticized U.S. funding for Ukraine in a CBS interview.


"The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation," Hagerty said.


The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war.


Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war.


Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies.

## California farmers enjoy pistachio boom, with much of it headed to China

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Lost Hills, California — In a sprawling plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and shipped off to groceries around the world.


Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the United States has surpassed Iran to become the world's top exporter of the nut.


"There has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online," said Zachary Fraser, president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. "You are starting to see the fruit of people's vision from 40 years ago."


California grows more than a third of the country's vegetables and three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the state's sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows.


Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during the Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey roasted.


The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as 40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards.


Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts hauled to a massive processing facility to be prepped for sale.


"There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios," Yraceburu said. "The world wants more."


Pistachios are poised to weather California's dry spells better than its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said.


Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for decades longer, Yraceburu said.


Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out.


Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said.


The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' shift into perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton, according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of California.


Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can't just be swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute's Water Policy Center.


But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don't. They can go longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the critical resource, he said.


When farmers decide what to plant, "I think the biggest thing is the market and where is the market," Franklin said. "And water is right below that."


Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014 state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some rural areas. About a fifth of California's pistachio crop is grown in areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out of production.


But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David Magana, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California.


Pistachios require about 3,700 cubic meters (3 acre-feet) of water per 0.4 hectares (acre) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while fetching a higher price, he said.


"You see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less acreage," Magana said. "I haven't seen pistachio orchards being pulled out."

## New York parks employee dies fighting fires as air quality warnings issued in region

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

POMPTON LAKES, N.J. — A New York parks employee died battling one of a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions that have prompted air quality warnings in both states, authorities said Sunday. 


The worker died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border, according to reports from the Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue and the New York state forestry services. 


“Rip brother your shift is over job well done,” the New York State forestry services post said. 


New York State Police said they were investigating the death amid the fire in Sterling Forest located in Greenwood Lake and identified the victim as Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state Parks and Recreation aide employed by the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department. 


The fires in New York and New Jersey come as firefighters are also battling a wildfire in California. 


The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to 10 square kilometers near the border in Passaic County’s West Milford and Orange County, New York. Officials said Sunday the blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek wildfire, was now threatening 14 Greenwood Lake structures as well as two New Jersey homes and eight buildings in that state's Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. 


Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease. 


New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a 70-hectare fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered. 


Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County. 


Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 142-hectare Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of “incendiary or tracer ammunition” was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday. 


In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves burned more than 81 hectares in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park that comprises about 8.8 square kilometers in the city 16 kilometers north of Boston. 


“This is a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years,” the Lynn Fire Department said in a statement on social media as firefighters continued to battle the blaze, blaming its intensely on low humidity as well as winds and dry leaves on the ground. 


It was one of many brush fires that cropped up across the region. In Foxborough, fire crews said that containing a wildfire at the F. Gilbert Hills State Forest would be a “a multi-day event.” 


Wind gusts topped 64 kph on Saturday, and less-powerful gusts continued Sunday. 


Firefighters and forest agencies warned against outdoor burning. 


The drier-than-normal weather is expected to continue, and virtually all of New England is categorized as being in drought or being abnormally dry. Most of the region was expected to see some light rain Sunday night, but there are no large rainfall events in the forecast, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jerry Combs. 


Firefighters in California were also battling a scattering of blazes over the weekend, including one north of Los Angeles that had burned more than 100 structures. 


Evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings for residents in several areas of Ventura County, where the Mountain Fire held at about 83 square kilometers and was 26% contained, authorities said.

## Donald Trump's US presidential victory was sweeping

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — In the end, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s victory in last week’s 2024 national election for a new four-year presidential term in the White House was sweeping.


Ahead of the Nov. 5 election, national polling showed Vice President Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Trump, maybe a percentage point or two, depending on the survey.




Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Trump, a Republican, were virtually deadlocked, the surveys indicated, in seven political battleground states that election analysts viewed as critical to the election outcome.


Trump, however, captured all seven states, leading to his lopsided edge in the state-by-state vote count in the Electoral College, 312 to 226, which determines the outcome of U.S. presidential elections. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270. He won the seven battleground states by a range of just under 1% in Wisconsin to more than 6% in Arizona.


Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:




On January 20, 2025, the 78-year-old Trump will take office as the country’s 47th president and the first president to win two nonconsecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. He is the oldest elected president in U.S. history.


Trump also won the popular vote, the first Republican candidate to do so since former President George W. Bush in 2004.


While the last ballots are still being counted, Trump already is the clear winner, capturing nearly 75 million votes so far to just under 71 million for Harris, a 50.5% to 47.9% edge for Trump.


Trump’s 2024 vote tally was about the same as the 74 million he received in losing the 2020 election to Democratic President Joe Biden, but the vote for Harris was about 10 million fewer than Biden received.




U.S. pollsters often like to say their surveys are just a snapshot in time, and not necessarily predictive.


But over Trump’s three runs for the presidency since 2016, his level of support has consistently been underestimated in polling, no matter how many times pollsters have tried to adjust their published results to account for a hidden Trump vote from people unwilling to tell even anonymous surveyors that, yes, when they went to polling centers or cast mail-in ballots, he was their choice.


Exit polls showed that women voters favored Harris and men Trump. More educated voters went for Harris, while those without college degrees voted for Trump, but nearly two-thirds of Americans do not have a college degree.




In amassing his majority vote, Trump cut into two traditional Democratic constituencies, Black and Latino voters.


According to The Associated Press’ VoteCast survey of voters, 16% of Black voters supported Trump in 2024, double that from his 2020 campaign. In comparison, 83% of Black voters supported Kamala Harris, down from the 91% who supported Biden in 2020.


Democrats also lost ground among Latino voters, with 56% voting for Harris in 2024 compared to 63% for Biden in 2020. Trump’s support grew from 35% four years ago to 42% this year.

## VOA immigration weekly recap, Nov. 3-9, 2024

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Editor's note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.


What to expect on immigration under a new Trump administration 


President-elect Donald Trump put immigration at the front of his campaign agenda, pledging to bring what he calls “unprecedented order” to the southern border and launch the nation’s largest mass deportation operation of undocumented immigrants on his first day in office. VOA immigration reporter Aline Barros has more.


US judge rules against Biden legalization program for immigrant spouses


A U.S. judge in Texas ruled Thursday against President Joe Biden's program offering a path to citizenship for certain immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens, a blow that could keep the program blocked through Biden's final months in office. U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker found the program exceeded Biden's executive authority. The program offers a path to citizenship to about 500,000 immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally if they are married to U.S. citizens. Reuters reports.


After election, Kenya-born legislator heads to Minnesota Capitol


Huldah Momanyi Hiltsley made history November 5 by becoming the first Kenya-born immigrant elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. She describes her victory as a testament to resilience, determination and the realization of the American dream. Standing in the State Capitol for the first time on the morning of her orientation, Hiltsley told VOA she was overwhelmed with emotions and eager to start her journey as an elected official. Produced by Abdushakur Aboud.


Families separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious minutes


Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in different countries. Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with their loved ones. The Associated Press reports.


Immigration around the world


Migrant caravan of 3,000 heads north in Mexico


A caravan of approximately 3,000 migrants set off Tuesday from southern Mexico, headed toward the United States on the day when U.S. voters were deciding between U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Immigration has been a key issue in the U.S. election campaign. Before heading northward, the migrants gathered in Tapachula, the capital of the southern Chiapas state, carrying banners with messages such as "NO MORE MIGRANT BLOOD" and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe, an important religious and cultural symbol in Mexico, according to witnesses. Reuters reports.


Ukrainian physicians find homes – and jobs – in Latvia



More than 160,000 Ukrainians fled their home country and headed to the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania since the Russian invasion. Physicians were among the 50,000 or so refugees who went to Latvia. Vladislavs Andrejevs spoke with some of them in Riga. Anna Rice narrates his story.


Israel notifies UN it will not cooperate with UN agency for Palestinian refugees 


Near-universal concern and condemnation have followed Israel’s formal announcement to the United Nations that it will not cooperate with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, after Israel’s parliament voted to cut ties last week. In Washington, at the U.N. and on the ground, officials and residents are raising alarms over the disintegrating humanitarian situation in Gaza and elsewhere. VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell reports from Washington.


News brief 


— Former U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer Leonard Darnell George, 42, of San Diego was sentenced in federal court Oct. 25 to 23 years in prison for accepting bribes to allow unauthorized migrants and vehicles containing methamphetamine and other illicit drugs to pass through the border into the U.S.

## 1760 schoolhouse for Black US children holds complicated history of slavery, resilience

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia — A Virginia museum has nearly finished restoring the nation's oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children, where hundreds of mostly enslaved students learned to read through a curriculum that justified slavery. 


The museum, Colonial Williamsburg, also has identified more than 80 children who lined its pinewood benches in the 1760s. 


They include Aberdeen, 5, who was enslaved by a saddle and harness maker. Bristol and George, 7 and 8, were owned by a doctor. Phoebe, 3, was the property of local tavern keepers. 


Another student, Isaac Bee, later emancipated himself. In newspaper ads seeking his capture, his enslaver warned that Bee "can read." 


The museum dedicated the Williamsburg Bray School at a large ceremony on Friday, with plans to open it for public tours this spring. Colonial Williamsburg tells the story of Virginia's colonial capital through interpreters and hundreds of restored buildings. 


'An amazing mirror'


Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch told the crowd outside the refurbished school that it was one of the most important historic moments of the last decade. 


"History is an amazing mirror," Bunch added. "It's a mirror that challenges us and reminds us that, despite what we've achieved, despite all our ideals, America still is a work in progress. But, oh, what an amazing work it is." 


The Cape Cod-style home was built in 1760 and still contains much of its original wood and brick. It will anchor a complicated story about race and education, but also resistance, before the American Revolution. 


The school rationalized slavery within a religious framework and encouraged children to accept their fates as God's plan. And yet, becoming literate also gave them more agency. The students went on to share what they learned with family members and others who were enslaved. 


"We don't shy away from the fact that this was a pro-slavery school," said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William & Mary's Bray School Lab, a partnership between the university and museum. 


But she said the school takes on a different meaning in the 21st century. 


"It's a story of resilience and resistance," Lee said. "And I put the resilience of the Bray School on a continuum that brings us to today." 


To underscore the point, the lab has been seeking descendants of the students, with some success. 




They include Janice Canaday, 67, who also is the museum's African American community engagement manager. Her lineage traces back to the students Elisha and Mary Jones. 


"It grounds you," said Canaday, who grew up feeling little connection to history. "That's where your power is. And those are the things that give you strength — to know what your family has come through." 


Franklin's idea


The Bray School was established in Williamsburg and other colonial cities at the recommendation of founding father Benjamin Franklin. He was a member of a London-based Anglican charity that was named after Thomas Bray, an English clergyman and philanthropist. 


The Bray School was exceptional for its time. White leaders across much of Colonial America forbade educating enslaved people, fearing literacy would encourage them to seek freedom. 


The white teacher at the Williamsburg school, a widow named Ann Wager, taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3 to 10. The school closed with her death in 1774. 


The schoolhouse became a private home before it was incorporated into William & Mary's growing campus. The building was moved and expanded for various purposes, including student housing. 


Historians identified the structure in 2020 through a scientific method that examines tree rings in lumber. Last year, it was transported to Colonial Williamsburg, which includes parts of the original city. 


The museum and university have focused on restoring the schoolhouse, researching its curriculum and finding descendants of former students. 


The lab has been able to link some people to the Jones and Ashby families, two free Black households that had students in the school, said Elizabeth Drembus, the lab's genealogist. 


But the effort has faced steep challenges: Most enslaved people were stripped of their identities and separated from their families, so there are limited records. And only three years of school rosters have survived. 


They 'weren't considered people'


Drembus is talking to people in the region about their family histories and working backward. She also is sifting through 18th-century property records, tax documents and enslavers' diaries. 


"When you're talking about researching formerly enslaved people, records were kept very differently because they weren't considered people," Drembus said. 


Researching the curriculum has been easier. The English charity cataloged the books it sent to the schools, said Katie McKinney, an associate curator of maps and prints at the museum. 


Materials include a small spelling primer, a copy of which was located in Germany, that begins with the alphabet and moves on to syllables, such as "Beg leg meg peg." 


Students also received a more sophisticated speller, bound in sheepskin, as well as the Book of Common Prayer and other Christian texts. 


Meanwhile, the schoolhouse has been mostly restored. About 75% of the original floor has survived, allowing visitors to walk where the children and teacher placed their feet. 


Canaday, whose familial roots include two Bray School students, wondered on a recent visit if any of the children "felt safe in here, whether they felt loved." 


Canaday noted that the teacher, Wager, was the mother of at least two kids. 


"Did some of her mothering bleed over into what she showed those children?" Canaday said. "There are moments when we forget to go by the rules and humanity takes over. I wonder how many times that happened in these spaces."

## With holidays approaching, US stores stock more supersize TV sets

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.


Forget the 165-centimeter TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 2.4 meters diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.


Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.


The 38,100 televisions of at least 246 centimeters sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs — the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 — and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.


"It's really taken off this year," Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.


Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 246 centimeters was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 249-centimeter TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.


Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 949-centimeter Sony for his 1,300-square-meter house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 216-centimeter TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.


"We just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, 'Why not?'" he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. "You get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You're sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene."


The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.


Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.




The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of 5 centimeters in both 2021 and 2022, and 216-centimeter TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 249-centimeter TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 279-292 centimeters are on the market right now, he said.


"You get better resolution over time," Kowalski said. "You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it's easier to produce those sets and improve the technology."


Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as "incredible."


"If you're watching YouTube TV content or ' NFL Sunday Ticket,' you can actually get four screens up, and that's four 48-inch (122-centimeter) screens on it," he said.


Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 249-centimeter lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.


James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.


"It's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience," Fishler said. "They want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. "


Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, its Sam's Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.


TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 254- to 305-centimeter image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.


"A dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors," Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. "But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV."


Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, "It's still a niche business."


"A lot of people just don't have the space to put one of those in," he added.


Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 249-centimeter TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.


But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 249-centimeter TV is actually just 1.8-3.6 meters feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.


If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?


"I think we'll have to wait and see," Fishler said.

## A Texas border county backed Democrats for generations; Trump won it decisively

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas — Jorge Bazán's family has lived on the U.S.-Mexico border for generations and voted for Democrats as long as he can remember.


He broke the family tradition this year and voted for Donald Trump because he doesn't trust the Democratic Party's economic policies.


"I think they forgot about the middle class," said Bazán, who works for the utility company in Rio Grande City, seat of the most Hispanic county in the nation. "People are suffering right now. Everything's very expensive."


The South Texas region — stretching from San Antonio to the Rio Grande Valley — has long been a Democratic stronghold. A slide toward Trump in 2020 rattled Democrats in the predominately Hispanic area, where for decades Republicans seldom bothered to field candidates in local races. However, few Democrats expected the dramatic realignment that happened Tuesday, when Trump flipped several counties along the border including Hidalgo and Cameron, the two most populous counties in the Rio Grande Valley.


In Starr County, where Bazán lives, voters backed a Republican presidential candidate for the first time in a century. The predominantly Hispanic and working-class rural county, with a median household income of $36,000 that's one of the lowest in the nation, gave Trump a 16 percentage-point victory margin over Vice President Kamala Harris. Roughly 2 million residents live at Texas' southernmost point, among vast tracts of farmland and many state and federal agents patrolling the border.


Trump's victories in the Rio Grande Valley starkly showed how working-class voters nationwide are shifting toward Republicans. That includes voters on the Texas border, where many Democrats long argued that Trump's promised crackdowns on immigration would turn off voters.




"I was always a lifelong Democrat, but I decided to change to Republican with the political landscape that it is now," said Luis Meza, a 32-year-old Starr County voter. "I felt that going Republican was the better choice, especially with the issues of immigration and everything like that that's going on."


Meza said that he was against Trump at first but noticed too few changes under President Joe Biden to justify voting for Harris.


Biden won Hidalgo County by less than half the margin that Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Since then, Republicans have invested millions of dollars to persuade Hispanic and working-class voters soured by Democratic policies.


A similar scenario played out in the state's three most competitive races in nearby counties. Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz claimed a decisive victory in the 15th Congressional District. In the two other races, seasoned Democratic incumbents barely held on to their seats.


Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar narrowly escaped defeat against a political newcomer in the most competitive race of his two-decade career. Cuellar, whose district includes Rio Grande City, was indicted this year on bribery and other charges for allegedly accepting $600,000 from companies in Mexico and Azerbaijan. His support for abortion restrictions makes him one of the most conservative Democrats in the House.


Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez also narrowly escaped defeat by an opponent he comfortably beat two years ago.


Nationally, Black and Latino voters appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, according to AP VoteCast data. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris, but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in 2020. Trump's support among those groups appeared to rise slightly compared to 2020.


In McAllen, Texas, Jose Luis Borrego said that inflation and the promise of tougher border restrictions made him vote for a Republican presidential candidate for the first time.


"I wanted to see change and that's why I did vote for Trump. I did vote red. I would not call myself a Republican" Borrego, 37, said. He said that he voted for Hillary Clinton and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in prior elections.


Borrego's whole family voted Trump.


"We just (made) this choice, because we didn't have another choice that we felt comfortable with," he said.


Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he had months of visits to the region during his campaign race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. In a victory speech on Election Day, Cruz said Hispanic voters are leaving the Democratic Party because of immigration.


"They are coming home to conservative values they never left. They understand something the liberal elites never will: There's nothing progressive about open borders," Cruz said. "There is nothing Latino about letting criminals roam free."


Michael Mireles, the director of civil engagement for labor rights group La Unión del Pueblo Entero, believes that Democrats did not engage Hispanic voters enough about the issues that concern them.


"I think that folks on the Democratic side have been really slow to have those conversations with Latino households and families." Mireles said in Hidalgo County after Election Day.


"We can't wait for a big election to have those conversations. By that point, it's too late."

## Florida's iconic Key deer face uncertain future as seas rise

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

BIG PINE KEY, Florida — The world's only Key deer, the smallest subspecies of the white-tailed deer, are found in piney and marshy wetlands bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico on the Florida Keys. For years, their biggest threat was being struck by vehicles speeding along U.S. Highway 1 or local roads.


But those waters surrounding the islands now pose the biggest long-term risk for this herd of about 800 deer as sea rise jeopardizes their sole habitat.


These charismatic diminutive deer have been listed as endangered for almost 60 years after their numbers dipped to about 50 from hunting and poaching long ago. Yet they've made a tremendous comeback, with a peak population of about 1,000 in the mid-2010s before a deadly parasite and Hurricane Irma took a heavy toll.


However, experts and wildlife advocates say this conservation success story today is at risk of being undone by climate change. Sea level rise is already altering the landscape of Big Pine Key and at least 20 smaller islands the deer call home.


The bulk of the deer live on Big Pine Key, a marshy island 48 kilometers from Key West. They roam neighborhoods where about 4,500 people live, browsing on lush gardens and drinking water from buckets residents put out for them as natural freshwater supplies dwindle.


Key deer are far smaller than their North American counterparts, with the biggest bucks standing less than 1 meter tall at the shoulder and weighing around 34 kilograms.


"They were always vulnerable," said Chris Bergh, the South Florida program manager for the Nature Conservancy, who oversees sea level rise projects and lives in Big Pine Key. "They're much more vulnerable now. And with the sea level rising and their habitat shrinking, they're becoming even more so."


Highway deer deaths


On Big Pine Key, mom and pop bars and restaurants dot either side of bustling U.S. 1, along with gas stations and small motels. The main industry revolves around the water — charter boats, fishing, diving, vacation rentals.


To protect the deer from being hit by vehicles, signs tell motorists they're entering deer habitat. A 3.2-kilometer stretch of U.S. 1 is elevated and fenced, allowing deer to cross under the road. And speed limits are strictly enforced, often frustrating tourists driving to Key West.


Deer still are struck at an alarming rate. "The bottom line is that some 90 to 120 deer are known to be killed by vehicles each year," said Jan Svejkovsky, chief scientist for Save Our Key Deer.


Wildlife officials have worked hard get out the message: Don't feed Key deer. They fear deer will approach cars and go near roadways for handouts.


Even with the traffic deaths, the population has remained stable. But a larger threat looms.




Climate change impacts on deer


The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that by 2100, seas will rise 0.5 to 2 meters in parts of the Florida Keys. The threat is greatest to low lying islands like Big Pine Key, where the highest point is only about 2.4 meters above sea level.


Sea rise will continue to shrink freshwater and food sources Key deer need to survive, experts say.


"So as the sea rises, that shrinks the amount of available freshwater, the amount of available, palatable vegetation, the places for bearing their young," said Bergh of the Nature Conservancy. "It puts them increasingly in conflict with people who are also occupying those higher grounds."


In addition to sea rise, climate change brings the threat of stronger hurricanes, with storm surges that can damage deer habitat and freshwater supplies.


Salt water intrusion also is responsible for killing many of the Florida slash pines that gave Big Pine Key its name. Mangroves are growing in their place in an ever-changing environment, choking deer habitat even more.


Shrinking habitat drives deer to neighborhoods


Key deer on Big Pine Key move through neighborhoods, munching on gardens. Some people even have names for ones that frequent their yards.


"They are very gentle, very, very gentle," said Connie Ritchie, who sometimes sees about 30 deer a day. "And the longer you live here, the more you want to protect them. Big time. Protect them because they're so innocent."


"They have certain plants that they really love," Ritchie said, noting that the federal deer refuge here hosts events where it gives away native plants. "So they're trying to teach us to plant the plants that the deer won't eat."


Development on Big Pine Key began in the 1970s and 1980s "when entire swaths of land on islands that still held deer were developed into planned subdivisions, complete with saltwater canal networks to provide lot-buyers with direct water access," said Svejkovsky of Save Our Key Deer.


While the key remains mostly rural with modest Florida bungalows and more palatial places, development has taken away some deer habitat.


"We have lots of people and the wildlife living in the same really concentrated area," said Katy Hosokawa, a park ranger at the National Key Deer Refuge, established in 1957 on 3,457 hectares of Big Pine Key. "So the more houses that we build, or the less lands that we have protected, the less areas that they have that are safe."


The deer have adapted to the humans and move freely between wild spaces and the neighborhoods. "They roam, they spend their day grazing," Hosokawa said. "We don't have a really nutritionally dense soil, so they need to eat a lot of food to get what they need. But trust me, they're very good at it. If it's soft and tender, they will try to eat it."


Future of the deer


The future, while uncertain, looks grim.


Just 15 centimeters of sea rise, expected by 2030, would mean loss of 16% of the freshwater holes on Big Pine Key, said Nova Silvy, professor emeritus with Texas A&M University who has studied Key deer since 1968 and has lived here for several years.


By 2050, sea rise is expected to overtake about 84% of the 805 hectares of the preferred habitat on Big Pine Key — and "the deer will already be gone," Silvy said.


What happens if the deer can't survive in the Keys?


Bergh said he prefers to buy more time to keep the deer viable here. "And at some point, if that's no longer possible, I personally think zoos are the most responsible alternative," he said. "But that's a terrible alternative. Who wants that for a wild animal?"


In rare instances, scientists have been allowed to relocate endangered species threatened by climate change as a last resort. But Silvy said, "The problem is if you take them any other place with deer, they're going to interbreed and then you've lost the Key deer."

## Why AP called Arizona for Trump

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Associated Press declared President-elect Donald Trump the winner in Arizona on Saturday night after vote updates in Maricopa and other counties added to his overall lead, putting the state out of reach for Vice President Kamala Harris.


At the time the AP called the race at 9:21 p.m. ET, Trump led Harris, 52.6% to 46.4%, a margin of about 185,000 votes. Harris needed to win about 7 out of every 10 votes of the roughly 443,000 uncounted ballots remaining, a percentage that has steadily grown as additional votes were counted.


Trump has now swept all seven of the hotly contested presidential battlegrounds, winning 312 electoral votes, compared to 226 for Harris. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270.


In 2020, President Joe Biden carried the state narrowly over Trump, but he won Maricopa County by a margin of 50 percentage points to 48. On Saturday, Trump was leading Harris 52 to 47.


The AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can't close the gap and overtake the vote leader.


Here's a look at how the AP called this race:


Candidates: President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver (Libertarian) vs. Jill Stein (Green).


Winner: Trump.


Poll closing time: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET.


About the race: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state, where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election Day.


Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border.


Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by Republicans, then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate contests and the governorship since 2018.


Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than 70 years.


Both candidates made a play for vote-rich Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe. Trump carried the county by 3 points in 2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%.


Why AP called the race: In statewide elections going back a dozen years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz.


Harris had large leads over Trump in all four counties, but she far underperformed Biden's showing from 2020.


She was trailing Trump in decisive Maricopa County, which Biden won in 2020 and has been a must-win county for statewide Democratic candidates in recent elections.


Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on election night, Trump has consistently led since then.


The AP's analysis of Arizona's voting history and political demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris' favor, they would not be enough to give her the lead.

## Trump completes swing state sweep by taking Arizona

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Donald Trump won the state of Arizona in this week's U.S. presidential election, U.S. TV networks projected on Saturday, completing the Republican's sweep of all seven swing states.


After four days of counting in the southwest state with a large Hispanic population, CNN and NBC projected Trump had obtained its 11 electoral votes as he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris.


Outgoing President Joe Biden scored a narrow but crucial victory in Arizona in 2020 that condemned Trump to defeat after his first term in office.


The scale and strength of Trump's comeback, which also saw the real estate tycoon win the popular vote by a margin of around 4 million votes, has sent shockwaves through the defeated Democratic Party.


The Republicans have already regained control of the Senate and look well set to retain a majority in the House of Representatives thanks to support from white working-class voters and a large share of Hispanics.


CNN has called Republican victories for 213 seats in the House, with 218 needed for a majority in the lower chamber.


The networks' figures show Democrats on 205 seats, although senior party figures are still hoping they can pull off a slim victory that would significantly curtail Trump's powers.


NBC sees the Republicans with 212 seats so far, and 204 for the Democrats.


The other six swing states won by Trump in the presidential race are Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia.


The latest good news for Trump came as the White House said Biden would meet with the president-elect at the White House on Wednesday.


Trump -- who never conceded his 2020 loss -- sealed a remarkable comeback to the presidency in the November 5 vote, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of U.S. politics dominated by his hardline right-wing stance.


This type of meeting between the outgoing and incoming presidents was considered customary, but Trump did not invite Biden for one after making unsubstantiated election fraud claims that culminated in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.


Trump also broke with precedent by skipping Biden's inauguration, but the White House has said the Democratic president will attend the upcoming ceremony.


Biden's meeting with Trump will take place in the Oval Office, the White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the ex-president's return to power.


Trump, the 78-year-old ex-reality TV star, won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a fascist.


Exit polls showed that voters' top concerns remained the economy and inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID pandemic.


The 81-year-old president, who dropped out of the White House race in July over concerns about his age, health and mental acuity, called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on the election win.


Trump 2.0


Democrats have been pointing fingers over who is to blame for Harris' decisive loss after she replaced Biden at the top of the ticket roughly 100 days before the election.


Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took aim at Biden, telling The New York Times that "had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race."


As the Democrats weigh what went wrong, Trump has begun to assemble his second administration by naming campaign manager Susie Wiles to serve as his White House chief of staff.


She is the first woman to be named to the high-profile role and the Republican's first appointment to his incoming administration.


Jockeying for jobs


Trump on Saturday ruled out re-appointing two senior figures from his first administration, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.


Former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is seen as a front-runner for the secretary of state position, as is Florida Senator Marco Rubio who called Trump a "con artist" and the "most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency" in 2016.


The other front-runners for a place in the Trump 2.0 administration reflect the significant changes it is likely to implement.


Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading figure in the anti-vaccine movement for whom Trump has pledged a "big role" in health care, told NBC News on Wednesday that "I'm not going to take away anybody's vaccines."


The world's richest man, Elon Musk, could also be in line for a job auditing government waste after the right-wing SpaceX, Tesla and X boss enthusiastically backed Trump.

## Trump says Haley, Pompeo will not join his administration

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. 


"I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation," Trump posted on social media. "I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our country." 


Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his January 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee. 


Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries.  


Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Trump, has been mentioned in some media reports as a possible defense secretary and also had been seen a potential Republican presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 he would not run. 


Haley and Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. 


During his first term as president, Trump made some key personnel announcements via social media posts. 


Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and former Senator Kelly Loeffler.

## Record 13 women will be governors in US next year

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

The election of Republican Kelly Ayotte as New Hampshire's governor means 13 women will serve as a state's chief executive next year, breaking the record of 12 set after the 2022 elections.


Governors hold powerful sway in American politics, shaping state policy and often using the experience and profile gained to launch campaigns for higher offices.


"It matters to have women in those roles to normalize the image of women in political leadership and even more specifically in executive leadership, where they’re the sole leader, not just a member of a team," said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics.


Governor Gretchen Whitmer was floated as a potential Democratic nominee for president after President Joe Biden exited the race. Republican South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem was thought to be in the running for President-elect Donald Trump's vice presidential post.


Ayotte, a former U.S. senator, defeated the Democratic nominee Joyce Craig, a former mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city.


Still, 18 states have never had a woman in the governor’s office.


"This is another side of political leadership where women continue to be underrepresented," Dittmar said. "Thirteen out of 50 is still underrepresentation."


With two women vying for governor in New Hampshire, a new record for female governors was inevitable. The state has a long history of electing women. As a senator, Ayotte was part of the nation’s first all-female congressional delegation. It was also the first state to have a female governor, state Senate president and House speaker at the same time, and the first to have a female majority in its Senate. Ayotte will be the state's third woman to be governor.


"Being a woman isn’t really that critical to her political persona," Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College, said of Ayotte.


Both Ayotte and Craig said their gender hasn’t come up on the campaign trail although reproductive rights often took front and center.




In her campaign, Craig attacked Ayotte’s record on abortion, and both candidates released TV ads detailing their own miscarriages. Ayotte said she will veto any bill further restricting abortion in New Hampshire where it is illegal after 24 weeks of pregnancy.


When Ayotte is sworn in, five Republican women will serve as governor at the same time, another new high. The other eight are Democrats.


New Hampshire's was one of the few competitive gubernatorial races among the 11 this year. More inroads or setbacks for women’s representation could come in 2026 when 36 states will elect governors.Most voters tend to cast their ballots based on party loyalty and ideology rather than gender, Dittmar said. However, she noted female candidates often face layers of scrutiny that male counterparts largely avoid, with voters judging such things as a woman's intelligence, appearance and even dating history with a sharper lens.


The small gain for women in governor’s offices comes as Vice President Kamala Harris failed in her effort to become the first female president.


"I would not suggest to you that Kamala Harris lost a race because she was a woman, because she was a Black and South Asian woman," Dittmar said. "We would also fail to tell the correct story if we didn’t acknowledge the ways in which both gender and race shapes the campaign overall, and also had a direct effect on how Kamala Harris was evaluated by voters, treated by her opponents and even in the media and other spaces."


Executive roles, especially the presidency with its associations like commander in chief, often carry masculine stereotypes that women must work harder to overcome, Dittmar said.


Experts say women confront these perceptions more acutely in executive races, such as for governor and president, than in state legislatures, where women are making historic strides as leaders, filling roles such as speaker and committee chairs.


"Sexism, racism, misogyny, it’s never the silver bullet. It’s never why one voter acts one way or another," said Erin Vilardi, CEO of Vote Run Lead, a left-leaning group that supports women running for state legislatures. "But we have so much of that built in to how we see a leader."
