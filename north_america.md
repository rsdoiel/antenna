## NYC officials envision turning Fifth Avenue into grand boulevard

date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA

New York — Manhattan’s famed luxury store row Fifth Avenue is in line for a major makeover.


New York City officials unveiled a plan last week to transform a central portion of the thoroughfare between Bryant Park and Central Park into a more pedestrian-centered boulevard.


They propose doubling the size of sidewalks, reducing traffic lanes from five to three, as well as adding seating areas and hundreds of trees and planters, among other improvements.


The vision is to emulate iconic strolling and shopping boulevards such as the Champs-Élysées in Paris.


“As we celebrate the 200th anniversary of one of the most famous streets in the world, New Yorkers can look forward to a brand-new Fifth Avenue that will return the street to its former glory as a pedestrian boulevard,” Madelyn Wils, interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association, which runs the local business improvement district, said in a statement. “Reversing the century-old trend of putting cars first, this visionary design will transform our overcrowded avenue into a spacious and green corridor for shoppers and workers, visitors and New Yorkers, and everyone on Fifth.”


The plan would cost more than $350 million and be paid through a mix of public and private financing, according to Mayor Eric Adams’ administration and the Future of Fifth Partnership.


Officials said the project represents the avenue’s first major redesign and could pay for itself in less than five years through increased property and sales tax revenue.


But some transit advocates have voiced concerns, saying the plan does not give enough consideration to the needs of the public bus system or the city’s many cyclists.


A public meeting will be held later this month on the plan, and construction could begin in 2028.


Officials say Fifth Avenue is roughly 100 feet wide, with just two 23-foot sidewalks, even though pedestrians make up 70% of all traffic on the corridor.


Some 5,500 pedestrians traverse its blocks on average each hour, a number that swells to 23,000 people an hour during the holidays, officials said.


“People across the globe identify Fifth Avenue as a premier destination for strolling and shopping,” Meera Joshi, the city’s deputy mayor for operations, said in a statement. “But its larger-than-life reputation means that its sidewalks have reached their capacity, hosting more people per hour in peak seasons than Madison Square Garden."


The Fifth Avenue plan was among other ambitious plans for roadways city officials revealed [last] week.


They also proposed capping stretches of the Cross Bronx Expressway, a major highway that cuts through the borough of the Bronx.


City officials said the proposals would build parks and greenspaces atop the covered highway, helping restore urban neighborhoods hollowed out by the expansion of the national highway system and the development of suburbs.


“This is a historic opportunity to right the wrongs of the past and reconnect communities once again,” Joshi said.

## Hurricane Oscar makes landfall in the Bahamas and heads toward Cuba

date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA

miami, florida — Hurricane Oscar made landfall early Sunday in the southeastern Bahamas and was heading toward Cuba, an island recently beleaguered by a massive power outage.  


The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm's center arrived on Great Inagua island. It is expected to produce a dangerous storm surge that could produce significant coastal flooding there and in other areas of the southeastern Bahamas. Two to four inches of rainfall are expected, with isolated amounts of up to six inches.  


Forecasters said five to 10 inches of rain, and even isolated amounts of up to 15 inches, are expected across eastern Cuba through Tuesday.  


Oscar formed Saturday off the coast of the Bahamas and brushed past the Turks and Caicos islands to the south.  


The National Hurricane Center earlier characterized the storm as “tiny,” but hurricane warnings were in place Sunday for southeastern Bahamas and portions of Cuba.  


The storm’s maximum sustained winds were clocked at 80 mph (130 kph) with higher gusts. Its center was located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east-northeast of Guantanamo, Cuba. The storm was heading west at 12 mph (19 kph) and was expected to reach Guantanamo or Holguin, Cuba, on Sunday afternoon at hurricane strength.  


The hurricane's approach comes as Cuba tries to recover from its worst blackout in at least two years, which left millions without power for two days last week. Some electrical service was restored Saturday.  


Philippe Papin of the National Hurricane Center said it was somewhat unexpected that Oscar became a hurricane Saturday.  


“Unfortunately the system kind of snuck up a little bit on us,” Papin said.  


Hours earlier Tropical Storm Nadine formed off Mexico’s southern Caribbean coast. It degenerated into a tropical depression as it moved over land.

## Whooping cough is at a decade-high level in US

date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA

MILWAUKEE — Whooping cough is at its highest level in a decade for this time of year, U.S. health officials reported Thursday.


There have been 18,506 cases of whooping cough reported so far, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. That's the most at this point in the year since 2014, when cases topped 21,800.


The increase is not unexpected — whooping cough peaks every three to five years, health experts said. And the numbers indicate a return to levels before the coronavirus pandemic, when whooping cough and other contagious illnesses plummeted.


Still, the tally has some state health officials concerned, including those in Wisconsin, where there have been about 1,000 cases so far this year, compared to a total of 51 last year.


Nationwide, CDC has reported that kindergarten vaccination rates dipped last year and vaccine exemptions are at an all-time high. Thursday, it released state figures, showing that about 86% of kindergartners in Wisconsin got the whooping cough vaccine, compared to more than 92% nationally.


Whooping cough, also called pertussis, usually starts out like a cold, with a runny nose and other common symptoms, before turning into a prolonged cough. It is treated with antibiotics. Whooping cough used to be very common until a vaccine was introduced in the 1950s, which is now part of routine childhood vaccinations. It is in a shot along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. The combo shot is recommended for adults every 10 years.


"They used to call it the 100-day cough because it literally lasts for 100 days," said Joyce Knestrick, a family nurse practitioner in Wheeling, West Virginia.


Whooping cough is usually seen mostly in infants and young children, who can develop serious complications. That's why the vaccine is recommended during pregnancy, to pass along protection to the newborn, and for those who spend a lot of time with infants.


But public health workers say outbreaks this year are hitting older kids and teens. In Pennsylvania, most outbreaks have been in middle school, high school and college settings, an official said. Nearly all the cases in Douglas County, Nebraska, are schoolkids and teens, said Justin Frederick, deputy director of the health department.


That includes his own teenage daughter.


"It's a horrible disease. She still wakes up — after being treated with her antibiotics — in a panic because she's coughing so much she can't breathe," he said.


It's important to get tested and treated with antibiotics early, said Dr. Kris Bryant, who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases at Norton Children's in Louisville, Kentucky. People exposed to the bacteria can also take antibiotics to stop the spread.


"Pertussis is worth preventing," Bryant said. "The good news is that we have safe and effective vaccines."

## Many schools are still closed weeks after Hurricane Helene

date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA

Tens of thousands of students in the Southeast are dealing with school disruptions after Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc so severe — on homes, campuses and municipal power and water systems — that some districts have no idea when they will reopen.


While virtual learning helped during the COVID-19 school closures, that has not been an option for this crisis because internet and cellphone service has remained spotty since the storm struck in late September.


In hard-hit western North Carolina, some districts warn students will miss up to a month of school, and others say they can't yet determine a timeline for returning to classrooms.


"I feel like a month is a lot, but it's not something that can't be overcome," said Marissa Coleman, who has sent her four children to stay with grandparents in Texas because their home in North Carolina's Buncombe County has no running water. "But if we get further into Thanksgiving and Christmas, it's like, how are they actually going to make this up?"


In mountainous Buncombe County, Helene swept away homes, cut power and destroyed crucial parts of the water system for Asheville, a city of about 94,000 people. The storm decimated remote towns and killed at least 246 people throughout the Appalachians, where massive cleanup efforts have been complicated by washed-out bridges and roads. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005.


The Buncombe County School system, which serves over 22,000 students, told families Tuesday on the district's Facebook page no decision has been made "with regards to start date or length of day" because of a need to repair buildings, restore phone and security systems and redraw bus routes.


Even when schools reopen, educators worry the disruption could have profound effects on students' learning and emotional well-being.


Children who experience natural disasters are more prone to acute illness and symptoms of depression and anxiety, research shows. The physical and mental health impacts put them at greater risk of learning loss: Absences can undermine achievement, as can the effects of trauma on brain function.




The challenges come amid growing concerns about the impacts of climate change on students. Wildfires have swept through communities, displacing families. Many school systems with inadequate heating or air conditioning have closed during extreme weather or forced students and educators to endure sweltering or frigid temperatures. According to the World Bank, 400 million children lost school days because of "climate-related closures" in 2022.


Days after Helene made landfall, Hurricane Milton roared ashore last week farther south along the same Florida coast as a Category 3 storm. While about half the state's districts were closed, all of them were planning to reopen by the end of this week.


Schools affected by Helene are trying to provide stability. The Buncombe district has suggested parents trade books with neighbors and friends for their kids. "Have them write, maybe about something they're looking forward to when school starts again," the district told parents on social media. "Turn everyday experiences into math problems."


Cécile Wight, a mother of two in Asheville, said she has been grateful for concern shown by schools including surveys checking on families' well-being and an elementary school bus driver who took his own car to visit each child on his route.


"That has been huge, just having the emotional support from the school system and from the people we know at the school," she said.


But uncertainty remains. Wight said her family is able to stay at their home because they have well water, but many other families have yet to return since evacuating. Most of Buncombe's 45 schools still lacked running water as of Tuesday, meaning they're unable to meet basic safety and hygiene standards.


Schools have begun exploring whether it would be possible to open without running water, relying on portable bathroom trailers. In a letter to families, Asheville Superintendent Maggie Furman said the district is considering drilling wells at each school so they don't have to rely on city water.


Coleman said her kids are eager for some kind of normalcy.


"I understand the schools are going to have to take some time to find a way to open safely, and I support that 100%. But I definitely am not in the camp of 'We need to wait until we get water back, until everything's normal again to open.' I just think that's going to be too long," Coleman said.


The Tennessee Department of Education is still trying to determine how many schools remain closed since Hurricane Helene and how many took too much damage to reopen.


Echoing the COVID-19 pandemic, several schools in Tennessee have postponed traditions like homecoming games, parades and dances. Many colleges are also granting extensions on application deadlines, officials say, to reduce high school seniors' stress.


In storm-drenched areas elsewhere, some early education providers may never reopen.


Private child care and preschool centers are particularly vulnerable in the aftermath of a natural disaster, said Militza Mezquita, senior adviser for education in emergencies at Save the Children. Many already operate on thin margins, meaning a temporary closure can easily turn permanent. As for-profit companies, they are also ineligible for many types of disaster aid. A natural disaster can wipe out 10% to 20% of providers, Mezquita said.


"Child care recovery is very critical to the whole recovery ecosystem," Mezquita said, noting the people essential to recovery — road workers, cleanup crews, doctors and nurses — often have young children that need to be looked after. "If they are not able to adequately get their children in care, they can't go to work."


Despite the instability, educators like Heather Smith, who was named North Carolina's Teacher of the Year in the spring, encourage families to see the lessons storms can provide. Smith brought along her two children, ages 8 and 4, to serve meals at her church.


"Our kids are learning so much every day, whether it's about adversity, whether it's about helping a community," said Smith, who rode out the storm at her home in Waynesville.


Similarly, Wight has been taking her children to volunteer for relief efforts at a school. She said it has helped them feel active and involved in the community.


"If COVID taught us something, it's that we can make things work. The kids are resilient," Wight said. "They will eventually catch up on the academic side of things."

## Cher, Mary J. Blige, Ozzy Osbourne among Rock Hall of Fame inductees

date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Cher, Mary J. Blige and Ozzy Osbourne were among this year's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, an elite group formally introduced into the music pantheon Saturday at a star-studded concert gala.


Kool & the Gang, Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner, A Tribe Called Quest, and Peter Frampton round out the 2024 class of honorees, artists honored at the ceremony held in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the prestigious hall.


Big Mama Thornton, Alexis Korner and John Mayall received special honors for "musical influence," as Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick and Norman Whitfield received awards for "musical excellence."


Suzanne de Passe, a trailblazer for women executives in the music business, who was big in Motown, won the night's award for nonperforming industry professionals.


Dua Lipa kicked off the evening with a performance of Believe, with Cher joining the pop star onstage to finish her 1998 smash hit, which was credited as the first song to use auto-tune technology as an instrument.


"I changed the sound of music forever," she said in her acceptance speech, less than a year after railing against the hall for not having yet added her to the ballot.


"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was getting in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame," she quipped Saturday night.


Performers included Kelly Clarkson, Sammy Hagar, Slash and Demi Lovato, who all appeared for Foreigner.


A group of artists including Queen Latifah, De La Soul and Busta Rhymes also performed with the surviving members of the eclectic, pioneering hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest -- Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White.

## US probes unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel attack plans

date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel's plans to attack Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate.


The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on October 1. They were sharable within the "Five Eyes," which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.


The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted to the Telegram messaging app and first reported by CNN and Axios. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.


The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained — including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S. intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, one of the officials said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the official said.


The U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a cease-fire in Gaza, and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel's leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran's missile attack go unanswered.


Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others.


In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the documents but did not have further comment.


The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters.


The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the leak of the two documents.


The documents first appeared online Friday via a channel on Telegram, claiming they had been leaked by someone in the U.S. intelligence community, then later the U.S. Defense Department. The information appeared entirely gathered through the use of satellite image analysis.


One of the two documents resembled the style of other material from the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency leaked by Jack Teixeira, an Air National Guardsman who pleaded guilty in March to leaking highly classified military documents about Russia's war on Ukraine and other national security secrets.


The Telegram channel involved in the leak identifies itself as being based in Tehran, Iran's capital. It previously published memes featuring Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and material in support of Tehran's self-described "Axis of Resistance," which includes Middle East militant groups armed by the Islamic Republic.

## 7 dead after ferry dock gangway collapses on Georgia's Sapelo Island

date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA

SAVANNAH, Georgia — At least seven people were killed Saturday after part of a ferry dock collapsed on Georgia's Sapelo Island, authorities said.


Multiple people were taken to hospitals, and crews from the U.S. Coast Guard, the McIntosh County Fire Department, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and others were searching the water, according to spokesperson Tyler Jones of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, which operates the dock.


Jones said a gangway at the dock collapsed and sent people plunging into the water. It happened as crowds gathered on the island for a celebration of its tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants.


"There have been seven fatalities confirmed," Jones said. "There have been multiple people transported to area hospitals, and we are continuing to search the water for individuals."


Jones said he did not know what caused the gangway to collapse, but officials believe there were at least 20 people on it at the time. The gangway connected an outer dock where people board the ferry to another dock onshore.


Among the dead was a chaplain for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Jones said.


Sapelo Island is about 97 kilometers south of Savannah and is reachable from the mainland by boat.


Cultural Day is an annual fall event spotlighting the island’s tiny community of Hogg Hummock, which is home to a few dozen Black residents. The community of dirt roads and modest homes was founded by former slaves from the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding.


Small communities descended from enslaved island populations in the South — known as Gullah, or Geechee in Georgia — are scattered along the coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say their separation from the mainland caused residents to retain much of their African heritage, from their unique dialect to skills and crafts such as cast-net fishing and weaving baskets.

## USPS mail carriers reach tentative contract for raises, trucks that stay cool

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

Some 200,000 mail carriers have reached a tentative contract deal with the U.S. Postal Service that includes backdated pay raises and a promise to provide workers with air-conditioned trucks. 


The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified by union members, runs through November 2026. Letter deliverers have been working without a contract since May 2023. 


Both the union and the Postal Service welcomed the agreement, which was announced Friday. 


"Both sides didn't get everything they wanted. But by bargaining in good faith, we ended with an agreement that meets our goals and rewards our members," Brian Renfroe, the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, told The Associated Press. "To make that happen, the Postal Service had to recognize the contributions of members to the Postal Service and the American people." 


Among other improvements, the deal increases the top pay and reduces the amount of time it takes new workers to reach that level, Renfroe said. He credited Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and his deputy for bargaining in good faith throughout the arduous process. 


The Postal Service said the agreement supported its 10-year 'Delivering for America' mission to modernize operations and adapt to changing customer needs. 


"This is a fair and responsible agreement that serves the best interest of our employees, our customers and the future of the Postal Service," said Doug Tulino, the deputy postmaster general and chief human resources officer. 


As part of the agreement, all city carriers will get three annual pay increases of 1.3% each by 2025, some of which will be paid retroactively from November 2023. Workers will also receive retroactive and future cost-of-living


There is also a commitment from the Postal Service to "make every effort" to provide mail trucks with air-conditioning. 


The Postal Service in summer began rolling out its new electric delivery vehicles, which come equipped with air-conditioning. While the trucks won't win any beauty contests, they did get rave reviews from letter carriers accustomed to older vehicles that lack modern safety features and are prone to breaking down — and even catching fire. 


Within a few years, the new delivery fleet will have expanded to 60,000, most of them electric models, serving as the Postal Service's primary delivery truck from Maine to Hawaii. 


Under the tentative contract agreement, the Postal Service must discuss with the union any plans to buy new mail trucks that don't have air-conditioning. 


This is the second contract negotiated since DeJoy was appointed postmaster general in 2020. It is expected to take several weeks for union members to ratify the contract. Rural mail deliverers aren't covered by the contract because they are represented by a different union.

## Last US in-person vote will be cast in Alaska's Aleutian Islands

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — On a desolate slab of island tundra in western Alaska, a resident of Adak will again become the last American to cast an in-person ballot for president, continuing a 12-year tradition for the nation’s westernmost community.


The honor of having the last voter in the nation fell to Adak when they did away with absentee-only voting for the 2012 election and added in-person voting.


“People have a little bit of fun on that day because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election’s decided way before we’re closed,” said city manager Layton Lockett. “But, you know, it’s still fun.”


When polls close in Adak, it will be 1 a.m. on the East Coast.




Adak Island, midway in the Aleutian Island chain and bordered by the Bering Sea to the north and the North Pacific Ocean to the south, is closer to Russia than mainland Alaska. The island best known as a former World War II military base and later naval station is 1,931 kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of Anchorage and farther west than Hawaii, where polls close an hour earlier.


Mary Nelson said Republican Mitt Romney was likely conceding the 2012 race to President Barack Obama on election night when she became Adak’s first last voter in a presidential election, although she didn’t know Obama had been reelected until the next morning when she turned on her computer to read election results.


Nelson, who now lives in Washington state, recalled to The Associated Press by telephone that she was a poll worker in Adak at the time and had forgotten to vote until just before the 8 p.m. poll closing time.


“When I opened the [voting booth's] curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture and announced that I was the last person in Adak to vote,” she said.


That was also the end of the celebration since they still had work to do.


“We had votes to count, and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,” she said.




There are U.S. territories farther west than Alaska, but there’s no process in the Electoral College to allow residents in Guam, the northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands to vote for president, according to the National Archives.


“I’ve been tickled pink and told people about it,” said Nelson, now 73. “I have the story I printed out about it and show some people who I think would think it’s a big deal, like my family,” she said.


Adak Island has historical significance for its role in World War II. The U.S. built facilities on the island after Japanese forces took islands farther west in the Aleutian chain.


Troops landed in August 1942, to begin building an Army base, and enemy planes dropped nine bombs on the island two months later, but in undeveloped areas, and riddled the landscape with machine gun fire. The Navy began building facilities in January 1943.


In May 1943, about 27,000 combat troops gathered on Adak as a staging point to retake nearby Attu Island from the Japanese.


Among famous Americans stationed at Adak were writers Dashiell Hammett and Gore Vidal. The island also played host to President Franklin Roosevelt, boxing champion Joe Lewis and several Hollywood stars, according to the Adak Historical Society.


In a lighter note, the Army attempted to start a forest on Adak Island between 1943 and 1945. A sign placed by residents in the 1960s outside the area of 33 trees noted: “You are now Entering and Leaving the Adak National Forest.”


After the war, the island was transferred to the Air Force and then the Navy in 1950. Nearly 32,000 hectares (80,000 acres) of the 73,000-hectare (180,000-acre) island were set aside for Navy use, and the rest of the island remained part of what eventually became the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.


The base closed in 1997. The Navy retains about 2,300 hectares (5,600 acres) with the remainder either owned by the Aleut Corporation, the Alaska Native regional corporation for the area; the city of Adak; or the refuge.


Lockett said the city is facing tough times with a dwindling population and lack of an economic driver. The town’s fish processing plant has closed numerous times over the years.


When the base was active, there were about 6,000 residents on Adak Island. The 2020 Census counted 171 residents. Lockett says that’s probably now down to below 50 full-time residents.


In Alaska, a school must have 10 students to remain open. Mike Hanley, the Aleutian Region School District superintendent, said in an email that the school closed in 2023 after it started the year with six students. That shrank to one by November, and then that student left.


Hanley said by the time he notified the state education department, “there were literally no children on the island, not even younger pre-K students.”


When it comes to politics, Lockett said it’s pretty easy in a small town to know where your neighbors fall politically, but there seems to be one goal that unites everyone.


Whoever is in office, are they going to try to “encourage the military to come back to Adak in some way, shape or form?” he said.


“We’re kind of in that great midst of, what’s next for Adak, because we’re struggling,” he said.


For now, with the presidential election coming up, the city can focus on its unique place in America.


“I’m not sure who the last voter will be this year,” said Adak City Clerk Jana Lekanoff. “Maybe it’ll be a bit of a competition?”

## Judges punishing Jan. 6 rioters fear more political violence as election nears

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Over the past four years, judges at Washington’s federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.


Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month’s election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's January 6, 2021, riot.


“That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,” Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. “He’s riling up the troops again, so if he doesn’t get what he wants, it’s not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse."


'It scares me'


Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one that injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.


“It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,” Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.




Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a “call to battle was announced” and that he had “answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.”


“It doesn’t take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,” Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.


Trump’s distortion of the January 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Biden's 2020 victory.


'Patriots' and 'hostages'


Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls “patriots” and “hostages," if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it’s “free and fair,” casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.




Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on January 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.


“We’re in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,” Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.


“I’ve got a young daughter, I’ve got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me," he said. "But I don’t know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.”


More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the January 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation’s history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.


Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.


“With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously," prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.


'I'd do it all over again'


Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on January 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.


The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, “I’ll go again given the opportunity.”


A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, “You can give me 100 years, and I’d do it all over again.” A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would "do it again tomorrow.”




A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the “J6 praying grandma” avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on January 6.


“And she has all but promised to do it all over again,” said prosecutor Terence Parker.


Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a “media blitz” to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes January 6 “was a good day for this country,” Parker said.


Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to “lower the volume” before the next election.


“These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they’re not going to help you,” Faruqui told her.

## Boeing makes new offer to union in hopes of ending strike

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

Boeing and the union representing striking machinists have negotiated a new contract proposal that would provide bigger pay raises and bonuses in a bid to end a costly walkout that has crippled production of airplanes for more than a month.


The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said early Saturday that it plans to hold a ratification vote Wednesday.


The union said the deal would increase pay by 35% over four years, up from 30% that was offered last month. It also boosts upfront bonuses to $7,000 per worker instead of $6,000.


The new offer would not restore a traditional pension plan — a key demand of the 33,000 striking workers — but it would increase the amount of contributions to 401(k) retirement plans that Boeing would match, the union said.


“We look forward to our employees voting on the negotiated proposal," Boeing said in a statement.


About 33,000 members of IAM District 751 began a strike on September 14. The strike has halted production of Boeing 737s, including the 737 Max, and 767s and 777s. Boeing is continuing to build 787 Dreamliners at a nonunion plant in South Carolina.


The strike has led new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg to announce about 17,000 layoffs and take early steps toward raising up to $25 billion from new stock or debt to bolster the company's finances.

## Southeast Asia bears brunt of US trade curbs on Uyghur forced labor

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

BANGKOK — Southeast Asia is bearing the mounting brunt of U.S. trade curbs aimed at stemming the forced labor of ethnic minority Uyghurs in China, with billions of dollars in blocked exports, the latest U.S. trade figures show.


Economists and human rights experts ascribe the heavy hit the region is taking to global supply chains shifting to reroute exports from China through Southeast Asia and to China’s persistent dominance in key commodities.


With both powerful forces at play, Southeast Asia is “caught in the middle,” Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told VOA.


The United States has detained $3.56 billion worth of imports in all since its Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, or UFLPA, took effect in mid-2022, according to recent figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Some 86% of those, more than $3 billion worth, arrived from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Only $395 million arrived directly from China.


The act forbids imports of any products made in whole or in part in China’s Xinjiang autonomous region, the Uyghurs’ historic homeland, presuming they have been made with forced labor. While many of the shipments are eventually allowed to enter the United States, the burden is on the importer to secure their release by proving the products are produced without forced labor, a process that can take months.




The United States and other governments have accused China of genocide over its treatment of the mostly Muslim Uyghurs for subjecting them to not only forced labor but mass surveillance and detention, religious persecution and forced sterilization — all denied by Beijing.


Xinjiang is a major source of some commodities crucial to the global supply chain, including 12% of the world’s aluminum, more than a third of the polysilicon for solar panels and 90% of the cotton produced by China, according to the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region, a global network of rights groups.


Many of those supply chains now flow through Southeast Asia for reasons beyond just the UFLPA, said Nick Marro, principal Asia economist and global trade lead analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit.


“For years, multinational companies — both Chinese and non-Chinese owned — have been pouring investment into Southeast Asia to construct supply chains aimed at dodging U.S. tariffs,” he told VOA.


While far from the only reason for the influx, he said, “shifting some production chains to Vietnam or Thailand, for example, can obfuscate whether a good might originally be produced in China.”


“This isn't necessarily a fool-proof strategy,” Marro said. “U.S. trade authorities are very sensitive to illegal transshipments and other efforts aimed at circumventing U.S. duties. But for some supply chains, cracking down on these activities can be challenging — especially for products like cotton, which is notoriously difficult to trace.”


Evolving supply chains now require looking beyond exports arriving directly from China to catch what’s made there, said Menon, a former lead economist for trade with the Asian Development Bank.


“Increasingly there’s production and value addition in multiple countries,” he said. “Simply looking at goods that emanate from Xinjiang to the U.S. will not capture the intended objective.”


Of the slightly more than $3 billion worth of exports the United States has detained from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam because of the UFLPA, the vast majority, $2.96 billion, have been electronics, including solar panels.


Louisa Greve, global advocacy director for the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, ascribes that to the surge of investment from Chinese solar panel makers into Southeast Asia starting more than a decade ago.


“We don’t know of any Uyghurs working in Southeast Asia in solar, but we do know where the polysilicon has to come from. That’s the issue,” she told VOA. “It’s about the components.”


Greve added that the Southeast Asian countries and companies involved in importing and incorporating that polysilicon into the solar panels they help make and export also risk being complicit in the state-sponsored forced labor that goes into producing it in China.


“Thirty-five percent of the world’s polysilicon, or solar-grade polysilicon, is coming from China. It’s up to every manufacturer, like the plants that are actually making solar panels in Southeast Asia … to say, ‘We have to be responsible for the raw materials that we’re using,’” she said.


Menon asserted the UFLPA could benefit low-wage countries less tainted by forced labor than China by driving more business their way, but he said that Southeast Asia will still struggle to wean itself off Chinese supplies.


“China is still the hub or the center of ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] supply chains. That hasn’t changed. There’s been some reconfiguration taking place, but by and large, China’s not going away,” he said.




Menon said that “blunt” trade tools like the act can also hurt the countries in the middle of those supply chains by driving existing production and investment away, leaving local workers with less work or fewer jobs.


“This [act] is quite a big move, quite a massive measure, and so I’d be surprised if it doesn’t have some impact in moving production around,” he said. “If you ban imports in this way, inevitably there will be some shifts that move production in a way that tries to circumvent those bans.”


Marro said the same pressures that drove companies to “de-risk” by moving production from China to Southeast Asia years ago could yet prove a “double-edged sword.” While the shift has boosted Southeast Asia’s economies, the costs may mount as the United States and others start taking a harder look at countries helping China evade their trade curbs.


Even with only 11 months of the 2024 fiscal year reported, U.S. customs figures show the UFLPA blocked more imports from Southeast Asia over the past year than the year before.


Marro said enforcement efforts were at a “very real risk” of picking up but added that geopolitics could also intervene.


“As much as U.S. officials want to crack down on Chinese tariff circumvention, there's an equal effort to avoid isolating Southeast Asia when it comes to the U.S.'s increasingly hawkish strategy towards China,” he said. “This balancing act will characterize the future of U.S. policy to the region.”

## Florida digs out of mountains of sand swept in by back-to-back hurricanes

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

BRADENTON BEACH, Florida — When a hurricane sets its sights on Florida, storm-weary residents may think of catastrophic wind, hammering rain and dangerous storm surge. Mounds of sand swallowing their homes? Not so much.


That's the reality for some after Hurricanes Helene and Milton clobbered Florida's Gulf Coast with back-to-back hits in less than two weeks. Storm surge as high as 3 meters swept mountains of sand into communities — in some areas, 1.5 meters high or higher.


The fine, white sand helps make Florida's beaches among the best in the world. But the powerful storms have turned the precious commodity into a costly nuisance, with sand creating literal barriers to recovery as homeowners and municipalities dig their way out.


"I've never seen sand like this," said Scott Bennett, a contractor who has worked in storm recovery since 2005's Hurricane Katrina. "Wind, rain, water, but never sand."


The morning after Hurricane Milton crashed ashore, the roads of Bradenton Beach, about an hour's drive south of Tampa, were lined with sandbanks less than a meter high, surrounding some bungalows. The views of the Old Florida beach town were not unlike those after a blustery Midwestern blizzard.


"The best way to describe it, it's like getting 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) of snow up north," said Jeremi Roberts, a member of the State Emergency Response Team surveying the damage that day.


Another hour south, Ron and Jean Dyer said the storms blew about 0.9 meters of sand up against their condo building on Venice Island.


"The beach just moved over everything," Ron Dyer said.


It had taken dozens of volunteers armed with shovels and wheelbarrows two days to dig all the sand out of the condo's pool after Hurricane Helene, only to see Milton fill it back in, he said.




"They just kept digging and wheeling and digging and wheeling. … They were there for two days doing that," he said. "We got to do it all over again."


Storm recovery contractor Larry West estimates that his team will do about $300,000 worth of work just to clean up all the sand and debris left behind at one of the condo buildings he's restoring in Manasota Key, about 56 kilometers south of Sarasota. He expects many property owners, especially those who don't have flood insurance, will have to pay out of pocket for this kind of cleanup.


"The poor homeowner who's going to have to spend $150,000 cleaning up, that's going to hurt them hard," West said.


West said he is not sure where to take the sand, after he heard that a local park that Charlotte County officials designated as a drop-off site was filling up with the stuff. According to the county, two sites remain open for dropping off sand.


"Right now I'm building mountains in their parking area," West said of the condo complex he's restoring. "We're just kind of waiting to find out if they're gonna have us transport it to a different location."




Officials in hard-hit Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg, are still crunching the numbers on just how big of a bite Helene and Milton took out of the coastline there, but county Public Works director Kelli Hammer Levy puts the current estimate at 765,000 cubic meters of sand lost.


"A lot of volume has been lost, and that's our main concern here right now," she told the county's Tourism Development Council. "It's hard to kind of stay positive with some of this stuff. I know the pictures are not what we want to see."


For perspective, a 2018 beach renourishment project to shore up the county's coastline with 994,000 cubic meters of sand cost more than $50 million, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.


Levy is hopeful that much of the displaced sand can be repurposed. Pinellas officials are encouraging residents to cart their sand right back out onto the beach — as long as it's clean.


"Again, we just need to remove debris. I've seen some piles out there with kitchen cabinets in it," Levy said. "We're going to have a problem if we have a lot of that stuff out there."


The county has also opened a drop-off location where residents can leave sand for workers to screen and clean, or dispose of if it's contaminated, under guidance from the state's Department of Environmental Protection.


In the meantime, Florida residents are continuing to dig out of the storm-driven sand, many of them by hand.


"Every shovelful is heavy," said West, the construction contractor. "This is horrendous, as far as the cleanup."

## Rare copy of US Constitution sells for $9M at auction

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

Asheville, north carolina — A rare copy of the U.S. Constitution printed 237 years ago and sent to the states to be ratified has been sold for $9 million at an auction in North Carolina. 


Brunk Auctions sold the document, the only copy of its type thought to be privately owned, at the private auction Thursday. The name of the buyer was not immediately released. 


Bidding took just over seven minutes, with bids coming in at $500,000 intervals, mostly over the phone. There was a pause at $8.5 million, then another after someone on the phone bid $9 million. 


"Just another second or two. Savor it a little bit, selling here at $9 million," said auctioneer and auction house owner Andrew Brunk. 


Brunk was thankful. The auction was originally set for September 28 but was delayed after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage throughout Asheville and western North Carolina. 


"It's a privilege to have it here. It's been quite a ride," Brunk said. 




The copy was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished drafting the proposed framework of the nation's government in 1787 and sent it to the Congress of the ineffective first American government under the Articles of Confederation, requesting it be sent to the states to be ratified by the people. 


It's one of about 100 copies printed by the secretary of that Congress, Charles Thomson. Just eight are known to still exist and the other seven are publicly owned. 


Thomson likely signed two copies for each of the original 13 states, essentially certifying them. 


What happened to the document up for auction Thursday between Thomson's signature and 2022 is not known. 


Two years ago, a property was being cleared out in Edenton in eastern North Carolina that was once owned by Samuel Johnston. He was the governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789 and oversaw the state convention during his last year in office that ratified the Constitution. 


The copy was found inside a squat, two-drawer metal filing cabinet with a can of stain on top, in a long-neglected room piled high with old chairs and a dusty book case, before the old Johnston house was preserved. The document was a broad sheet that could be folded one time like a book. 


Along with the Constitution on the broad sheet, printed front and back, is a letter from George Washington asking for ratification. He acknowledged there would have to be compromise and that certain rights the states enjoyed would have to be given up for the nation's long-term health. 


The Constitution copy wasn't the only seven-figure purchase Thursday. A watermarked 1776 first draft of the Articles of Confederation went for $1 million. 


Also sold was a 1788 Journal of the Convention of North Carolina at Hillsborough, where representatives spent two weeks debating whether ratifying the Constitution would put too much power with the federal government instead of the states. The document sold for $85,000.


Auction officials were not sure what the Constitution document would go for because there is so little to compare it to. The last time a copy of the Constitution that was sent to the states sold, it was for $400 in 1891. 


In 2021, Sotheby's of New York sold one of only 14 remaining copies of the Constitution printed for the Continental Congress and delegates to the Constitutional Convention for $43.2 million, a record for a book or document.

## Dense breasts can make it harder to spot cancer on a mammogram

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

When a woman has a mammogram, the most important finding is whether there's any sign of breast cancer.


The second most important finding is whether her breasts are dense.


Since early September, a new U.S. rule requires mammography centers to inform women about their breast density — information that isn't entirely new for some women because many states already had similar requirements.


Here's what to know about why breast density is important.


Are dense breasts bad?


No, dense breasts are not bad. In fact, they're quite normal. About 40% of women ages 40 and older have dense breasts.


Women of all sizes can have dense breasts. It has nothing to do with breast firmness. And it only matters in the world of breast cancer screening, said Dr. Ethan Cohen of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.


With the new rule, "there are going to be a lot of questions to a lot of doctors and there's going to be a lot of Googling, which is OK. But we want to make sure that people don't panic," Cohen said.


How is breast density determined?


Doctors who review mammograms have a system for classifying breast density.


There are four categories. The least dense category means the breasts are almost all fatty tissue. The most dense category means the breasts are mostly glandular and fibrous tissue.


Breasts are considered dense in two of the four categories: "heterogeneously dense" or "extremely dense." The other two categories are considered not dense.


Dr. Brian Dontchos of the Seattle-based Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center said the classification can vary depending on the doctor reading the mammogram "because it's somewhat subjective."


Why am I being told I have dense breasts?


Two reasons: For one, dense breasts make it more difficult to see cancer on an X-ray image, which is what a mammogram is.


"The dense tissue looks white on a mammogram and cancer also looks white on a mammogram," said Dr. Wendie Berg of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief scientific adviser to DenseBreast-info.org. "It's like trying to see a snowball in a blizzard."


Second, women with dense breast tissue are at a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer because cancers are more likely to arise in glandular and fibrous tissue.


Reassuringly, women with dense breasts are no more likely to die from breast cancer compared to other women.


What am I supposed to do?


If you find out you have dense breasts, talk to your doctor about your family history of breast cancer and whether you should have additional screening with ultrasound or MRI, said Dr. Georgia Spear of Endeavor Health/NorthShore University Health System in the Chicago area.


Researchers are studying better ways to detect cancer in women with dense breasts. So far, there's not enough evidence for a broad recommendation for additional screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force called for more research in this area when it updated its breast cancer screening recommendations earlier this year.


Do I still need a mammogram?


Yes, women with dense breasts should get regular mammograms, which is still the gold standard for finding cancer early. Age 40 is when mammograms should start for women, transgender men and nonbinary people at average risk.


"We don't want to replace the mammogram," Spear said. "We want to add to it by adding a specific other test."


Will insurance cover additional screening?


For now, that depends on your insurance, although a bill has been introduced in Congress to require insurers to cover additional screening for women with dense breasts.


Additional screening can be expensive — from $250 to $1,000 out of pocket, so that's a barrier for many women.


"Every woman should have equal opportunity to have their cancer found early when it's easily treated," Berg said. "That's the bottom line."

## Drone maker DJI sues Pentagon over Chinese military listing

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — China-based DJI sued the U.S. Defense Department on Friday for adding the drone maker to a list of companies allegedly working with Beijing's military, saying the designation is wrong and has caused the company significant financial harm.


DJI, the world's largest drone manufacturer that sells more than half of all U.S. commercial drones, asked a U.S. District Judge in Washington to order its removal from the Pentagon list designating it as a "Chinese military company," saying it "is neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military."


Being placed on the list represents a warning to U.S. entities and companies about the national security risks of conducting business with them.


DJI's lawsuit says because of the Defense Department's "unlawful and misguided decision" it has "lost business deals, been stigmatized as a national security threat, and been banned from contracting with multiple federal government agencies."


The company added "U.S. and international customers have terminated existing contracts with DJI and refuse to enter into new ones."


The Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


DJI said on Friday it filed the lawsuit after the Defense Department did not engage with the company over the designation for more than 16 months, saying it "had no alternative other than to seek relief in federal court."


Amid strained ties between the world's two biggest economies, the updated list is one of numerous actions Washington has taken in recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies that it says may strengthen Beijing's military.


Many major Chinese firms are on the list, including aviation company AVIC, memory chip maker YMTC, China Mobile 0941.HK, and energy company CNOOC.


In May, lidar manufacturer Hesai Group ZN80y.F filed a suit challenging the Pentagon's Chinese military designation for the company. On Wednesday, the Pentagon removed Hesai from the list but said it will immediately relist the China-based firm on national security grounds.


DJI is facing growing pressure in the United States.


Earlier this week DJI told Reuters that Customs and Border Protection is stopping imports of some DJI drones from entering the United States, citing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.


DJI said no forced labor is involved at any stage of its manufacturing.


U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly raised concerns that DJI drones pose data transmission, surveillance and national security risks, something the company rejects.


Last month, the U.S. House voted to bar new drones from DJI from operating in the U.S. The bill awaits U.S. Senate action. The Commerce Department said last month it is seeking comments on whether to impose restrictions on Chinese drones that would effectively ban them in the U.S. -- similar to proposed Chinese vehicle restrictions.

## US lawmakers seek investigation of consulting firm over work in China

date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA

washington — A group of Republican lawmakers is demanding a federal investigation into the U.S. consulting firm McKinsey over its work with the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises, even as the company reportedly is revamping its China business to reduce risks. 


A letter — signed by Representative John Moolenaar of Michigan, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa — asks the Justice Department to investigate whether McKinsey's $480 million contracts with the Defense Department comply with federal law when the consulting firm also advised China's national and provincial governments and state-controlled businesses. The three accuse McKinsey of misrepresenting its relationship with the Chinese government. 


"McKinsey's activities pose a serious risk to U.S. national security and may have failed to meet McKinsey's obligations under federal law," according to the letter dated Thursday. 


McKinsey declined to comment on the letter but has in the past defended its practices in China. It has said it follows the "most rigorous and comprehensive client service policy in our industry." 


The consultancy also has said it does not work for the ruling Chinese Communist Party or the central government but mainly with multinationals and private Chinese businesses.   


The lawmakers' scrutiny over McKinsey's dealings with Beijing comes as the U.S. and China are becoming increasingly competitive, prompting American politicians to reexamine business ties to ensure Beijing and its military would not get stronger with U.S. help. Beijing also has grown wary of American companies.   


The Biden administration has imposed export controls to block China's access to advanced computer chips and limited U.S. investments in China in areas such as microelectronics, quantum information technologies and artificial intelligence. Last month, a Republican congressional report raised red flags that partnerships between American and Chinese universities could aid Beijing in developing critical technology for military advances.   


U.S. companies, which have built experience in China over the past several decades, are readjusting to the new geopolitical reality. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKinsey has cut back on government-linked clients in China and reduced the workforce there by nearly 500 people, or about a third. 


The letter by Republican lawmakers accused McKinsey of helping China "rapidly develop its military and economy" through its consulting services. It said McKinsey failed to disclose its work with the Chinese government while acquiring U.S. defense contracts, which amounted to more than $480 million since 2008 and granted McKinsey "access to classified or otherwise sensitive national security data." 


Bob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee's subcommittee on investigations in February that "we've never worked for the Chinese Communist Party or the central government in China, to the best of my knowledge." 


The letter asserted that McKinsey may have misrepresented its relationship with the Chinese government, citing public information and documents.

## Striking machinists, Boeing confer indirectly, aided by US government

date: 2024-10-18, from: VOA News USA

A union representing striking machinists at Boeing said Friday that it was "actively engaged in indirect discussions" with the plane maker that were being facilitated by Acting U.S. Labor Secretary Julie Su.


"We are fully committed to these talks. It is our responsibility to attempt to reach a resolution," the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 751 said in a social media post.


About 33,000 of Boeing's unionized West Coast workers, most in Washington state, have been on strike since September 13, demanding a 40% wage increase spread over four years and a restoration of workers' defined benefit pension. The work stoppage has halted production of the company's best-selling 737 Max and its 767 and 777 wide-body aircraft.


The talks are the first sign of movement in the strike since October 8, when Boeing - following the breakdown of talks attended by mediators -withdrew its enhanced offer that included a 30% wage increase over four years. Boeing subsequently filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union.


Boeing declined to comment on Friday.


On Monday, Su was in Seattle for her first in-person effort to help reach a new Boeing contract and returned on Thursday night to resume efforts after a trip to Detroit.


A spokesperson for Su said Friday that the secretary "is currently in Seattle having discussions with both parties. She has met with the CEO and the union and has been in touch multiple times throughout the process."


Last Friday, Boeing announced it would cut 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its global staff, and take $5 billion in charges, continuing a year of tumult for the company since a new Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 airplane suffered a midair emergency.


Boeing announced a window for up to $25 billion in stock and debt offerings over the next three years on Tuesday, as well as a $10 billion credit agreement.


In September, nearly 95% of the West Coast workers rejected Boeing's contract offer of a 25% pay increase over four years, prompting the strike.

## Muslim candidates surge in local elections in US

date: 2024-10-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — As the United States prepares for a presidential election next month, the idyllic New York suburb of Teaneck, New Jersey, is gearing up for elections that reflect a broader trend in U.S. politics.


Two Muslim women are running for local office in Teaneck, a town of 41,000 residents with a significant Muslim population. They are among hundreds of Muslim candidates in local, state and federal elections around the country.


Teaneck once had a Muslim mayor but never a Muslim woman on its city council.


Reshma Khan, a longtime local activist of Indian origin and a council candidate, is aiming to change that.


"I don't take that lightly," Khan, 47, said in a recent phone interview from her makeshift canvassing base in Teaneck. "It's one of great responsibility as a Muslim."


Nadia Hussain, a Trinidadian American high school teacher, is the other Muslim candidate in Teaneck's nonpartisan local elections. She is hoping to be the first Muslim woman elected to the local school board.


Khan and Hussain, two hijab-wearing, everyday working American moms, represent a growing trend of Muslim Americans seeking office, reflecting a larger national pattern of more diverse candidates.


"There is a saying that we have: 'If you're not at the table, then you're on the menu,' so engagement is a must," Hussain said in an interview with VOA.


Muslims' political engagement surges


The U.S. has roughly 3.5 million Muslims from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Though most vote Democratic, a growing number have leaned Republican in recent elections.


Muslim elected officials, once a rarity, have become increasingly common in recent years. This surge in political engagement is driven by a mix of factors, from a concern about Islamophobia to a desire for political representation, experts say.


"If voter turnout of American Muslims is any indication of further political participation, Muslims running for office seems to parallel that trend," said Nura Sediqe, an assistant professor of political science at Michigan State University.


Some experts trace the surge of Muslim political engagement to 2018, when Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib shattered glass ceilings by becoming the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Their success, coupled with that of numerous local candidates, ignited a wave of Muslim political activism.




The ripple effects have continued in the years since. In 2021, Boston and New York City elected their first Muslim council members. The following year, Dearborn, Michigan, a city with a substantial Arab and Muslim population, inaugurated its first Muslim mayor. Meanwhile, state legislatures from Maine to Texas have welcomed about 50 Muslim members into their ranks.


"Every cycle we're seeing an increase in the number of people running," said Basim Elkarra, executive director of CAIR Action, himself a school board president near the Sacramento, California, area. "You're seeing more local races, more school board races and more city council races where folks are running in."


Last year, CAIR, a civil rights group promoting American-Islamic relations, tallied 235 Muslim elected officials, including nearly 50 in New Jersey, home to the largest Muslim population per capita in the country. This year, the group expects the total number to surpass 250, a record.


Local races, like school board and city council elections, account for most of the recent growth. A city council member may not wield the power of a member of Congress, but in a country where "all politics is local," these races can have a huge impact on local communities.


Recounting her talking points to voters, Khan said, "We say, yes, the presidential election is important, but more important is local elections."


A consummate activist, Khan views a future role on the city council as an extension of her activism rather than a political position. Her goal, she said, is to inspire future generations of Muslim women.


"I'm not doing this for myself," Khan said. "I am doing this for the Fatimas and the Muhammads and the Ahmads who are going to come 50 years from now."


Candidate aims to challenge stereotypes


Khan wasn't always a hijabi woman. Born in Chennai, India, she attended a Catholic school. After earning an master's degree in business administration from an Indian university, she moved to the U.S. in early 2001 to take a marketing job in New Jersey.


The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, changed her outlook. To challenge stereotypes about Muslims, she began wearing a hijab.


"I wanted to show that there are peaceful Muslims," she said.


Nearly 20 years ago, Khan and her husband, Arif, moved to Teaneck, where she immersed herself in community activism: attending city council meetings, serving on the council's community relations board and leading a school Parent Teacher Association.


Then in 2021, she was thrust into the spotlight after helping lead a ballot initiative to move local elections from May to November when turnout is higher. She credits her marketing skills for the success of the "One Town, One Vote" campaign.


"At this point, I had become such an icon in Teaneck, because even though the movement was not started by me, I brought my marketing skills," she said.


The following year, she considered running for town council but decided to wait while she was raising three young daughters.


This year, though, she took the plunge, inspired by the historic victories of several Muslim women candidates in New Jersey and a sense the council wasn't listening to her community.


"I felt that I should be the leader for my community, so my community finds a voice in American politics," she said.


Teaneck is an ethnically and religiously diverse town, with about 40% of the population Jewish, more than 20% Muslim, and the rest mostly Blacks and Latinos.


The war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' terror attack on Israel last October, sparked tensions after the council passed a resolution in support of Israel but not one "designed to speak for Palestinian voices," Khan said.


Teaneck's Muslims, Khan said, "feel let down by the local leadership because the local leadership has only spoken for one community."


Teaneck Mayor Mike Pagan did not respond to repeated requests from VOA for comment.


A self-described "bridge builder," Khan said she has formed a broad coalition of supporters from Teaneck's major communities, using young canvassers to go door to door.


Whether that's enough to win remains to be seen. With local elections now held in November, winning a council seat requires substantially more votes. But whether she wins or not, Khan said she wants to be remembered "as a woman in her hijab who's a Muslim and has galvanized support from every community in the town, not because she is a Muslim person but because she is someone who stands for equity."

<p class="p1">Dozens of people wait in line at the U.S. consulate in Shanghai in hopes of scoring a visa. One worry on their minds? Whether the outcome of the U.S. presidential election will ease tensions between the two nations or heat them up. Plus, why builders are breaking ground on more single-family homes and fewer apartment complexes, and how mobile homes became an integral part of the American housing stock.</p>

## US, allies take lead on North Korea sanctions

date: 2024-10-18, from: VOA News USA

A Canadian surveillance plane over the East China Sea — Over the blue waters of the East China Sea, a Canadian air force patrol crew scans the horizon, searching for vessels suspected of making illicit transfers of oil to North Korea.


The 20-member crew aboard the Aurora CP-140 is on the front line of a U.S.-led multinational effort to enforce United Nations sanctions that cap North Korea's oil imports.




On this clear day in mid-October, the Canadian plane is patrolling international waters off the coast of China — a hotspot, the crew says, for ships attempting to dodge sanctions.


When they locate a suspicious vessel, the crew swoops low, circling to snap pictures from multiple angles. The idea is to "make our presence known," said Major Doug Publicover, the commander of the Canadian mission.




The Canadians pass the information to the Enforcement Coordination Cell, or ECC, a loose configuration of 11 nations that conduct surveillance and share intelligence on North Korea's sanctions violations.


"It's a small piece of the pie," Publicover said of Canada's contribution, "but each country does their bit, and hopefully that deterrence can be larger."




Sanctions under strain 


Since 2006, U.N. Security Council sanctions have restricted much of North Korea's economic activity as punishment for its nuclear and missile programs. The sanctions limit North Korea's annual imports to 4 million barrels of crude oil and 500,000 barrels of refined products.


U.S. officials, however, say North Korea regularly exceeds these limits, mainly because of a lack of enforcement by China and Russia — North Korea's key allies. Both countries deny those claims but have taken steps to blunt the impact of the sanctions, which they say are no longer necessary.




Earlier this year, Russia vetoed the renewal of a U.N. panel that monitored sanctions violations. China abstained from the vote. As an alternative, the U.S. and its allies this week created the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team, or MSMT, which aims to fill the intelligence gap left by the disbanded panel.


"We just collect information, we tabulate it, and we push it off," says Royal Canadian Air Force Commander Larry Moraal, the ECC's deputy director. "[But] they'll have greater access to the international community than we do."


China pushback 


As the U.S. and its allies move ahead with sanctions enforcement, China has voiced growing frustration, particularly with patrols near its borders. Chinese military jets have frequently intercepted Canadian and Australian planes on these missions, at times creating tense encounters.


During this week's flight, with VOA aboard, Chinese fighter jets shadowed the Canadian plane for hours as it patrolled the East China Sea. Unlike past incidents, though, the interactions were not dangerous, said Publicover.


"We're in their backyard — we expect to have some company," Publicover said.




China's biggest concern is that some flights "have been seriously approaching or even entered China's airspace," said Hu Bo, director of the Beijing-based South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative.


In 2023, China accused a Canadian CP-140 of entering its airspace near the disputed Diaoyu Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan. The islands are administered by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan.


When asked by VOA, Canadian officials declined to comment on the incident, underscoring that all its operations occur in international waters.


Philip Shetler-Jones, a senior research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, said it's easy to understand why China doesn't like patrols so close to its borders.


"I don't think many countries would like it. But that's different from having an acceptable legal basis to say it's not OK — or an acceptable legal basis on which to justify the kind of dangerous maneuvers and actions they've carried out," he said.


Going it alone 


With China and Russia increasingly disengaged from enforcing sanctions, U.S.-led mechanisms like the ECC and MSMT are among the few remaining options. Some experts, however, question how effective this approach can be.


"There's no way the U.S. and its allies on their own could enforce U.N. sanctions" without help from China and Russia, says Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Seoul-based Sejong Institute.


Still, Ward said the newly created MSMT can serve as a useful tool for naming and shaming violators, applying pressure, and helping countries struggling to implement sanctions.


Maya Ungar, a U.N. analyst at the International Crisis Group, added that the body could boost its credibility by involving a wider range of countries. But, she said, its accusations will likely carry less weight than those from the now-dismantled U.N. panel of experts.


How to measure success 


Despite enforcement efforts, North Korea continues to secure energy imports, often exceeding U.N.-imposed limits. Commander Moraal acknowledges this but said the ECC is raising the cost of sanctions evasion.


As an example, Moraal cites two North Korean-linked coal ships seized by South Korea earlier this year after ECC provided intelligence.


But if the ultimate goal is to curb North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the results appear less encouraging. Recent estimates suggest North Korea now has enough fissile material to build up to 90 nuclear warheads, and it regularly unveils new advanced missile systems.


Ward believes a shift in strategy may eventually be necessary. "At some point, we may need to reckon with the fact that North Korea does have nuclear weapons and figure out how to deal with that," he said.


Still, even if full enforcement is impossible, Ward argues there's a case for maintaining sanctions. "The alternative could reward bad behavior," he said.


"So long as North Korea sanctions remain relatively comprehensive, if very leaky, there are many countries that will see the case of North Korea as a cautionary lesson," he said.

## America Is Becoming a Low-Trust Society

date: 2024-10-18, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgzNDc2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDE2Mjk1Nn0.SIsl8uJE2gDO6-9mKHEodrzX3cOxHyD1yyDFzwY8PaY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">When Hurricanes Helene and Milton swept through the Southeast, small-government conservatives demanded fast and effective government service, in the form of relief operations organized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Yet even as the agency was scrambling to meet the need, it found itself targeted by far-right militias, who prevented it from doing its job because they had been led by cynical politicians to believe it wasn't doing its job.</p><p>It’s almost a law of nature, or at least of politics, that when government does its job, few people notice — only when it screws up does everyone pay attention. While this is nothing new in itself, it has increasingly profound implications for the future of government-driven climate action. While that action comes in many forms and can be sold to the public in many ways, it depends on people having faith that when government steps in — whether to create new regulations, invest in new technologies, or provide benefits for climate-friendly choices — it knows what it’s doing and can accomplish its goals. </p><p>As the climate crisis grows more urgent, restoring faith in government will be more important than ever. Unfortunately, simply doing the right things — like responding competently to disasters — won’t be enough to convince people that the next climate initiative will do what it’s supposed to. </p><p>The number of people expressing faith in government today is nearly as low as it has been in the half-century pollsters have been asking the question. That trust has bounced up and down a bit — it rose after September 11, then fell again during the disastrous Iraq War — but for the last decade and half, only around 20% of Americans say they trust the government most of the time. </p><p>It’s partisan, of course: People express more trust when their party controls the White House. And the decline of trust reaches beyond the government. Faith in most of the key institutions of American life — business, education, religion, news media — has fallen in recent decades, sometimes for good reason. The net result is a public skeptical that those in authority have the ability to solve complex problems. </p><p>Changing that perspective is extraordinarily difficult, often because of the nature of good and bad news: The former usually happens slowly and invisibly, while the latter often happens dramatically and all at once.</p><p>Take the program created in the Energy Department under George W. Bush to provide loans to innovative energy technologies. If most Americans had heard of it, it was because of one company: Solyndra, a manufacturer of innovative but overly expensive solar panels. Undercut by a decline in prices of traditional panels, the company went under, and its $535 million loan was never repaid. Republicans made Solyndra’s failure into a major controversy, claiming that the program showed that government investment in green technology was corrupt, ineffective, and wasteful. </p><p>What few people heard about was that the loan program overall not only <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/11/13/363572151/after-solyndra-loss-u-s-energy-loan-program-turning-a-profit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>turned a profit</u></a> at the time (and for what it’s worth, it <a href="https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-15-colleagues-highlight-success-of-doe-loan-programs-office#:~:text=The%20LPO%20provides%20a%20useful,of%20that%20%2434%20billion%20investment." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>still does</u></a>), it also provided help to many successful companies, even if a few failed — as any venture capital investor could tell you is inevitable. The successes included Tesla, which used <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its federal loan</u></a> to ramp up production of the sedans that would turn it from a niche manufacturer of electric roadsters into what it is today. Needless to say, Elon Musk does not advertise the fact that his success was built on government help. </p><p>More recently, the hurricane response has shown how partisan polarization can be used to undermine trust in government — especially when Donald Trump is involved. Trump took the opportunity of the hurricanes to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/376982/trump-hurricane-helene-fema-lies-debunked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accuse</u></a> the federal government of being both political and partisan, delivering help only to those areas that vote for Democrats. Soon after, he <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-threatens-california-withhold-aid-water-fire-rally-1235132731/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised</u></a> to do precisely what he falsely accused the Biden administration of doing, saying that if he is president again, he will withhold disaster aid from California unless Gov. Gavin Newsom changes the state’s water policies to be more to Trump’s liking. “And we’ll say, Gavin, if you don’t do it, we’re not giving any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the fire, forest fires that you have,” Trump said. And in fact, in his first term Trump <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/helene-isnt-the-first-time-trump-inserted-politics-into-a-natural-disaster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>did try</u></a> to withhold disaster aid from blue states.</p><p>What sounds like hypocrisy is actually something much more pernicious. As he often does, Trump is arguing not that he is clean and his opponents are dirty, but that <em><em>everyone</em></em> is dirty, and it’s just a question of whether government is in the hands of our team or their team. When he says he’ll “drain the swamp,” he’s telling people both that government is corrupt, and the answer is merely to change who gets the spoils. If you believe him, you’ll have no trust in government whatsoever, even if you might think he’ll use it in a way you’ll approve of. </p><p>We’ve seen again and again that people want government to perform well and get angry when it doesn’t, but they don’t reward competence when it happens. Which is why making sure systems operate properly and problems are solved is necessary but not sufficient to win back trust. Government’s advocates — especially those who are counting on it to undertake ambitious climate action both now and in the future — need not only to deliver, they have to get better at, for lack of a better word, propaganda. Policy success is not its own advertisement. And despite his ample policy achievements, Joe Biden has not been a charismatic and effective messenger — on the role of government, or much else.</p><p>Ronald Reagan used to say that the most frightening words in the English language were “I’m from the government and I’m here to help”; the oft-repeated quip was at the center of his incredibly successful effort to delegitimize government in the eyes of voters. To reverse the decline of trust so people will believe that government has the knowledge and ability to tackle climate change, the public needs to be reminded — often and repeatedly — of what government does well. </p><p>Touting past and present successes on climate — and disaster relief, and so many other ways the government solves problems every day — is essential to building support for future climate initiatives. Those successes are all around, it’s just that most people never hear about them or take them for granted. But promoting government as an engine of positive change should be as high a priority for climate advocates, including those who hold public office, as discrediting government was for Reagan and is for Trump.</p>

## Russia returns bodies of 501 soldiers; Western allies weigh Zelenskyy victory plan

date: 2024-10-18, from: VOA News USA

Russia returned to Ukraine the bodies of 501 soldiers on Friday, Ukrainian authorities said. The move appeared to be the biggest repatriation of war dead since Russia invaded in February 2022.


Most of the soldiers were killed in the fighting in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, around the city of Avdiivka. After a long and grueling battle, Russian forces captured the city in February, Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement.


Law enforcement agencies and forensic experts will identify the victims, Ukrainian authorities said. The bodies will then be returned to family members for burial.


The repatriation came two days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented his "victory plan" to European Union leaders and NATO defense ministers. Ukraine's allies are giving it qualified support, with one leader saying it will be reconsidered after the U.S. election next month.


Zelenskyy's plan, which he unveiled to Ukraine's parliament Wednesday, calls first for an unconditional invitation to join NATO, along with the deployment of a non-nuclear deterrent to Russian aggression, among other points.  He maintains the plan could end the war no later than next year.


While NATO allies and leadership insist Ukraine's future is with NATO, a formal invitation to join the alliance has not been made. NATO allies have said the nation cannot become a member while it is at war, and the focus has been on providing the support it needs to win.




The NATO-Ukraine Council met late Thursday, following Zelenskyy's presentation to the defense ministerial meeting.  At a Friday news conference in Brussels, new NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the focus of that meeting was "to get massive military aid into Ukraine" from Western allies.


"Obviously, we all know that Ukraine will become a member of NATO, so the question is exactly when," Rutte said.  "But that was not the main issue of the debate last night."


U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was asked about Zelenskyy's plan during a briefing Friday in Brussels. "The victory plan is President Zelenskyy's plan, and we're going to do everything that we can and provide security assistance to support the president as he tries to accomplish his objectives," Austin said.


Austin added, "It is not my position to evaluate publicly his plan. We have been supporting him by providing security assistance in a major way for over two and a half years. We are going to continue to do that."


U.S. President Joe Biden was in Berlin on Friday for meetings with the leaders of Britain, Germany and France, and support for Ukraine was a focus of their talks. Biden called on the Western allies of Ukraine to "sustain our resolve" in supporting Ukraine.


The president said the "cost" of supporting Ukraine is "heavy," but that cost is no match "in comparison to the cost of living in a world where aggression prevails, where large states attack and bully smaller ones simply because they can."




On the sidelines of that meeting, U.S. national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters the White House was still reviewing Zelenskyy's plan.


He said the U.S. supported "President Zelenskyy's plan for a just peace. It's critical that whatever that peace looks like, it has to be acceptable to him and to the Ukrainian people."


Ukrainian media reported that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk spoke to reporters Friday following European Union talks in Brussels and said there was "no consensus" on the plan among EU leaders. He said it was difficult to tell how realistic it was because "much depends on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election."


Tusk added that the plan would be reassessed after the U.S. elections next month. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has indicated he does not support continuing U.S. military aid for Ukraine, at least not at current levels.


Also Friday, Ukraine's military said Russian forces Thursday suffered their second deadliest day since the war began.


On its account on the Facebook social media platform, the General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces reported 1,530 Russian casualties since Thursday.


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.

It wasn’t even unusual for Redmond voters to send Republicans to represent their zip code in the state legislature, despite the city being located in blue King County. </p><p>The Redmond of today, on the other hand, looks far more like what you’d expect from an affluent (and now <a href="https://www.nwprogressive.org/weblog/2023/07/welcome-to-redmond-republicans-youre-in-one-of-the-most-progressive-cities-in-washington-and-the-pacific-northwest.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staunchly progressive</u></a>) suburb of Seattle. A cannabis dispensary with a pride flag and a “Black Lives Matter” sign in the window has replaced Work and Western Wear, and the new high-performing magnet school happens to share a name with one of the most popular cars in the neighborhood: Tesla. But Washington is a state full of contradictions, and among Redmond’s few remaining farms is one <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/6-initiatives-head-to-wa-ballot-with-6m-support-of-brian-heywood/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>registered</u></a> under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>winkingly libertarian</u></a> name of “Galt Valley Ranch LLC.” It belongs to a multimillionaire who has almost single-handedly bankrolled the most significant challenge yet to Washington’s standing as a national climate leader. </p><p>Andrew Villeneuve, the founder of the Northwest Progressive Institute, a left-wing think tank also based in Redmond, told me he’s struggled to get voters to pay attention to ballot measures in the past. “I’ve had no such awareness issues this year,” he said. “Nobody’s like ‘Who’s Brian Heywood?’”</p><p>A hedge fund manager, multimillionaire, and recent California transplant, Heywood has in short order made himself the supervillain of Washington’s left. His <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/joker-arc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Joker arc</u></a> into politics involves fleeing the liberal dystopia of the Golden State in 2010 for the no-income-tax refuge of Washington, only to discover that Olympia was progressive, too. This year, he set out to personally “<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/6-initiatives-head-to-wa-ballot-with-6m-support-of-brian-heywood/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fix stupid things</u></a>” in his adopted state by spending $6 million out of pocket on a signature-gathering campaign that ultimately landed four conservative initiatives on Washington’s general election ballot. (His campaign, <a href="https://letsgowashington.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Let’s Go Washington</u></a>, is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Go_Brandon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>allusively named</u></a>, although Heywood <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/6-initiatives-head-to-wa-ballot-with-6m-support-of-brian-heywood/#:~:text=Heywood%20has%20not%20been%20a%20supporter%20of%20Donald%20Trump.%20He%20says%20he%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20see%20someone%20else%20carry%20the%20Republican%20banner%20for%20president." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a> <em><em>The Seattle Times</em></em> that he is not a MAGA supporter.) </p><p>Two of the four ballot measures Heywood has willed before voters this November address standard small-government gripes: One would repeal the capital gains tax, and the other would allow workers to opt out of the state’s long-term care payroll tax. Others, however, will ask Washingtonians to vote directly on whether to repeal the state’s landmark cap-and-invest carbon-trading program (I-2117) or block its transition away from natural gas (I-2066). </p><p>“We’ve faced initiatives like these before,” Villeneuve told me, “but what is different is how many of them are coming at once.” </p><p>As in many Western states, it’s relatively easy for a motivated individual with means to collect the roughly 320,000 signatures needed for a petition to end up on the ballot in Washington. (Contract workers are <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/up-to-5-a-pop-signature-gatherers-cash-in-on-petitions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paid up to $5 per signature</u></a>, and they often descend on ferry lines, where bored motorists can be talked into putting down their names as they wait for the next boat.) But while rich activists have leveraged this system in the past — Washingtonians may remember the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Eyman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Tim Eyman</u></a> — the outcome of the ballot measures before voters this fall will be closely watched by other states and legislatures to gauge how directly popular bold climate progress really is.</p><p>“What happens in Washington will certainly have an impact on what happens around the rest of the country,” Leah Missik, the Washington deputy policy director at the clean energy nonprofit Climate Solutions, who also serves on the executive board of the No on 2066 campaign, told me. She added, “If these [laws] are in any way repealed or weakened, that is a sign to other states, and I think it would be incredibly damaging and incredibly unfortunate.”</p><p>Though politics in Washington have long been conservation-minded and, shall we say, <em><em>crunchy</em></em> (I grew up in Redmond), the state really began to stand out as a leader in progressive climate policy with Governor Jay Inslee’s election in 2013. During Inslee’s tenure, Washington committed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/18/18363292/washington-clean-energy-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one of the most aggressive</u></a> 100% clean energy pathways in the country, passed a wide-ranging building emissions law that <a href="https://rmi.org/washington-clean-buildings-bill-raises-the-bar-for-every-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RMI described</u></a> as “significantly [raising] the level of ambition on what might be possible for other states,” and in 2023 enacted its <a href="https://www.cleanprosperouswa.com/cap-and-invest-rules-finalized/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>landmark cap-and-invest program</u></a>, called the Climate Commitment Act, which has generated <a href="https://www.sightline.org/2024/10/08/reexplaining-washingtons-climate-commitment-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over $2 billion</u></a> in state revenue so far for transit projects, decarbonization initiatives, and clean air and water programs. Washington has even been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/05/04/jay-inslee-governor-washington-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>credited</u></a> with inspiring some of President Biden’s climate actions in office.</p><p>With Inslee, a Democrat, retiring at the end of this term, Let’s Go Washington’s campaign begins to appear designed to dismantle his legacy while proposing little in the way of alternatives. Hallie Balch, the communications director, denied this allegation in an emailed statement, telling me the initiatives “promote choice and affordability.” The cap-and-invest program, for example, “has not done what the governor said it would do,” she said, and “there are no metrics in place to track [its] success.”</p><p>Though the CCA’s cap covers about 75% of the state’s total greenhouse gas emissions, it’s true that we’re still a few years away from having a clear picture of the program’s results. (The law’s first compliance deadline for polluters isn’t until this November.) “The CCA has only been around for almost two years at this point, and so we haven’t yet seen the big emissions declines,” Emily Moore, the director of the climate and energy program at the Sightline Institute, a nonpartisan sustainability think tank that does not take an official position on initiatives, told me. “But what we <em><em>are</em></em> seeing,” she added, “is the money that it has generated for a whole suite of climate-friendly and community-friendly projects.”</p><p>There isn’t a revenue source remotely comparable to cap-and-invest available to fund the state’s transit, infrastructure, and community projects if the program goes away, meaning a repeal would have a dramatic impact on everything from bus service to <a href="https://www.bellinghamherald.com/opinion/article289500812.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>salmon recovery projects</u></a> to local heat pump and induction stove rebates, with most likely getting the axe. The program is also one of the main levers Washington has to reach its goal of reducing emissions 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. As one person involved in crafting the CCA described the upcoming vote on I-2117 to me, it’s “life or death for climate action in Washington.”</p><p>That’s partially because I-2117 wouldn’t only repeal the CCA; it would also bar the state from implementing a new climate tax or cap-and-invest program<em><em> at any point in the future</em></em>. When asked what an alternative might be last week during a debate at Seattle University’s Department of Public Affairs and Nonprofit Leadership, Heywood vaguely proposed “<a href="https://tvw.org/video/seattle-university-initiative-2117-debate-2024101121/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>something that works</u></a>.” </p><p>“We always knew we were going to have to defend this program at the ballot box,” Joe Fitzgibbon, the majority leader of Washington’s House of Representatives and the chair of the House Environment and Energy Committee, who helped create the CCA, told me. He admitted that he’d expected such a defense to take the form of legislative elections, but 2022 came and went without a single backer of the CCA losing their seat. “I guess in hindsight, I thought we were out of the woods,” Fitzgibbon said.</p><p>Let’s Go Washington has labeled I-2117 a “hidden gas tax” and, bundled with its other initiatives, is running on the slogan “vote yes, pay less.” I-2117 is already <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/initiative-2117-washington-state-boing-field-2021-climate-commitment-act-governor-jay-inslee-no-campaign-greenhouse-gases-northwest-progressive-institute-energy-efficiency-wildfire-season" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the most expensive ballot measure campaign of this election cycle</u></a> — and the most controversial, with Heywood campaigning at gas stations offering discounted gas, which opponents <a href="https://www.chronline.com/stories/group-behind-state-initiatives-accused-of-violating-state-anti-corruption-laws-with-discount-gas,361080" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>say</u></a> violates vote-buying anti-bribery laws. But opposition to the initiative has also rallied a remarkable and unprecedented coalition of strange bedfellows in defense of the CCA, including <a href="https://no2117.com/our-coalition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over 500</u></a> businesses, environmental groups, health care organizations, faith leaders, tribes — as well as more than 30 breweries, “a very important coalition member in the state of Washington,” as No on I-2117’s communication director Kelsey Nyland quipped to me. Jane Fonda recently swung through the state to stump for I-2117; the ‘no’ campaign even has the support of <a href="https://greenjobspac.org/no-on-2117/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Green Jobs PAC</u></a>, whose contributors include Shell and BP.</p><p>While almost all the advocates I spoke to about I-2117 were feeling optimistic ahead of Washington ballots going out at the end of this week, <a href="https://www.cascadepbs.org/politics/2024/09/washington-ballot-initiatives-lose-ground-voters-new-pollhttps://www.cascadepbs.org/politics/2024/09/washington-ballot-initiatives-lose-ground-voters-new-poll" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the most recent Cascade PBS/Elway poll</u></a> on the initiative shows support has dropped slightly since May, with 46% saying they would vote no over 30% who would vote yes. (Heywood has pointed optimistically to the number of undecided voters this leaves.) Still, it seems pretty unlikely that Washingtonians will repeal their cap-and-invest program.</p><p>I-2066 is a different story.</p><p>To the immense frustration of its opponents, Let’s Go Washington touts I-2066 as “Stop the Gas Ban.” The measure was only certified for the ballot in July, compared to <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/about-office/news/2024/secretary-hobbs-notifies-legislature-initiative-no-2117-certification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>January</u></a> for 2117, meaning that organizers have had much less time to mobilize — several major national green groups, including Defenders of Wildlife and the Environmental Defense Action Fund, confirmed to me that they’d endorsed No on I-2117 but not considered a position on I-2066 — and are on the back foot to combat misinformation.</p><p>For one thing, there <em><em>is </em></em>no gas ban: I-2066, rather, would repeal parts of a Washington law directing its largest utility, Puget Sound Energy, to consider electrification alternatives before installing new gas pipes; scuttle a pilot effort to <a href="https://www.sightline.org/2024/03/21/washingtonians-will-soon-enjoy-cleaner-heating-and-cooling-options/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promote thermal energy networks</u></a> as a gas alternative; and, most starkly, it would bar cities and towns, as well as Washington’s energy code, from “prohibiting, penalizing, or discouraging” gas appliances in buildings. “Discouraging” does a lot of work here. For example, Seattle’s building emissions performance standard, which doesn’t ban gas but nudges large developments toward a 2050 net-zero emissions target, could be in jeopardy.</p><p>Still, all of this is a lot to expect voters to sort through in the few minutes they might spend filling in the bubbles in their ballot, especially when Let’s Go Washington is making out its message to sound like one simply about energy choice. Add the opaque triple-negative climate campaigners have to sell (“vote no on a ban on banning gas”), and the messaging headaches grow more severe.</p><p>Earlier this month, the editorial board for the largest media outlet in Washington,<em><em> The Seattle Times</em></em>, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-seattle-times-editorial-board-recommends-vote-yes-on-initiative-2066-insist-on-a-better-gas-transition-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>endorsed a yes vote on I-2066</u></a>, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-seattle-times-editorial-board-recommends-vote-yes-on-initiative-2066-insist-on-a-better-gas-transition-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>arguing for</u></a> a slower transition away from fossil fuels that leans more heavily on natural gas. “Unfortunately, we are up against a network of fossil fuel corporations and their allies who have a lot of money and who are very invested in the status quo because it perpetuates their wealth and their influence,” Missik, who’s involved with the No on I-2066 campaign, told me, pointing to the Building Industry Association as well as Northwest Natural, National Propane Gas Association, and Koch Industries, who have backed the other side. I-2066 is also <a href="https://www.cascadepbs.org/politics/2024/09/washington-ballot-initiatives-lose-ground-voters-new-poll" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>polling much better</u></a> than I-2117; as of September, 47% of voters said they would vote yes, compared to 29% who said they’d vote no.</p><p>Rather than interpret those numbers as the electorate’s backlash to Washington’s climate progress, advocates argue they indicate how fossil fuel groups have successfully capitalized on the door propped open by Heywoods’s signature-gathering campaigns. It’s “because one guy opened his wallet; it is that simple,” Villeneuve, the founder of the Northwest Progressive Institute, said. “There is no grassroots movement to overturn these laws; it doesn’t exist. Brian Heywood brought this entire thing into being.” Or, as Missik put it: “Most Washingtons do believe in climate progress, whether or not this will be overridden by money. I sure hope not.”</p><p>All of this ultimately brings us back to the question of what Heywood’s whole deal is. With the singular exception of I-2066, his $6 million initiatives seem mostly doomed.</p><p>Some I spoke to floated the idea that Heywood and his allies are using Washington as a testing ground for dismantling climate action and seeing what sticks. “If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere: It can happen in California, it can happen in Colorado, it can happen in New York, it can happen in all these states that have passed really strong climate policies,” Caitlin Krenn, the climate and clean energy director of the nonprofit Washington Conservation Action, told me.</p><p>But there are other rumors, too. The <em><em>Washington State Standard</em></em>’s Jerry Cornfield recently <a href="https://x.com/dospueblos/status/1821008712389251331" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quoted</u></a> a local GOP chair calling Heywood’s initiatives “a powerful tool” that will “help get Republicans elected” — essentially, a turnout generator. (“We certainly want to see as many people as are eligible to vote exercise their right to make their voices heard, but our top priority is to educate voters about what's at stake with the initiatives this November,” Balch told me in response.) And then there is Heywood’s ranch. Republicans have <a href="https://time.com/3682230/republican-politicians-cowboy-boots/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long</u></a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/12/12/roy-moore-rode-to-the-polls-as-a-cowboy-after-spending-an-entire-campaign-in-costume/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cosplayed</u></a> as rural farmers and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-01-21/arizona-cowboy-republican-politics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cowboys</u></a> to tap into the masculine conservative fantasy of rugged individualism (what <em><em>Texas Monthly</em></em> once <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/jeff-bezos-cartoon-cowboy-vogue-photo-shoot/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called</u></a> “authenticity drag”). It’s essentially an image-building exercise — perhaps not so unlike positioning yourself as <em><em>the </em></em>guy who tried to rein in the state’s runaway Dems.</p><p>So far, Heywood has dodged questions about whether he plans to run for governor, and his campaign told me he “isn't using the initiatives as anything other than a way to bring broken policies directly to the people to vote on.” But with this year’s ballots going out to Washington voters today, it’s also a question for another time.</p><p>Regardless of what happens, many of the organizers I spoke to rejected the framing of Washington voters cooling on climate. One went as far as to tell me that the time, attention, and money Heywood has spent trying to roll back Washington’s progress is the highest compliment of all. “This is part of the process of doing big things,” Isaac Kastama, who was involved in enacting the CCA and now works for the advocacy group Clean and Prosperous Washington, told me. “If it’s not big and if it goes undetected, that probably means you’re not doing something serious enough.”</p>

## Texas Supreme Court halts execution of man in shaken baby case

date: 2024-10-18, from: VOA News USA

HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS — The Texas Supreme Court halted Thursday night's scheduled execution of a man who would have become the first person in the United States put to death for a murder conviction tied to a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.


The late-night ruling to spare for now the life of Robert Roberson, who was convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, capped a flurry of last-ditch legal challenges and weeks of public pressure from Republican and Democratic lawmakers who say he is innocent and was sent to death row based on flawed science.


In the hours leading up to the ruling, Roberson had been confined to a prison holding cell a few feet from America's busiest death chamber at the Walls Unit in Huntsville, waiting for certainty over whether he would be taken to die by lethal injection.


"He was shocked, to say the least," said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesperson Amanda Hernandez, who spoke with Roberson after the court stayed his execution. "He praised God, and he thanked his supporters. And that's pretty much what he had to say."


She said Roberson would be returned to the Polunsky Unit, about 72 kilometers (45 miles) to the east, where the state's male death row is located.


Roberson, 57, was convicted of killing of his daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the East Texas city of Palestine. His lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia.


A night of last-minute maneuvers


It is rare for the Texas Supreme Court — the state's highest civil court — to get involved in a criminal matter.


But how the all-Republican court wound up stopping Roberson's execution in the final hours underlined the extraordinary maneuvers used by a bipartisan coalition of state House of Representatives lawmakers who have come to his defense.


Rejected by courts and Texas' parole board in their efforts to spare Roberson's life, legislators on Wednesday tried a different route: issuing a subpoena for Roberson to testify before a House committee next week, which would be days after he was scheduled to die. The unusual plan to buy time, some of them conceded, had never been tried before.




They argued that executing Roberson before he could offer subpoenaed testimony would violate the Legislature's constitutional authority. Less than two hours before Roberson's execution, a judge in Austin sided with lawmakers and paused the execution, but that was then reversed by an appeals panel. The Texas Supreme Court then weighed in with its order, ending a night of uncertainty.


Roberson is scheduled to testify before the committee Monday.


"This is an innocent man. And there's too much shadow of a doubt in this case," said Democratic state Representative John Bucy. "I agree this is a unique decision today. We know this is not a done deal. He has a unique experience to tell, and we need to hear that testimony in committee on Monday."


Governor, US Supreme Court did not act


Texas Governor Greg Abbott had the authority to delay Roberson's punishment for 30 days. Abbott has halted only one imminent execution in nearly a decade as governor and has not spoken publicly about the case.


Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to halt the execution, although Justice Sonia Sotomayor — in a 10-page statement about the case — urged Abbott to grant a 30-day delay.




Roberson's lawyers had waited to see if Abbott would grant Roberson the one-time reprieve. It would have been the only action Abbott could take in the case, as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Wednesday denied Roberson's clemency petition.


The board voted unanimously, 6-0, to not recommend that Roberson's death sentence be commuted to life in prison or that his execution be delayed. All board members are appointed by the governor. The parole board has recommended clemency in a death row case only six times since the state resumed executions in 1982.


The one time Abbott halted an imminent execution was when he spared the life of Thomas Whitaker in 2018.


Texas law on scientific evidence


The House committee on Wednesday held an all-day meeting on Roberson's case. In a surprise move at the end of the hearing, the committee issued the subpoena for Roberson to testify next week.


During its meeting in Austin, the committee heard testimony about Roberson's case and whether a 2013 law created to allow people in prison to challenge their convictions based on new scientific evidence was ignored in Roberson's case.


Anderson County District Attorney Allyson Mitchell, whose office prosecuted Roberson, told the committee a court hearing was held in 2022 in which Roberson's attorneys presented their new evidence to a judge, who rejected their claims.


"Based on the totality of the evidence, a murder took place here. Mr. Roberson took the life of his almost 3-year-old daughter," Mitchell said.


Most of the members of the House committee are part of a bipartisan group of more than 80 state lawmakers, including at least 30 Republicans, who asked the parole board and Abbott to stop the execution.


Spotlight on shaken baby syndrome


Roberson's case has renewed debate over shaken baby syndrome, known in the medical community as abusive head trauma.


His lawyers, as well as the Texas lawmakers, medical experts, bestselling author John Grisham and others, say his conviction was based on faulty and now outdated scientific evidence. The diagnosis refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child's head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.


Roberson's supporters don't deny head and other injuries from child abuse are real. But they say doctors misdiagnosed Curtis' injuries as being related to shaken baby syndrome and that new evidence shows the girl died from complications related to severe pneumonia.


Roberson's attorneys say his daughter fell out of bed in Roberson's home after being seriously ill for a week.


Roberson's lawyers also suggested his autism, then undiagnosed at the time of his daughter's death, was used against him as authorities became suspicious of him because of his lack of emotion over her death. Autism affects how people communicate and interact with others.

## The legal right to ignore your boss

date: 2024-10-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>After working hours, that is. The European Union is now considering rules to formalize a &#8220;right to disconnect&#8221; for employees — a legal right to ignore those pesky work-related emails, calls or messages when you&#8217;re not working. Presently, around 20 countries have such laws. We&#8217;ll learn more. Also on the program, we&#8217;ll hear about homebuilder optimism, Netflix&#8217;s slower subscriber growth and the reasons behind climbing interest rates.</p>

When it comes to military equipment being sent to Ukraine, big-ticket items like Patriot missiles and F-16 fighter jets come to mind. But for many Ukrainian soldiers, the U.S.-made 60-millimeter M224 mortars, also used by the U.S. Marine Corps, have been highly effective against Russian forces. Anna Kosstutschenko has the story.

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Forest fire CO2 emissions have skyrocketed since 2001</h3><p>
	Carbon emissions from forest fires have risen by 60% in two decades, according to a new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl5889?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-82XB_i-lp3XoRBXMYxxIsA4a5rvXpbSRYKOe4y_Yzo8X-0jKE8b6xNZ9dYjkboonWqIEwJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em>Science</em>. “We had to check the calculations because it’s such a big number,” Matthew Jones, the lead author of the report and a physical geographer at the University of East Anglia in England, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/climate/carbon-fires-forests-global-warming.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-82XB_i-lp3XoRBXMYxxIsA4a5rvXpbSRYKOe4y_Yzo8X-0jKE8b6xNZ9dYjkboonWqIEwJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. “It’s revealed something quite staggering.” The research specifically links this trend to climate change, which is creating hotter, drier conditions. Emissions from boreal forest fires in Canada and Siberia saw a particularly large increase between 2001 and 2023. In one type of boreal forest, emissions nearly tripled. The rise in emissions from forests – which normally serve as large carbon sinks – “poses a major challenge for global targets to tackle climate change,” the researchers said.
</p><h3>2. NFL stadiums could see huge losses from climate disasters</h3><p>
	NFL stadiums across the country could suffer $11 billion in losses by 2050 due to climate-related disasters, according to a new <a href="https://www.climate-x.com/articles/industry/report-projects-11-billion-financial-losses-for-nfl-stadiums-by-2050-due-to-climate-risks?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-82XB_i-lp3XoRBXMYxxIsA4a5rvXpbSRYKOe4y_Yzo8X-0jKE8b6xNZ9dYjkboonWqIEwJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from climate risk analysis firm Climate X. The report ranks 30 stadiums based on their vulnerability to extreme weather events. MetLife Stadium in New Jersey ranks highest, with damages exceeding $5.6 billion by 2050. California’s SoFi Stadium and Arizona’s State Farm Stadium are also highly exposed. It’s worth noting that the Climate X analysis uses a “high-emissions” scenario that would see temperatures rise by 4.3 degrees Celsius by 2100.

## Biden, Scholz to discuss antisemitism concerns during Germany meeting

date: 2024-10-18, from: VOA News USA

berlin — U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will discuss increased reports of antisemitic acts in both countries over the last year as war has raged in the Middle East when they meet Friday in Berlin, a Biden administration official told reporters on the eve of Biden’s state visit to Germany.


“This is an area where the United States and Germany have worked very closely,” said the official, who was not named as a condition of the Wednesday night briefing.


The official added that while Biden is unlikely to hold a specific event centered on antisemitism during his one-day visit, the issue is “very important to President Biden, and one that he has, that we have, discussed with the German government over the years and continue to do so.”


The official did not give any more details on engagements or plans.




Watchdogs have sounded the alarm in both countries: According to a German government report, antisemitic incidents rose by about 83% last year. In the United States, the Anti-Defamation League has said that U.S. antisemitic incidents “skyrocketed” in the months after Hamas militants attacked Israel last October.


Biden has clearly tied the recent rise in anti-Jewish acts to a growing backlash over his staunch support of Israel.


In May, he spoke at the first Holocaust Remembrance Day since the start of the war on October 7, 2023. He warned of a “ferocious” rise in antisemitic incidents and said that, at the height of university protests, “Jewish students [were] blocked, harassed, attacked, while walking to class.”


He said protesters used “antisemitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world’s only Jewish state.”


Earlier this month, he spoke of his belief that “without an Israel, every Jew in the world’s security is less stable.”


He added, “It doesn’t mean that Jewish leadership doesn’t have to be more progressive than it is, but it does mean it has to exist, and that’s what worries me most about what’s going on now.”


Germany’s World War II history makes it particularly sensitive to this type of hatred, but critics say it has taken steps that stifle legitimate criticism.


In November, weeks into the Gaza conflict, a German museum canceled a show by a South African artist after she expressed support for the Palestinian cause. Candice Breitz, the artist, who is Jewish, called the act another example of “Germany’s increasingly entrenched habit of weaponizing false charges of antisemitism against intellectuals and cultural workers of various descriptions.”


In March, police canceled a conference of pro-Palestinian activists because a planned speaker had previously made antisemitic remarks. They blocked him from entering Germany and cut power to the Berlin building where conference participants had gathered to watch him on a livestream.


On the first anniversary of the war, Scholz warned against growing anti-Jewish sentiment and affirmed his support for Israel.


“We will never accept antisemitism and blind hatred of Israel. The Jewish people here in Germany have the full solidarity of our state,” he said.




A difficult definition


Key to managing antisemitism is the question of whether criticism of Israel is, by definition, antisemitic.


The Federal Association of Research and Information Centers for Antisemitism, Germany’s antisemitism watchdog, uses a working definition from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, describing antisemitism as “a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.” Although its definition of antisemitism does not mention Israel, many of its cited examples of antisemitism do.


The U.S. State Department also uses that definition, but when the White House produced its first strategy on antisemitism last year, before the start of the Gaza war, the strategy was not based solely on that definition.


One Jewish rights group that worked with the White House on the strategy said the decision to codify the definition of antisemitism “would only have made it harder to recognize and respond to antisemitic attacks in context" and "would have opened the door to infringement of First Amendment rights.”


That group, T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, also opposed a proposed bill in Congress using the group’s definition, with CEO Rabbi Jill Jacobs saying in a statement: “The profoundly misguided Antisemitism Awareness Act does nothing to keep Jews safe, while also threatening the civil liberties fundamental to this country.”




Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, who led the rollout of the White House strategy, said it is more important to look at what antisemitism does than what it is.


"At its core, antisemitism divides us, erodes our trust in government, institutions and one another," he said. "It threatens our democracy while undermining our American values of freedom, community and decency. Antisemitism delivers simplistic, false and dangerous narratives that have led to extremists perpetrating deadly violence against Jews.”


History professor Jonathan Elukin of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, said the definition of antisemitism has shifted over the centuries. He focuses on antisemitism in the medieval and early modern periods — before Israel was founded.


This iteration of antisemitism in the U.S., he told VOA, is “more associated with a kind of larger sense of an anti-Western, anti-modern kind of feeling, both on the far right and on the far left. They both seem to be converging in some ways on resentment, hatred, suspicion, anxiety about the Jews.”


As for the sentiment on the far right, he said, “I think it's more a kind of tribal nostalgic sense that America is supposed to be or was thought to be kind of a Christian nation.”


He said the debate over definitions obscures a problem.


“Does it even matter whether it fits some kind of arbitrary notion of antisemitism, which in itself is a very arbitrary and time-bound definition?” he asked.


But, he said, talking about the problem is a start.


“In the short term, obviously it requires education, activism, political leadership to draw the line at acceptable or what's not acceptable expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment,” he said. “Both here and abroad.”

## Panel urges Secret Service overhaul in response to Trump shooting

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

An independent panel formed to investigate the performance of the Secret Service after an assassination attempt in July against former President Donald Trump has called for extensive changes to the agency, including the installation of new leadership from the outside.


In a report issued Thursday morning, the panel praised the bravery of the individual agents who work to protect political figures in the United States. However, it blasted their leaders for creating an internal culture that has become "bureaucratic, complacent and static," with the result that "the Secret Service does not perform at the elite levels needed to discharge its critical mission."


Without "fundamental reform," the panel warned, other attacks on the agency's protectees "can and will happen again."


In a statement, Secret Service Acting Director Ronald L. Rowe Jr. said, "We respect the work of the Independent Review Panel and will carefully examine the report and recommendations released today."


He added that the agency has started making changes as a result of the attempted assassination.


"We have already significantly improved our readiness, operational and organizational communications and implemented enhanced protective operations for the former president and other protectees," Rowe said.




Failure in Pennsylvania


President Joe Biden established the panel after a July 13 episode in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which a young man with a rifle was able to get within a few hundred meters of Trump while he was delivering a campaign speech. The would-be assassin fired several shots; Trump's right ear was struck, but he was not seriously wounded. One bystander was killed, and two others were seriously wounded, before a Secret Service countersniper team killed the gunman.


In the aftermath of the incident, it became clear that there had been multiple failures leading up to the assassination attempt. The gunman was identified as a potential danger in advance of the shooting but was not prevented from accessing the roof of a building with a clear line of sight to the stage where Trump was speaking.


In the minutes leading up to the shooting, law enforcement officials in the crowd were made aware of the shooter's presence, but because of poor coordination of communications, the information was not relayed to the members of Trump's protective detail near the stage.


Panel's recommendations


The panel's findings include calls for specific changes to the way the Secret Service handles large events such as the Trump rally in Butler.


While the Secret Service has primary responsibility for the security of such events, it relies on other law enforcement agencies, including state and local police, for assistance. The report calls for having a unified command post at events like the Butler rally that would allow better communication among various agencies.


The report also calls for creating specific plans for dealing with all locations within 914 meters (1,000 yards) of an event that offer line-of-sight vision of the protectee, overhead surveillance of all outdoor events, improved communication systems and other changes.




Leadership change


In the wake of the Butler shooting, Kimberly Cheatle resigned as Secret Service director and was temporarily replaced by Rowe. However, the report issued Thursday calls for a much more extensive shakeup of the agency's higher echelons.


Citing "an urgent need for fresh thinking informed by external experience and perspective," the panel recommended that a new director, drawn from outside the Secret Service, be put in place and "be allowed to bring in the leadership team he or she thinks most fit."


The new leadership would be charged with addressing multiple problems identified by the investigation, including "a troubling lack of critical thinking" within the agency and "corrosive cultural attitudes regarding resourcing and 'doing more with less.' "


The report also urged a refocusing of the agency on its protective duties, to the point of potentially "shedding certain peripheral responsibilities," including complex investigations into financial fraud and counterfeiting.


'More with less'


Ronald Kessler, an author and journalist who has written two books about the Secret Service, told VOA that the panel correctly identified a number of problems with the agency. In particular, he cited the "do more with less" ethos, which he said has been present in the agency since it was folded into the Department of Homeland Security more than 20 years ago.


Kessler said it has become a point of pride in the agency that it operates on a shoestring rather than demanding more funding and resources.


"It's a recipe for mediocrity and just the opposite of what anybody would want in any organization," he said.


Within the agency, Kessler said, "the way to be promoted has been, 'You don't make waves, you don't ask for more money, you don't point out problems, you don't expose the fact that the technical systems that are just basic don't work.' "


Kessler praised the decision to seek outside leadership.


"In any organization, when it's failing, you bring in outside people, whether it's a private company or a government agency, and the people do respond," he said.


Doubts about outside leadership


Paul Eckloff, a 23-year veteran of the agency who served as the assistant special agent in charge of the protection details of Presidents Barack Obama and Trump, said he doubted the wisdom of seeking outside leadership for an agency as unique as the Secret Service.


"The report is indicative of some fundamental misunderstandings of how the Secret Service operates, and these misunderstandings would be shared by any outside leader," he told VOA.


"It would exacerbate problems within the rank and file, who believe that they are not well represented," Eckloff said. "If the complaint about Secret Service leadership was that they were detached from the operators on the ground — [a job] they ostensibly have done before — imagine a leader who never held a post. How detached would they be?"


Eckloff also warned that requiring the agency to focus exclusively on its protective mission would be counterproductive. Serving on a protective detail is extremely intense work, he said, with agents often working weeks at a time without a day off.


For that reason, the agency tries to limit the time agents are assigned directly to a protective detail to periods of five to eight years, after which they rotate off and move into investigative work.


This leaves the agency with a deep pool of experienced agents who can be called upon to assist in protective details at times when the agency needs to surge its capacity, which occurs at least every four years during presidential elections.


The panel reviewed the attack from early August through early October. Members were Mark Filip, a former federal judge and former deputy attorney general; David Mitchell, a former superintendent of the Maryland State Police; Janet Napolitano, former secretary of homeland security; and Frances Townsend, a former homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush.

## Why Climate’s Hardest Problem Might Need a Carbon Market

date: 2024-10-17, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgzMjAwNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMDYzNDU5NX0.NHr7qmzaG4ws1Otx-O0fdjWckQCt7EY1yYt20He1pWE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Imagine you’re a corporate sustainability exec and your company is planning to build a new data center. You’ve managed to convince the higher-ups to pay extra to use low-carbon building materials, lest the project blow up your brand’s emissions goals. But when you meet with the general contractor hired for the job, they don’t actually know of any low-carbon concrete purveyors in the area. Concrete is a hyper-local industry by necessity — you can’t hold the stuff for more than 90 minutes or so before it hardens and becomes unusable.<br/></p><p>So here you are, one of the few people with the power and budget to pay a premium for zero-emissions concrete — a product that must become the standard if we are to stop climate change — and you can’t even get your hands on it.</p><p>This is, more or less, the situation Microsoft has found itself in. Last year, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/05/15/microsoft-environmental-sustainability-report-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the company’s indirect emissions rose 31%</u></a>, primarily due to the construction of new data centers. Cement, the main ingredient in concrete, is one of the most carbon-intensive materials on the planet, responsible for 6% of global emissions, according to <a href="https://rhg.com/research/the-global-cement-challenge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Rhodium Group’s estimate</u></a>. Low-carbon cement exists and is starting to be manufactured at a small scale, but first movers with deep pockets like Microsoft can’t necessarily access it. </p><p>To solve this and help clean cement startups access a bigger pool of buyers, Microsoft is leading the development of a new market for low-carbon cement — what climate finance experts call a “book and claim” market.</p><p>The tech giant has <a href="https://sublime-systems.com/microsoft-signals-intent-to-purchase-environmental-attributes-of-low-carbon-cement-developed-by-sublime-systems/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed a memorandum of understanding</u></a> with Sublime Systems, a Massachusetts-based cement startup, saying that it will buy “environmental attribute certificates” from Sublime’s first commercial cement plants. Microsoft will “book” the environmental attributes — the greenness, for lack of a better word — of Sublime’s cement, and “claim” those attributes in its own emissions accounting.</p><p>Let’s get a collective <em><em>groan</em></em> out of the way<em><em>.</em></em> Yes, once again, the business community is proposing a sort of carbon credit system as the best way — possibly the only way — to scale climate solutions. These certificates, however, have at least one notable difference from the beleaguered carbon offsets you’ve likely heard so much about: They are tied to a physical product. Microsoft won’t be buying one ton of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere and then subtracting that from its overall emissions ledger. It will be buying the rights to say that it used one ton of cement with a carbon intensity of zero (or whatever the carbon intensity of Sublime’s product ends up being). Instead of neutralizing its cement-related emissions by paying someone to plant trees, it’s doing so by enabling Sublime to sell its clean cement to local buyers at a competitive price. </p><p>“It tremendously simplifies our logistics,” Leah Ellis, the CEO and founder of Sublime Systems told me, by solving the unavoidable problem that at this early point in the company’s development, it would be impossible to deliver its cement to all the early adopters willing to pay extra for it. “We end up doing death by 1,000 pilots if we have to pilot here, there, everywhere. Being able to use the cement locally and have the carbon attribute be counted against Microsoft's Scope 3 emissions is a really innovative way to unstick this whole problem.”</p><p>That’s key. Scope 3 is a category of emissions that encompasses all the carbon that is related to a business but not directly produced by it. When Microsoft builds a data center, it has no direct control over the process used to make the cement that goes into the building. In theory, it does have the ability to say, “We want to use clean stuff, not dirty stuff.” But in reality, companies are struggling to effect change within their supply chains. </p><p>“The thing to understand right out the gate is that basically no major consumer-facing company that uses things like steel or aluminum or cement knows where their stuff actually comes from,” Stephen Lezak, a researcher focused on carbon markets at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as at Oxford University, told me. He thinks that’s going to change, and hopes that in 15 years we all look back on this fact in horror. But in the meantime, “the urgency of the climate crisis requires using high integrity tools that aren't ideal, but still preserve fundamental integrity from a carbon accounting perspective,” he said. </p><p>Microsoft, for its part, told me it sees this transaction as a near-term solution and “prioritizes buying and installing physical product first” i.e., before buying certificates, “where technical, geographical, and supply chain considerations align.”</p><p>Sublime is currently building its first commercial plant in Holyoke, Massachusetts, which will use its <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/sublime-carbon-cement-electrolyzer" target="_self"><u>unique zero-emissions process</u></a> to produce 30,000 tons of cement per year. The Department of Energy awarded the company an $87 million grant to fund the project earlier this year. Holcim and CRH, two of the largest building materials companies in the world, have also invested in Sublime and agreed to purchase a large portion of the volume produced by the first plant. </p><p>Ellis hopes the deal with Microsoft will help attract additional investment and get the company through its “awkward teenage years.” Sublime needs to show investors that “people want this material, people will pay that green premium so that we can drive up the volume so that that premium goes away,” she said. </p><p>As with carbon offsets, there are still ways to game the system. Microsoft recently <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/structuring-demand-for-lower-carbon-materials-an-initial-assessment-of-book-and-claim-for-the-steel-and-concrete-sectors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>co-authored a report</u></a> with the clean energy think tank RMI describing what a larger book and claim market for clean cement might look like and what questions need to be answered to ensure the market is credible. Until clean cement is just as cheap or cheaper than conventional cement, it’s pretty clear this kind of market will help reduce emissions. But should the environmental attributes be tied to cement, or to concrete? How should the carbon intensity be calculated? How will emissions be tracked and traced from the producer to the contractor to the building itself? </p><p>Perhaps the most critical question is how to avoid double-counting. If Microsoft is buying the right to say it used clean cement, what can the company that bought the <em><em>actual cement </em></em>say? Will it be able to brag that its building is green?</p><p>When I posed this question to Ellis, and Ben Skinner, a manager at RMI and one of the authors of the report, each gave me a version of the same answer: Yes and no. </p><p>Ellis launched into a passionate monologue about the concrete companies and contractors and structural engineers who should be celebrated for taking the risk of using a new material. “This problem of cement emissions is so intractable,” she said. “We need to make cement more visible. We need to talk about this more. We need more people to care. And so that physical embodiment, having it stamped ‘Sublime cement,’ and having a plaque that shows the public, hey, these are the emissions reduced by this thing you see here, you want to celebrate that physical embodiment.” At the end of all this, she added, “And by no means am I saying that you should double count.”</p><p>The suggestion is that it should be possible to separate carbon accounting and green marketing. If Microsoft has booked the green attributes of a delivery of cement, the contractors or building owners who used the physical stuff should not be able to claim they used clean cement on their emissions balance sheets, Skinner said. (What number they <em><em>should</em></em> use is a tricky question that will have to be solved.) But perhaps they still deserve some kind of recognition. </p><p>What kind of recognition, Lezak told me, is a gray area. “There's a really difficult part of this whole conversation, where you start anchored in material science and climate science and everything is really rigorous,” he said. “And at some point, the train sort of moves on to the political economy track, and it's really tough because you look for the same sort of black and white answers to these questions and they just don't show up.”</p><p>The details of the Microsoft deal and who can claim what are still being negotiated. At the same time, RMI and a new nonprofit called the Center for Green Market Activation have started work to stand up a larger book and claim market for cement. Their goal is to develop standards for how these certificates should be created, traded, and used so that companies that do not have the expertise or budget or resources that Microsoft has can access them. “We do think that it's possible to create a really high integrity system,” Skinner, told me. </p><p>Whether you like this idea or hate it, get ready to hear a lot more about it. The Center for Green Market Activation, which launched in June, is <a href="https://gmacenter.org/programs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>working to develop book and claim markets</u></a> across a range of carbon intensive industries, including aviation, trucking, maritime shipping, and chemicals. There is one clear alternative to these paper-trading schemes — regulations that <em><em>require</em></em> companies to use more green materials over time. But proponents don’t see that happening anytime soon.</p><p>Lezak, though initially skeptical of these markets, has grown to support the idea. “There are people out there arguing that if you want to claim the emissions reduction in green steel, you need to make sure that the green steel actually shows up on your factory floor,” he said. “That's a beautiful idea, but you're talking about potentially pulling out the rug from billions of dollars of high integrity carbon finance.”</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This article has been updated to reflect the correct portion of the output from Sublime’s first plant Holcim and CRH have agreed to purchase.</em><br/></p>

## US sanctions Chinese entities for building, shipping Russian Garpiya drones used in Ukraine

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The United States on Thursday announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese and Russian entities for their role in designing, building and shipping attack drones that have resulted in mass casualties in Ukraine.


The sanctions target two Chinese entities, Xiamen Limbach Aircraft Engine Co., Ltd., and Redlepus Vector Industry Shenzhen Co Ltd (Redlepus), Russian entity TSK Vektor and TSK Vektor’s General Director Artem Mikhailovich Yamshchikov.


A senior administration official told reporters Thursday that the entities were involved in developing the Russian Garpiya series long-range attack drones, producing them in China and shipping them directly to Russia.


“The Garpiya, designed and produced in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in collaboration with Russian defense firms, has been used to destroy critical infrastructure and has resulted in mass casualties,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement.


“Today’s action is part of our continued effort to disrupt attempts by PRC-based and Russia-based entities and individuals to support Russia’s acquisition of advanced weapons technology and components. We will continue to impose costs on those who provide support to Russia’s military-industrial base.”


The senior administration official said the U.S. has warned Beijing in the past about the network, contradicting Chinese statements that they are not aware of such networks.


Two Chinese firms are directly “involved in producing and shipping things that are unmistakably part of Russia's war against Ukraine and are going unmistakably to an actor that the West has already identified and sanctioned as being part of the Russian military industrial base,” said the official.


Since 2022, the U.S. has sanctioned close to 100 entities based in China and Hong Kong. The majority of them are part of the supply chain of dual-use items – components or goods that can be converted by Russia into military items that are then being deployed against Ukraine.


However, Thursday’s sanctions were the first to hit Chinese entities “directly developing and producing complete weapons systems in partnership with Russian firms.”


Also Thursday, the U.K. announced its largest package of sanctions against Russia’s “shadow fleet of oil tankers” – ships that supposedly knowingly operate in defiance of Western sanctions.


London said 18 more shadow fleet ships will be barred from U.K. ports, bringing the total number of oil tankers sanctioned to 43.


Sanctions working



In response to VOA’s question, the official said that Western sanctions are working.


“This is having a direct impact on their economy. It's having a direct impact on their ability to get war material. It's having a direct impact on the quality of goods that they are achieving,” the official said.


A second senior administration official said Moscow is feeling “unprecedented external pressure” on its trade and investment projects with China. Growing trade ties between the two countries, though, indicate “they are continuing to innovate and circumvent which is why we are also moving out on sanctions and other tools.”


China says it is not providing weapons for Russia. Beijing maintains it handles its export of dual-use items in accordance with laws and applies strict controls on drone exports.


The sanctioned companies' transactions are “incompatible” with Beijing’s statements, the second official said. “If China is serious about that commitment, we are asking them to take action to shut down this network.”


Beijing has said in the past it “firmly opposes unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law or authorization of the U.N. Security Council.”


Every month, Beijing exports to Russia more than $300 million of those so-called dual-use items that have both commercial and military applications, according to an analysis of Chinese customs data by the Carnegie Endowment think tank.


Ties have grown between Moscow and Beijing. On Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced plans for expanded cooperation during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or SCO, summit in Islamabad, Pakistan. The SCO was founded by Russia and China in 2001 to counter Western alliances.

## FBI arrests suspect in hacking of US SEC's account on platform X

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — An Alabama man was arrested on Thursday over criminal charges that he hacked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's X account earlier this year, in an action that caused bitcoin's value to spike, federal prosecutors announced. 


In January, a hacker posted false news about a widely anticipated announcement the SEC was expected to make about bitcoin, shocking the market and sending the cryptocurrency's price spiking. The post on @SECGov said the securities regulator had approved exchange-traded funds to hold bitcoin. The SEC deleted the post shortly after it appeared. 


Eric Council Jr., 25, of Athens, Alabama, was arrested on Thursday morning in connection with the hack, the U.S. Attorney's office for the District of Columbia said in a statement on Thursday. 


The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Thursday's arrest.  


The agency previously said it was the victim of "SIM swapping," a technique used by fraudsters to seize control of telephone lines, when its account on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, was hacked earlier in January.

## Battleground state starts early in-person voting while recovering from Helene

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA — Early in-person voting began statewide Thursday in the presidential battleground of North Carolina, including in mountainous areas where thousands of potential voters still lack power and clean running water after Hurricane Helene's epic flooding.


More than 400 locations in all 100 counties were slated to open for the 17-day early vote period, said State Board of Elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell. Only four of 80 sites in the 25 western counties hardest hit by the storm weren't going to open.


Helene's arrival three weeks ago in the U.S. Southeast decimated remote towns throughout Appalachia and killed at least 246 people, with a little over half of the storm-related deaths in North Carolina. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005.


At the South Buncombe Library in Asheville, a city devastated by the storm, about 60 people — most bundled up in jackets, hats and gloves for the chilly weather — lined up around the building before the polls opened at 9 a.m.


They included 77-year-old Joyce Rich, who said Helene made early voting more urgent for her. Rich said while her house was largely spared by the storm, she and her husband still need to do some work on it. Meanwhile, family members who don't have power or water access are coming over to take showers.


"We decided, let's just get it finished," Rich said. "You never know what's going to happen."


Another voter at the library, 33-year-old Jarred Teague, said it was important to show up to vote early, in part because "democracy itself seems to be on the line" during this election.


Early in-person voting, which continues through November 2, is very popular in North Carolina. More than 3.6 million ballots — 65% of all cast ballots — were cast this way in the 2020 general election. In the 2016 election, 62% of all cast ballots were cast during early in-person voting.


Absentee voting in North Carolina began a few weeks ago, with over 67,000 completed ballots turned in so far, election officials said. People displaced by Helene are being allowed to drop off their absentee ballot at any early voting site in the state.


The importance of early voting wasn't lost upon the presidential campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.


On Thursday, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz was expected to campaign in Winston-Salem and Durham, where he was to be joined by former President Bill Clinton.


South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley were expected to appear on the "Team Trump Bus Tour" when it resumes Thursday in Rutherford County, which was among the hardest-hit areas.


The North Carolina ballot also includes races for governor, attorney general and several other statewide positions. All U.S. House of Representatives and state General Assembly seats are up for reelection.


County election boards have received flexibility to modify early voting sites, including locations and their daily hours. In Buncombe County, 10 of the 14 planned early voting sites will be open.


In Watauga County, home to Boone and Appalachian State University, the board adjusted early voting hours to avoid evening travel for voters and poll workers. They also expanded weekend voting options.


Watauga elections Director Matt Snyder said Wednesday having all six sites ready for Thursday was a feat his office didn't expect in Helene's immediate aftermath. But election officials have been working weekends to get prepared.


"It's exhausting," Snyder said. "It's 16-hour days ... but everybody seems to pitch in."


Officials in the 25 counties affected by the storm were still evaluating Election Day polling locations, with the "vast majority" expected to be available to voters, Brinson Bell said.


This is the first presidential general election for which North Carolina voters must show photo identification. Someone who has lost their ID because of the storm can fill out an exception form.

## Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 shocks fans around the world

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

Buenos Aires, Argentina — The death of Liam Payne, who shot to stardom as a member of British boy band One Direction and grappled with intense global fame while still in his teens, sent shockwaves across the world Thursday as Argentine investigators continued their investigation at the scene.


Fans, music-industry figures and fellow musicians paid tribute to Payne, 31, who died after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina.


As fans and media bombarded the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina's capital, the forensics unit worked inside on Thursday collecting evidence.


The Buenos Aires police said they found Payne's hotel room "in complete disarray," with packs of clonazepam, a central nervous system depressant, as well as energy supplements and other over-the-counter drugs strewn about and "various items broken." They added that a whiskey bottle, lighter and cellphone were retrieved from the internal hotel courtyard where Payne's body was found.


The day before, police said that Payne "had jumped from the balcony of his room," without elaborating on how they came to that conclusion. The Associated Press could not confirm details of the incident, as the investigation is ongoing. The medical examiner's office said it was conducting an autopsy.




Police said they had rushed to the hotel Wednesday in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time that had warned of an "aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol."


A hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call recording obtained by The Associated Press saying the hotel has "a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... He's destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please." The manager's voice becomes more anxious as the call goes on, noting the room has a balcony.


Payne was known as the tousle-headed, sensible one of the quintet that went from a TV talent show to a pop phenomenon with a huge international following of swooning fans. In recent years he had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, saying in a YouTube video posted in July 2023 that he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls.


Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, who performed with One Direction in 2014, said he was "shocked and saddened."


"God bless Liam, thinking of all his loved ones. He will be dearly missed," Wood wrote on X.


Paris Hilton also sent condolences on X, saying the news was "so upsetting." The Backstreet Boys said in a social media post that their hearts go out to "Directioners around the world."


Dozens of One Direction fans flocked to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside, where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen leaving the building, from where Payne's body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew.


"I didn't think he was going to die so young," 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP.


Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed after each auditioned for the British singing competition "The X Factor" in 2010, two years after Payne's first attempt to get on the show. Aged 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublé's version of "Cry Me a River," appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audience's cheers and applause.


After each singer failed to make it through the competition as a solo act, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands ever — even though they lost the competition.


Each member had his own persona, with Payne — who hailed from Wolverhampton in England's West Midlands region — known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits including "What Makes You Beautiful," "Night Changes" and "Story of My Life."


Payne had prominent solos on songs including "Stole My Heart" and "Change Your Ticket," co-writing several of the band's hits. One Direction had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as "Directioners," many of them teen girls.


"I've always loved One Direction since I was little," said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne's hotel. "To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me."


With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to life in the public eye.


"I don't think you can ever deal with that. It's all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do," he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him.


One Direction announced an indefinite "hiatus" in 2016, and Payne — like each of his erstwhile bandmates — pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop.


While Styles became a huge solo star, the others had more modest success. Payne's 2017 single "Strip That Down," featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out an album "LP1" in 2019, and his last release — a single called "Teardrops" — was released in March.


In 2020, to mark the 10th anniversary of One Direction, Payne shared a screenshot of a text message he sent to his father on the day he joined the group, which read: "I'm in a boyband."


"What a journey … I had no idea what we were in for when I sent this text to my dad years ago at this exact time the band was formed," he wrote.


Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl, who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an "X Factor" judge during One Direction's season, although their relationship began years later.


Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship.


In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola.

## Panel looking into Trump assassination attempt says Secret Service needs 'fundamental reform'

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

An independent panel investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally faulted the Secret Service for poor communications that day and failing to secure the building where the gunman took his shots. The review also found more systemic issues at the agency such as a failure to understand the unique risks facing Trump and a culture of doing "more with less." 


The 52-page report issued Thursday took the Secret Service to task for specific problems leading up to the July 13 rally in Butler as a well as deeper one within the agency's culture. It recommended bringing in new, outside leadership and refocusing on its protective mission. 


"The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission," the authors wrote Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Homeland Security Department, the Secret Services' parent agency, in a letter accompanying their report. "Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again." 


One rallygoer was killed and two others wounded when Thomas Michael Crooks climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and opened fire as Trump spoke. The former president was wounded in the ear before being rushed off the stage by Secret Service agents. That shooting, along with another incident in Florida when Trump was golfing — a gunman there never got a line of site on the president or fired a shot — has led to a crisis in confidence in the agency. 


The report by a panel of four former law enforcement officials from national and state government follows investigations by members of Congress, the agency's own investigators and by Homeland Security's oversight body. 


A look at the report's key findings and recommendations: 


Poor communications, no plan for key buildings 


The panel echoed previous reports that have zeroed in on the failure to secure the building near the rally that had a clear line of site to where Trump was speaking and the multiple communications problems that hindered the ability of the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement to talk to each other. 


"The failure to secure a complex of buildings, portions of which were within approximately 130 yards of the protectee and containing numerous positions carrying high-angle line of sight risk, represents a critical security failure," the report said. 


The panel faulted the planning between Secret Service and the local law enforcement, and said the Secret Service failed to ask about what was being done to secure the building: "Relying on a general understanding that 'the locals have that area covered' is simply not good enough and, in fact, at Butler this attitude contributed to the security failure." 


The panel also cited the fact that there were two separated command posts at the Butler rally: one with various local law enforcement and another with the Secret Service: "This created, at the highest level, a structural divide in the flow of communications." 


There were other communications problems. 


The Secret Service had to switch radio channels because radio traffic of agents protecting first lady Jill Biden at an event in Pittsburgh was popping up on the channels of agents covering the Butler rally. 


The panel also noted that all the law enforcement personnel on the ground were using a "chaotic mixture" of radio, cell phone, text, and e-mail throughout the day to communicate. 


Also the panel said it was unclear who had ultimate command that day. 


Cultural issues within the agency 


The report delved into the agency's culture and painted a picture of an agency struggling to think critically about how it carries out its mission, especially when it comes to protecting Trump. 


The panel said agency personnel operated under the assumption that they effectively had to "do more with less." The report said the additional security measures taken to protect Trump after the Butler shooting should have been taken before. 


"To be clear, the Panel did not identify any nefarious or malicious intent behind this phenomenon, but rather an overreliance on assigning personnel based on categories (former, candidate, nominee) instead of an individualized assessment of risk," the panel wrote. 


The panel also noted the "back-and-forth" between the Trump security detail and Secret Service headquarters regarding how many people were needed to protect him. 


The panel also faulted some of the senior-level staff who were involved in the rally for what they called a "lack of ownership." In one example, the panel said a senior agent on site who was tasked with coordinating communications didn't walk around the rally site ahead of timen and did not brief the state police counterpart before the rally about how communications would be managed. 


It cited the relative inexperience of two specific agents who played a role in security for the July 13 rally. One was the site agent from Trump's detail whose job it was to coordinate with the Pittsburgh field office on security planning for the rally. The panel said the agent graduated from the Secret Service academy in 2020, and had only been on the Trump detail since 2023. Before the Butler rally the agent had only done "minimal previous site advance work or site security planning." 


Another agent assigned to operate a drone detection system had only used the technology at two prior events. 


What did the panel recommend? 


Having a unified command post at all large events where Secret Service and other law enforcement representatives are all physically in the same place; overhead surveillance for all outdoor events; security plans must include a way to mitigate line of site concerns out to 1,000 yards and who's in charge at the event; and more training on how to get protectees out of dangerous scenarios. 


The panel said the agency also needs new, outside leadership and a renewed focus on its core protective mission while expressing skepticism that the agency should continue with the investigations it currently conducts. While the Secret Service is well known for what it does to protect presidents and other dignitaries, it also investigates financial crimes. 


"In the Panel's opinion, it is simply unacceptable for the Service to have anything less than a paramount focus on its protective mission, particularly while that protective mission function is presently suboptimal," the report said. 


The panel members were Mark Filip, deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush; David Mitchell, who served in numerous state and local law enforcement roles in Maryland and Delaware; Janet Napolitano, homeland security secretary under President Barack Obama; and Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.

## The Case of the Missing Climate Money

date: 2024-10-17, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgyODY3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDEyNDY4M30.zgAVEDZEryEAuOkCbkxzxqWqbJeBu4-gnfQ0jRKKt0s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Parts of southwest France are flooded after heavy rains • Sydney’s Bondi Beach is closed because lumps of toxic tar are washing ashore • A winter storm warning is in effect for parts of Montana.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Report: Large chunk of World Bank climate funds unaccounted for</h3><p>
	Nearly 40% of the climate finance funds that have been distributed by the World Bank over the last seven years are unaccounted for due to poor record keeping, according to a new <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/41-billion-world-bank-climate-finance-unaccounted-oxfam-finds?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--GZn6E6sTQ2tXR-IUi6ZRbBJ8TUyTCcYl_nc0xa-t0_YkpY2GMZJWDa0ooTyTH5O7wdzYC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from Oxfam International. That’s up to $41 billion that is untraceable. “There is no clear public record showing where this money went or how it was used, which makes any assessment of its impacts impossible,” the report said. “It also remains unclear whether these funds were even spent on climate-related initiatives intended to help low- and middle-income countries protect people from the impacts of the climate crisis and invest in clean energy.”
</p><p>
	The World Bank is the largest multilateral provider of climate finance, and has a goal of directing 45% of its total financing toward climate projects by 2025. The report noted that climate finance will be a key issue at the upcoming COP29, where countries will put forward a new global climate finance goal. “The lack of traceable spending could undermine trust in global climate finance efforts at this critical juncture,” Oxfam said.
</p><h3>2. Trump pressed on climate change during Univision town hall</h3><p>
	During a town hall event hosted by Univision last night, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1846747316633411673?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--GZn6E6sTQ2tXR-IUi6ZRbBJ8TUyTCcYl_nc0xa-t0_YkpY2GMZJWDa0ooTyTH5O7wdzYC" target="_blank">asked</a> by a veteran construction worker – who had seen first-hand “the devastating impacts of climate change” – if he still believed global warming was a “hoax.” In his response, Trump claimed to be an environmentalist, saying he’d won “many awards over the years” for the way he’d constructed his buildings, “the way I used the water, the sand, the mixing of the sand.” But, he said, “we can’t destroy our country” for the sake of saving the climate. He said the U.S. is competing against China, which “doesn’t spend anything on climate change.” <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/china?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--GZn6E6sTQ2tXR-IUi6ZRbBJ8TUyTCcYl_nc0xa-t0_YkpY2GMZJWDa0ooTyTH5O7wdzYC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to</a> the International Energy Agency, last year China alone accounted for one-third of the world’s clean energy investments.
</p><p>
	Needless to say, Trump didn’t really answer the question about whether he thought climate change was real, but he did cast doubt on sea level rise and claimed “the real global warming we have to worry about is nuclear.”
</p><p>
	I’ll just take this opportunity to remind you that Heatmap’s Jeva Lange put together an <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-fact-check?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--GZn6E6sTQ2tXR-IUi6ZRbBJ8TUyTCcYl_nc0xa-t0_YkpY2GMZJWDa0ooTyTH5O7wdzYC" target="_self">exhaustive fact-check</a> on Trump’s climate and weather claims going back to 2001.
</p><h3>3. SCOTUS says Biden’s power plant rules can stay — for now</h3><p>
	The Supreme Court yesterday <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/supreme-court-power-plant-rule?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--GZn6E6sTQ2tXR-IUi6ZRbBJ8TUyTCcYl_nc0xa-t0_YkpY2GMZJWDa0ooTyTH5O7wdzYC" target="_self">allowed</a> the Environmental Protection Agency to move forward with its rule restricting climate pollution from power plants, meaning that one of the Biden administration’s key climate policies can stay in place. For now. The high court’s decision will allow the EPA to defend the rule in a lower court over the next 10 months. Whether the Biden administration’s new attempt at regulating climate pollution will survive depends on the outcome of next month’s election. The Trump campaign has said that it will overturn the EPA’s new climate rules. Should Harris win, the rule will still have to survive the lower court challenge. That case is scheduled to be heard in front of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals this term.

## US prosecutors see rising threat of AI-generated child sex abuse imagery

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

U.S. federal prosecutors are stepping up their pursuit of suspects who use artificial intelligence tools to manipulate or create child sex abuse images, as law enforcement fears the technology could spur a flood of illicit material.


The U.S. Justice Department has brought two criminal cases this year against defendants accused of using generative AI systems, which create text or images in response to user prompts, to produce explicit images of children.


"There's more to come," said James Silver, the chief of the Justice Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, predicting further similar cases.


"What we're concerned about is the normalization of this," Silver said in an interview. "AI makes it easier to generate these kinds of images, and the more that are out there, the more normalized this becomes. That's something that we really want to stymie and get in front of."


The rise of generative AI has sparked concerns at the Justice Department that the rapidly advancing technology will be used to carry out cyberattacks, boost the sophistication of cryptocurrency scammers and undermine election security. 


Child sex abuse cases mark some of the first times that prosecutors are trying to apply existing U.S. laws to alleged crimes involving AI, and even successful convictions could face appeals as courts weigh how the new technology may alter the legal landscape around child exploitation. 


Prosecutors and child safety advocates say generative AI systems can allow offenders to morph and sexualize ordinary photos of children and warn that a proliferation of AI-produced material will make it harder for law enforcement to identify and locate real victims of abuse.


The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit group that collects tips about online child exploitation, receives an average of about 450 reports each month related to generative AI, according to Yiota Souras, the group's chief legal officer.


That's a fraction of the average of 3 million monthly reports of overall online child exploitation the group received last year.


Untested ground 


Cases involving AI-generated sex abuse imagery are likely to tread new legal ground, particularly when an identifiable child is not depicted.


Silver said in those instances, prosecutors can charge obscenity offenses when child pornography laws do not apply.


Prosecutors indicted Steven Anderegg, a software engineer from Wisconsin, in May on charges including transferring obscene material. Anderegg is accused of using Stable Diffusion, a popular text-to-image AI model, to generate images of young children engaged in sexually explicit conduct and sharing some of those images with a 15-year-old boy, according to court documents.


Anderegg has pleaded not guilty and is seeking to dismiss the charges by arguing that they violate his rights under the U.S. Constitution, court documents show.


He has been released from custody while awaiting trial. His attorney was not available for comment.


Stability AI, the maker of Stable Diffusion, said the case involved a version of the AI model that was released before the company took over the development of Stable Diffusion. The company said it has made investments to prevent "the misuse of AI for the production of harmful content."


Federal prosecutors also charged a U.S. Army soldier with child pornography offenses in part for allegedly using AI chatbots to morph innocent photos of children he knew to generate violent sexual abuse imagery, court documents show.


The defendant, Seth Herrera, pleaded not guilty and has been ordered held in jail to await trial. Herrera's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.


Legal experts said that while sexually explicit depictions of actual children are covered under child pornography laws, the landscape around obscenity and purely AI-generated imagery is less clear. 


The U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 struck down as unconstitutional a federal law that criminalized any depiction, including computer-generated imagery, appearing to show minors engaged in sexual activity. 


"These prosecutions will be hard if the government is relying on the moral repulsiveness alone to carry the day," said Jane Bambauer, a law professor at the University of Florida who studies AI and its impact on privacy and law enforcement.


Federal prosecutors have secured convictions in recent years against defendants who possessed sexually explicit images of children that also qualified as obscene under the law. 


Advocates are also focusing on preventing AI systems from generating abusive material. 


Two nonprofit advocacy groups, Thorn and All Tech Is Human, secured commitments in April from some of the largest players in AI including Alphabet's Google, Amazon.com, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, OpenAI and Stability AI to avoid training their models on child sex abuse imagery and to monitor their platforms to prevent its creation and spread. 


"I don't want to paint this as a future problem, because it's not. It's happening now," said Rebecca Portnoff, Thorn's director of data science.


"As far as whether it's a future problem that will get completely out of control, I still have hope that we can act in this window of opportunity to prevent that."

## Helene highlights fragility of IV fluid supply chain

<p>A shortage of IV fluid is forcing hospitals across the country to conserve and even postpone surgeries and procedures after an IV fluid production facility in North Carolina was hit by the devastating floods from Hurricane Helene. It&#8217;s vital for hospitals, and the shortage clues us in to some of the economics of health care.

## LA Archdiocese agrees to pay $880 million to clergy sexual abuse victims

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has agreed to pay $880 million to victims of clergy sexual abuse dating back decades, in what an attorney said was the largest single child sex abuse settlement with a Catholic archdiocese, it was announced Wednesday.


After the announcement of the agreement in principle, Archbishop José H. Gomez said in a statement, "I am sorry for every one of these incidents, from the bottom of my heart."


"My hope is that this settlement will provide some measure of healing for what these men and women have suffered," the archbishop added. "I believe that we have come to a resolution of these claims that will provide just compensation to the survivor-victims of these past abuses."


Attorneys for 1,353 people who allege that they suffered horrific abuse at the hands of local Catholic priests reached the settlement after months of negotiations with the archdiocese, the Los Angeles Times reported.


The agreement caps a quarter-century of litigation against the most populous archdiocese in the United States.


Attorneys in the Plaintiffs' Liaison Committee said in a joint statement, "While there is no amount of money that can replace what was taken from these 1,353 brave individuals who have suffered in silence for decades, there is justice in accountability."


Under the settlement, the plaintiffs will engage in a process— that will not involve the archdiocese — to allocate the settlement amount among the participants.


The archdiocese has previously paid $740 million to victims in various settlements and had pledged to better protect its church members, so this settlement would put the total payout at more than $1.5 billion, the Times said.


Attorney Morgan Stewart, who led the negotiations, said in a statement that the settlement is the largest single child sex abuse settlement with a Catholic archdiocese.


"These survivors have suffered for decades in the aftermath of the abuse. Dozens of the survivors have died. They are aging, and many of those with knowledge of the abuse within the church are too. It was time to get this resolved," Stewart told the Times.


The settlement will be funded by archdiocese investments, accumulated reserves, bank financing, and other assets. According to the archdiocese, certain religious orders and others named in the litigation will also cover some of the cost of the settlement, the Times said.

## US strikes Houthi weapons storage sites in Yemen

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

U.S. forces carried out airstrikes Wednesday against Houthi militant weapons storage sites in Yemen, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.


The strikes, conducted by B-2 bombers, targeted weapons the Houthis have used in a yearlong campaign of attacks against ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that have disrupted major sea shipping routes.


“This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,” Austin said.




The Iran-backed Houthis have said their campaign of using boats, missiles and drones to target vessels is being done in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the war in Gaza.


The United States and Britain have conducted multiple strikes against the Houthis to try to protect the shipping lanes, while commercial companies have rerouted many ships to use the longer and more expensive route of going around the African continent.


“The Houthis’ illegal attacks continue to disrupt the free flow of international commerce, threaten environmental catastrophe, and put innocent civilian lives and U.S. and partner forces’ lives at risk,” Austin said.

## Mexican official sentenced to 38-plus years in US for taking cartel bribes

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The man once heralded as the architect of Mexico's war on drug cartels was sentenced to more than 38 years in a U.S. prison Wednesday for taking massive bribes to aid drug traffickers.


Genaro García Luna, Mexico's former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023 of taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect the violent Sinaloa cartel that he was supposedly combating. He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States.


At his sentencing hearing before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday, García Luna continued to maintain his innocence and said the case against him was based on false information from criminals and the Mexican government.


"I have a firm respect for the law," he said in Spanish. "I have not committed these crimes."


García Luna, 56, led Mexico's federal police before he served in a Cabinet-level position as the top security official from 2006-12 under then-President Felipe Calderón. At the time, García Luna was hailed as an ally by the U.S. in its fight on drug trafficking.


But U.S. prosecutors said that in return for millions of dollars, he provided intelligence about investigations against the cartel, information about rival gangs and the safe passage of massive quantities of drugs.


Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. García Luna's lawyers had argued that he should get no more than 20 years.




U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan said he wasn't moved by past accolades that García Luna received for his work in the war on drugs.


"That was your cover," Cogan said before imposing the sentence. "You are guilty of these crimes, sir. You can't parade these words and say, 'I'm police officer of the year.'"


Besides the sentence of 38 years and four months, the judge imposed a $2 million fine.


During the trial, photos were shown of García Luna shaking hands with former President Barack Obama and speaking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John McCain.


But prosecutors said García Luna secretly advanced a drug trafficking conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Mexican citizens. He ensured that drug traffickers were notified in advance of raids and sabotaged legitimate police operations aimed at apprehending cartel leaders, they said.


Drug traffickers were able to ship more than 1 million kilograms of cocaine through Mexico and into the United States using planes, trains, trucks and submarines while García Luna held his posts, prosecutors said.


During former Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán's trial in the same court in 2018, a former cartel member testified that he personally delivered at least $6 million in payoffs to García Luna and that cartel members agreed to pool up to $50 million to pay for his protection.


"He enabled the cartel. He protected the cartel. He was the cartel," Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy told the judge Wednesday.


García Luna enabled a corrupt system that allowed violent cartels to thrive and distribute drugs that killed multitudes of people, she added.


"It may not have been the defendant pulling the trigger, but he has blood on his hands," Komatireddy said.


Prosecutors also said García Luna plotted to undo last year's verdict by seeking to bribe or corruptly convince multiple inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to support false allegations that two government witnesses communicated via contraband cellular phones in advance of the trial.


García Luna's lawyer, Cesar de Castro, said the defense intends to appeal the sentence. He said his client is someone who "has served his country" and has now lost his money, his reputation as well as policies he championed in Mexico.


"He has lost close to everything. All that remains is his wonderful family," de Castro said.


In Mexico, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum briefly commented on the case Tuesday, saying: "The big issue here is how someone who was awarded by United States agencies, who ex-President Calderón said wonderful things about his security secretary, today is prisoner in the United States because it's shown that he was tied to drug trafficking."

## Understanding political polls: From history to interpretation

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

In any election campaign, candidates and the public rely on opinion polls to comprehend the state of the race and inform their actions and choices. But polls can be confusing, contradictory, and, historically, even occasionally flat-out wrong. It’s both an art and a science — and you can easily become tripped up if you don’t know what to look for.

## Billie Jean King, female athletes to honor her Women's Sports Foundation

date: 2024-10-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Billie Jean King started the Women's Sports Foundation with a $5,000 check. 


She's turned that investment into $100 million and a half century of helping girls and women achieve their dreams through travel and training grants, local sports programs, and mentorship of athletes and coaches.


King was set to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation by honoring the 1999 U.S. women's World Cup champions; Mark Walter, co-owner of the Professional Women's Hockey League and the Los Angeles Dodgers; and the Women's National Basketball Association's 2024 rookie class on Wednesday night in New York. 


"What makes me happy is creating opportunities and dreams for others," King told The Associated Press in a recent interview. "I look back and that's what drives me." 


Nearly 100 female athletes will attend the awards dinner to celebrate the milestone and King, a tireless advocate for equal pay and more investment in women's sports. 


That includes awards host and soccer honoree Julie Foudy. She graduated from Stanford and played for the 1999 U.S. soccer team that won the World Cup before a record crowd of more than 90,000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. 


"She's remained a friend and mentor and such a catalyst for changing the trajectory of women's soccer and so many sports," said Foudy, a former president of the Women's Sports Foundation and current soccer broadcaster for Turner and TNT. 


After the World Cup win, Foudy and the team turned to King, Donna Lopiano and Donna de Verona for advice about improving pay and starting a professional soccer league. 


"I'll never forget, (King) said, 'What are you guys doing about it?' " said Foudy, regarding their collective leverage with the U.S. Soccer Federation. "And as players, that was the exact epiphany we needed at that moment." 


Foudy and the '99ers eventually witnessed the successful struggle toward equity, helping lay the foundation for the current U.S. women's national team to receive the same pay and working conditions as the men's team. A players' lawsuit against the federation resulted in a landmark $24 million settlement in 2022. 


"Billie doesn't have just one meeting. She'd check in and follow up and ask, 'What do you need?' " Foudy said. "She was at that first (WUSA professional) game in Washington, D.C. (in 2001), and was a big proponent of the importance of having a league and player pool for the longevity and growth of women's soccer." 


The current iteration is the NWSL, which formed in 2013 and now has 14 teams. Foudy is part of the ownership group of Angel City FC. New owners Bob Iger and Willow Bay acquired a controlling stake in the team in July, with a value of $250 million. 


King recently joined forces with Mark and Kimba Walter to create the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), which will launch its second season in late November. U.S. Olympic gold medalist Kendall Coyne Schofield reached out to King to help unify the fractured pro hockey landscape into one viable league. King, who is part of the Dodgers' ownership group, collaborated with Walter to form the new six-team league. 


The WNBA rookie class, led by No. 1 pick Caitlin Clark, will receive the Next Gen Award for "showing up, showing out and boldly carrying the torch forward." The popularity of Indiana's Clark and Chicago's Angel Reese generated unprecedented WNBA attendance, more nationally televised games and record-breaking TV ratings this summer. 


"Caitlin Clark is fantastic," King said. "It reminds me of Chris Evert in 1971, when she changed everything at the U.S Open. Anytime a player can do well, she helps everybody." 


The rookie class includes Cameron Brink (Stanford), Kamilla Cardoso (NCAA champion South Carolina), Rickea Jackson (Tennessee), Jacy Sheldon (Ohio State), Aaliyah Edwards (Connecticut), Reese (Louisiana State) and Alissa Pili (Utah). 


The WNBA lags in pay equity, with Clark receiving only $76,000 in her rookie season compared with the NBA No. 1 pick, who gets $12 million. WNBA players may see an increase in salary in 2026 from a new 11-year media rights deal for approximately $200 million a year ahead of the next collective bargaining agreement. The players' union is interested in increasing the WNBA revenue share from 9.3%, while NBA players receive about 50% of the money generated from TV deals, ticket sales, merchandise and licensing. 


King said it might take more time to close the pay gaps because women's sports is "still in its infancy." 


"The NBA is 78 years old, the WNBA is 28 years old," King said. "(Former NBA Commissioner) David Stern made a huge difference. He was a marketing genius. We need to continue to do that for women's sports." 


King and the “Original Nine” helped market the early women's professional tennis circuit, and she formed the Women's Tennis Association with players a week before Wimbledon in 1973. She advocated for Title IX, beat Bobby Riggs and fought for equal prize money in tennis. Along the way, she won 39 Grand Slam titles during her career. 


The next milestone for King, 80, will be receiving the Congressional Gold Medal. It's one of the highest U.S. civilian honors for individuals whose achievements have a lasting impact on their field. 


"The Women's Sports Foundation, nobody knew how long it would last," she said. "I look at the 50th anniversary as a continuation to create more opportunities. You can't let up."

## SCOTUS Says Biden’s Power Plant Rules Can Stay — For Now

For now. </p><p>The high court’s decision will allow the EPA to defend the rule in a lower court over the next 10 months.

In <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-1530" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>that now landmark case</u></a>, the court ruled that the EPA could restrict greenhouse gas pollution from power plants only by requiring new technology, such as carbon capture equipment, to be installed at the plant itself.

## Biden, dignitaries honor RFK widow, human rights champion Ethel Kennedy

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

washington  — U.S. President Joe Biden joined former Democratic presidents and others to honor longtime human rights advocate and storied political family matriarch Ethel Kennedy at a memorial service in Washington on Wednesday after her death last week at age 96.


The widow of Robert F. Kennedy — a former U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator, who was assassinated while seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 — founded a human rights center to carry on her husband's work.


She never remarried and went on to raise her 11 children, enduring a host of other family tragedies along the way, including separate plane crashes that killed her parents, brother and nephew, as well as the untimely deaths of several of her children, grandchildren and a great-grandchild.


She and her husband were devastated by the assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, in Dallas in 1963.


Biden, a fellow Irish Catholic who has leaned on his faith amid his own losses, including the death of his son Beau, said the Democratic family matriarch was there for him at his time of tragedy. He said her husband had been one of his heroes.


"Ethel was a hero in her own right," Biden said in remarks at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, just blocks from the White House.


Former Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others, also reflected on her life.


The son of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated just two months before Robert Kennedy, noted the two families' shared journey and understanding of sacrifice amid their work for social justice.


"Faith and history knitted us together. Respect and love has kept us together," Martin Luther King III told the crowd.




The Kennedys were known for their parties and Wednesday's service was no different, with scores of relatives filling the pews and high-profile attendees remembering the infectious spirit highlighted by her children and grandchildren.


"She was a spitfire," Obama said. "As serious as Ethel was about righting wrongs, she never seemed to take herself too seriously."


Other Democratic attendees included California Governor Gavin Newsom and former top U.S. diplomat and presidential candidate John Kerry. Country star Kenny Chesney sang "You Are My Sunshine" while Sting surprised guests with "Fragile" and Stevie Wonder with "Isn't She Lovely."


Over the decades, Kennedy took up many causes championed by her late husband, including fighting poverty, working for social justice and protecting the environment. Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. She died on October 10 from complications following a stroke, her family said.


Her daughter Kathleen Kennedy Townsend was Maryland's lieutenant governor, while her son Joseph P. Kennedy II represented Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives. Her grandson, former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, serves as special envoy to Northern Ireland.


Her son Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine advocate and former independent presidential candidate, broke from his family's long Democratic ties to endorse Donald Trump in November's election.


Many members of the Kennedy clan have denounced his election politics and backed the Democratic ticket, now led by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris after Biden stepped aside in July. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended Wednesday's service alongside his family but made no remarks.

## FBI, French authorities coordinate on Islamic State arrests

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

washington  — Recent arrests in the United States and in Europe have law enforcement and intelligence agencies on alert, bolstering concerns about a reinvigorated Islamic State terror group bent on lashing out against the West.


FBI officials Wednesday confirmed the bureau shared information with French authorities following last week’s arrest of 27-year-old Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, an Afghan national in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on charges connected to a mass shooting plot in the name of the Islamic State group, to coincide with the U.S. election in November.




That information led to the arrest of a 22-year-old Afghan national in the Haute-Garonne region of France, who French officials say is linked to Tawhedi.




That arrest followed the arrests of three other men in the same region, again carried out in coordination with the U.S.

French anti-terrorism prosecutors said Saturday that the suspects, all of whom are said to be followers of the Islamic State, appear to have been involved in a plan to carry out an attack on a football stadium or a shopping center.


“The recent arrests in France and by the FBI's Oklahoma City field office demonstrate the importance of partnerships to detect and disrupt potential terrorist attacks,” the FBI said in a statement.


“The FBI's top priority is preventing acts of terrorism, and we are committed to working with our partners both overseas and in the United States to uncover any plots and protect our communities from violence,” it said.


The arrests follow repeated warnings from Western counterterrorism officials that the Islamic State, also known as IS or ISIS, has set its sights on launching attacks against the U.S. and Europe. And many have raised specific concerns about the group’s Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan or ISIS-K.


IS-Khorasan "does have the intention to carry out external attacks, including external attacks inside the United States,” said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen, speaking during a Washington Post webcast last month.


“We are very concerned about the capacity of ISIS-K to potentially move operatives into the United States," he added.




Others have warned that IS, and IS-Khorasan, have each sought to expand recruiting efforts around the globe.


Some Western officials and regional observers have told VOA that as far back as 2021, the IS Afghan affiliate was seeking to seed Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan with small but highly capable cells and networks that could serve as the basis for future attacks.


Some also have warned that IS-Khorasan has since built on those efforts, increasingly trying to target Afghans and Central Asians living in the West.




"We've seen ISIS-K make a concerted effort to recruit from diaspora communities," said Austin Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center, or NCITE, speaking with VOA last week following the Oklahoma City arrest.


“It will be another important factor to watch as more information becomes available.”

## Colleagues of slain Las Vegas reporter relieved as killer gets 28-year sentence

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

washington — Colleagues of a slain Las Vegas reporter have expressed relief about the sentencing of the onetime elected official who killed him.


A district court in Clark County, Nevada, on Wednesday sentenced Robert Telles, a former county public administrator, to 28 years in prison for murdering Jeff German.


A jury in August convicted Telles of stabbing German to death outside the reporter's home. German, who worked for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, had covered misconduct in Telles' office and had exposed a relationship the official was having with a co-worker.


Telles denied killing German, but prosecutors presented evidence at the trial, including his DNA under the journalist's fingernails.


"The judge couldn't sentence him to any more time," Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson told reporters, adding that the sentence represented justice for the community. "She gave him the maximum." 


German's colleagues welcomed the sentencing.


"There is relief in the Las Vegas Review-Journal's offices because Robert Telles finally is headed to prison, hopefully for the rest of his life," the paper's executive editor, Glenn Cook, said in a statement shared with VOA.


"His [Telles'] steadfast refusal to accept responsibility or show a hint of remorse for the barbaric murder of Jeff German should ensure he is never paroled. We'll never forget Jeff. His killing remains an immeasurable loss for his family, friends, colleagues and community, and for journalism itself,” Cook said.


Telles is the first former elected official in the U.S. to be convicted of the murder of an American journalist.  


He had been the subject of German's coverage of misconduct in 2022 and later lost a primary election for a second term. 


Prosecutor Pamela Weckerly told the judge that evidence showed Telles killed German because "he didn't like what Mr. German had written about him. He felt that Mr. German had cost him an elected position." 


"This type of violence, this sort of political violence," the prosecutor said, "is unacceptable and dangerous for a community as a whole." 


The National Press Club in Washington said the sentence "marks a decisive victory for press freedom and a salient reminder that violence against journalists will never go unanswered." 


"Those who seek to silence the vital work of journalists through brutality will face swift and severe consequences. The message should be clear: If you try to silence a journalist with violence, you will be arrested, convicted and sentenced to the full extent of the law," said club president Emily Wilkins.  


The Committee to Protect Journalists described the case as a "significant milestone in the quest for justice." 


"German's murder by a county politician is a stark reminder of the dangers that journalists – especially local reporters worldwide – face simply for doing their jobs and reporting on matters of public interest," said Katherine Jacobsen, who covers the U.S. for the media watchdog.  


When he appeared before the judge on Wednesday, Telles offered condolences to German's family but denied any wrongdoing.


German, 69, had built a solid reputation as an investigative reporter in Las Vegas, where he focused on crime and corruption.  He was found stabbed outside his home on September 2, 2022. 


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.

## The Collapse of the Northeast’s Biggest Hydrogen Plant

date: 2024-10-16, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgyNzM0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODI3NTI0M30.u7mAdj28fSlnlkcy2rkR_jL0b5Fn8CSVoLhrzcAwlVc/image.jpg?width=2160&height=1440&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">In 2021, top elected officials in New York state promised that Plug Power, a nascent company in the growing hydrogen industry, would build a large hydrogen fuel production facility in the Buffalo-Rochester area. It was supposed to make the state an industry leader. </p>
<p>Today, the project is looking more like a warning sign about the perils of being a first-mover in the unproven hydrogen business. </p>
<p>It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Plug Power, an American hydrogen and fuel cell producer founded in 1997, believed it would capitalize on rising demand for the liquid fuel when it broke ground at its hydrogen production facility at Genesee County’s Science, Technology and Advanced Manufacturing Park <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-construction-start-largest-green-hydrogen-plant-north-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in 2021</u></a>, a project known colloquially as STAMP. Heavy polluting industries like steel and transportation were chomping at the bit to strike supply deals for hydrogen, a liquid fuel that produces no carbon when burned. And this New York plant would on paper be particularly attractive from a climate perspective: It would be powered by hydroelectric dams <a href="https://www.thebatavian.com/press-release/gcedc-and-national-grid-announce-growth-at-stamp-site/635653" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at Niagara Falls</u></a>, offering a potential carbon reduction of an estimated 14,000 tons of CO2 per year. It would also be the largest project of its kind in the Northeast. </p>
<p>Three years later and the project appears to be on ice, according to a phone call recording between New York county officials and a real estate developer that was obtained by Heatmap News. </p>
<p>Construction stopped in January, per the call, as did work Plug Power promised to do on an electrical substation that will also power a neighboring semiconductor manufacturing plant. Now energy-hungry data center developers are bidding to pick up the substation work instead in exchange for a spot at STAMP and access to some of the remaining hydroelectricity, and county officials are looking at buying <a href="https://www.gcedc.com/file-library/100268/9.4.24.GCEDC.STAMP.MeetingMinutes.Draft.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Plug Power’s electrical equipment</u></a>. </p>
<p>It is unclear whether the hydrogen production plant will ever be completed. </p>
<p>“They’ve put things on hold and now we’re coming to pick up the pieces,” Chris Suozzi, an executive vice president at the Genessee County Economic Development Authority, told one bidder – PRP Real Estate Management – on a call last month. PRP taped the call and shared it with us after it was first reported by local <a href="https://www.investigativepost.org/2024/10/09/money-woes-at-plugpower-more-headaches-at-stamp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>news nonprofit </u><u><em><em>InvestigativePost</em></em></u></a>. Suozzi also said on the call: “They’re not ready to go. They’re on pause. We don’t know what’s going to happen with them at this point.” </p>
<p>The New York Plug Power plant’s problems should be familiar to anyone in the climate tech startup space but for the unfamiliar, the company’s rapid growth seems to have run headlong into struggles with cash. A year ago Plug Power said in <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001093691/f2d39c6a-e710-49a7-923e-4634d2de39f1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an investor filing</u></a> there was a “substantial” concern the company may not have “sufficient funds to fund [its] operations through the next 12 months.” So problematic are Plug’s financial woes that they’ve become a political target; after the Energy Department offered a $1.6 billion conditional loan commitment to Plug for building hydrogen production plants, Republicans in Congress called for <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/6/barrasso-requests-inspector-general-investigation-into-doe-loan-commitment-to-plug-power-inc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an inspector general investigation</u></a> into the move. <br/><br/>But the New York production facility won’t benefit from the potential loan either. We’ve learned from two sources familiar with the matter that the project is not included in its potential loan application currently pending before DOE. </p>
<p>Then there has been the rollout of the Inflation Reduction Act. Even though the project relies on carbon-free hydropower, it may not qualify for the IRA’s hydrogen production <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>tax credit</u></a> because of proposed requirements for fuel to rely on new renewable energy sources (known as “additionality”). This has been a major sticking point in implementation of the credit, and Plug Power is quoted in <em><em>InvestigativePost</em></em> last week linking the work stoppage at the production facility on waiting for the final regulation implementing the credit. This is even as the company uses the yet-to-be finalized credit in its financial analyses for other <a href="https://www.ir.plugpower.com/press-releases/news-details/2024/Plug-to-Receive-Federal-Clean-Hydrogen-Production-Tax-Credit-at-Georgia-Hydrogen-Facility/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hydrogen facilities in operation</u></a> today, like this <a href="https://www.ir.plugpower.com/press-releases/news-details/2024/Plug-Power-Starts-Production-of-Liquid-Green-Hydrogen-at-its-Georgia-Plant/default.aspx#:~:text=Located%20in%20Woodbine%2C%20Georgia%2C%20the,separated%20into%20hydrogen%20and%20oxygen." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one in Georgia</u></a>. </p>
<p>Environmental justice issues have also been a drag on development. The native Tonawanda Seneca Nation is <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22112023/new-york-clean-hydrogen-indigenous-nation-sees-threat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>opposed</u></a> to the entire industrial park because of the resulting impacts on wildlife, noise and the visual landscape. In April, the Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://www.investigativepost.org/2024/04/25/feds-revoke-major-permit-for-stamp-industrial-park/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>revoked a necessary permit</u></a> for a wastewater treatment pipeline that would be used by companies at the park. </p>
<p>Earthjustice attorney Alex Page – who is working with the Nation to fight the project – told me the tribe was told last year by the Energy Department that Plug Power had withdrawn the New York site from its loan application. The Nation will continue to fight the project and DOE’s loan financing to Plug Power on the chance that money could be reprogrammed to the industrial park. Page said: “The Nation remains very, very much opposed.” </p>
<p>We sent Plug Power multiple requests for comment as well as Suozzi. A representative for Plug Power declined to answer questions about the project. I got a text from a number listed for Suozzi asking to chat later, but I didn’t hear back before publication. </p>

## US Supreme Court declines to pause EPA power plant emissions rule

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Wednesday to put on hold a new federal rule targeting carbon pollution from coal- and gas-fired power plants at the request of numerous states and industry groups in another major challenge to President Joe Biden's efforts to combat climate change.


The justices denied emergency requests by West Virginia, Indiana and 25 other states — most of them Republican led — as well as power companies and industry associations, to halt the Environmental Protection Agency rule while litigation continues in a lower court. The regulation, aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, took effect July 8.


The rule would require existing coal and new natural gas-fired plants eventually to reduce emissions including by capturing and storing carbon dioxide.


The EPA's new rule, issued under the landmark Clean Air Act anti-pollution law, was issued two years after a major ruling by the Supreme Court in 2022 undercut the agency's power to issue sweeping regulations to force an electricity-generation shift from coal to cleaner energy sources.


The EPA has said efforts to address climate change and its impacts such as extreme weather and rising sea levels must include the power sector because fossil fuel-fired plants make up 25% of overall domestic greenhouse gas emissions.


Notably, the rule mandates that coal plants operating past 2038 and certain new gas plants reduce emissions by 90% by 2032 including by using carbon capture and storage systems that extract carbon dioxide from plant exhaust and sequester it underground.


The EPA has called the technology proven and technically feasible. The rule's challengers have said it has not been shown effective at the scale predicted by the EPA.


The rule's requirements are "really a backdoor avenue to forcing coal plants out of existence," West Virginia, a major coal producer, and other state challengers said in a written filing.


The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling was based on what is called the "major questions" legal doctrine embraced by its conservative justices that requires explicit congressional authorization for action on issues of broad importance and societal impact.


The states and certain other challengers contend that the EPA's new rule likewise implicates a major question and exceeds the agency's authority.


Numerous states and industry players filed multiple lawsuits challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which on July 19 denied requests to pause the regulation pending its review.


The case did not implicate a major question because the EPA's actions setting plant limits were "well within" its statutory authority, the D.C. Circuit stated.

## A Battery Ban, Burning Man, and Lots More Yelling

San Diego County, California </strong>– The battery backlash just got stronger after the city of Escondido, California, indefinitely banned permits to the entire sector in reaction to a <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/california-sdge-battery-fire-was-well-managed-caused-minimal-impact/" target="_blank"><u>battery fire</u></a> last month. </p><ul><li>Last week, the city council enacted a 45-day moratorium on permits to construction and operation of battery energy storage systems, or BESS. The moratorium will impact AES Corporation’s Seguro storage project, as well as at least one more pending project, according to staff testimony at the city council meeting on the matter.</li><li>But for AES and anyone else who hopes this ends quickly, some bad news: Staff also testified it’ll take <em><em>much</em></em> longer than 45 days to prepare a report outlining next steps due to the outstanding government workload – and that’ll just be the idea generation phase of the city’s response. A 10-month moratorium was discussed as a potential next step.</li><li>“I don’t think any of us up here are adamantly opposed to battery energy storage systems,” the city’s Republican mayor Dane White said at the meeting. “However, it has to be done the right way.”</li></ul><p><strong>2. Waldo County, Maine</strong> – The potential first floating offshore wind assembly site in America is now one step further in the permitting process, after Maine’s Department of Transportation <a href="https://www.maine.gov/mdot/projects/searsport/windport/docs/Maine%20OSWP_Pre-Application%20Alternative%20Analysis_Draft-October%202024.pdf" target="_blank"><u>released a pre-application alternatives analysis</u></a> required for federal environmental reviews. </p><ul><li>The Maine DOT report defends the selection of Sears Island for the project.

According to the report, the Mack Point alternative would cost more and “limit any future plans for growth.”</li><li>“[It] presents problematic design features that greatly reduce its operational functionality and effectively preclude its use,” the report stated.</li><li>This effectively begins the state and federal environmental permitting process for the Sears Island port project. On its end, the state is also preparing a broader draft environmental review.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Dickinson County, Kansas </strong>– This one county may be a bellwether for future problems in Kansas, a state with many existing wind farms — and even more potential — but also a lot of opposition. </p><ul><li>Activists stormed a community meeting <a href="https://www.kwch.com/2024/10/11/proposed-wind-farm-project-prompts-massive-turnout-dickinson-county-meeting/" target="_blank"><u>late last week</u></a> on deciding whether to move forward with Enel Green Power’s 334-megawatts Hope Ridge wind farm. If county planners reject the project, it’ll potentially come with a two-year moratorium on wind. Enel has several operating wind farms in Kansas, including Diamond Vista, which is in the adjacent Marion County. (Marion’s got its own moratorium now, too).</li><li>Despite existing generation, Dickinson County is one of the riskier places in the United States for <em><em>new</em></em> renewable energy development, according to Heatmap Pro’s analytics, thanks to its demographic, economic, and geographic similarities to other opposed counties.</li><li>At the top of the meeting, Enel project developer Jon Beck laid out a laundry list of reasons to build the project including jobs and tax revenue. “This area has been really favorable for a lot of reasons, and that’s why we continue here,” Beck said.</li><li>But while some in attendance supported the development, lots of testimony opposing the project stretched the hearing beyond the five-hour mark. (Pray for me, I listened back to the tape).</li><li>There’s a follow-up meeting this week. And Enel clearly takes this development seriously, because they sent me a lengthy statement about the opposition to Hope Ridge.</li><li>“Throughout this process, we’ve worked to show the Dickinson County community that wind power has been a huge success story for Kansas, bringing billions of dollars in economic impact largely targeted to rural areas,” the statement read. “Our landowners and community partners at Diamond Vista, just down the road, have seen how our project has provided new jobs, better roads, and more local funding over the last six years.”</li><li>It continued: “We understand many people in Dickinson County have concerns, but we also have a lot of supporters in the county — including our landowners — who are counting on us to make the case for this project. We hope to earn the support of the Planning Commission this week."</li></ul><p><strong>4.

## Renewable Energy’s Gloomy Election

<strong>IRA on the mind </strong>– The renewable energy ecosystem is starting to really sound alarm bells about the November election and the risks of what they’re calling a “clean energy plan repeal” – e.g. scrapping IRA credits and carbon pollution rules.
</p><ul>
<li>Yesterday, the nonprofit E2 <a href="https://e2.org/reports/survey-business-impact-of-ira-repeal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a survey</a> of industry leaders that found more than half would “lose business or revenue” from such a repeal and more than 20% would have to lay off employees. </li>
<li>Climate Power then sent out the survey in an email blast that read in big bold letters: “ICYMI: Business Leaders Say Repealing the Clean Energy Plan Would Lead to Mass Layoffs, Major Blow to Business.” </li>
<li>This is some classic Washington messaging prep clearly in the event of a less-than-favorable outcome in the election.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>No Golden climate bill – </strong>However, if Kamala Harris and the Democrats <em><em>do </em></em>win in November, I’m bearish on the odds of another big piece of renewables stimulus passing through Congress next term.
</p><ul>
<li>That’s because of moderate Democrat Jared Golden of Maine, who said in a <em><em>Politico</em></em> profile yesterday that he would oppose his party moving to another piece of major climate legislation if they held power. </li>

<li>Given the odds of a major blue wave are exceedingly low, a Democratic majority would probably be thin – so thin that Golden would easily get his way.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Data center moratoriums – </strong>Energy demand for tech may be a driver of renewables development across the country, but data centers are starting to face moratoria fights of their own.
</p><ul>
<li>In Indiana, the activist group Citizens Action Coalition called for a state-wide ban on new data centers for artificial intelligence, arguing they waste electricity and no longer fit the budgetary boundaries of an existing state tax exemption on data centers. </li>

## Biden to travel to Germany this week, Angola in December for visits delayed by Hurricane Milton

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden is heading to Germany Thursday and will visit Angola the first week in December, rescheduling visits that were postponed so he could remain in Washington to monitor the federal response to Hurricane Milton as it struck Florida.


The White House confirmed Biden will depart for his quick trip to Berlin on Thursday. It will offer him the opportunity to huddle with his key ally, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, about their countries' support for Ukraine in its war with Russia as the conflict is at another critical moment.


Biden's initial itinerary for the postponed trip included a meeting on the war in Ukraine with allied nations at an American military base in Germany before he was to continue on to Angola.




The White House says that the gathering of representatives of the allied nations, partners in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, will instead take place virtually next month. Still, the war in Ukraine will loom large during Biden's time in Berlin this week.


Biden spoke by phone Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but they will not meet while the president is in Germany.


The two leaders discussed Zelenskyy's "victory plan," shortly after the Ukrainian leader presented it to his parliament . Zelenskyy is scheduled to present the five-point plan to the European Council on Thursday.


Zelenskyy had previously spoken to Biden about the proposal.


The plan includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv's allies so far.


The White House on Wednesday declined to comment about the plan.


"We're going to let the Ukrainians speak to their victory plan," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. "What we're going to continue to do is show our support for the Ukrainians on the battlefield as they continue to beat back Russia."


Zelenskyy said in a statement following the call he also spoke to Biden about the U.S. and Ukraine potentially exploring ways to produce weapons together.


The Biden administration also announced a further $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine, bringing its total to more than $64 billion in the two and a half years since Russia's invasion. Wednesday's package includes surface-to-air missiles to protect Ukrainian infrastructure from Russian attacks and long range rockets and artillery to help its war effort.


Biden and Scholz recently spoke by phone to discuss the need for the countries to "continue our strong collaboration on geopolitical priorities, including supporting Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression," according to the White House.


Jean-Pierre said the trip was important to Biden, in part because of Germany's help with a complicated hostage swap with Russia.


"The president really wanted to make sure to go to Germany to thank Chancellor Scholz directly," she said.


Scholz in a speech before the German parliament on Wednesday said he was looking forward to Biden's visit. "I would like to say that … President Biden stands for an incredible improvement in cooperation over recent years," said Scholz, adding that he was grateful for the "good collaboration" forged with the Democratic president.


There's a significant measure of anxiety in Europe about what next month's U.S. presidential election could mean for Ukraine.


Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has been in lockstep with Biden about the need to maintain robust economic and military support for Ukraine. Republican Donald Trump has said he would move to quickly to end the war the war with Russia should he regain the White House.


Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has said that the plan would include establishing a "demilitarized zone" and that Ukraine would not reclaim territory that Russia occupies and would agree not to join NATO.


Scholz has been one of Biden's closest global allies.


In addition to his robust support for Ukraine, Scholz played a critical role in helping free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, corporate security executive Paul Whelan, and others from Russian prisons in a multinational prisoner swap.


As part of the biggest prisoner exchange in post-Soviet history, Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.


Biden has not visited Africa since taking office in early 2021.


Jean-Pierre said the coming visit to Luanda aims to "recognize Angola's role as a strategic partner and regional leader, and discuss increased collaboration on security, health, and economic partnerships."

## US Navy fighter jet with two on board crashes during training in Washington state

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Navy searched Wednesday through mountainous terrain for two crew members who were aboard a fighter jet that crashed in Washington state during a routine training flight.


The EA-18G Growler jet from the Electronic Attack Squadron crashed east of Mount Rainier at about 3:23 p.m. Tuesday, according to Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. Search teams, including a U.S. Navy MH-60S helicopter, launched from NAS Whidbey Island to try to find the crew and examine the crash site.


Navy searchers were joined by Yakima County tribal and local authorities as they pored over an area of about 48 kilometers (30 miles) west of Yakima in cloudy weather with low visibility, the Navy said. As of late Wednesday morning, they hadn't found the wreckage or crew, officials said in a news release.


Navy officials said they didn't know if the two crew members managed to eject before the crash, which remains under investigation.


The EA-18G Growler is similar to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and includes sophisticated electronic warfare devices. Most of the Growler squadrons are based at Whidbey Island. One squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.


The "Zappers" were recently deployed on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower.


The search Wednesday was happening in rainy and cloudy weather near Mount Rainier, a towering active volcano that is blanketed in snowfields and glaciers year-round.


The first production of the Growler was delivered to Whidbey Island in 2008. In the last 15 years, it has operated around the globe supporting major actions, the Navy said. The plane seats a pilot in front and an electronics operator behind them.


"The EA-18G Growler aircraft we fly represents the most advanced technology in airborne Electronic Attack and stands as the Navy's first line of defense in hostile environments," the Navy said on its website. Each aircraft costs about $67 million.


Military aircraft training exercises and travel can be dangerous and sometimes result in crashes, injuries and deaths.


In May, an F-35 fighter jet on its way from Texas to Edwards Air Force Base near Los Angeles crashed after the pilot stopped to refuel in New Mexico. The pilot was the only person on board in that case and was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.


Last year, eight U.S. Air Force special Operations Command service members were killed when a CV-22B Osprey aircraft they were flying in crashed off the coast of Japan.

## The Transmission Study Making the Rounds on the Hill

date: 2024-10-16, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgyNzI5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NjgzNzY5M30.jjIx8tdp15PxZxa07BgmmiWrXunh_gf5fFxO9K4Fx2Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=40%2C0%2C40%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>This week’s conversation is with Ray Long, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, or ACORE. A representative of one of Washington’s most influential climate tech policy trade groups, Long is also a seasoned veteran of the energy sector across fossil and carbon-free power and now an industry thought leader based in Washington. I caught up with him at ACORE’s Grid Forum last week and asked him how companies are doing against NIMBYs. </p>
<p><strong>Developers of gas infrastructure – are they spending more, less, or the same as renewable energy developers on community engagement? Who spends more on community engagement? </strong></p>
<p>I just don’t know. I have no idea. It’s hard to gauge. And let’s talk about why – each company doesn’t disclose how much they spend on community engagement. You know, it’s not like you can go see who is registered to lobby in different areas, it’s not clear. I suppose you could go back after the fact and look at community benefit funds and those sorts of things that get put together but I’m just not sure if that’ll give you the snapshot that you’re looking for. </p>
<p><strong>I’m curious if you feel if developers in renewable energy are spending enough of their capital on getting the consent of host communities. </strong></p>
<p>Having worked for a renewable developer I can only speak from the perspective of the experience I had there. My sense is, across the industry, you’ve got different levels of companies that have different levels of sophistication and different levels of capabilities to do those things. And I’ll say this: even the sophisticated companies that are going in early, having the conversations and doing all the things that I would say would be a strategic way to getting it done… even they’re running into opposition. I don’t think it’s really any different than some of the fossil plants in my experience where there has been politicization. </p>
<p><strong>Given the various degrees of sophistication and the various degrees of capacity, how would you score the renewable energy industry’s success rate at dealing with project opposition? </strong></p>
<p>One of the places you can look at data is NEPA – the environmental impact statements. You know that NEPA impacts wind, solar, transmission, and fossil. Stanford [University] did this <a href="https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/publication/nepa-litigation-over-large-energy-and-transport-infrastructure-projects" target="_blank">really interesting study</a> where they looked back 10 years and they pulled all the environmental impact statements that had been submitted and then they graphed it, and they looked at it from the standpoint of which projects had been delayed, litigated, and ultimately canceled. Going in, if you go into Democratic offices and you talk to them in Washington, the impression a lot of us had was, I’d guess fossil projects would be the first. They’d be delayed the most, litigated the most, canceled the most. But it wasn’t. It was solar, wind… fossil’s fourth. That study was fascinating. That’s one of those things making the rounds now on the Hill as Democratic offices are considering the permitting and transmission bill. </p>
<p><strong>But so many of these projects don’t require a NEPA review. How is the industry doing when it comes to dealing with the local county clerks? </strong></p>
<p>I think it really depends on which technology, which company is going in. What’s their approach to it. It’s really hard to give a grade to the industry as a whole. </p>
<p><strong>What would you say to a developer on best practices for community engagement in your view? </strong></p>
<p>Number one, go into a community as soon as you think you have a project you’re going into. Start to talk to local people there about what their interests are and understand why. You’ve got to have a sense of curiosity, and develop an understanding of what people’s motivators are. </p>
<p>The second thing is hire local. Get some local people that you’re going to work with, who understand the community and can best advise you on it. <br/><br/>The third thing is, as you look to pull your project together and you think about your permitting structure, start to build in those things that the community cares about. Only then, when you have a line of sight on doing that, start the permitting process. </p>
<p><strong>I certainly hope companies heed your advice.</strong></p>
<p>Well if you look at the success record, companies that do that have a higher success record than those who don’t. </p>

## Defense contractor to pay $252M penalty to resolve Qatar bribery charges

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — RTX Corporation, the defense contractor formerly known as Raytheon, has agreed to pay the U.S. government $252 million to resolve criminal charges alleging it paid bribes to secure contracts with Qatar, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.


The company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement on charges of violating the anti-bribery provision of the Foreign Corruption Practices Act and the Arms Export Control Act.


It also agreed to pay a $52.5 million civil penalty to resolve a parallel Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and must forfeit at least $37 million to satisfy both probes.


At a brief hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, lawyers for RTX waived their right to an indictment and pleaded not guilty to both counts. They did not object to any of the allegations in court documents filed in conjunction with the agreement.


Under the agreement, the company will have to demonstrate good conduct for the next 3½ years and foster a culture of ethics and compliance with anti-corruption laws.


Messages seeking comment were left for RTX Corporation and the Qatari Embassy in Washington.


RTX said in a July regulatory filing that it set aside $1.24 billion to resolve pending legal and regulatory matters. The company's president and CEO, Christopher Calio, told investors that the investigations largely involved issues that predated the Raytheon-United Technologies merger that formed the current company in 2020.


"These matters primarily arose out of legacy Raytheon Company and Rockwell Collins prior to the merger and acquisition of these companies," Calio said. "We've already taken robust corrective actions to address the legacy gaps that led to these issues."


According to court documents, Raytheon employees and agents offered and paid bribes to a foreign official between 2012 and 2016 to gain an advantage in obtaining lucrative business deals with the Qatar Emiri Air Force and Qatar Armed Forces.


The company then succeeded in securing four additions to an existing contract with the Gulf Cooperation Council — a regional union of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — and a $510 million sole-sourced contract to build a joint-operations center for the Qatari military, the court documents said.


Raytheon made about $36.7 million in profit from the Gulf Cooperation Council contract additions and anticipated making more than $72 million on the joint operations center, but the Qatari government ultimately did not go forward with the deal, prosecutors said.


Wednesday's penalty is just the latest legal fallout from RTX's business dealings.


According to court and regulatory filings, the company is expected to soon enter into another deferred prosecution agreement to resolve civil and criminal investigations in Massachusetts into defective pricing claims for Raytheon contracts dating from 2011 to 2017.


In August, the company agreed to pay $200 million to the State Department after voluntarily disclosing more than two dozen alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Among the allegations were that the company provided classified military aircraft data to China and that employees took company-issued laptops containing information about missiles and aircraft into Iran, Lebanon and Russia.

## Listeria recall grows to 5.4 million kilograms of meat and poultry

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

A nationwide recall of meat and poultry products potentially contaminated with listeria has expanded to nearly 15.4 million kilograms (12 million pounds) and now includes ready-to-eat meals sent to U.S. schools, restaurants and major retailers, federal officials said.


The updated recall includes prepared salads, burritos and other foods sold at stores including Costco, Trader Joe's, Target, Walmart and Kroger. The meat used in those products was processed at a Durant, Oklahoma, manufacturing plant operated by BrucePac. The Woodburn, Oregon-based company sells precooked meat and poultry to industrial, foodservice and retail companies across the country.


Routine testing found potentially dangerous listeria bacteria in samples of BrucePac chicken, officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department said. No illnesses have been confirmed in connection with the recall, USDA officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not launched an outbreak investigation, a spokesperson said.


The recall, issued on October 9, includes foods produced between May 31 and October 8. The USDA has posted a 342-page list of hundreds of potentially affected foods, including chicken wraps sold at Trader Joe's, chicken burritos sold at Costco and many types of salads sold at stores such as Target and Walmart. The foods were also sent to school districts and restaurants across the country.


The recalled foods can be identified by establishment numbers "51205 or P-51205" inside or under the USDA mark of inspection. Consumers can search on the USDA recall site to find potentially affected products. Such foods should be thrown away or returned to stores for refunds, officials said.


Eating foods contaminated with listeria can cause potentially serious illness. About 1,600 people are infected with listeria bacteria each year in the U.S. and about 260 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


Listeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food. The infections are especially dangerous for older people, those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant.


The same type of bacteria is responsible for an outbreak tied to Boar's Head deli meat that has killed at least 10 people since May.

## Two US radio stations end Russian-backed 'propaganda' programming

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Russian-backed radio programmer Sputnik no longer broadcasts in the Washington market after years of criticism that its local radio station, WZHF, carries antisemitic content and false information about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.


Political cartoonist Ted Rall, who described himself as a guest on Sputnik’s programming, posted a comment Tuesday on X: “Biden/Harris say they're fighting for democracy. Yet: today Sputnik News US is being forced to shut down today due to Biden/Harris sanctions. My radio show and cartoons for them are being quashed. So are the other amazing shows. I go off the air with the station at noon.” 


Manila Chan, a self-described indie journalist, tweeted Tuesday that she and Rall would be relaunching their show on YouTube “following sanctions that have shut down RT+Sputnik.” 


As first reported by The Desk, a news website on the business of streaming media, Sputnik stopped programming in its Washington-based market and three stations in the Kansas City, Missouri, area this week. 


Last month, the U.S. State Department introduced new sanctions on Russian-backed broadcasters, including television channel RT, for fundraising on behalf of the Russian military in opposition to Ukraine. The sanctions marked the first time the United States accused Russian broadcasters of providing direct and material military support. 


“RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda disinformation efforts, to remain hidden. Our most powerful antidote to Russia’s lies is the truth. It’s shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month.  


The sanctions did not specifically prohibit the content of the programming but made it more difficult for Sputnik to continue buying airtime on U.S. stations. 


“As Foreign Missions Act-designated entities, Rossiya Segodnya, RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik will be required to notify the State Department of all personnel working in the United States. The entities will also be required to disclose all real property they hold within the United States,” said the State Department in a September 4 statement. 


RT and RT America, the TV and digital media company founded by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2005, directs Sputnik. Prior to this week, five U.S. radio stations carried Russian government-backed Sputnik programming. 


Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the National Association of Broadcasters said in a statement, “While the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, however, it does not prevent private actors from exercising sound, moral judgment. To that end, given the unprovoked aggression exhibited by Russia against the free and sovereign people of Ukraine, NAB calls on broadcasters to cease carrying any state-sponsored programming with ties to the Russian government or its agents.”


“While we know that airings of such programs are extremely limited, we believe that our nation must stand fully united against misinformation and for freedom and democracy across the globe,” said NAB.


In January, Republican Representative Jack Bergman called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the license of Radio Sputnik Washington affiliate WZHF (1390) and its translator W288BS at 105.5 FM. In the letter, Bergman cited a steady stream of antisemitic tropes and false information about the war in Ukraine. 


“An FCC licensee clearly has a First Amendment right to broadcast. However, that right is tempered by its obligation to broadcast programming that is in the public interest and responsive to the needs of the local community,” Bergman wrote in the letter.


He also argued the licensees “have made no effort to ascertain the needs or interests of the local community” and that their programming decisions “are based exclusively on monetary considerations.”


In 2018, three Democratic members of Congress asked then-FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to investigate Sputnik’s alleged efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 


“In Washington, D.C., listeners need only tune their radios to 105.5 FM to hear the Russian government’s effort to influence U.S. policy,” the letter from Democratic Representatives Anna Eshoo, Mike Doyle and Frank Pallone said. “Disturbingly, this means the Kremlin’s propaganda messages are being broadcast over a license granted by the FCC.” 


Pai — a Trump administration appointee — declined to investigate, saying the First Amendment prevented the FCC “from interfering with a broadcast licensee’s choice of programming, even if that programming may be objectionable to many listeners.” 


A bipartisan group of members of Congress introduced the Identifying Propaganda on Our Airwaves Act in 2018. 


“Foreign governments shouldn’t be able to hide behind shell companies to fund misinformation and propaganda on American airwaves,” said Democratic Senator Brian Schatz, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.


“By giving the FCC the authority to require disclosure of this foreign propaganda, our bipartisan bill will help stop this practice and improve programming transparency on TV and the radio,” he said.


The bill did not advance in Congress. Federal regulations already prevent foreign governments from holding U.S. broadcast licenses.

## Former US president Jimmy Carter, 100, casts vote

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

washington  — Fifteen days after turning 100, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter cast his ballot in the U.S. election on Wednesday, fulfilling an earlier declared wish to live long enough to vote for Kamala Harris.


The former Democratic leader "voted by mail," according to the Carter Center, the nonprofit he founded after he left the White House in 1981 to pursue his vision of world diplomacy.


The centenarian — who left office under a cloud of unpopularity, but has seen his star rise ever since — took advantage of early voting in his home state of Georgia, where he is receiving hospice care.


Carter had told his family earlier this year that living long enough to vote for Harris and help defeat her Republican rival, Donald Trump, was more important to him than his centennial, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.


He reached both milestones.


More than 420,000 people have cast their ballot since early voting began Tuesday in Georgia, according to Gabriel Sterling, a state election official who posted the figures at midday.


Election Day is November 5.


Carter, a one-term president, has been receiving end-of-life care in his hometown of Plains in Georgia since February last year.


He is the first former U.S. president to reach the century mark, another extraordinary milestone for the one-time peanut farmer who worked his way to the White House.

## What Makes Amazon’s Big Nuclear Deal Different

Amazon is not just buying the power that a nuclear reactor will produce after it’s completed. It’s getting involved in the projects themselves.</p><p>This has not typically been how big tech companies with commitments to reduce emissions and rapidly expanding energy needs to <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/iea-world-energy-outlook-2024" target="_self"><u>power more data centers</u></a> get involved with nuclear power.</p><p>The <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>Microsoft/Constellation deal to restart Three Mile Island</u></a> did not entail Microsoft taking on the financial and logistical burden of upgrading the plant so that it could be up and running again in a few years — for that, Constellation will be putting $1.6 billion of its own money into the plant. Instead, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal for the plant’s output, known as a power purchase agreement, which <a href="https://x.com/ArnabDatta321/status/1846539077056688503" target="_blank"><u>guarantees a price</u></a> for the plant’s product. These types of deals were pioneered by Google to support renewables projects by giving them a guaranteed income independent of how electricity prices might fluctuate in whatever market they were selling into.</p><p>Amazon’s deal, on the other hand, is a “direct investment in the Energy Northwest project,” an X-energy spokesperson told me. According to an Amazon spokesperson, that means a “capital commitment to fund development, licensing and construction of an SMR project with Energy Northwest in Washington State,” a spokesperson told me. The project would be sited near the existing Columbia Generating Station in Richland.</p><p>“This is Amazon saying, <em><em>We’re in, and we need this, and we’re putting skin in the game directly</em></em>,” Rampal said. By contrast, other nuclear deals like Microsoft’s and Google’s “send demand signals and are, <em><em>Hey, we’ll be there when you’re done</em></em>.”</p><p>Energy Northwest and X-energy signed a joint development agreement for the project last year. If all goes as planned, the finished facility could be as large as 960 megawatts from 12 X-energy 80-megawatt “modules.” Amazon could buy the electricity from up to four of the modules, totaling 320 megawatts. Amazon said that the project “will help meet the forecasted energy needs of the Pacific Northwest beginning in the early 2030s.” (Last year X-energy and Energy Northwest <a href="https://x-energy.com/media/news-releases/energy-northwest-x-energy-joint-development-agreement-xe-100" target="_blank"><u>said the project would be online</u></a> “by 2030.”)</p><p>“We’ve been working for years to develop this project at the urging of our members, and have found that taking this first, bold step is difficult for utilities, especially those that provide electricity to ratepayers at the cost of production,” Greg Cullen, Energy Northwest’s vice president for energy services and development, said in a release. “We applaud Amazon for being willing to use their financial strength, need for power, and know-how to lead the way to a reliable, carbon-free power future for the region.” </p><p>That “first, bold” step is difficult because nuclear development is notoriously risky even with proven technologies, let alone novel designs like X-energy’s. The only other small modular reactor deal in the United States, between NuScale (which has the only approved small modular reactor design) and a coalition of Mountain West utilities, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self"><u>fell through due to escalating costs</u></a>.</p><p>Amazon is also anchoring an equity investment in X-energy itself, alongside Citadel founder Ken Griffin and other investors. Amazon said its investment in X-energy “includes manufacturing capacity to develop the SMR equipment to support more than 5 gigawatts of new nuclear energy projects utilizing X-energy’s technology.”</p><p>The reactor design that Energy Northwest and X-energy plan to deploy, the Xe-100, is in the <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/licensing-activities/pre-application-activities/xe-100.html" target="_blank"><u>“pre-application” process</u></a> with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. X-energy and the NRC have been engaging with each other since 2018, according to the docket for the project.</p><p>Amazon also announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Virginia utility Dominion Energy to look into SMR projects. Earlier this year, Dominion <a href="https://news.dominionenergy.com/2024-07-10-Dominion-Energy-takes-important-step-to-determine-feasibility-of-Small-Modular-Reactor-SMR-technology-to-support-customers-needs" target="_blank"><u>put out a request for proposals for SMRs</u></a> at its existing North Anna site near Richmond, whose two reactors have a capacity of around 1,800 megawatts.</p><p>The Department of Energy has estimated that existing nuclear sites could host an additional 60 to 95 gigawatts of new nuclear power, which means the United States’ nuclear output could double without having to set up a new site for a reactor.

## Nebraska's high court says people with felony records can register to vote

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

OMAHA, Neb. — Nebraska's top election official had no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that restored the voting rights of those who have been convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision with implications for the approaching election.


In July, Secretary of State Bob Evnen ordered county election officials to reject the voter registrations of those with felony convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers. That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony sentences.


Evnen's order could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union said. Many of them reside in Nebraska's Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the race for president and Congress could be in play.


In an otherwise reliably Republican state that, unlike most others, splits its electoral votes, the district has twice awarded an electoral vote to Democratic presidential candidates — once to Barack Obama in 2008 and again to Joe Biden in 2020. In a presidential race shown by polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who wins.


Given the Omaha district's history, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Democratic groups have spent millions in the district in the hopes of securing the electoral vote — far more than former President Donald Trump and Republican groups.


The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in Nebraska is Oct. 25 and must be done in person at a voter's county election commission office. Election Day is Nov. 5.


Hilgers' opinion had said the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers, saying only the state Board of Pardons under the control of the executive branch can restore voting rights through pardons.


Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are Republicans.


The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years after they complete the terms of their sentences. 


The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied the right to vote under Evnen's directive. Because Evnen's move came only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court agreed. 


Restoring the voting rights of former felons has drawn national attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of most convicted felons. Following that, an election police unit championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 former felons. Several of them said they were confused by the arrests because they had been allowed to register to vote. 


In Tennessee, lawmakers killed a bipartisan bill this year that would have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without also restoring their gun rights. 


Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote, either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU. 


Felony disenfranchisement laws date to the Jim Crow era and mainly targeted Black people, according to experts. Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

## Growing number of young women say abortion rights top election issue

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

Since the U.S. Supreme Court sent the issue of abortion back to the states in 2022, Democrats have mobilized to protect abortion rights while Republicans have worked to restrict the procedure on religious and moral grounds. The issue is motivating voters to go to the polls this election year. VOA Congressional Correspondent Katherine Gypson has more from Nevada. Videographer: Mary Cieslak

## Welcome to the Age of Electricity

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
1. IEA: The ‘Age of Electricity’ is upon us
</h3><p>
	The world is entering the “Age of Electricity,” with low-emission energy sources on track to generate more than half of the world’s electricity by the end of the decade, according to the International Energy Agency’s new <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Energy Outlook</a>. The report examines how the energy transition would look in three different scenarios: following current energy and climate policies, fulfilling all announced climate commitments, and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. “The energy outlook is complex, multifaceted and defies a single view on how the future might unfold,” the report says. Some facts and figures:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>2</strong> – percent by which global energy demand rose in 2023. Two-thirds of that was met by fossil fuels. But under current policies, the energy demand growth rate would slow by about half by 2030.</li>
<li><strong>2 trillion</strong> – dollars being invested in clean energy projects annually, “almost double the combined amount spent on new oil, gas, and coal supply.”</li>
<li><strong>560</strong> – gigawatts of new renewable power capacity that came online in 2023, a record high.</li>
<li><strong>60</strong> – percent of the world’s new renewables capacity that China accounted for last year. </li>
<li><strong>200</strong> – clean energy trade measures introduced since 2020, up from 40 in the five years prior.</li>
<li><strong>60</strong> – cents currently spent on grids and energy storage per $1 spent on renewables. Parity is expected in the 2040s.</li>
<li><strong>750 million</strong> – people lacking access to electricity, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. “Lack of access to energy remains the most fundamental inequity in today’s energy system.”</li>
<li><strong>2.4 </strong>– degrees Celsius by which the world is on track to warm by 2100 under current policies.</li>
</ul><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><h3>2. IEA report puts data center power demand into context</h3><p>
	The IEA’s report says the world should certainly be concerned about rising electricity demand overall, but it also conveys that perhaps we should all just calm down when it comes to data center load growth driven by the rise of generative artificial intelligence, <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/iea-world-energy-outlook-2024?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote Heatmap’s Katie Brigham</a>. The report demonstrates that on a global scale, data centers are pretty trivial compared to, say, the uptick in electric vehicle adoption or increased demand for cooling. By 2030 in the base case scenario, the IEA projects that data centers will account for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth, which is roughly equal to demand growth from desalination technologies, which we see much less hand-wringing about. By comparison, the combination of rising temperatures and rising incomes could create over 1,200 terawatt-hours of additional cooling demand by 2035, more than the entire Middle East’s electricity use.
</p><h3>3. Nearly 100 still missing in North Carolina</h3><p>
	Ninety-two people are still missing in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene, Gov. Roy Cooper, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-missing-people.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said yesterday</a>. So far 95 storm-related deaths have been confirmed in the state, and thousands of people are still without power and other basic amenities. Nearly 600 roads are still closed, though this represents an improvement on the 1,200 that were closed immediately after the storm swept through the state three weeks ago. More than $99 million has been paid out in individual FEMA aid. Meanwhile, the U.S. Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-disaster-loan-program-exhausts-funds-after-hurricane-helene-2024-10-15/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drained</a> of funds after Helene. “Until Congress appropriates additional funds, the SBA is pausing new loan offers for its direct, low-interest, long-term loans to disaster survivors,” the SBA <a href="https://www.sba.gov/article/2024/10/15/sba-exhausts-funds-new-disaster-loans?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. Congress is currently in recess, and won’t return until after the presidential election.
</p><h3>4. U.S. power plant emissions declined in 2023 </h3><p>
	Emissions from America’s power plants <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-2023-data-collected-under-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" target="_blank">fell 7% last year</a> compared to 2022, according to the EPA’s annual <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/find-and-use-ghgrp-data?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program</a>. The analysis looks at reported emissions from more than 8,100 industrial facilities across the country. When compared to 2011 emissions from power plants, last year’s levels were 34% lower, “reflecting the long-term shifts in power sector fuel-stock from coal to natural gas.” On the flip side, emissions from oil and gas operations are rising. They were up 1.4% last year compared to 2022 and 16.4% on 2016 levels. For the <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16102024/alabama-coal-plant-top-greenhouse-gas-polluter-ninth-consecutive-year/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ninth year in a row</a>, Alabama Power’s James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant was the country’s largest single producer of greenhouse gas pollution in 2023.
</p><h3>5. Honda Prologue sees surge in Q3 sales</h3><p>
	Honda has surprised analysts with its remarkable Q3 EV sales. The Honda Prologue, which only entered the U.S. market this year, was the fifth best-selling EV in the country. More than 12,600 of the all-electric SUVs were sold in the last three months. “Honda has been seen as a huge EV laggard for several years,” <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/15/honda-comes-from-nowhere-scores-big-ev-sales-in-usa/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Zachary Shahan at <em><em>CleanTechnica</em></em>. But its “reputation as a leader in fuel efficiency and hybrids made it an easy sell to get customers into its first serious full electric vehicle.” Patrick George at <em><em>Inside EVs</em></em> <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/737314/honda-prologue-sales-q3-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreed</a>: “This is a nice outcome for Honda's first modern EV, but perhaps it's not too surprising. American car buyers still tend to equate Honda and Toyota with being ‘green’ car companies since both were such pioneers in the hybrid arena.”

## US police urged to embrace prevention to head off mass shootings, attacks

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. agency charged with protecting the life of the president of the United States and other high-ranking officials wants state and local law enforcement to do more to stop potential threats from escalating into violence.


And it is trying to show police agencies across the country exactly how to do it.


The U.S. Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) on Wednesday issued a new guide, encouraging law enforcement agencies to create specific units to address threatening behavior in cases where there are significant concerns, even though no laws have been broken.


The guide specifically calls for police agencies to set up what NTAC calls behavioral threat assessment units that can assess potential dangers and then provide resources to make sure individuals get help before they resort to violence.


"What our research has continuously found is that in many cases of mass violence or other forms of targeted violence, the attacker's behavior was witnessed by community bystanders, some of whom sought to report their concerns to public safety officials," said Lina Alathari, NTAC director, briefing reporters ahead of the guide's release.


"Unfortunately, many communities lack the structured systems to receive, evaluate and respond to these reports in a way that would reduce the likelihood of a violent or tragic outcome," she said.


NTAC's plea for law enforcement agencies to find ways to be more proactive is not new.


A January 2023 report that analyzed 173 mass attacks carried out over a five-year period urged communities to make it easier for witnesses to report concerns and allow for earlier intervention from crisis counselors and social services.




But the latest guidance comes as national security officials are bracing for potential violence.


The Department of Homeland Security's 2025 annual threat assessment, issued last month, warned, "The terrorism threat environment in the United States over the next year will remain high.


"The threat will continue to be characterized primarily by lone offenders or small cells motivated to violence by a combination of racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances; conspiracy theories; and personalized factors," it added.


The Secret Service has itself responded to two unrelated attempts to assassinate former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, coming under criticism for its failure to prevent one of the would-be assassins from firing eight shots and injuring Trump before he was stopped. 




Investigators in that case have said the now dead 20-year-old gunman had spent months researching assassinations and saw the former president as a "target of opportunity." 




The new guide, issued Wednesday, aims to show police agencies how to spot warning signs more quickly and find ways to intervene.


"We have seen historically that law enforcement in the United States may at times feel limited in what they can do when responding to reports of threats or other concerning behavior, particularly when that behavior does not involve criminal activity," said NTAC Assistant Chief Steven Driscoll.


"This publication represents the most comprehensive guidance ever produced on how to adapt and operationalize the Secret Services Behavioral Threat Assessment model for use by state and local law enforcement agencies," he said.


Some state law enforcement agencies have already adopted the Secret Service model.


North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation set up a behavioral analysis threat assessment unit following a 2018 shooting that killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida.




The unit works with other state agencies and the state's university system to prevent potential attacks.


The state of Hawaii has likewise created a team to intervene in cases of potential violence. And there is a similar program in Washington, the U.S. capital.


"Behavioral threat assessment methodology has been proven effective in safeguarding community time and again," Driscoll said. "Prevention happens successfully every day, and thankfully, these are stories that we never hear about, when everybody goes home safely."


As an example, Driscoll pointed to a 2021 NTAC study that looked at 67 incidents in which attacks on schools were averted due to students and community members reporting warning signs so authorities could intervene before anyone got hurt.


Despite such successes, NTAC said it does not have any data on how many communities have behavioral threat assessment units. And officials worry that too many state and local law enforcement agencies lack access to programs that allow them to step in when a threat has been identified but no law has been broken.


Some federal funding, though, is available.


The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it has awarded almost $90 million through its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program since 2020.


And NTAC's Alathari said the specialized units can be effective, even when people and resources are scarce.


"Behavioral assessment units are able to vary in size," she said in response to a question from VOA. "An agency with limited resources to establish this kind of unit could begin with just a single designated violence prevention officer who maintains the responsibility of gathering information, information to manage situations that might revolve around potential violence."

## Chinese cyber association calls for review of Intel products sold in China

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — Intel products sold in China should be subject to a security review, the Cybersecurity Association of China (CSAC) said on Wednesday, alleging the U.S. chipmaker has "constantly harmed" the country's national security and interests. 


While CSAC is an industry group rather than a government body, it has close ties to the Chinese state and the raft of accusations against Intel, published in a long post on its official WeChat group, could trigger a security review from China's powerful cyberspace regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). 


"It is recommended that a network security review is initiated on the products Intel sells in China, so as to effectively safeguard China's national security and the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese consumers," CSAC said. 


Last year, the CAC barred domestic operators of key infrastructure from buying products made by U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc after deeming the company's products had failed its network security review. 


Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's shares were down 2.7% in U.S. premarket trading.

## Talking Permitting Reform, Trade, and More With Biden’s Top Climate Advisor

date: 2024-10-16, from: Heatmap News

	What’s next for the Biden administration — and for climate policy in the United States? Should Democrats negotiate with Republicans over permitting reform, even if it means making concessions to fossil fuel interests? And how should the country’s trade policy handle the problem of carbon pollution?

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Ali Zaidi: </strong>The conversation in Congress right now makes it seem like transmission is a Democratic policy priority when it boosts reliability and lowers rates. I thought Republicans and Democrats both agreed we need to boost reliability and lower rates. So I don’t know why that needs to be offset by any measure.<br/>
<br/>
	That’s thing number one. Thing number two is …
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>This is the challenge of talking about things, is that if Democrats say, <em><em>oh, we really value this</em></em>, then suddenly it’s a Democratic priority.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Zaidi: </strong>Yeah. And then the second is, how do we accelerate the siting and permitting of things and then there is a how do we shift more power to the oil and gas industry. The conversation around leasing, happening against a backdrop where the industry itself is moving away from long-cycle investment to short-cycle investment, it’s tough. So I would hope that more of the permitting conversation were a permitting conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Well, one way this sometimes gets reflected is that you’ll hear environmentalists say, any policy that makes the oil and gas industry happy or bigger, we should not take. And that makes making a compromise …<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Zaidi: </strong>And I reject that. Yeah, look, if ExxonMobil wants to pay for a pipeline that will help us deliver what was once solar and wind, as a fuel, to help us decarbonize a steel plant, they can be for it and I can be for it. If there is a — Blackstone, for example, has a <a href="https://tallgrass.com/newsroom/press-releases/blackstone-infrastructure-partners-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-controlling-interest-in-tallgrass-energy" target="_blank">Project Tallgrass</a> that has converted a pipeline that used to pull hydrocarbons out of the ground. It’s now flipped the pipeline around, and is putting CO2 into the ground.<br/>
<br/>
	They can be for that. I can be for that — not speaking to the specific project, but conceptually. So I don’t think … It’s not the actor. It’s the question of whether this is directionally consistent with trying to chase down a 1.5 degree future or not.
	<br/>
<br/>
	We are behind as a world, and we need to run faster in that direction. If it’s not directionally consistent, that’s a problem.

## Xi says China willing to be a partner, friend with the US

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two countries to be enablers for each other's development rather than an obstacle, according to state media on Wednesday.


"China is willing to be a partner and friend with the United States. This will benefit not only the two countries, but the world," Xi said in remarks from a letter to the 2024 annual awards dinner of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, according to a CCTV news report.


Xi pointed out that China-U.S. relations are among the most important bilateral relations in the world, which have a bearing on the future and destiny of mankind, according to the letter.


The two countries have been at odds over national security concerns, ongoing trade spats as well as China's actions in the South China Sea and intensified military drills around Taiwan.


Trade relations soured over the past year and have centered around issues including restrictions on electric vehicles and advanced semiconductors.


"China has always handled China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and has always believed that the success of China and the United States is an opportunity for each other," Xi said.

## The IEA Isn’t Sweating Data Center Electricity Demand

date: 2024-10-16, from: Heatmap News

	Early this morning, the International Energy Agency released its annual 
	<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>World Energy Outlook</u></a>. And while the Paris-based agency says the world should certainly be concerned about rising electricity demand overall, it also conveys (not quite in so many words) that perhaps we should all just calm down when it comes to data center load growth driven by the rise of generative artificial intelligence.
</p><p>
	The report demonstrates that on a global scale, data centers are pretty trivial compared to, say, the uptick in electric vehicle adoption or increased demand for cooling. By 2030 in the base case scenario, the IEA projects that data centers will account for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth, which is roughly equal to demand growth from desalination technologies, which we see much less hand-wringing about. By comparison, the combination of rising temperatures and rising incomes could create over 1,200 terawatt-hours of additional cooling demand by 2035, more than the entire Middle East’s electricity use.

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IEA</small>
</p><p>The IEA emphasized that when it comes to data centers, “plausible high and low sensitivities do not change the outlook fundamentally,” meaning that regardless of factors such as how quickly renewables and other low-emission energy sources are able to ramp up or the rate at which computing efficiency improves, data centers are poised to be a small piece of the overall pie. </p><p>The authors even sound an optimistic note as they urge readers to consider the positive impacts that artificial intelligence could have on the energy sector at large, writing that “the potential implications of AI for energy are broader [than just their data center electricity use] and include improved systems coordination in the power sector and shorter innovation cycles.” As of now, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/07/generative-ai-energy-emissions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>folks can only guess</u></a> as to whether the net benefits of AI will be <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-climate-week-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>positive or negative</u></a> from an emissions standpoint. But the report again sounded relatively cheery as it noted that there is “a set of low-emissions options available to meet this [data center] demand,” as cleaner electricity sources are growing much faster than data center electricity use. </p><p>The unbothered tone might seem surprising, given the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_self"><u>general freakout</u></a> over demand growth as well as <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>dueling</u></a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/abundance-additionality-permitting-reform" target="_self"><u>perspectives</u></a> over how to meet it. But while it’s important to put these numbers in perspective, that task shouldn’t be an excuse not to act. After all, even “a small percent of the pie” still leads to some pretty big figures. For example, say data centers comprise a conservative 5% of global electricity demand growth between now and 2030. That would mean an additional 338 terawatt-hours of electricity demand by the end of the decade, an estimate the IEA says could vary by as much as 170 terawatt-hours. So on the high end, global growth in data center electricity demand could reach around 500 terawatt-hours by 2030, nearly a quarter of <a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec7_5.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>total U.S. electricity generation last year</u></a>.</p><p>So while this might not level up to a crisis on a global scale, it’s still very much a problem worth mitigating — all the more so because data centers are heavily geographically concentrated, meaning local grid impacts will be felt acutely. Back in April, <a href="https://www.koomey.com/about.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jonathan Koomey</u></a>, an independent researcher, lecturer, and entrepreneur who studies the energy and environmental impacts of information technology, <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-10-ai-data-centers" target="_self"><u>discussed this very issue</u></a> with Heatmap’s own Shift Key co-hosts, Robinson Meyer and Jesse Jenkins. As Koomey put it, “A place like Ireland that has, I think at last count 17%, 18% of its load from data centers, if that grows, that could give them real challenges. Same thing with Loudoun County in Virginia.” </p><p>The IEA also acknowledges this reality, noting that even if, globally, there’s enough clean energy to go around, local constraints on generation and grid capacity could be severe. But as Koomey told Heatmap — and as, perhaps, the IEA is trying to tell us all — “it is not a national story. It is a local story.”</p>

## Georgia judge blocks ballot counting rule and says county officials must certify election results

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA — A judge has blocked a new rule that requires Georgia Election Day ballots to be counted by hand after the close of voting. The ruling came a day after the same judge ruled that county election officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law.


The State Election Board last month passed the rule requiring that three poll workers each count the paper ballots — not votes — by hand after the polls close.


The county election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta’s suburbs, had filed a lawsuit seeking to have a judge declare that rule and five others recently passed by the state board invalid, saying they exceed the state board’s authority, weren’t adopted in compliance with the law and are unreasonable.


In a ruling late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote, that the so-called hand count rule “is too much, too late” and blocked its enforcement while he considers the merits of the case.


McBurney on Monday had ruled in a separate case that “no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.” While they are entitled to inspect the conduct of an election and to review related documents, he wrote, “any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.”


Georgia law says county election superintendents — generally multimember boards — “shall” certify election results by 5 p.m. on the Monday after an election, or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is this year.


The two rulings came as early in-person voting began Tuesday in Georgia.


They are victories for Democrats, liberal voting rights groups and some legal experts who have raised concerns that Donald Trump’s allies could refuse to certify the results if the former president loses to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in next month’s presidential election. They have also argued that new rules enacted by the Trump-endorsed majority on the State Election Board could be used to stop or delay certification and to undermine public confidence in the results.


In blocking the hand count rule, McBurney noted that there are no guidelines or training tools for its implementation and that the secretary of state had said the rule was passed too late for his office to provide meaningful training or support. The judge also wrote that no allowances have been made in county election budgets to provide for additional personnel or expenses associated with the rule.


“The administrative chaos that will — not may — ensue is entirely inconsistent with the obligations of our boards of elections (and the SEB) to ensure that our elections are fair legal, and orderly,” he wrote.


The state board may be right that the rule is smart policy, McBurney wrote, but the timing of its passage makes implementing it now “quite wrong.” He invoked the memory of the riot at the U.S. Capitol by people seeking to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential victory on Jan. 6, 2021, writing, “Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.”


During a hearing earlier Tuesday, Robert Thomas, a lawyer for the State Election Board, argued that the process isn’t complicated and that estimates show that it would take extra minutes, not hours, to complete. He also said memory cards from the scanners, which are used to tally the votes, could be sent to the tabulation center while the hand count is happening so reporting of results wouldn’t be delayed.


State and national Democratic groups that had joined the suit on the side of the Cobb election board, along with the Harris campaign, celebrated McBurney's ruling in a joint statement: “From the beginning, this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block it.”


The certification ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Julie Adams, a Republican member of the election board in Fulton County, which includes most of the city of Atlanta and is a Democratic stronghold. Adams sought a declaration that her duties as an election board member were discretionary and that she is entitled to “full access” to “election materials.”


Long an administrative task that attracted little attention, certification of election results has become politicized since Trump tried to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. Republicans in several swing states, including Adams, refused to certify results earlier this year and some have sued to keep from being forced to sign off on election results.


Adams' suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, argued county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also argued county election officials could certify results without including certain ballots if they suspect problems.


Judge McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or what should be done about it. Instead, he wrote, state law says a county election official's “concerns about fraud or systemic error are to be noted and shared with the appropriate authorities but they are not a basis for a superintendent to decline to certify.”


The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia had joined the lawsuit as defendants with the support of Harris' campaign. The campaign called the ruling a “major legal win.”


Adams said in a statement that McBurney's ruling has made it clear that she and other county election officials “cannot be barred from access to elections in their counties.”


A flurry of election rules passed by the State Election Board since August has generated a crush of lawsuits. McBurney earlier this month heard a challenge to two rules having to do with certification brought by the state and national Democratic parties. Another Fulton County judge is set to hear arguments in two challenges to rules tomorrow — one brought by the Democratic groups and another filed by a group headed by a former Republican lawmaker. And separate challenges are also pending in at least two other counties.

## Troops kicked out under 'don't ask, don't tell' upgraded to honorable discharges

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced Tuesday that more than 800 military personnel have seen their service records upgraded to honorable discharges after previously being kicked out of the military under its former "don't ask, don't tell" policy.


It is the latest development over the decades to undo past discrimination against LGBTQ service members.


The 1951 Uniform Code of Military Justice's Article 125 had criminalized consensual gay sex. In 1993, former President Bill Clinton modified the military's policy to "don't ask, don't tell," which allowed LGBTQ troops to serve in the armed forces if they did not disclose their sexual orientation.


That policy was repealed in 2011, when Congress allowed for their open service in the military. The 1951 UCMJ code was modified in 2013 to be limited to nonconsensual gay sex.


President Joe Biden in June announced he was issuing pardons to service members convicted under repealed military policies.


Under "don't ask, don't tell," thousands of service members still saw their military service ended without an honorable discharge, meaning they did not receive the military benefits they would have otherwise, such as education benefits, and it also could have affected their ability to apply for jobs or loans.


Last year, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a review of cases of former service members who might have been affected by the policy.


The Pentagon estimates about 13,500 service members were released from military service under "don't ask, don't tell." With the review and upgrades of the more than 800 troops announced Tuesday, the Pentagon said that about 96% of the 13,500 personnel affected by the policy had received an honorable discharge.


Not every case of the 13,500 needed review. Some of those personnel did not serve long enough to qualify for benefits, were released with an honorable discharge at the time, already had their discharges upgraded through other means, or did not qualify for an upgrade due to other violations.


"We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our troops — including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve but were turned away because of whom they love. We will continue to strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served their country," Austin said in a statement.

## Voting rights groups seek investigation into Wisconsin text messages

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

madison, wisconsin  — Voting rights advocates on Tuesday asked state and federal authorities to investigate anonymous text messages apparently targeting young Wisconsin voters, warning them not to vote in a state where they are ineligible.


Free Speech for People, on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, made the request to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as the Wisconsin Department of Justice. The letter says that "thousands of young voters across Wisconsin" received the text message last week, including staff members at the League of Women Voters and students at the University of Wisconsin.


The text in question cites Wisconsin state law prohibiting voting in more than one place and says that violating the law can result in fines of up to $10,000 and 3.5 years in prison.


"Don't vote in a state where you're not eligible," the text said.


Wisconsin is known for having razor-thin presidential elections. Four of the last six were decided by less than a percentage point. President Joe Biden won in 2020 by less than 21,000 votes.


At least one person who received the text posted it on the social media platform X.


The League of Women Voters, in its request for investigation, said that without prompt action "the sender may continue its efforts to frighten eligible young voters into not voting."


Students attending college in Wisconsin can register to vote either at their home address or their one at school.


"But now, many students and other young voters are fearful that they will face criminal prosecution if they register and exercise their right to vote — because of a malicious, inaccurate text sent by an anonymous party," the letter said.


The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.


Wisconsin Department of Justice spokesperson Gillian Drummond said the department takes allegations of potential violations of election law seriously. She said the agency was reviewing the information in the request for an investigation and would assess "what, if any, follow-up is appropriate based on the facts and the law."


University of Wisconsin System spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that system officials were unaware of any security breach that may have resulted in leaked student contact information. He added that nothing has been reported to system officials about the text, and there was no indication how many students may have received it.


Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in an email to The Associated Press that the commission can't determine whether the text message violates state law because the commission hasn't received a formal complaint about it.


However, he called the message "concerning" and said it certainly could leave recipients feeling intimidated. He urged recipients to contact law enforcement directly if they are worried about the message.


"We understand that these third-party text messages can be very frustrating for voters," Vetterkind said. "We recommend voters rely upon official sources of election information, such as from state or local election officials. Voters are free to ignore these text messages since they are not sent or associated with an official source."


The text message was sent as thousands of voters in Wisconsin are casting absentee ballots. As of Monday, nearly 240,000 absentee ballots had already been returned statewide.


Starting October 22, voters can start casting absentee ballots in person.


Wisconsin is one of the "blue wall" states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that is key to winning for either Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

## Tech firms increasingly look to nuclear power for data center

date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA

As energy-hungry computer data centers and artificial intelligence programs place ever greater demands on the U.S. power grid, tech companies are looking to a technology that just a few years ago appeared ready to be phased out: nuclear energy. 


After several decades in which investment in new nuclear facilities in the U.S. had slowed to a crawl, tech giants Microsoft and Google have recently announced investments in the technology, aimed at securing a reliable source of emissions-free power for years into the future.  


Earlier this year, online retailer Amazon, which has an expansive cloud computing business, announced it had reached an agreement to purchase a nuclear energy-fueled data center in Pennsylvania and that it had plans to buy more in the future. 


However, the three companies' strategies rely on somewhat different approaches to the problem of harnessing nuclear energy, and it remains unclear which, if any, will be successful. 


Energy demand 


Data centers, which concentrate thousands of powerful computers in one location, consume prodigious amounts of power, both to run the computers themselves and to operate the elaborate systems put in place to dissipate the large amount of heat they generate.  


A recent study by Goldman Sachs estimated that data centers currently consume between 1% and 2% of all available power generation. That percentage is expected to at least double by the end of the decade, even accounting for new power sources coming online. The study projected a 160% increase in data center power consumption by 2030. 


The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that the largest data centers can consume more than 100 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power about 80,000 homes. 


Small, modular reactors 


Google's plan is, in some ways, the most radical departure — both from the current structure of the energy grid and from traditional means of generating nuclear power. The internet search giant announced on Monday that it has partnered with Kairos Power to fund the construction of up to seven small-scale nuclear reactors that, across several locations, would combine to generate 500 megawatts of power. 


The small modular reactors (SMRs) are a new, and largely untested, technology. Unlike sprawling nuclear plants, SMRs are compact, requiring much less infrastructure to keep them operational and safe. 


"The smaller size and modular design can reduce construction timelines, allow deployment in more places, and make the final project delivery more predictable," Google and Kairos said in a press release.  


The companies said they intend to have the first of the SMRs online by 2030, with the rest to follow by 2035. 


Great promise 


Sola Talabi, president of Pittsburgh Technical, a nuclear consulting firm, told VOA that SMR technology holds great promise for the future. He said that the plants' small size will eliminate many of the safety concerns that larger reactors present. 


For example, some smaller reactors generate so much less heat than larger reactors that they can utilize "passive" cooling systems that are not susceptible to the kind of mechanical failures that caused disaster at Japan's Fukushima plant in 2011 and the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant in 1986.  


Talabi, who is also an adjunct faculty member in nuclear engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and University of Michigan, said that SMRs' modular nature will allow for rapid deployment and substantial cost savings as time goes on. 


"Pretty much every reactor that has been built [so far] has been built like it's the first one," he said. "But with these reactors, because we will be able to use the same processes, the same facilities, to produce them, we actually expect that we will be able to … achieve deployment scale relatively quickly." 


Raising doubts 


Not all experts are convinced that SMRs are going to live up to expectations. 


Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, told VOA that the Kairos reactors Google is hoping to install use a new technology that has never been tested under real-world conditions.


"At this point, it's just hope without any real basis in experimental fact to believe that this is going to be a productive and reliable solution for the need to power data centers over the medium term," he said. 


He pointed out that the large-scale deployment of new nuclear reactors will also result in the creation of a new source of nuclear waste, which the U.S. is still struggling to find a way to dispose of at scale.  


"I think what we're seeing is really a bubble — a nuclear bubble — which I suspect is going to be deflated once these optimistic, hopeful agreements turn out to be much harder to execute," Lyman said. 


Three Mile Island 


Microsoft and Amazon have plotted a more conventional path toward powering their data centers with nuclear energy. 


In its announcement last month, Microsoft revealed that it has reached an agreement with Constellation Energy to restart a mothballed nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and to use the power it produces for its data operations. 


Three Mile Island is best known as the site of the worst nuclear disaster in U.S. history. In 1979, the site's Unit 2 reactor suffered a malfunction that resulted in radioactive gases and iodine being released into the local environment.  


However, the facility's Unit 1 reactor did not fail, and it operated safely for several decades. It was shut down in 2019, after cheap shale gas drove the price of energy down so far that it made further operations economically unfeasible. 


It is expected to cost $1.6 billion to bring the reactor back online, and Microsoft has agreed to fund that investment. It has also signed an agreement to purchase power from the facility for 20 years. The companies say they believe that they can bring the facility back online by 2028. 


Amazon's plan, by contrast, does not require either new technology or the resurrection of an older nuclear facility. 


The data center that the company purchased from Talen Energy is located on the same site as the fully operational Susquehanna nuclear plant in Salem, Pennsylvania, and draws power directly from it. 


Amazon characterized the $650 million investment as part of a larger effort to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

## Mining and the clean energy paradox

date: 2024-10-15, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Today we’re talking about a key piece of the global transition to renewable energy: metals. Specifically, metals like copper, lithium and cobalt that we need to build wind turbines, electric vehicles and to improve our energy grid. Vince Beiser, author of the forthcoming book &#8220;Power Metal: The Race for the Resources That Will Shape the Future,&#8221; said we&#8217;ll need hundreds of millions more tons of these metals. But mining them comes at a cost. On the show today, Beiser explains the environmental and social consequences of mining for these metals, China&#8217;s dominance over the supply chain, and ways to make the transition to renewables more fair. Plus, why mining in space is a pipe dream, at least for now.</p>

## FEMA resumes door-to-door visits in North Carolina after threats tied to disinformation

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

Federal disaster personnel have resumed door-to-door visits as part of their hurricane-recovery work in North Carolina, an effort temporarily suspended amid threats that prompted officials to condemn the spread of disinformation. 


Over the weekend, reports emerged that workers with the Federal Emergency Management Agency could be targeted by militia as the government responds to Hurricane Helene. A sheriff's office said Monday that one man was arrested during an investigation, but that the suspect acted alone. 


FEMA made operational changes to keep personnel safe "out of an abundance of caution," agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said at a briefing Tuesday. FEMA workers were back in the field Monday, accompanied by Criswell, and she said disaster-assistance teams helping survivors apply for FEMA aid as well as state and local assistance will continue to go door-to-door. She emphasized that the agency isn't going anywhere. 


"The federal family has been here working side by side with the state since Day One. These are people who put their lives on hold to help those who have lost everything," Criswell said. "So let me be clear: I take these threats seriously." 


North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said he directed the state's Department of Public Safety to coordinate law enforcement assistance for FEMA and other responders. He stressed the damage that internet rumors and falsehoods were causing and said officials may never know how many people won't apply for assistance because of bad information. 


"There's still a persistent and dangerous flow of misinformation about recovery efforts in western North Carolina that can lead to threats and intimidation, breeds confusion and demoralizes storm survivors and response workers alike," Cooper said at the briefing. "If you're participating in spreading this stuff, stop it. Whatever your aim is, the people you are really hurting are those in western North Carolina who need help." 


The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office said it received a call Saturday about a man with an assault rifle who made a comment "about possibly harming" FEMA employees working in the hard-hit areas of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock in the North Carolina mountains. A man was charged with "going armed to the terror of the public," a misdemeanor, and was released after posting bond. 


The sheriff's office said it received initial reports that a "truckload of militia" was involved in the threat, but further investigation determined the man acted alone. 


FEMA has faced rampant disinformation about its response to Helene, which hit Florida on September 26 before heading north and leaving a trail of destruction across six states. 


Asked what might be fueling disinformation, Cooper said social media has become more extreme, but he also pointed to politics. 


"This is happening in the middle of an election where candidates are using people's misery to sow chaos for their own political objectives — and it's wrong," he said. 


Former President Donald Trump and his allies have seized on the storm's aftermath to spread false information about the Biden administration's response in the final weeks before the election. Their debunked claims include false statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants, that people accepting federal relief money could see their land seized and that FEMA is halting trucks full of supplies. 


Helene decimated remote towns throughout Appalachia, left millions without power, knocked out cellular service and killed at least 246 people. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. 


Terrie Daughtry, a volunteer handling therapy dogs Tuesday at a FEMA Disaster Recovery Center in Asheville, said threats and misinformation — including the militia rumors — made her feel unsafe for the first time in several trips to volunteer at disaster sites. 


"I'm not coming to risk my life with it all, to be shot or hurt or trampled because of lunacy," said Daughtry, who volunteers with Therapy Dogs International. She said she previously traveled to help in the aftermath of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, floods in Virginia and tornadoes in Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama. 


She and another volunteer have been using their therapy dogs to calm people waiting in line to make FEMA claims. They hand out candy, let people pet the dogs and talk to people about their experiences. 


Despite the extra stress from the "absolutely ridiculous" threats and misinformation, Daughtry said she's seen some amazing moments of human spirit. At one point on Monday, someone in line started playing a guitar and singing about having no water, she said. Eventually, the whole line sang along. 


"These are special people. They're singing in horrible adversity," she said. "It made me tear up being there, and it's making me tear up now."

## Georgia judge rules county election officials must certify election results

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA, georgia — A Georgia judge has ruled county election officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law and cannot exclude any group of votes from certification even if they suspect error or fraud. 


Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that "no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance."


While they have the right to inspect the conduct of an election and to review related documents, he wrote, "any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so." 


Georgia law says county election superintendents, which are multimember boards in most counties, "shall" certify election results by 5 p.m. on the Monday after an election — or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is this year. 


The ruling comes as early voting began Tuesday in Georgia. 


Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County election board, had asked the judge to declare that her duties as an election board member were discretionary and that she is entitled to "full access" to "election materials." 


Long an administrative task that attracted little attention, certification of election results has become politicized since then-President Donald Trump tried to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. Republicans in several swing states, including Adams, refused to certify election results earlier this year and some have sued to keep from being forced to sign off on election results. 


Adams' suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, argues that county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also argued that county election officials could certify results without including ballots that appear to have problems, allaying concerns of a board member who might otherwise vote not to certify. 


Judge McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or what should be done about it. Instead, he wrote, the law says a county election official's "concerns about fraud or systemic error are to be noted and shared with the appropriate authorities but they are not a basis for a superintendent to decline to certify." 


Both sides in the fight over certification claimed McBurney's ruling as a victory. 


The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia, with the support of Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, had joined the lawsuit as defendants and called the ruling a "major legal win." 


Adams has said she was not given access to county election documents with enough time to consider them before the certification vote for elections earlier this year. She said in a statement that McBurney's ruling has made it clear that she and other county election board members "cannot be barred from access to elections in their counties."

## DeSantis praises Milton recovery efforts as rising floodwaters persist in Florida

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

TALLAHASSEE, Florida — While there's still more work to do, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Tuesday praised Hurricane Milton recovery efforts, saying power has never been restored to so many so quickly after a major storm.


"President (Ronald) Reagan used to say the most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.' There's a lot of wisdom in that, but I don't think The Gipper ever saw Florida respond to a natural disaster, because we get after it and we do make a difference," DeSantis said at a news conference in front of a flooded road in Zephyrhills.


There were still about 170,000 customers without electricity, rivers continued to rise in some flooded areas and the state was still providing free gas to residents struggling to top off their tanks. But DeSantis pointed out that more than 4 million customers had power restored less than a week after the Category 3 storm.


At least 11 people died less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene inflicted major damage in Florida and other Southeastern states. The death toll from Helene is more than 240. While most gas stations were back up and running, the state still has 10 active fuel distribution centers providing free gas to residents. DeSantis said more than 2 million gallons had been distributed so far.


As happened two years ago during Hurricane Ian, parts of central Florida on Tuesday were flooding almost a week after Milton made landfall due to the rising St. Johns River.


In Seminole County, north of Orlando, crews closed roads along the shores of Lake Harney and Lake Jesup after several homes were flooded by the river. Since last Thursday, at least 15 people have been evacuated from homes in nearby Geneva and a neighborhood in Altamonte Springs located in a crook of the Little Wekiva River.


Water levels along the St. Johns River were expected to crest later in the week.


In Sumter County, home to the sprawling retirement community, The Villages, residents along the Little Withlacoochee River were being encouraged to evacuate as river levels rose. Residents who decided to evacuate were offered shelter at the Sumter County Fairgrounds.

## US slaps sanctions on 'sham charity' fundraising for Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on what it said was a key international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which Washington has designated a terrorist organization.


The U.S. Treasury Department, in action taken with Canada, said in a statement it imposed sanctions on the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, accusing it of being "a sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser" for the PFLP. 


The PFLP, which has also taken part in the fight against Israel in Gaza, was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. in October 1997 and October 2001, respectively. 


The Treasury said PFLP uses Samidoun to fundraise in Europe and North America. The group's activities were banned by Germany last year. 


“Organizations like Samidoun masquerade as charitable actors that claim to provide humanitarian support to those in need, yet in reality divert funds for much-needed assistance to support terrorist groups,” Treasury's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. 


The Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network did not respond immediately to a Reuters request for comment. 


A member of the PFLP's leadership abroad was also targeted with sanctions on Tuesday. 


Canada announced the listing of Samidoun as a terrorist entity on Tuesday. “Violent extremism, acts of terrorism or terrorist financing have no place in Canadian society or abroad," Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement announcing the listing. 


The Treasury said the PFLP remained active in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, including participating in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage to Gaza, by Israeli tallies. 


More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive so far, according to Gaza's health authorities.

## As US presidential vote looms, newsrooms focus on how to stay safe

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

Washington/New York — On a rainy day in September, a group of journalists gathered in a nondescript office building outside Washington. Some were seasoned reporters, others still students. But they were all there to learn how to stay safe while covering elections and unrest.


Organized by the International Women’s Media Foundation, or IWMF, the training session was part of a national campaign to teach journalists based in the United States how to stay safe on assignment, including while reporting on the presidential campaign.


Over the past year, the IWMF has trained more than 620 journalists across 13 states.


“This safety tour has really been illuminating. Unfortunately, what we are hearing is quite alarming, and it’s not just about election reporting,” IWMF executive director Elisa Lees Munoz told VOA. “What we’re understanding more and more is that literally every beat in America has become a polarizing beat, and therefore has become a dangerous beat.”




Three times as many journalists have been arrested in the U.S. this year compared to last year, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. More journalists have been assaulted too, according to the group’s data.



“We’re seeing journalists still struggling every day to uphold that basic right of freedom of the press,” Kirstin McCudden, the Tracker’s managing editor, told VOA at the group’s office in Brooklyn. “It’s a little alarming.”


Many of the incidents took place during pro-Palestine protests. In one case, three photojournalists were arrested in Chicago in August while covering a protest on the outskirts of the Democratic National Convention.




“Police departments feel that they have the power to violate the rights of journalists. Then what ends up happening is it turns into a snowball effect. More police agencies crack down even harder,” said Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which publishes the Tracker.


While press freedom is often a local issue, it also matters what presidential candidates are saying and how they treat the press, multiple analysts said.


The campaign of former President Donald Trump has been punctuated by the same kinds of attacks against the media that characterized his presidency, the analysts who spoke with VOA said.


Leading up to and during Trump’s presidency, Stephanie Sugars, a senior reporter at the Tracker, documented more than 2,000 anti-media posts by Trump on the social media platform X, then known as Twitter. The tenor of those posts evolved from targeting individual journalists to targeting specific news outlets to targeting the media industry writ large.


“A lot of that rhetoric is still in play and is part of his playbook,” Sugars said. She added that the Tracker would monitor anti-media posts from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris if those kinds of posts existed.


Sugars cautioned against solely blaming Trump for the increased hostility facing journalists in the U.S. But, she said, he hasn’t helped the situation either.


“If you sow distrust in these sorts of external sources and really encourage your followers, those who support you, to only believe what you specifically say, that’s a great way to maintain firm control over what the narrative is, what truth is understood to be, and that’s an incredible amount of power to have,” Sugars said.




McCudden agreed. “Rhetoric does matter, and it’s fuel to the fire,” she said.

In response to VOA’s request for comment, Trump’s presidential campaign shared a statement that Republican National Committee spokesperson Taylor Rogers originally provided to the conservative news site the Daily Caller.



In it, Rogers described Trump as a “champion for free speech” and said that “everyone was safer under President Trump, including journalists.”


Mitigating risk


The hostile environment for journalists comes at a time when trust in media is already at a record low in the U.S., according to Gallup. Attacks or hostile rhetoric against the press only make the situation worse.


So far, the Tracker has documented only a few violations directly related to the election. But, McCudden said, “History tells us that we should be worried and aware.”


She cited the January 6 insurrection on the Capitol, where 18 journalists were assaulted.


It may take a few days for the election results to be confirmed, McCudden said. “And in that time, tensions will be high. And journalists whose job it is to cover these tense times are also often in harm’s way,” she said.


The IWMF’s safety training originally was directed at journalists in combat zones and dangerous regions. But following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when attacks on the media began to rise, the IWMF realized U.S. based journalists would benefit from them, too, according to Munoz.


For Jennifer Thomas, a journalism professor at Howard University in Washington, the training offered her the tools to better help her students to stay safe.


“Back when I was reporting locally and then nationally and covering news, we didn't have to really be that concerned when we went out to cover an event,” said Thomas, who previously worked at CNN. “Well, times have changed.”


During the training, Thomas and the others were introduced to a range of resources on issues including covering riots and dealing with an arrest. Munoz thinks this information will become all the more important for journalists in the U.S. in years to come.

## Chinese pandas arrive at Washington's National Zoo; public debut set for January

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The National Zoo's long dark panda drought has come to an end.


Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears arrived late Tuesday morning.


The three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, were flown from China to Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia, with a refueling stop in Alaska. They were loaded into special FedEx trucks and arrived at the zoo just before noon.


"Our team has worked tirelessly to prepare for the pandas’ arrival, and we’re thrilled to welcome Bao Li and Qing Bao to Washington, D.C., the only place you can see giant pandas for free in the nation,” said Brandie Smith, the national zoo director who travelled to China to take part in farewell ceremonies for the bears there. "As a result of our collective efforts, today we joyfully celebrate a new chapter of our 52-year-long giant panda breeding and conservation program.”




The zoo was closed Tuesday to facilitate the arrivals. The bears will be quarantined from the public for at least 30 days. A statement from the zoo set the date for the bears' official public debut and the reopening of the renovated panda house as Jan. 24, 2025.


Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions.


Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China last week.


That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco.


In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May, Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year.


Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation’s capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following President Richard Nixon’s historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck.


“The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story, both for locals and incoming travelers alike,” said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. “The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.”


The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China before they reach age four.


Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements, giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely vulnerable.


“The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,” Liu said in an email. “We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as well.”

## Microsoft: Cybercriminals increasingly help Russia, China, Iran target US, allies

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Russia, China and Iran are increasingly relying on criminal networks to lead cyberespionage and hacking operations against adversaries such as the United States, according to a report on digital threats published Tuesday by Microsoft.


The growing collaboration between authoritarian governments and criminal hackers has alarmed national security officials and cybersecurity experts. They say it represents the increasingly blurred lines between actions directed by Beijing or the Kremlin aimed at undermining rivals and the illicit activities of groups typically more interested in financial gain.


In one example, Microsoft's analysts found that a criminal hacking group with links to Iran infiltrated an Israeli dating site and then tried to sell or ransom the personal information it obtained. Microsoft concluded the hackers had two motives: to embarrass Israelis and make money.


In another, investigators identified a Russian criminal network that infiltrated more than 50 electronic devices used by the Ukrainian military in June, apparently seeking access and information that could aid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There was no obvious financial motive for the group, aside from any payment they may have received from Russia.


Marriage of convenience


For nations such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, teaming up with cybercriminals offers a marriage of convenience with benefits for both sides. Governments can boost the volume and effectiveness of cyber activities without added cost. For the criminals, it offers new avenues for profit and the promise of government protection.


"We're seeing in each of these countries this trend toward combining nation-state and cybercriminal activities," said Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust.


So far there is no evidence suggesting that Russia, China and Iran are sharing resources with each other or working with the same criminal networks, Burt said. But he said the growing use of private cyber "mercenaries" shows how far America's adversaries will go to weaponize the internet.


Microsoft's report analyzed cyber threats between July 2023 and June 2024, looking at how criminals and foreign nations use hacking, spear phishing, malware and other techniques to gain access and control over a target's system. The company says its customers face more than 600 million such incidents every day.


Russia focused much of its cyber operations on Ukraine, trying to enter military and government systems and spreading disinformation designed to undermine support for the war among its allies.


Ukraine has responded with its own cyber efforts, including one last week that knocked some Russian state media outlets offline.


US elections targeted


Networks tied to Russia, China and Iran have also targeted American voters, using fake websites and social media accounts to spread false and misleading claims about the 2024 election. Analysts at Microsoft agree with the assessment of U.S. intelligence officials who say Russia is targeting the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, while Iran is working to oppose former President Donald Trump.


Iran has also hacked into Trump's campaign and sought, unsuccessfully, to interest Democrats in the material. Federal officials have also accused Iran of covertly supporting American protests over the war in Gaza.


Russia and Iran will likely accelerate the pace of their cyber operations targeting the U.S. as election day approaches, Burt said.


China, meanwhile, has largely stayed out of the presidential race, focusing its disinformation on down-ballot races for Congress or state and local office. Microsoft found networks tied to Beijing also continue to target Taiwan and other countries in the region.


Denials from all parties


In response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said allegations that China partners with cybercriminals are groundless and accused the U.S. of spreading its own "disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats."


In a statement, spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that "our position is consistent and clear. China firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cybertheft in all forms."


Russia and Iran have also rejected accusations that they're using cyber operations to target Americans. Messages left with representatives of those three nations and North Korea were not returned Monday.


Efforts to disrupt foreign disinformation and cyber capabilities have escalated along with the threat, but the anonymous, porous nature of the internet sometimes undercuts the effectiveness of the response.


Federal authorities recently announced plans to seize hundreds of website domains used by Russia to spread election disinformation and to support efforts to hack former U.S. military and intelligence figures. But investigators at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab found that sites seized by the government can easily and quickly be replaced.


Within one day of the Department of Justice seizing several domains in September, for example, researchers spotted 12 new websites created to take their place. One month later, they continue to operate.

	Bill Gates’ climate venture firm Breakthrough Energy is out today with its 2024 <a href="https://transition.breakthroughenergy.org/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sPbCXYi6r_wrmJCTgvm-KDtw4okqa7zHr5kWIt37_hFgaJspN3Y7SVFssKDNXRXwbfznC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State of the Transition</a> report. The firm has invested $3.5 billion into more than 110 climate tech companies over the last nine years, and the report mostly discusses those projects’ progress, along with climate-tech investment strategies. Perhaps the most interesting part of the report is the letter from Gates himself, in which he says 2024 saw climate tech enter its “deployment era.” He wrote:
</p><p>
<em><em>“At Breakthrough Energy, we noticed a subtle, but important, perspective shift from both the investors and corporations we engage with. Major global investors … are finally getting off the sidelines and engaging in climate tech opportunities in meaningful ways. Meanwhile, corporate leaders increasingly understand that cleantech is not just about shrinking their carbon footprint. It’s also about strengthening their businesses and deploying their capital more efficiently.”</em></em>
</p><h3>4. Report: Global South scaling renewables faster than Global North</h3><p>
	Many of the world’s emerging economies are ramping up renewable energy deployment faster than more advanced economies, according to new <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/powering-up-the-global-south/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sPbCXYi6r_wrmJCTgvm-KDtw4okqa7zHr5kWIt37_hFgaJspN3Y7SVFssKDNXRXwbfznC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a> from think tank RMI. These countries, scattered across the Global South (and excluding China, Eurasia, and the Middle East), are all showing clear trends, such as a surge in clean tech investment, exponential renewables growth, and solar and battery storage cost parity with fossil fuels. Much of this is driven by a lack of fossil fuel reserves, and a need for alternatives. In a third of developing countries, demand for fossil fuels has peaked. With enough investment, these trends could be supercharged, and the developing world could catch up with advanced economies’ energy transitions within five years. Climate coalition <a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/launching-mission-2025/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sPbCXYi6r_wrmJCTgvm-KDtw4okqa7zHr5kWIt37_hFgaJspN3Y7SVFssKDNXRXwbfznC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mission 2025</a> used the report as an opportunity to reiterate its call for governments in rich countries to massively scale finance for low-income countries to reach the goal of tripling renewables by 2030.

Soil, grasslands, forests, and wetlands are some of the world’s greatest carbon sinks, helping to balance the climate. But last year, the hottest year on record, it looks as though they absorbed almost no carbon at all. The researchers say that if warming rates continue as they are, urgent action is needed “to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gasses emissions to net zero before reaching a dangerous level of warming at which natural CO2 sinks may no longer provide to humanity the mitigation service they have offered so far by absorbing half of human induced CO2 emissions.”

## Abundance, Not Additionality, Will Meet the Energy Demands of AI

date: 2024-10-15, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY5NzIzNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDA0NTc5MH0.e7k6QjPpbpd1fi4NJJDJvBSpWVeobXY9PzRqIlAc76s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">American electricity consumption is growing for the first time in generations. And though low-carbon technologies such as solar and wind have scaled impressively over the past decade, many observers are concerned that all this new demand will provide “a lifeline for more fossil fuel production,” as Senator Martin Heinrich <a href="https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-welcomes-strong-treasury-guidance-on-45v-clean-hydrogen-tax-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put it</u></a>.</p><p>In response, a few policy entrepreneurs have proposed novel regulations known as “additionality” requirements to handle new sources of electric load. First suggested for <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>electrolytic hydrogen</u></a>, additionality standards would require that subsidized hydrogen producers source their electricity directly from newly built low-carbon power plants; in a Heatmap piece from September, Brian Deese and Lisa Hansmann <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>proposed similar requirements</u></a> for new artificial intelligence. And while AI data centers were their focus, the two argued that additionality “is a model that can be extended to address other sectors facing growing energy demand.”</p><p>There is some merit to additionality standards, particularly for commercial customers seeking to reduce their emissions profile. But we should be skeptical of writing these requirements into policy. Strict federal additionality regulations will dampen investment in new industries and electrification, reduce the efficiency of the electrical grid through the balkanization of supply and demand, and could become weapons as rotating government officials impose their views on which sources of demand or supply are eligible for the standards. The grid and the nation need a regulatory framework for energy abundance, not burdensome additionality rules.</p><p><br/></p><p class="drop-caps">After decades of end-use efficiency improvements, offshoring of manufacturing, and shifts toward <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/how-we-can-have-green-growth-increasing-human-population-prosperity-while-taking-better-care-1486342" target="_blank"><u>less material-intensive</u></a> economies, a confluence of emerging factors are pushing electricity demand back up again. For one, the nation is electrifying personal vehicles, home heating, and may do the same for industrial processes like steel production in the not-too-distant future, sparked by a combination of policy and commercial investment. Hydrogen, which has long been a marginal fuel, is attracting<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hydrogen-demand-is-set-to-boom-but-growth-faces-big-hurdles-91954056" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>substantial interest</u></a>. And technological innovation is leading to whole new sources of electric load — compute-hungry artificial intelligence being<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>the most immediate example</u></a>, but also large-scale critical minerals refining, indoor agriculture like alternative protein cultivation and aquaculture, and so on.</p><p>In recent years, clean energy has seemed to be on an unstoppable path toward dominating the power sector. Coal-fired generation has been in terminal decline in the United States as natural gas power plants and solar and wind farms have become more competitive. Flexible gas generation, likewise, is increasingly crowded out by renewables when the wind is blowing and the sun shining. These trends persisted in the context of stable electricity load. But even as deployment accelerates, low-carbon electricity supply may not be able to keep up with the surprisingly robust growth in demand. The most obvious — though not the exclusive — way for utilities and large corporates to meet that demand is often with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/05/ai-could-drive-natural-gas-boom-as-utilities-face-surging-electric-demand.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new or existing natural gas capacity</u></a>. Even a few coal plants have delayed retirement, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/data-centers-internet-power-source-coal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a> in response to rising demand and reliability concerns.</p><p>Given the durable competitiveness of coal and especially natural gas, some form of additionality requirement might make sense for hydrogen production in particular, since hydrogen is not just a nascent form of electric load but a novel fuel in its own right. Simply installing an electrolyzer at an existing coal or natural gas plant could produce hydrogen that, from a lifecycle perspective, would result in higher carbon emissions, even if it displaces fossil fuels like gas or oil in final consumption. Even so, many experts caution that <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/ai-additionality-wrong-solution-real-problem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overly strict additionality standards</u></a> for hydrogen at this stage are overkill, and <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/no-20-spring-2024/two-pillars-not-three" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may smother the industry in its crib</u></a>.</p><p>Likewise, large corporate entities and electricity customers adopting additionality requirements for their own operations can bolster investment in so-called “clean firm” generation like nuclear, geothermal, and fossil fuels with carbon capture. In just the past month, Google <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/google-nuclear-power-artificial-intelligence-87966624" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced plans</u></a> to back the construction of new small nuclear reactors, and Microsoft <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>announced</u></a> plans to purchase electricity for new data centers from the shuttered Three Mile Island power plant, the plant made famous by the 1979 meltdown but which only closed down in 2019. Three Mile Island’s <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-constellation-ai-stock-nuclear-power-30d0e00b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$100-per-megawatt-hour price tag</u></a> would have been unthinkable just a few years ago but is newly attractive.</p><p>Notice the problem Microsoft is trying to solve here: a lack of abundant, reliable electricity generation. <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BPC_Nuclear-Permit-License-Reform-Issue-Brief.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Outdated technology licensing</u></a>, <a href="https://www.thecgo.org/benchmark/much-more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-nepa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>onerous environmental permitting processes</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/hot-rocks-part-iii-barriers-to-next-gen-geothermal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>other regulatory barriers</u></a> are obstructing the deployment of renewables, advanced nuclear energy, new enhanced geothermal technologies, and low-carbon sources. Additionality fixes none of these issues. Of course, Deese and Hansmann propose “a dedicated fast-track approval process” for verifiably additional low-carbon generation supplying new sources of AI load. Yet this should be the central effort, not the after-the-fact add-on. The back and forth over <a href="http://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>additionality rules for the clean hydrogen tax credit</u></a> is a case in point. The rules for the tax credit will (likely) be finalized by January, but lawsuits already loom over them. Expanding this contentious additionality requirement to apply to broad use cases will be even more contentious without solving the actual shortage data center companies care about. Conversations about additionality are a distraction and misplace the energies of policymakers and staff.</p><p>Substituting one regulatory thicket for another is a recipe for stasis. Instead of adding more red tape, we should be working to cut through it, fast-tracking the energy transition and fostering abundance.</p><p>With such broad requirements, what’s to stop future administrations from expanding them to cover electric vehicle charging, electric arc furnace steelmaking, alternative protein production, or any politically disfavored source of new demand? Could a second Trump Administration use additionality to punish political enemies in the tech industry? Could a Harris Administration do the same? What if a future administration maintained additionality standards for new sources of load, but required that the electricity come from fossil fuels instead of low-carbon sources?</p><p>Zero-sum regulatory contracts between sources of electricity supply and demand are not simply at risk of becoming a tool for handing out favors on a partisan basis — they already are one. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cqsBA7RdxT2PF0ac-WMFRzJjioYe3v04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Two pieces of model legislation</u></a> proposed at the July meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization of conservative state legislators that collaborate to write off-the-shelf legislative measures, would require public utility commissions to prioritize dispatchable generation and formally discourage intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind. One of the proposals suggests leaning on state attorneys general to extend the lifespans of coal plants threatened with retirement. </p><p>These proposals did not move forward this year, but it is unlikely that the motivating force behind them is exhausted. And whatever one thinks of the relative merits of intermittent versus firm generation, ALEC’s proposals demonstrate just how easily gamed regulations like additionality could be and the risks of relying on administrative discretion instead of universal, pragmatic rules.</p><p><br/></p><p class="drop-caps">This is not how the electric grid is supposed to work. The grid is, if not an according-to-Hoyle public good, a shared public resource, providing essential services to customers large and small. Homeowners don’t have to sign additionality contracts with suppliers when they buy an electric car or replace their gas furnace with an electric heat pump. Everyone understands that such requirements would slow the pace of electrification and investment in new industries. The same holds for corporate customers and novel sources of load.</p><p>The real problem facing the AI, hydrogen, nuclear, geothermal, and renewables industries is an inability to build. There are more than enough clean generators queueing to enter the system — 2.6 terawatts <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/queues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at last count</u></a>, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The unfortunate reality, however, is that just one in five of these projects will make it through — and those represent just 14% of the capacity waiting to connect. Still, this totals about 360 gigawatts of new energy generation over the next few years, much more than the predicted demand from AI data centers. Obstacles to technology licensing, permitting, interconnection, and transmission are the key bottlenecks here.</p><p>Would foregoing additionality requirements and loosening regulatory strictures on technology licensing and permitting increase the commercial viability of new or existing fossil fuel capacity, as Deese and Hansmann warn? Perhaps, on some margin. But for the foreseeable future, the energy projects and infrastructure most burdened by regulatory requirements will be low-carbon ones. Batteries, solar, and wind projects make up more than 80% of the queue added in 2023. Meanwhile, oil and gas benefit from categorical exclusions under the <a href="https://ifp.org/how-nepa-will-tax-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National Environmental Policy Act</u></a>, while low-carbon technologies are subject to stricter standards (although three permitting bills recently <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2024/09/25/drill-baby-drill-for-steam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>passed the House</u></a>, including one that waives these requirements for new geothermal projects).</p><p>Consider that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afb729b9-9641-42b2-97ca-93974c461c4c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>40% of projects</u></a> supported by the Inflation Reduction Act are caught up in delays. That is $84 billion of economic activity just waiting for the paperwork to be figured out, according to the <em><em>Financial Times</em></em>. Additionality requirements are additional boxes to check that almost necessarily imply additional delays. Permitting reform makes them redundant and unnecessary for a cleaner future.</p><p>This underscores perhaps the most essential conflict between strict additionality requirements and clean energy abundance. Ensuring that every new policy and every new source of demand allows for absolutely zero additional fossil fuel consumption or emissions will prove counterproductive to global decarbonization in the long run. Natural gas is still reducing emissions on the margin in the United States. Over the past decade, in years with higher natural gas prices, coal generation has <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/use-of-coal.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ticked up</u></a>, indicating that the so-called “natural gas bridge” has not yet reached its terminus. Even aggressive decarbonization scenarios now expect a <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13345138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>substantial role for natural gas</u></a> over the coming decades.

## Leaf-peepers are flocking to see New England's brilliant fall colors

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

MEREDITH, N.H.  — New England leaf-watching season is in full swing, as people from as far as Florida and Berlin flock to the region for scenic drives, train rides and bus tours to soak in the splendid hues of red, orange and bronze. With quaint towns and covered bridges scattered through swaths of changing forest, the rural Northeast provides an ideal setting to view nature's annual show.


"Leaf-peeping is one of the most accessible tourism things that you can do," said Teddy Willey, the general manager of the Frog Rock Tavern in Meredith, New Hampshire. “You don’t have to have the athleticism to be a hiker, you don’t have to have the money to own a boat.”


You just need to be able to jump in a car and head north, he said.


“Once you’re there, you just take it in," Willey said.


He spoke just after his tavern was flooded with tourists from Indiana who had stepped off a sightseeing bus.


Among them was Vicky Boesch, of Fort Wayne, who had made the trip with her sisters.


“We came out to the Northeast to see the beautiful foliage and the colorful leaves,” she said, adding the she was impressed with Vermont.


“The leaves were very pretty on the mountains because the sun was out yesterday, and so that makes them pop more,” she said.


It wasn't only the fall colors that provided a contrast with Indiana, she said, but also the region's distinctive architecture, lakes and towns.


Gordon Cochran, of Lake View, Iowa, said he was in New Hampshire to visit his daughter and had a “beautiful ride” on the slow-moving Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad.


Weather conditions associated with climate change have disrupted some recent leaf-peeping seasons. One problem is that global warming has brought drought that causes leaves to turn brown and wither before they can reach their colorful peak.


Willey acknowledges that he's not a leaf guy.


“Personally, no. I grew up here, so I think it loses its luster a little bit,” he said with a chuckle, adding that the season still has its moments.


"I’ll be driving somewhere around the Lakes Region, and all of a sudden, you're like, ‘You know what, there’s a reason why people come here and there’s a reason I live here. It really is quite beautiful,’” he said, referring to a scenic part of eastern New Hampshire.

## How Republican-leaning Arizona became a swing state

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

There are 50 U.S. states, but voters from seven so-called battleground states are expected to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. The Southwestern state of Arizona used to reliably lean toward Republican candidates. But President Joe Biden, a Democrat, won the state in 2020. And this year, Arizona’s electoral votes are up for grabs again.

## Acting US labor secretary intervenes in Boeing strike

date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su flew to Seattle on Monday to try to ease a Boeing machinists strike, as thousands of employees face layoffs, and a major airline reacted with alarm to the plane maker's deepening turmoil. 


Su's first in-person intervention, reported by Reuters and confirmed by the Labor Department, comes days after Boeing — dealing with a crippling strike now in its fifth week — unveiled plans to cut 17,000 jobs and take $5 billion in charges, continuing a year of tumult for the company. 


"Acting Secretary Su is meeting with both parties today to assess the situation and encourage both parties to move forward in the bargaining process," a spokesperson said. 


While Su has previously spoken with Boeing and the union, it is her first time in Seattle meeting both sides in person, the spokesperson said. 


Roughly 33,000 workers have been on strike since September 13, seeking a 40% wage increase and the restoration of a defined-benefit pension they agreed to give up in 2014.   


The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers was not immediately available for comment. Boeing and a White House spokesperson declined to comment. 


Shares of the aerospace giant fell 1.3% to close Monday at $148.99, following the company's surprise after-hours announcement Friday, which also included a new delay to the 777X jetliner and the ending of civil 767 freighter production. 




Boeing will hold meetings this week to lay out detailed plans, having given few specifics in Friday's announcement, industry sources said. The company also expects a quarterly cash burn of about $1.3 billion, better than anticipated, but still the third consecutive quarter it has burned through cash. 


Boeing will next month send out 60-day notices to thousands of workers in its commercial aviation division, meaning those staff will leave the company in mid-January, one source familiar with the matter said. 


A second phase of notices, if more redundancies are required, would be rolled out in December, the source said. 


A spokesperson for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, which represents engineers at Boeing, said the company informed the union Monday that 60-day notices to their members would be issued on November 15. 


Boeing is expected to refrain from asking for voluntary departures to limit severance cash and avoid an exodus of skills, sources said, adding the company will rely mainly on involuntary layoffs. Rivals are scooping up scarce labor to relieve pressure on aerospace supply chains. 


"The trick will be not losing the 10% of people you want to keep, which is even more important than usual in the post-pandemic skill shortage environment," said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham. 


Industry alarm 


The one-year delay in 777X deliveries to 2026 was widely expected in the industry and brings the lag in delivery of the 777 mini-jumbo successor to six years amid certification and testing delays. 


Emirates Airline President Tim Clark, whose initial order for 150 jets helped launch the world's largest twin-engine jet more than a decade ago, hinted at commercial repercussions.   


"We will be having a serious conversation with them over the next couple of months,” he said in a statement. "I fail to see how Boeing can make any meaningful forecasts of delivery dates." 


He also became the first senior industry figure to articulate fears, whispered privately by some industry leaders in recent weeks, over Boeing's ability to tackle its worst-ever crisis intact. 


"Unless the company is able to raise funds through a rights issue, I see an imminent investment downgrade with Chapter 11 looming on the horizon," Clark told the Air Current aviation news service. 


Emirates is the largest user of the 777 jet family, a long-distance workhorse whose original success has been clouded by delays to its successor and the crisis engulfing Boeing's smaller 737 cash cow over safety and quality issues. 


Friday's package of announcements showed Boeing has just over $10 billion of gross cash, a much-touted level that analysts said would ease some near-term pressure, though the company still needs to raise money by year's end, they said. 


Most analysts expect Boeing to be able to raise up to $15 billion through a share issue. But major airlines' perception of Boeing's financial risk remains a sensitive topic, as many have billions of dollars of deposits sitting with the plane maker — an exposure some already want to limit because of delays, industry sources say. 


Boeing declined to comment on Clark's remarks. 


Ratings agency S&P has warned Boeing risks losing its prized investment-grade credit rating. 


Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth said Monday that recent layoff announcements were not expected to disrupt its programs, which include helicopters and munitions.

## Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters arrested outside New York Stock Exchange

date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — About 200 demonstrators protesting Israel's war in Gaza were arrested in a sit-in outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, police said. 


The protesters chanted “Let Gaza live!" And “Up up with liberation, down down with occupation!" in front of the stock exchange's landmark building in lower Manhattan. 


“The reason we’re here is to demand that the U.S. government stop sending bombs to Israel and stop profiting off of Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,” said Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace, the group that organized the demonstration. “Because what’s been happening for the last year is that Israel is using U.S. bombs to massacre communities in Gaza while simultaneously weapons manufacturers on Wall Street are seeing their stock prices skyrocket.” 


A handful of counter protesters waved Israeli flags and tried to shout down the pro-Palestinian chants. 


None of the pro-Palestinian protesters got inside the exchange, but at least 200 made it inside a security fence on Broad Street, where they sat down and waited to be taken into custody. 


A spokesperson for the exchange declined to comment on the protest. 


Police arrested the protesters one by one, cuffing their hands behind their backs with plastic ties and leading them to vans. Some demonstrators went limp and were carried by three or four officers. 


A police spokesperson said there were about 200 arrests. She did not have details on the charges they faced. 


The protest happened a week after the world marked the anniversary of Hamas' surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the start of Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza, which has since spread to Lebanon and beyond. 


The Lebanese Red Cross said an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 21 people. 


There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and it was not clear what the target was.

## Trump's campaign crowdfunded millions online in untraditional approach to emergency relief

date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump's campaign is using GoFundMe to rally its network of deep-pocketed backers and everyday donors around the survivors of his July assassination attempt and Hurricane Helene's destruction, bucking more traditional avenues of emergency relief. 


The two high-profile fundraisers — organized by the Republican nominee's national finance director — have drawn more than $14 million. They do not violate campaign finance laws, according to legal experts. Nor is the campaign allowed to pocket any proceeds for its own political ends; a GoFundMe spokesperson told The Associated Press that the majority of the Butler, Pennsylvania, funds have been disbursed. 


But the use of a crowdfunding platform marks an unorthodox response to crises from a political campaign. Never before has a major party's presidential candidate turned to the for-profit company — which usually features desperate appeals for help covering tuition costs or medical bills — to mobilize their base toward outside charitable causes. 


"It's pretty unusual and actually quite odd," said Brett Kappel, a longtime campaign finance attorney with Harmon Curran who has advised both Republicans and Democrats. 


It's more typical to see candidates contribute campaign funds to IRS-approved nonprofits during natural disasters, Kappel said. He pointed to Federal Election Commission filings that show U.S. Senator Tim Scott's 2022 campaign gave to the American Red Cross after Hurricane Ian hit South Carolina. 


Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said the motivation arose from "the president wanting to help find a way for his supporters to give as much direct support as they can." 


The finance team only got involved because of their "great expertise in working with large accounts," according to Hughes, and "not one penny of this funding is going anywhere but to those impacted." Hughes said more than $6.5 million of the $7.7 million raised for organizations helping with Hurricane Helene recovery had been disbursed as of Oct. 11. 


"The president has an amazing movement of supporters," Hughes told AP. "With the experience in Butler generating millions of dollars of support, he saw the same opportunity to be a direct conduit for a philanthropic effort from his supporters." 


Longtime Trump associates, conservative celebrities and right-wing groups gave tens of thousands of dollars. Bill Ackman, the CEO of the Pershing Square investment firm who endorsed Trump shortly after the assassination attempt, donated $100,000 for hurricane relief. UFC President Dana White also pitched in $100,000. Republican U.S. Senator Rick Scott said on X that he donated $50,000 from his congressional salary for the Butler, Pennsylvania victims. Also contributing was The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025. 


GoFundMe collects a transaction fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents for every donation to cover credit and debit charges. Its global Trust & Safety team has been communicating closely with organizer Meredith O'Rourke to ensure the safe distribution of donations from the Butler, Pennsylvania, page, according to a company spokesperson. O'Rourke also provided a verified distribution plan, the GoFundMe spokesperson told AP, which the company routinely requires in cases where organizers are withdrawing money on behalf of other recipients. 


Lawyer advises against 


It's not advisable for campaign finance officials to run crowdfunding pages "at the same time they were writing your money for your camp," said Andrew Herman, a Washington lawyer specializing in campaign finance. Because online crowdfunding is less regulated, he said, it would've been "more palatable" to direct supporters toward a recognized nonprofit. 


"But people get into trouble when they try to ascribe rationality or any degree of what we would generally consider best financial practices to campaigns," Herman said. 


"There's no black letter law that says they can't do this," he added. "Should they? Of course not." 


The bulk of the Pennsylvania disbursements were made earlier this month, and more payouts will come while the page remains active, according to Hughes. The "vast majority" has gone to the families of the three people shot, he said. Some funds also compensated a local crane rental company after the owner said he lost business when the ensuing police investigation left him unable to retrieve equipment he'd donated for the rally. 


Money raised for Hurricane Helene victims has gone to four nonprofits. Samaritan's Purse spokesperson Gabrielle Bouquet said the Christian humanitarian aid organization is grateful for Trump's "steadfast support of the work we do in Jesus' name." Bouquet declined to share the exact amount of the donation. 


Water Mission, a Christian engineering nonprofit that builds safe water solutions in disaster areas, confirmed that the South Carolina-based ministry had also received funds. Public relations director Gregg Dinino did not specify the total. 


Mtn2Sea Ministries, which delivers generators and supplies in the immediate aftermath of weather events, said on Facebook that it received $25,000 on Monday. The disaster relief group posted that the proceeds were used to buy South Georgia businesses' gift cards because "the best way to help those in need is to get resources directly into their hands." 


'Combustible dynamic' 


It makes sense that Trump's team gravitated toward crowdfunding, said Benjamin Soskis of the Urban Institute's Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy. The campaign "has often been premised on a suspicion of institutions," he said, and GoFundMe "drew some of its attraction by serving as an alternative to institutional charitable giving." 


But crowdfunding also brings less accountability, Soskis said. Crowdfunding pages don't have the same disclosure requirements as public charities that must divulge their finances in annual tax filings. 


Soskis said Trump's checkered philanthropic ventures have likely brought increased levels of scrutiny. A judge fined Trump $2 million in 2019 for using his since-dissolved charitable foundation to advance his interests. 


"It is a combustible dynamic when you combine campaigning and charitable giving," Soskis said. "The extra dynamics of crowdfunding and Trump's own history with philanthropy itself adds more fuel to that fire."

## The Latest Nobel Winner Has a Different Approach to Solving Climate Change

date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News

To do so, the trio looked at the history of those countries’ institutions — laws, modes of government, relationship between the state and individuals — and drew out which are conducive to wealth and which lead to poverty.</p><p>Long story short, “extractive” institutions set up to reward a narrow elite tend to hurt economic development over time, as in <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/colonial-origins-of-comparative-development.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much of Africa</u></a>, which was colonized by Europeans who didn’t actually live there. “Inclusive” institutions, by contrast, arose in the United States and Canada, where there was significantly more European migration, thus incentivizing the ruling elite to set up institutions that benefitted a broader range of (again, European) residents.</p><p>While this research rests heavily on <em><em>the climate</em></em> (the reason Europeans avoided African colonies was because of the high rate of disease in tropical climates), it does not touch on <em><em>climate change</em></em> specifically. But Acemoglu especially is an incredibly wide-ranging scholar and has devoted some time to the specific questions of climate change — and in so doing has been a direct critic of Nordhaus, Stockholm’s preferred climate economist.</p><p>“Existing approaches in economics still do not provide the right framework for managing the problems that will confront us over the next several decades,” <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/what-climate-change-requires-of-economics-by-daron-acemoglu-2021-09" target="_blank"><u>Acemoglu wrote</u></a> in a 2021 essay titled “What Climate Change Requires of Economics,” referring directly to Nordhaus’s Nobel-winning work. “Although the economics discipline has evolved over time to acknowledge environmental risks and costs, it has yet to rise to the challenge of climate change. A problem as massive as this one will require a fundamental reconsideration of some of the field's most deeply held assumptions.”</p><p>His criticisms included that Nordhaus’s more gradualistic approach — <a href="https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2024-03/barrage-nordhaus-2024-policies-projections-and-the-social-cost-of-carbon-results-from-the-dice-2023-model.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the latest version of his model</u></a> spits out that a 1.5 degree Celsius warming target is “infeasible,” and the “cost vs. benefit optimal” amount of warming as 2.6 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels with a carbon price that rises to $115 per ton by 2050 — ignores both the best way to reduce emissions and the risk of not doing so fast enough.</p><p>Acemoglu is far more optimistic about how policy can direct technological development and less sanguine about additional warming over and above the Paris Agreement limits. He argues that the possibility of theoretical “<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-nine-tipping-points-that-could-be-triggered-by-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tipping points</u></a>,” where exceeding <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Eb4u07ljUreXRyc2NnRXQ5RkE/view?resourcekey=0-LT7b_pQG5krLrO6DU5yKlg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>certain climate thresholds</u></a> by even a small amount may cause dramatic damages, make the risk of such overshoot far too great.</p><p>He also took issue with the discount rate applied to spending later vs. spending now in Nordhaus’s models. The basic idea is that a dollar spent today to mitigate the effects of climate change is more valuable than one spent in 2050. But the rates Nordhaus uses — which he derives from real-world investment returns — implies that in order for spending now to be worth it later, the benefits in 2050 or 2100 must be very, very large.</p><p>“There is a plausible economic (and philosophical) case to be made for why future essential public goods should be valued differently than private goods or other types of public consumption,” Acemoglu wrote in 2021, arguing that discount rates derived from investment returns, <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/nepa/119017/175400/213681/Exhibit_20_Nordhaus_PNAS_2017-1518-23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>like the ones Nordhaus uses</u></a>, might not be the best guide to public policy.</p><p>So what does the latest Nobel laureate want instead? Well, something like what the United States has been doing the past few years.<br/><br/>Accounting for the economic benefits of domestic or “endogenous” technological development, Acemoglu’s research finds that "the transition to cleaner energy is much more important than simply reducing energy consumption, and that technological interventions need to be redirected far more aggressively than they have been.” He explored how this process could work in papers he wrote over more than a decade, developing a model for this kind of directed technological change and applying it to the United States, starting as far back as 2012.</p><p>Across all his work on climate change, Acemoglu argues that a focus on pricing the “externalities” of carbon emissions — the harm emissions impose on everyone that isn’t reflected in the prices of fossil fuels — is myopic. Instead, the challenge is both restricting emissions <em><em>and</em></em> fostering clean technologies that can take the place of dirty ones, which have had a remarkable head start in investment.</p><p>In “<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/The%20Environment%20and%20Directed%20Technical%20Change.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The Environment and Directed Technical Change</u></a>,” published in 2012 and co-written with Philippe Aghion, Leonardo Bursztyn, and David Hemous, Acemoglu argues that a mixture of carbon taxes and research subsides could “redirect technical change and avoid an environmental disaster” by imposing a cost on dirty technology and boosting clean technology.<br/><br/>Such an approach would probably rest heavily on positive subsidies and encouraging clean technology and less on a carbon tax, the four write (although a carbon tax would still help to “discourage research” into polluting technologies). It would also need to happen soon.</p><p>“Directed technical change also calls for immediate and decisive action in contrast to the implications of several exogenous technology models used in previous economic analyses.”</p><p>This framework does not precisely match United States policy — we have no carbon tax — but it does somewhat approximate it. The Biden administration’s approach to climate policy centers on large-scale investments in clean technologies, whether they’re tax credits for non-carbon-emitting electricity production or financing for clean energy projects from the Loan Programs Office, combined with a suite of Environmental Protection Agency rules that are intended to reduce pollution from fossil fuel power plants (along with an actual direct fee on methane emissions).</p><p>This approach is embedded within an overall industrial policy that’s supposed to make the economy more productive — a counter-argument to the idea that climate spending is an economic drag that trades off with environmental harms in the future. Acemoglu, too, questions the idea that there’s a tradeoff between economic growth and spending to combat climate change. Not only could renewables be cheaper than fossil fuels, “an energy transition can improve productive capacity and thus lead to an expansion of output, because transition to cleaner technologies can boost investment and the rate of technological progress,” he and his co-authors write.</p><p>Acemoglu has also weighed in on one the more controversial questions in climate policy and economics: the shale gas boom. <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-08/Climate%20Change%2C%20Directed%20Innovation%2C%20and%20Energy%20Transistion%20-%20The%20Long-run%20Consequences%20of%20the%20Shale%20Gas%20Revolution.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In a 2023 paper</u></a> written, again with Aghion, Hemous, and Lint Barrage, he weighed the effects of dramatic increase of domestically extracted natural gas, focusing on the importance of technological development. The Environmental Protection Agency attributes the decline in US greenhouse gas emissions since 2010 <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in part to</u></a> “the growing use of natural gas and renewables to generate electricity in place of more carbon-intensive fuels,” due to natural gas replacing coal electricity generation. While this logic has come under fire from <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>some activists and researchers</u></a> who say the government’s models underestimate methane leakage from natural gas operations, Acemoglu took a different tack.</p><p>Yes, natural gas substituting for coal reduces short-run emissions, he and his co-authors concluded, but also, “the natural gas boom discourages innovation directed at clean energy, which delays and can even permanently prevent the energy transition to zero carbon.” They backed up this assertion by pointing to a decline in the total share of patents rewarded to renewable energy innovation between 2009 and 2016.</p><p>The way out is that same mix of carbon prices and technology subsidies Acemoglu has been recommending in some form since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kelly Clarkson was last on top of the charts</u></a>, which “enables emission reductions in the short run, while optimal policy would ensure that the long-run green transition is not disrupted.”</p><p>If the Biden Administration’s climate policy works out, it will look something like that, and the prize will be far greater than anything given out in Stockholm.</p>

## Washington's National Zoo set to welcome new pair of pandas from China

date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA

The National Zoo's long dark panda drought seems to be coming to an end. 


Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears is set to arrive. 


A pair of 3-year-old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan and will soon be flown to Washington, according to a statement by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. 


"Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots, as well as water and medicine," the statement said, adding that the partnership will "make new contributions in protecting global biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two countries." 


It's unclear exactly when the bears will arrive in Washington, but there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period before they are introduced to the public. 


Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year exchange agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous agreement expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its iconic furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions.

## Lilly Ledbetter, American icon of the fight for equal pay, dies at 86

date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA

New York — Lilly Ledbetter, an former Alabama factory manager whose lawsuit against her employer made her an icon of the equal pay movement and led to landmark wage discrimination legislation, has died at 86.


Ledbetter's discovery that she was earning less than her male counterparts for doing the same job at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. plant in Alabama led to her lawsuit, which ultimately failed when the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she had filed her complaint too late. The court ruled that workers must file lawsuits within six months of first receiving a discriminatory paycheck — in Ledbetter's case, years before she learned about the disparity through an anonymous letter.


Two years later, former President Barack Obama signed into the law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gave workers the right to sue within 180 days of receiving each discrimination paycheck, not just the first one.


"Lilly Ledbetter never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work," Obama said in a statement Monday. "Lilly did what so many Americans before her have done: setting her sights high for herself and even higher for her children and grandchildren."




Ledbetter died Saturday of respiratory failure, according to a statement from her family cited by the Alabama news site AL.com.


Ledbetter continued campaigning for equal pay for decades after winning the law named after her. A film about her life starring Patricia Clarkson premiered last week at the Hamptons International Film Festival.


The team behind the film, "LILLY," issued a statement of condolence on social media.


"Lilly was an ordinary woman who achieved extraordinary things, and her story continues to motivate us all. We will miss her," the team said.


In January, President Joe Biden marked the 15th anniversary of the law named after Ledbetter with new measures to help close the gender wage gap, including a new rule barring the federal government from considering a person's current or past pay when determining their salary.


Ledbetter had advocated for the measure in a January opinion piece for Ms. Magazine penned with Deborah Vagins, director of the Equal Pay Today advocacy group. But Ledbetter and other advocates for years have been frustrated that more comprehensive initiatives have stalled, including the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963.


The sense of urgency among advocates deepened after an annual report from the Census Bureau last month found that the gender wage gap between men and women widened for the first time 20 years. In 2023, women working full time earned 83 cents on the dollar compared with men, down from 84 cents in 2022.


Even before then, advocates had been frustrated that wage gap improvement had mostly stalled for the last 20 years despite women making gains in the C-suite and earning college degrees at a faster rate than men. Experts say the reasons for the enduring gap are multifaceted, including the overrepresentation of women in lower-paying industries and weak childcare system that pushes many women to step back from their careers in their peak earnings years.


In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Ledbetter wrote a opinion piece in The New York Times detailing the harassment she faced as a manager at the Goodyear factory and drawing a link between workplace sexual harassment and pay discrimination.


"She was indefatigable," said Emily Martin, chief program officer at the National Women's Law Center, which worked closely with Ledbetter. "She was always ready to lend her voice, to show up to do a video, to write an op-ed. She was always ready to go."


Ledbetter was a manager at the Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama, and had worked there 19 years when she received an anonymous note saying she was being paid significantly less than three male colleagues.


She filed a lawsuit in 1999 and initially won $3.8 million in backpay and damages from a federal court. She never received the money after eventually losing her case before the Supreme Court.


Although the law named after her didn't directly address the gender wage gap, Martin said it set an important precedent "for ensuring that we don't just have the promise of equal pay on the books but we have a way to enforce the law."


"She is a really an inspiration in showing us how a loss does not mean you can't win," Martin said. "We know her name because she lost, and she lost big, and she kept coming back from it and kept working until the day she died to change that loss into real gains for women across the country."

## Should You Trust Zillow’s Climate Risk Data?

date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News

It will focus on the risk from five types of dangers: floods, wildfires, high winds, heat, and air quality. </p><p>The data has the potential to transform how Americans think about buying a home, especially because climate change will likely worsen many of those dangers. About 70% of Americans look at Zillow at some point during the process of buying a home, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/z/corp/about/#:~:text=Zillow's%20ecosystem%20of%20products%20and,some%20point%20in%20their%20transaction." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to the company</u></a>.</p><p>“Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,” Skylar Olsen, Zillow’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Healthy markets are ones where buyers and sellers have access to all relevant data for their decisions.”</p><p>That’s true — if the information is accurate. But can homebuyers actually trust Zillow’s climate risk data? When climate experts have looked closely at the underlying data Zillow uses to assess climate risk, they have walked away unconvinced.</p><p>Zillow’s climate risk data comes from <a href="https://firststreet.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>First Street Technology</u></a>, a New York-based company that uses computer models to estimate the risk that weather and climate change pose to homes and buildings. It is far and away the most prominent company focused on modeling the physical risks of climate change. (Although it was initially established as a nonprofit foundation, <a href="https://firststreet.org/press/first-street-announces-new-structure-investment-partners-and-advisor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">First Street <u>reorganized</u></a> as a for-profit company and <a href="https://firststreet.org/press/first-street-finalizes-a-46-million-series-a-to-scale-breakthrough-advancements-in-physical-climate-risk-modeling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accepted</u></a> $46 million in investment earlier this year.)</p><p>But few experts believe that tools like First Street’s are capable of actually modeling the dangers of climate change at a property-by-property level. A report from a team of White House scientific advisors <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PCAST_Extreme-Weather-Report_April2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concluded</u></a> last year that these models are of “questionable quality,” and a <em><em>Bloomberg </em></em>investigation <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-flood-fire-climate-risk-analytics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a> that different climate risk models could return wildly different catastrophe estimates for the same property.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of Zillow</small></p><p>Not all of First Street’s data is seen as equally suspect. Its estimates of heat and air pollution risk have generally attracted less criticism from experts. But its estimates of flooding and wildfire risk — which are the most catastrophic events for homeowners — are generally thought to be inadequate at best. </p><p>So while Zillow will soon tell you with seeming precision that a certain home has a 1.1% chance of facing a wildfire in the next 30 years, potential homebuyers should take that kind of estimate with “a lot of grains of salt,” Michael Wara, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, told me. </p><p>Here’s a short guide for how to think through Zillow’s estimates of climate risk. </p><p>Neither First Street nor Zillow immediately responded to requests for comment.</p><h3>If Zillow tells you  a property has flooded recently, take it seriously.</h3><p>Zillow has said that, when the data is available, it will tell users whether a given home has flooded or burned in a wildfire recently. (It will also say whether a home is near a source of air pollution.)</p><p>Homebuyers should take that information seriously, <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/madison-condon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Madison Condon</u></a>, a Boston University School of Law professor who studies climate change and financial markets, told me. </p><p>“If the house flooded in the recent past, then that should be a major red flag to you,” she said. Houses that have flooded recently are very likely to flood again, she said. <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joel-scata/growing-nationwide-trend-states-requiring-flood-disclosure#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%2010%20states%20(Florida,their%20flood%20risk%20disclosure%20laws." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Only 10 states</u></a> require a home seller to disclose a flood to a potential buyer.</p><h3>Use Zillow’s flood risk assessment as a starting place — but contact the local government to learn more.</h3><p>First Street claims that its physics-based models can identify the risk that any individual property will flood. But the ability to determine whether a given house will flood depends on having an intricate knowledge of local infrastructure, including stormwater drains and what exists on other properties, and that data does not seem to exist in anyone’s model at the moment, Condon said. </p><p>When <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-flood-fire-climate-risk-analytics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>compared</u></a> the output of three different flooding models, including First Street’s, they agreed on results for only 5% of properties. </p><p>If you’re worried about a home’s flood risk, then contact the local government and see if you can look at a flood map or even talk to a flood manager, Condon said. Many towns and cities keep flood maps in their records or on their website that are more granular than what First Street is capable of, she said. </p><p>“The local flood manager who has walked the property will almost always have a better grasp of flood risk than the big, top-down national model,” she said.</p><h3>Don’t hesitate to buy flood insurance. </h3><p>In some cases, Zillow will recommend that a home buyer purchase federal flood insurance. That’s generally not a bad idea, Condon said, even if Zillow reaches that conclusion using national model data that has errors or mistakes. </p><p>“It simply is true that way more people should be buying flood insurance than generally think they should,” she said. “So a general overcorrection on that would be good.”</p><h3>Zillow probably underestimates a home’s wildfire risk, especially out west.</h3><p>If you’re looking at buying a home in a wildfire-prone area, especially in the American West, then you should generally assume that Zillow is underestimating its wildfire risk, Wara, the Stanford researcher, told me. </p><p>That’s because computer models that estimate wildfire risk are in a fairly early stage of development and improving rapidly. Even the best academic simulations lack the kind of granular, structure-level data that would allow them to predict a property’s forward-looking wildfire risk. </p><p>That is actually a bigger problem for homebuyers than for insurance companies, he said. A home insurance company gets to decide whether to insure a property every year. If it looks at new science and concludes that a given town or structure is too risky, then it can raise its premiums or even simply decline to cover a property at all. (State Farm <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-farm-halts-home-insurance-sales-in-california-5748c771" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stopped</u></a> selling home insurance policies in California last year, partly because of wildfire risk.) </p><p>But when homeowners buy a house, their lives and their wealth get locked into that property for 30 years. “Maybe your kids are going to the school district,” he said. It’s much harder to sell a home when you can’t get it covered. “You have an illiquid asset, and it’s a lot harder to move.”</p><p>That means First Street’s wildfire risk data should be taken as “absolute minimum estimate,” Wara said. In a wildfire-prone area, “the real risk is most likely much higher” than its models say.</p><h3>Wildfire models are especially bad at predicting the most destructive types of fires.</h3><p>Over the past several years, runaway wildland fires have killed dozens of people or destroyed tens of thousands of homes in <a href="https://lahainatown.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lahaina, Hawaii</u></a>; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/09/777801169/the-camp-fire-destroyed-11-000-homes-a-year-later-only-11-have-been-rebuilt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Paradise, California</u></a>; and <a href="https://research.noaa.gov/2024/01/08/looking-back-at-colorados-marshall-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Marshall, Colorado</u></a>.</p><p>But in those cases, once the fire began incinerating homes, it ceased to be a wildland fire and became a structure-to-structure fire. The fire began to leap from house to house like a book of matches, condemning entire neighborhoods to burn within minutes. </p><p>Modern computer models do an especially poor job of simulating that transition — the moment when a wildland fire becomes an urban conflagration, Wara said. Although it only happens in perhaps 0.5% of the most intense fires, those fires are responsible for destroying the most homes.</p><p>But “how that happens and how to prevent that is not well understood yet,” he said. “And if they’re not well understood yet from a scientific perspective, that means it’s not in the [First Street] model.”</p><p>Nor do the best university wildfire models have good data on every individual property’s structural-level details — such as what material its walls or roof <a href="https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/fire-prevention-education-mitigation/wildfire-mitigation/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are made of</u></a> — that would make it susceptible to fire. </p><h3>Your whole neighborhood matters when assessing flood or wildfire risk. </h3><p>When assessing whether your home faces wildfire risk, its structure is very important. But “you have to know what your neighbor’s houses look like, too, within about a 250-yard radius. So that’s your whole neighborhood,” Wara said. “I don’t think anyone has that data.”</p><p>A similar principle goes for thinking about flood risk, Condon said. Your home might not flood, she said, but it also matters whether the roads to your house are still driveable or whether the power lines fail. “It’s not particularly useful to have a flood-resilient home if your whole neighborhood gets washed out,” she said.</p><p>Experts agree that the most important interventions to discourage wildfire — or, for that matter, floods — have to happen at the community level. Although few communities are doing prescribed burns or fuel reduction programs right now, some are, Wara said. </p><p>But because nobody is collecting data about those programs, national risk models like First Street’s would not factor those programs into an area’s wildfire risk, he said. (In the rare case that a government is<em> </em>clearing fuel or doing a prescribed burn around a town, wildfire risk there might actually be lower than Zillow says, Wara added.)</p><p>Going forward, figuring out a property’s climate risk — much like pushing for community-level resilience investment — shouldn’t be left up to individuals, Condon said. </p><p>The state of California <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/california-to-explore-first-in-nation-public-wildfire-catastrophe-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is investing</u></a> in a public wildfire catastrophe model so that it can figure out which homes and towns face the highest risk. She said that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal entities that buy home mortgages, could invest in their own internal climate-risk assessments to build the public’s capacity to understand climate risk. </p><p>“I would advocate for this not to be an every-man-for-himself, every-consumer-has-to-make-a-decision situation,” Condon said. </p>

## Harris, Trump campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania Monday

date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA

Harrisburg, Pennsylvania  — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will take their fight for Pennsylvania to opposite ends of the state on Monday, with Harris speaking in the northwest corner in Erie and Trump in the southeastern suburbs of Philadelphia.


Democrat Harris and Republican Trump have been making regular appearances in what is the country's largest battleground state — it will be Harris' 10th visit to Pennsylvania this campaign season, and just last week Trump made stops in both Scranton and Reading.


Pennsylvania's energy industry and natural gas fracking are likely topics as they compete for the fraction of the state's voters who have not made up their minds. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential race.


Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania on his way to winning the presidency in 2016, but native Scrantonian Joe Biden beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago.


Harris will be holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state's reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29.


Harris plans to talk up early voting during her rally. And she'll stop by a Black-owned small business in Erie in advance of the rally to promote her proposals to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances to thrive as Democrats try to energize the voting bloc.


Trump plans a town hall Monday at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center and Fairgrounds in suburban Oaks, hoping to drive up turnout among his supporters.


Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday's scheduled events, they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns' public events.


Michigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on winning states that had been part of the Democrats' so-called "blue wall" until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer.


Democrats have won three straight elections for governor, and both current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state's legislature is closely divided.

## NASA spacecraft rockets toward Jupiter's moon Europa, searching for keys to life

date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA

CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida  — A NASA spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a quest to explore Jupiter’s tantalizing moon Europa and reveal whether its vast hidden ocean might hold the keys to life.


It will take Europa Clipper 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter, where it will slip into orbit around the giant gas planet and sneak close to Europa during dozens of radiation-drenched flybys.


Scientists are almost certain a deep, global ocean exists beneath Europa’s icy crust. And where there is water, there could be life, making the moon one of the most promising places out there to hunt for it.


Europa Clipper won’t look for life; it has no life detectors. Instead, the spacecraft will zero in on the ingredients necessary to sustain life, searching for organic compounds and other clues as it peers beneath the ice for suitable conditions.


SpaceX started Clipper on its 3 billion-kilometer (1.8 million-mile) journey, launching the spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. An hour later, the spacecraft separated from the upper stage, floated off and called home.


“Please say goodbye to Clipper on its way to Europa,” NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's flight director Pranay Mishra announced from Southern California.


"The science on this is really captivating,” NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free told The Associated Press back at the launch site. Scientists are still learning about the depths of our own ocean, “and here we are looking that far out.”


The $5.2 billion mission almost got derailed by transistors.


NASA didn’t learn until spring that Clipper’s transistors might be more vulnerable to Jupiter’s intense radiation field than anticipated. Clipper will endure the equivalent of several million chest X-rays during each of the 49 Europa flybys. The space agency spent months reviewing everything before concluding in September that the mission could proceed as planned.


Hurricane Milton added to the anxiety, delaying the launch by several days.


“What a great day. We’re so excited,” JPL Director Laurie Leshin said after liftoff.


About the size of a basketball court with its solar wings unfurled, Clipper will swing past Mars and then Earth on its way to Jupiter for gravity assists. The nearly 5,700-kilogram (13,000-pound) probe should reach the solar system’s biggest planet in 2030.


Clipper will circle Jupiter every 21 days. One of those days will bring it close to Europa, among 95 known moons at Jupiter and close to our own moon in size.


The spacecraft will skim as low as 25 kilometers (16 miles) above Europa — much closer than the few previous visitors. Onboard radar will attempt to penetrate the moon’s ice sheet, believed to be 15 kilometers to 24 kilometers (10 miles to 15 miles or more) thick. The ocean below could be 120 kilometers (80 miles) or more deep.


The spacecraft holds nine instruments, with its sensitive electronics stored in a vault with dense zinc and aluminum walls for protection against radiation. Exploration will last until 2034.


“Ocean worlds like Europa are not only unique because they might be habitable, but they might be habitable today,” NASA’s Gina DiBraccio said on the eve of launch.


If conditions are found to be favorable for life at Europa, then that opens up the possibility of life at other ocean worlds in our solar system and beyond, according to scientists. With an underground ocean and geysers, Saturn’s moon Enceladus is another top candidate.

## Why Cringe-Worthy School Start Times Are Bad for Kids

## Everything’s Bigger in Texas, Including Hydrogen Emissions

date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News

Their proposal to produce the clean-burning fuel using natural gas and carbon capture, in addition to other methods, was selected by the Biden administration a year ago to become one of the country’s seven clean hydrogen hubs. But a trio of researchers at the University of Texas at Austin just showed that there’s a dirty paradox at the heart of the plan.</p><p>In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-024-01653-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> published in the journal <em><em>Nature Energy</em></em> on Monday, the researchers show that upstream emissions in the natural gas supply chain in Texas are so high that it’s essentially impossible to make hydrogen from it that would meet federal standards for “clean” hydrogen. But, the authors warn, the government’s proposed method for measuring the carbon intensity of hydrogen overlooks these emissions. That means these Texas hydrogen projects could get millions in public funding in the name of tackling climate change, all while making the problem worse. </p><p>“You’re investing so much in developing a hydrogen economy, and then it turns out, 10 years later, half of them are not even low carbon,” Arvind Ravikumar, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the authors of the new paper, told me. “I think that’s a real risk.”</p><p>This story might sound familiar. I’ve written extensively about the emissions accounting challenges plaguing another method for making clean hydrogen that requires only water and carbon-free electricity, known as electrolysis. The problem there is that the electric grid still runs largely on fossil fuels, and so plugging in a hydrogen plant will produce indirect emissions, even if the production process itself is clean. </p><p>The new study highlights a similar issue with hydrogen made from natural gas. Of course, since this method uses fossil fuels, it’s already substantially more difficult to prove it has any climate benefits at all. In theory, the emissions can be greatly reduced, although likely not entirely eliminated, by capturing the carbon emitted from the plant. The authors show, however, that the more important factor is where the natural gas comes from. </p><p>Natural gas is mostly methane, a greenhouse gas more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term, and leaks are notoriously underestimated. But any assessment of the benefits of hydrogen made from methane must take leakage into account, and some natural gas fields are leakier than others. </p><p>The paper analyzes a range of scenarios for two hypothetical hydrogen plants — one on the Gulf Coast that sources natural gas from the Permian Basin, and one in Ohio that gets gas from the Marcellus Shale. The Treasury Department’s draft rules for calculating the carbon intensity of hydrogen for the clean hydrogen tax credit say these two plants should assume that a national average of 1% of the natural gas extracted from the ground is leaked into the atmosphere where it warms the planet. But more than a decade of on-the-ground measurements, combined with more recent satellite data, has shown that methane leaks vary widely from well to well and basin to basin.</p><p>Using the more accurate, though still approximate, leakage rates of 5.2% in the Permian and 1.25% in the Marcellus, the authors calculated the carbon intensity of hydrogen produced at the two plants under various assumptions. What if the carbon capture system is more effective? Or less effective? What if the capture equipment is powered by renewables? What if we measure the warming effects of methane over 20 years versus over 100 years? </p><p>No matter which variable they changed, one result stayed the same: Hydrogen made from Permian Basin gas greatly exceeded the government’s definition of clean hydrogen, i.e. 4 kilograms of CO2 released per kilogram of hydrogen produced. In fact, the emissions from natural gas production in the Permian Basin alone pushed it over that standard. Hydrogen made from Marcellus Shale gas, on the other hand, has the potential to qualify as clean if at least 90% of the carbon at the plant is captured.</p><p>The findings suggest that without enormous efforts to reduce those upstream emissions, which come from leaks, venting, and flaring at the wellhead and along the pipeline system, natural gas-based hydrogen projects on the Gulf Coast should not qualify for federal subsidies.</p><p>The authors advocate for the Treasury’s final guidelines for calculating the carbon intensity of hydrogen to account for these regional differences. “I think that, to begin with, will make a huge difference in accurately estimating the emissions intensity of these projects,” Ravikumar said. As new methane regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency go into effect, it’s possible that projects that are not eligible today could become eligible in the future. “But the point is, you’ll only know that if you do your carbon accounting accurately across supply chains,” he said. </p><p>One problem with this solution is that hydrogen producers have access to another federal tax credit that doesn’t require any analysis of how clean the hydrogen is — up to $85 for every ton of carbon they capture and sequester underground. Indeed, at least one project developer has <a href="https://www.hydrogeninsight.com/production/exclusive-we-will-not-claim-the-us-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-on-our-4-5bn-blue-h2-plant-in-louisiana-air-products/2-1-1646412" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already said they will go after that subsidy</u></a> instead of the one for clean hydrogen.</p><p>Ravikumar thinks those developers are facing a major risk. “At the end of the day, you’re going to buy hydrogen from these companies explicitly for its low-carbon attributes,” he said. “Right now we did this analysis, but very soon, you’re going to have satellites that are going to look at all these regions and be able to make emissions information publicly available. And once you’re able to do that, you can’t make up numbers on paper.”</p>

<p>More than 400,000 electricity customers are out of power across Florida this morning. After the storm, ports, transfer terminals and roads were closed, and that&#8217;s disrupted the supply of critical products, including gasoline. We&#8217;ll get into it. Then, you may be getting an inundation of fundraising texts and emails from the Trump-Vance or Harris-Walz. But do the campaigns really need your money at this point? And later, we&#8217;ll learn about hotel-to-housing conversions.</p>

## Historic Jersey Shore amusement park closes after generations of family thrills

date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA

OCEAN CITY, N.J.  — For generations of vacationers heading to Ocean City, the towering “Giant Wheel” was the first thing they saw from miles away.


The sight of the 140-foot-tall (42-meter) ride let them know they were getting close to the Jersey Shore town that calls itself “America's Greatest Family Resort,” with its promise of kid-friendly beaches, seagulls and sea shells, and a bustling boardwalk full of pizza, ice cream and cotton candy.


And in the heart of it was Gillian’s Wonderland Pier, an amusement park that was the latest in nearly a century-long line of family-friendly amusement attractions operated by the family of Ocean City’s mayor.


But the rides were to fall silent and still Sunday night, as the park run by Ocean City’s mayor and nurtured by generations of his ancestors, closed down, the victim of financial woes made worse by the lingering aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Superstorm Sandy.




Gillian and his family have operated amusement rides and attractions on the Ocean City Boardwalk for 94 years. The latest iteration of the park, Wonderland, opened in 1965.


“I tried my best to sustain Wonderland for as long as possible, through increasingly difficult challenges each year,” Mayor Jay Gillian wrote in August when he announced the park would close. “It's been my life, my legacy and my family. But it's no longer a viable business.”


Gillian did not respond to numerous requests for comment over the past week.


Sheryl Gross was at the park for its final day with her two children and five grandchildren, enjoying it one last time.


“I've been coming here forever,” she said. “My daughter is 43 and I've been coming here since she was 2 years old in a stroller. Now I'm here with my grandchildren.”


She remembers decades of bringing her family from Gloucester Township in the southern New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia to create happy family memories at Wonderland.


“Just the excitement on their faces when they get on the rides,” she said. “It really made it feel family-friendly. A lot of that is going to be lost now.”




There were long lines Sunday for the Giant Wheel, the log flume and other popular rides as people used the last of ride tickets many had bought earlier in the year, thinking Wonderland would go on forever.


A local non-profit group, Friends of OCNJ History and Culture, is raising money to try and save the amusement park, possibly under a new owner who might be more amenable to buying it with some financial assistance. Bill Merritt, one of the non-profit's leaders, said the group has raised over $1 million to help meet what could be a $20-million price tag for the property.


“Ocean City will be fundamentally different without this attraction,” he said. “This town relies on being family-friendly. The park has rides targeted at kids; it's called ‘Wonderland’ for a reason.”


The property's current owner, Icona Resorts, previously proposed a $150-million, 325-room luxury hotel elsewhere on Ocean City's boardwalk, but the city rejected those plans.


The company's CEO, Eustace Mita, said earlier this year he would take at least until the end of the year to propose a use for the amusement park property.


He bought it in 2021 after Gillian's family was in danger of defaulting on bank loans for the property.


At a community meeting last month, Gillian said Wonderland could not bounce back from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the pandemic in 2020 and an increase in New Jersey’s minimum wage that doubled his payroll costs, leaving him $4 million in debt.


Mita put up funds to stave off a sheriff's sale of the property, and gave the mayor three years to turn the business around. That deadline expired this year.


Mita did not respond to requests for comment.


Merritt said he and others can't imagine Ocean City without Wonderland.


“You look at it with your heart, and you say ‘You’re losing all the cherished memories and all the history; how can you let that go?'” he said. “And then you look at it with your head and you say, ‘They are the reason this town is profitable; how can you let that go?’”

## You’ve Seen Taylor Krause on ‘Love Is Blind.’ Now Read Her Policy Paper.

date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMzQ5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzE2MzUyNX0.SyIVuFIFFT1rBzM-MPuN1wuPTVo_SCqSQANZiIY22A4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Millions of Americans first met Washington, D.C., resident Taylor Krause when she appeared on Netflix’s dating show “Love Is Blind.” The series frames getting engaged as a type of matching problem, where contestants talk to each other, fall in love, and get engaged before they meet each other in person. </p><p>But here at Heatmap, we know Krause’s work because of a different type of matching problem: how to match clean hydrogen makers with new sources of clean electricity.</p><p>Krause works on the problem of decarbonizing heavy industry for the climate policy think tank RMI. Her team is wrapped up in <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>a sprawling fight</u></a> over how to regulate the clean hydrogen industry, a fight Heatmap followed keenly. The battle could determine how the government spends up to an estimated $100 billion in tax credits to incentivize the production of green hydrogen.</p><p>Treasury recently told Heatmap those regulations will be finalized by <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>the end of the year</u></a>. Meanwhile, the newest salvo in that fight — this being D.C., it took the form of a policy memo — was released on Monday by RMI. <a href="https://rmi.org/a-roadmap-for-designing-hydrogen-projects-for-45v-compliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The white paper</u></a>, coauthored by Krause, explains how developers could actually build clean hydrogen projects that are connected to the power grid while meeting the government’s stringent proposed standards. </p><p>It emerged in part from RMI’s collaboration with a “working group spanning developers, registries, and electricity forecasting experts,” according to the paper, and it proposes a series of ways hydrogen developers can meet the stringent “<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>three pillars</u></a>” standards the government has proposed. These rules would require that any electricity used to electrolyze water and extract hydrogen itself be produced by new zero-carbon sources during the same time period it’s used, and on the same power grid as the electrolyzer. </p><p>This three-step approach aims to keep the generous hydrogen tax credit from creating higher electricity prices across the power grid and <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99ve%20developed%20a%20structure%20that%20will%20drive%20innovation%20and%20create%20good%2Dpaying%20jobs%20in%20this%20emerging%20industry%20while%20strengthening%20our%20energy%20security%20and%20reducing%20emissions%20in%20hard%2Dto%2Dtransition%20sectors%20of%20the%20economy%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said." target="_self"><u>generating more emissions</u></a> than the hydrogen produced will mitigate, but it has been criticized by some companies for being too arduous and complicated to comply with. (Some hydrogen makers, such as the industrial gas-making giant Air Products, <a href="https://www.airproducts.com/energy-transition/air-products-response-to-45v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support</u></a> the three pillars approach.) </p><p>One of the biggest topics the new memo tackles is the problem of buying clean electricity. If America regulates the clean hydrogen industry as the Biden administration has proposed, then eventually hydrogen companies will need to buy electricity credits from a “registry” — a company that can guarantee the power the hydrogen companies bought actually complies with the rules.</p><p>Those registries don’t exist right now. Until they do, the new memo argues, hydrogen makers should go straight to the source and solve the “matching problem” by contracting directly with a newly built solar, wind, or zero-carbon power source, using a two-way deal like a power purchase agreement, <a href="https://rmi.org/people/nathan-iyer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Nathan Iyer</u></a>, a senior associate at RMI and co-author of the paper, told me. (Krause didn’t have time to talk.)</p><p>In other words: If you’re a clean hydrogen maker trying to buy electricity to power your electrolyzer, then love — or at least your procurement budget — should <em><em>not </em></em>be blind. Good to know. The memo ticks through a few other myths about the new standards that Krause and Iyer want to debunk. It’s a good reminder that while there might be no rules in love and war, there are <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-28359/section-45v-credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-section-48a15-election-to-treat-clean-hydrogen#h-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than 100 pages of proposed rules</u></a> for taking advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean hydrogen production tax credit.</p>
