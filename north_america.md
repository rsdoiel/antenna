## US House panel to consider releasing report on Trump's attorney general nominee

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee is set to meet Wednesday to decide whether to release its investigative report on former Representative Matt Gaetz, who was accused of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use before he was picked by President-elect Donald Trump to be attorney general in his new administration.


Several U.S. senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, are demanding that the report be released so they can consider the scope of Gaetz’s background as they undertake their constitutionally mandated role of confirming or rejecting a new president’s Cabinet nominees.


Last Wednesday, Trump named Gaetz, 42, a Republican congressman from Florida for eight years, to become the country’s top law enforcement official. Hours later, Gaetz resigned from Congress, even though he had just been reelected to a fifth term. His resignation ended the House Ethics Committee’s investigation, which had been nearing a conclusion.


But it remained uncertain whether the panel would divulge what conclusions it had reached.


The committee, with five Democrats and five Republicans, had been looking into allegations that Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and used drugs illicitly. Gaetz has denied the allegations. The Justice Department, which Gaetz hopes to lead, investigated the case but declined last year to bring any charges.


House Speaker Mike Johnson, who leads the narrow Republican majority in the chamber, has contended that no ethics report should be made public because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. However, there have been instances where that has occurred in the past.


Johnson told CNN on Sunday that senators reviewing the Gaetz nomination as the country’s top law enforcement official will “have a vigorous review and vetting process,” but that they did not need to see the House Ethics Committee’s report. Some senators have suggested they could move to subpoena it if it is not turned over to them voluntarily.


Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin on Sunday told NBC's "Meet the Press" that the panel should share its report with the Senate.


"The Senate should have access to that," Mullin said. "Should it be released to the public or not? That I guess will be part of the negotiations."


Gaetz is one of several Trump appointees to his Cabinet who do not have the credentials normally seen in candidates for high-level government jobs.


Over the weekend, a lawyer for another Trump choice, Pete Hegseth, a 44-year-old Fox News host named to be defense secretary, revealed that Hegseth several years ago paid an undisclosed amount to a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 to avert the threat of what he viewed as a baseless lawsuit becoming public.


Trump has stood by his Cabinet nominees, refusing to withdraw their nominations. But the controversies surrounding Gaetz, Hegseth and others could threaten their confirmations by the Senate to be in Trump’s Cabinet.


The president-elect also has sought — with little success so far — to get the Senate, in Republican control come January when he takes office, to agree to recess at times so he could name and install his Cabinet members without the need for contentious and time-consuming confirmation hearings.

## Why Climate Conservatives Are Excited About Trump 2.0

date: 2024-11-18, from: Heatmap News

In the groggy reckoning of Wednesday morning, <em><em>MIT Technology Review </em></em><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/06/1106712/trumps-win-is-a-tragic-loss-for-climate-progress/?utm_medium=tr_social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=site_visitor.unpaid.engagement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>deemed</u></a> the outcome a “tragic loss for climate progress;” the next day, a <em><em>Guardian</em></em> columnist reminded readers that “Trump has pledged to wage war on planet Earth.” Arielle Samuelson, <a href="https://heated.world/p/15c-is-dead-the-climate-fight-isnt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writing for </u><u><em><em>Heated</em></em></u></a>, reported that given the incoming administration’s <a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/president-trump-announces-withdrawal-paris-agreement-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>history</u></a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5181963/trump-promises-more-drilling-in-the-u-s-to-boost-fossil-fuel-production" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>intentions</u></a>, the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels was “dead” (although to be fair, that has likely been the case for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/despite-cop28-deal-fossil-fuels-15c-goal-likely-out-reach-2023-12-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>some time</u></a>).</p><p>But to that segment of the population who approach issues of energy, the environment, and climate change from the right, the post-election mood ranged from cautiously optimistic to jubilant. “The biggest thing we’re excited about is the momentum around this next year and the next administration,” Stephen Perkins, a conservative strategist and the chief operating officer of the American Conservation Coalition, told me.</p><p>What Trump <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/trump-climate-tech" target="_self"><u>will or won’t do</u></a> in office remains an open question (the picture is getting <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-kill-ev-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>clearer</u></a> by the day, however, and we’re <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy" target="_self"><u>tracking it closely</u></a> here at Heatmap).

Far and away, it’s clearing red tape. Perkins pointed out that one of Elon Musk’s first tweets when it became clear Republicans would take back the White House on election night was the promise that “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854023551575322959" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>soon, you will be free to build again</u></a>.”</p><p>“I give it a 99% to 100% chance we’re going to see permitting reform,” Heather Reams, the president of the center-right group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, told me from her hotel room at COP29.</p><p>Nick Loris, the vice president of public policy at C3 Solutions, a nonpartisan public policy group that advocates for free-market solutions to climate, environment, and energy problems, echoed that prediction. “I’m most excited about a renewed and more aggressive push for permitting reform,” he told me, explaining that the election “affords the opportunity for Republicans in both the House and the Senate to come together with even more ambitious plans to reduce red tape in all forms of energy — and I really hope it is for <em><em>all</em></em> forms of energy, not just for selected technologies and resources that Republicans tend to like.”</p><p>There was also consensus on the value of clearing the path for the export of LNG, which marks one of the more significant ideological breaks of the climate right with the climate left. “I think there’s going to be an immediate push [by the Trump administration] to reduce the pause on liquified natural gas exports,” Loris predicted. (The pause <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/climate/federal-judge-biden-gas-exports.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ended in July</u></a> and the Department of Energy <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/lng/090324-us-doe-grants-lng-export-permit-for-altamira-lng-first-since-permitting-pause" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>resumed</u></a> issuing export permits in September, but Trump is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-lng-developers-see-trump-win-lifting-pall-over-expansions-2024-11-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expected</u></a> to expedite the process.) Reams said she expects that during his first 100 days in office, Trump will reverse Biden’s methane emissions fee, which “some considered punitive,” and that she was looking for him to prioritize “protecting fracking, interstate pipelines, [and] exports of crude oil and other petroleum products.” As she explained, “displacing coal or dirtier forms of natural gas with higher life cycle emissions in place of using the U.S. LNG that has lower life cycle emissions” will ultimately help global emissions “go down.” (Others have argued that <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>LNG is far worse</u></a> over its lifespan than coal.)</p><p>Other items on the conservative climate wishlist include reforming regulations governing the mining of critical minerals to ensure a more reliable, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/resolution-copper-mine" target="_self"><u>less risky schedule</u></a> for opening new mines and creating a domestic supply chain for the clean energy build-out; accelerating geothermal development and <a href="https://grist.org/cop29/nuclear-power-trump-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>taking the baton</u></a> from the Biden administration on nuclear energy; and a general streamlining of government programs. “Part of the near-term goal is going to be having an understanding from within the Department of Energy of what’s not working and why isn’t the money flowing out the door in a faster, in a more efficient way?” said Loris of C3 Solutions, citing what he perceived to be the DOE’s lack of urgency on <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/haleu-availability-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the commercial high-assay, low-enriched uranium program</u></a>, a key part of establishing a domestic nuclear supply chain.</p><p>Spending in the form of <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/ira-tax-credits" target="_self"><u>clean energy tax credits</u></a> and incentives presents a thornier problem for the climate right to navigate. Reams told me that all the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act will be “up for grabs” as the Trump administration readies its plan to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-ira-climate-law" target="_self"><u>preserve and extend</u></a> its 2017 tax cuts, and that each must be defended on its merits. “The Trump tax credits expire at the end of 2025, so if you’re looking at one or the other, that’s really the value proposition: Do you want green tax credits, or do you want $2,000 more in your pocket each year per household?” Reams said. “It’s hard to say you want a tax credit for clean energy without understanding the benefits to your household.” Perkins of the ACC added that he doesn’t object to clean energy investments, <em><em>per se</em></em> — “red districts overwhelmingly stand to benefit” from such programs, he said — but rather the concern from the right relates “everything else that gets looped into those bills,” such as opposition to IRA provisions <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4885124-republicans-inflation-reduction-act-energy-tax-credits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>connected to prescription drug prices</u></a>. No one made any promises against pruning.</p><p>On other issues, some Republican climate and energy groups break with the Trump administration entirely. “We are very much going to be pushing back on the extensive and aggressive use of tariffs that might come from this administration, which could not just run counter to the administration’s promise to reduce costs for families and businesses but also stymie the deployment of cleaner energy sources as well,” Loris told me of C3 Solution’s plans.</p><p><a href="https://republicen.org/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RepublicEN</u></a>, an education- and communication-oriented group that positions itself as the “EcoRight” answer to the environmental Left, broke with the incoming administration more completely, publishing a series of <a href="https://republicen.org/blog/climate-week-en-review-november-15-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tepid blog posts</u></a> in the election’s aftermath. <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bob-inglis-republican-climate-change" target="_self"><u>Bob Inglis</u></a>, the group’s executive director and a former South Carolina Republican congressman, told me that he believes a “substantial percentage of Trump voters” support climate policies and might serve as a local-level bulwark against any climate-unfriendly policies — if “those constituents are visible and audible to their members of Congress.” He’s optimistic that the Republican Party has largely moved on from its “dark days” of climate denialism, and that the next four years might see more reaching across the aisle in pursuit of a common goal.</p><p>Is such a thing even possible in this day and age? Inglis hesitated. “I surely hope so,” he finally said. He believes Republicans can “breathe easier now” that they’ve had such resounding electoral wins. “The water’s coming up here in Charleston,” he added. “Let’s do something about it.”</p><p>If there was one hope I heard across the board from conservative proponents of climate action, however, it was this: that there should be more compromise between the parties on the issues they agree are important. “As much as some people in the climate space may view this as a challenging time for bipartisanship, we actually think it is <em><em>the</em></em> moment for bipartisanship,” Perkins told me. “We’re going to see some incredible things done over the next four years.”</p>

## Jury selection begins in human smuggling case after deaths of Indian family at Canada-US border

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

fergus falls, minnesota — Nearly three years after a couple from India and their two young children froze to death while trying to cross the border from Canada into the U.S., two men went on trial Monday on human smuggling charges, accused of being part of a criminal network that stretched around the world.


Prosecutors say Indian national Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, 29, ran part of the scheme and recruited Steve Shand, 50, of Florida, to shuttle migrants across the border. Both men have pleaded not guilty in federal court in Minnesota. They're standing trial before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim, with proceedings expected to last about five days. They each face four counts related to human smuggling.


On January 19, 2022, Shand was allegedly waiting in a truck for 11 migrants, including the family of four from the village of Dingucha in Gujarat state. Prosecutors say 39-year-old Jagdish Patel; his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s; the couple's 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi; and 3-year-old son, Dharmik, died after spending hours wandering fields in blizzard conditions as the wind chill reached minus 36 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 38 Celsius).


Prosecutors say when Jagdish Patel's body was found, he was holding Dharmik, who was wrapped in a blanket.


Before jury selection began Monday morning, defense attorneys objected to prosecutors’ plan to show seven photos of the frozen bodies of Jagdish Patel and his family, including close-up images of the children.


Shand's attorney, Aaron Morrison, said the heart-wrenching images could cause “extreme prejudice to the jury” and asked for the photos to be removed as evidence.


Prosecutors argued the photos were necessary to show the family was not adequately prepared by Shand and Harshkumar Patel for the frigid conditions.


Tunheim allowed the images to remain evidence.


Patel is a common Indian surname and the victims were not related to Harshkumar Patel. Federal prosecutors say Harshkumar Patel and Shand were part of an operation that scouted clients in India, got them Canadian student visas, arranged transportation and smuggled them into the U.S., mostly through Washington state or Minnesota.


The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending this Sept. 30. By 2022, the Pew Research Center estimates more than 725,000 Indians were living illegally in the U.S., behind only Mexicans and El Salvadorans.


Harshkumar Patel’s attorney, Thomas Leinenweber, told The Associated Press that his client came to America to escape poverty and build a better life for himself and now "stands unjustly accused of participating in this horrible crime. He has faith in the justice system of his adopted country and believes that the truth will come out at the trial.” Attorneys for Shand did not return messages.


Court documents filed by prosecutors show Patel was in the U.S. illegally after being refused a U.S. visa at least five times, and that he recruited Shand at a casino near their homes in Deltona, Florida, just north of Orlando.


Over a five-week period, court documents say, Patel and Shand often communicated about the bitter cold as they smuggled five groups of Indians over a quiet stretch of border. One night in December 2021, Shand messaged Patel that it was “cold as hell” while waiting to pick up one group, the documents say.


“They going to be alive when they get here?” he allegedly wrote.

During the last trip in January, Shand had messaged Patel, saying: “Make sure everyone is dressed for the blizzard conditions, please,” according to prosecutors.


Prosecutors say Shand told investigators that Patel paid him about $25,000 for the five trips.


Jagdish Patel grew up in Dingucha. He and his family lived with his parents. The couple were schoolteachers, according to local news reports.


Satveer Chaudhary is a Minneapolis-based immigration attorney who has helped migrants exploited by motel owners, many of them Gujaratis. He said smugglers and shady business interests promised many migrants an American dream that doesn’t exist when they arrive.


“The promises of the almighty dollar lead many people to take unwarranted risks with their own dignity, and as we’re finding out here, their own lives,” Chaudhary said.

## Biden seeks nearly $100 billion in emergency aid after Hurricanes Helene, Milton

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is requesting nearly $100 billion in emergency disaster aid after Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other natural disasters, telling lawmakers that the money is "urgently needed." 


The letter Monday to House Speaker Mike Johnson comes as lawmakers meet during a lame-duck session to finish key priorities before making way for a new Congress and the incoming Trump administration. Biden said he has met firsthand with those harmed by the storms and he heard what residents and businesses needed from the federal government. 


"Additional resources are critical to continue to support these communities," Biden said. 


The largest share of the money, about $40 billion, would go to the main disaster relief fund at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Biden said the fund would face a shortfall this budget year without additional money. He said that would not only affect the agency's ability to provide lifesaving assistance to survivors, but also would slow recovery efforts from prior disasters. 


An additional $24 billion would help farmers that have experienced crop or livestock losses, and $12 billion would go toward community development block grants administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 


Some $8 billion more would help rebuild and repair highways and bridges in more than 40 states and territories. The administration is also seeking $4 billion for long-term water system upgrades to mitigate future damage from natural disasters. Several other agencies would also receive emergency funds if Congress agrees to the request. 


Lawmakers were expecting a hefty number from the administration. Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said Congress will evaluate the request and "we'll make sure we deliver for the hurricane victims and the people that have suffered from that." 


The Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to hear Wednesday from the heads of several of the government agencies that would receive funding through Biden's request. It's possible that emergency aid could be attached to any spending bill designed to keep federal agencies operating after current funding expires Dec. 20. 


Biden noted that Congress had provided more than $90 billion in aid after Hurricane Katrina nearly two decades ago, and more than $50 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2013. He urged Congress to take "immediate action." 


"Just as the Congress acted then, it is our sworn duty now to deliver the necessary resources to ensure that everyone in communities reeling from Hurricanes Helene and Milton — and those still recovering from previous disasters — have the Federal resources they need and deserve," Biden wrote.

## Teenage Buddhist lama marks last birthday in US before joining monastery in Himalayas

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

ISANTI, Minn. — The young Buddhist lama sat on a throne near an altar decorated with flowers, fruits and golden statues of the Buddha, watching the celebrations of his 18th birthday in silence, with a faint smile. 


Jalue Dorje knew it would be the last big party before he joins a monastery in the Himalayan foothills -- thousands of kilometers from his home in a Minneapolis suburb, where he grew up like a typical American teen playing football and listening to rap music. 


But this was not an ordinary coming-of-age celebration. It was an enthronement ceremony for an aspiring spiritual leader who from an early age was recognized by the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan Buddhist leaders as a reincarnated lama. 


From the stage, he saw it all: The young women in white long bearded masks who danced, jumping acrobatically and twirling colorful sticks to wish him luck in a tradition reserved for dignitaries. The banging of drums. The procession of hundreds – from children to elderly -- who lined up to bow to him and present him with a "khata" -- the white Tibetan ceremonial scarves that symbolize auspiciousness. 




From a throne reserved for lamas, he smelled the aroma of Tibetan dishes prepared by his mother over sleepless nights. He heard the monks with shaved heads, in maroon and gold robes like his own, chant sacred mantras. Behind them, his shaggy-haired high school football teammates sang "Happy Birthday" before he cut the first slice of cake. 


One of his buddies gave him shaker bottles for hydrating during training at the gym; another, a gift card to eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill. 


"I was in awe!" Dorje recalled later. "Usually, I'd be at the monk section looking up to whomever was celebrating. But that night it was for me." 




Watching Monday Night Football and memorizing ancient Buddhist prayers 


Since the Dalai Lama's recognition, Dorje has spent much of his life training to become a monk, memorizing sacred scriptures, practicing calligraphy and learning the teachings of Buddha. 


After graduation in 2025, he'll head to northern India to join the Mindrolling Monastery, more than 11,500 kilometers from his home in Columbia Heights. 


Following several years of contemplation and ascetism, he hopes to return to America to teach in the Minnesota Buddhist community. His goal is "to become a leader of peace," following the example of the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. 


"There's going to be a lot of sacrifice involved," Dorje said. But he's not new to sacrifices. 


He remembered all the early mornings reciting ancient prayers and memorizing Buddhist scriptures, often rewarded by his dad with Pokémon cards. 


"As a child, even on the weekend, you're like: 'Why don't I get to sleep more? Why can't I get up and watch cartoons like other kids.' But my dad always told me that it's like planting a seed," he said, "and one day it's going to sprout." 


It all began with the process of identifying a lama, which is based on spiritual signs and visions. Dorje was about four months old when he was identified by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche, a venerated master of Tibetan Buddhism and leader of the Nyingma lineage. He was later confirmed by several lamas as the eighth Terchen Taksham Rinpoche — the first one was born in 1655. 


After the Dalai Lama recognized him at age 2, Dorje's parents took him to meet the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism when he visited Wisconsin in 2010. 


The Dalai Lama cut a lock of Dorje's hair in a ceremony and advised his parents to let their son stay in the U.S. to perfect his English before sending him to a monastery. 


Dorje is fluent in English and Tibetan. He grew up reading the manga graphic novel series "Buddha," and is an avid sports fan. He roots for the Timberwolves in basketball, Real Madrid in soccer, and the Atlanta Falcons in football. He even keeps a rookie card of wide receiver Drake London pasted to the back of his phone, which he carried wrapped in his robes during his party. 




On the football field, playing as a left guard, his teammates praised his positivity, often reminding them to have fun and keep losses in perspective. 


"It's someone to look up to," said Griffin Hogg, 20, a former player who took Dorje under his wing. He said they learned from each other and credits Dorje with helping him find his spirituality. "I'm more of a relaxed person after getting to know him and understanding his own journey." 


While Dorje tries to never miss Monday Night Football, he's always there to help with any event hosted by the local Tibetan community, one of the largest in the United States. 


"He has one foot in the normal high school life. And he has one foot in this amazing Tibetan culture that we have in the state of Minnesota," said Kate Thomas, one of his tutors and the teachings coordinator at Minneapolis' Bodhicitta Sangha Heart of Enlightenment Institute. 


"You can see that he's comfortable playing a role of sitting on a throne, of participating and being honored as a respected person in his community, as a religious figure. And yet, as soon as he has the opportunity, he wants to go and hang out with his high school buddies," she said. "That's testimony to his flexibility, his openness of mind." 




Listening to rap and making Tibetans proud 


For years, he has followed the same routine. He wakes up to recite sacred texts and then attends school, followed by football practice. He returns home for tutoring about Tibetan history and Buddhism. Then he might practice calligraphy or run on a treadmill while listening to BossMan Dlow, Rod Wave and other rappers. 


Although he was officially enthroned in 2019 in India, an estimated 1,000 people gathered at the Tibetan American Foundation of Minnesota for his recent ceremony. 


"He unites us – Jalue is always here for us," said Zenden Ugen, 21, a family friend and neighbor who performed Tibetan dances at the event. 


"I wish him the best in life because being born and not being able to choose your life must be very hard," Ugen said. "But he has a responsibility and him being able to take on that responsibility, I'm very inspired by him. I just hope he keeps being who he is." 


Dorje's proud uncle, Tashi Lama, saw him grow up and become a Buddhist master. 


"He's somebody who's going to be a leader, who's going to teach compassion and peace and love and harmony among living beings," he said about his nephew, often referred to as "Rinpoche" -- a Tibetan word that means "precious one."

## Cracks in G20 consensus over Ukraine as US ramps up aid

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

RIO DE JANEIRO — With just two months remaining in President Joe Biden’s administration, the U.S. is ramping up financial, military and diplomatic support for Kyiv’s effort to defend itself against Russian aggression.


At the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where Biden and leaders of 20 of the world’s largest economies are meeting, U.S. officials are pushing for the “strongest possible” language on Ukraine, deputy national security adviser John Finer told VOA during a briefing Monday.


Western diplomats have renewed their push for stronger criticism on Moscow following Russia’s weekend airstrike, its largest on Ukrainian territory in months.


They’ve also warned on increased Russian war efforts that could have a destabilizing effect beyond Europe. Earlier this month, the U.S. and Ukraine announced that North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops to help Moscow reclaim territory seized by Ukraine in Russia’s Kursk region.




The final joint leaders’ statement is still being negotiated but a draft seen by VOA and other versions circulating on social media suggest it will only include broad language underscoring U.N. principles and the need to respect peace in Ukraine and Gaza.


Finer acknowledges that finding a consensus on global conflicts is elusive given the diversity of the G20. In addition to mostly like-minded countries of the G7, the G20 also includes Russia, China and nations of the Global South.


“We'll see where it lands,” he said.


Ever since the G20 2022 summit in Bali, held months after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the global grouping has faced challenges hammering out a response to the conflict.  


Long-range missiles authorized


The U.S. has been surging its military assistance to Kyiv. It is also authorizing Ukraine to use American-supplied long-range missiles to strike inside Russia, according to media reports quoting officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.


Finer declined to confirm but said it is “consistent” with the U.S. approach of tailoring its response to meet developments on the ground to “allow the Ukrainians to continue to defend their territory and their sovereignty.”




On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that if true, authorization for Kyiv to strike inside Russia with U.S. long-range missiles, “will mark a qualitatively new round of tensions and level of Washington's involvement in the Ukraine conflict.”


Last week in Brussels, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought to reassure European allies that Biden is “committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20,” the date of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.


Trump has been critical of using American taxpayer’s money to help Kyiv. Without providing details, Trump often boasts he can swiftly end the war, even before he takes office — a statement that many in Europe fear would mean forcing Ukraine to capitulate.


Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wants a “just end” to the war and that a swift end “means losses.” On Saturday he told Ukrainian public radio that under the Trump administration, “the war will end faster.”


“This is their approach, the promise to their country,” he said. “And for them, it is also very important.”


Climate change, poverty alleviation


G20 host Brazil has worked to keep the focus of talks away from global conflicts and more on issues raised at the ongoing U.N. conference on climate change in Azerbaijan, and on accelerating efforts to reduce global hunger and poverty — an initiative championed by summit host President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.


Lula’s approach to resist pressures from the G7 and the rest of the G20 on Ukraine and Gaza reflects Brazil’s strategy of “multi-alignment” in an increasingly fragmented global landscape, said Bruna Santos, director at the Wilson Center’s Brazil Institute.


However, “neutrality risks alienating all sides in an increasingly polarized world,” Santos told VOA.


Aside from divisions on global conflicts, negotiators in Rio have been struggling to find consensus on shared language on climate financing, said diplomatic sources who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations.


Western nations have been pushing for China and wealthy Middle Eastern countries to join them in contributing to global funds for climate change mitigation — a proposal resisted by Brazil and other member countries of the Global South.


Another Lula proposal, a 2% tax on the super-rich that Brazil says can potentially generate up to $250 billion per year to help the world’s poor, has also met new resistance.


Argentinian right-wing President Javier Milei rejected the proposal after visiting Trump at his Florida residence, the first foreign leader to visit the president-elect.

## US sanctions group that builds illegal West Bank settlements, with close ties to Israeli government

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on organizations and firms involved in illegal settlement development in the occupied West Bank, including a well-established decades-old group that has close ties with Israeli leadership. 


Treasury sanctioned Amana, the largest organization involved in illegal settlement development in the West Bank, and its subsidiary Binyanei Bar Amana Ltd. Already sanctioned by Britain and Canada, Amana is one of the major funders and supporters of unauthorized settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Peace Now, a settlement tracking group, says its assets are valued at around 600 million Israeli shekels, or about $160 million, and that it has a yearly budget stretching into tens of millions of shekels. 


Amana, which is based in the West Bank and has no known connection to the U.S. appliance maker, over the past few years has underwritten loans, signed contracts, bought equipment and funded infrastructure projects for new settlements, according to Peace Now. The settlements, small farming outposts, have become some of the primary drivers of violence and displacement of Palestinians living in the West Bank. 


Additionally, the State Department imposed diplomatic sanctions on Eyal Hari Yehuda Co., which provides construction logistics to sanctioned groups, as well as company owner Itamar Yehuda Levi. The co-founder of the already sanctioned nonprofit group Hashomer Yosh, Shabtai Koshlevsky, and Israeli citizen Zohar Sabah, who has perpetrated acts of violence on Palestinians, also were hit with sanctions. 


The penalties come as settlers in the territory celebrate the incoming Trump administration, believing it will likely take a more favorable approach to the settlements. During his first term, Trump took unprecedented steps to support Israel's territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. 


Treasury's Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the U.S. "remains committed to holding accountable those who seek to facilitate these destabilizing activities, which threaten the stability of the West Bank, Israel, and the wider region." 


Among other things, the sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. and prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them. 


In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that targets Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been accused of attacking Palestinians and Israeli peace activists in the occupied territory. That order is used to justify the financial penalties against the companies and men. 


In response, Texans for Israel, a Christian nonprofit, Israeli nonprofit Regavim and others in August sued the Biden administration in Amarillo, Texas, over its sanctions against Israeli extremists in the West Bank. 


Eitay Mack, a human rights lawyer who has spent years campaigning for the sanctions on violent West Bank settlers, said the sanctions on Amana were "an earthquake for the settlement project and especially the shepherds farms." He called on the U.S. to extend the sanctions now to firebrand Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, also a far-right settler in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet. 


Amana's leadership has appeared at pro-settlement events alongside Cabinet members. Peace Now says the group's secretary-general, Zeev Hever, was greeted by Smotrich at a June conference where Smotrich laid out his plans for the West Bank. 


Violence against Palestinians and their displacement have only picked up since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 8,000 Palestinians have been displaced in the West Bank during that time and over 700 killed, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Palestinian health officials. 


The Associated Press previously reported that the sanctions measures have had minimal impact, instead emboldening settlers as attacks and land-grabs escalate, according to Palestinians in the West Bank, local rights groups and sanctioned Israelis who spoke to AP. Additionally, Smotrich has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers' behalf. 


Israel captured the West Bank along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want those territories for their hoped-for future state. 


Settlement growth and construction have been promoted by successive Israeli governments stretching back decades, but it has exploded under Netanyahu's far-right coalition, which has settlers in key Cabinet posts. There are now well over 100 settlements and 500,000 Israeli settlers sprawling across the territory from north to south — a reality, rights groups say, dimming any hopes for an eventual two-state solution. 


State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said "we once again call on the Government of Israel to take action and hold accountable those responsible for or complicit in violence, forced displacement, and the dispossession of private land. The United States will continue to promote accountability for those who further destabilize conditions in the West Bank and support extremist violence in the region."

## For Ukraine, US approval of long-range missiles marks strategic shift

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

Warsaw — Many in Ukraine see the Biden administration’s decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russian territory as a turning point in the war but welcome it with a mix of gratitude and frustration. 


"Strikes are not made with words," President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. "The missiles will speak for themselves." 


His tone reflects the high stakes involved in this decision, which comes as Ukraine braces for intensified Russian offensives following the reported deployment of 12,000 North Korean troops to bolster Moscow’s efforts. 




Ukrainian officials and analysts see the U.S. authorization as a crucial move, allowing Ukraine to target key military installations in Russia, particularly in the Kursk region, where new threats are emerging. However, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, former Minister of Defense (2019–2020) and adviser to the government, said the delay in granting such permissions has cost Ukraine dearly. 


"Ukraine has been asking for this for years, not months," Zagorodnyuk told VOA. "The administration’s fear of escalation led to an overcautious approach. This reactive, piecemeal strategy — responding to Russian provocations rather than implementing a comprehensive plan — has not brought us closer to resolving the war. Instead, it has allowed Russia to escalate further."  


Critical stage 


The decision follows an escalation of Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, yet the timing raises questions about the long-term strategy of Western allies. 




Mark Voyger, director of the master's program in Global Management at American University Kyiv, emphasized the operational and psychological importance of the decision. "Operationally, these missiles can target Russian storage facilities, command centers, and even North Korean troops preparing for offensive actions," Voyger explained.  


"Better late than never, the time for inaction and ... psychological [self-constraint] due to some presumed fear of escalation is over." Voyger highlighted the risks of delay. "This decision should have been made earlier to save lives and give Ukraine a stronger hand on the battlefield. The reactive approach only emboldens Russia to escalate further." 


Zagorodnyuk echoed these sentiments, warning that the U.S. policy of incremental aid has hindered Ukraine’s ability to gain the upper hand. "This piecemeal strategy, like doing little steps, step by step, as a reaction [to] some escalation from Russia's side, is, first of all, escalatory itself. And secondly, [it] is not bringing us to any resolution of the war. Because we [are] essentially supporting Russia escalating the war.” 


Russian reaction 


Moscow condemned the U.S. decision as an escalation of U.S. involvement in the war and warned of serious consequences. 


"If such a decision was really formulated and brought to the attention of the Kyiv regime, then, of course, this is a qualitatively new round of tension and a qualitatively new situation in terms of the involvement of the United States in this conflict," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian media.  


Russian state media have amplified narratives accusing the U.S. of directly fueling the conflict, potentially laying the groundwork for further rhetorical or military escalations. 


US leadership transition 


The approaching U.S. transfer of power adds another layer of uncertainty.  


There are fears in Kyiv that Washington’s critical support will be reversed, following President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign promises to end the war quickly with no clear outline of a strategy. 


"Unlike [U.S. President Joe] Biden, Trump immediately announced his ultimate goal to stop the war. The question is — how is he going to do that?" Zagorodnyuk said. While Ukrainians would welcome an end to the war, “some people suggest all kinds of concessions from Ukraine,” which he said, “is not going to stop the war." 


In a VOA interview, Voyger added that the Biden administration’s timing of this decision might reflect concerns about securing support for Ukraine before a potential political shift. "If a new administration pulls back on military aid or restricts Ukraine’s ability to strike, it could significantly weaken Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table," he said. 


Stopping the war 


Both analysts agree that stopping the war needs a robust and proactive Western strategy. This includes providing Ukraine with sufficient long-range missiles, expanding the scope of permissible targets, and ensuring consistent support regardless of political changes in Washington.  


"The West needs to empower Ukraine to not just defend itself, but to achieve the operational success that forces Russia to reconsider its aggression,” Voyger said. 


Zagorodnyuk agrees the only way to force Russian President Vladimir Putin into serious negotiations is to put him in a position where he risks losing not just on the battlefield but also his hold on power. "The ideal situation for Ukraine would be that NATO allies, and first of all the United States, would provide us with the means to reach the effect [of] Putin [and Russia] losing its operations.   


“Ukraine can successfully do a series of counteroffensive operations [that] would bring Putin to a situation where he would understand that unless he stops the war, he would be losing tremendously, and that would impact his regime and his power.”

## Pentagon rejects Kremlin criticism of US-fueled escalation in Ukraine

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — The Pentagon dismissed a new round of Russian accusations that the United States is pushing the war in Ukraine into ever more dangerous territory as “reckless” rhetoric, calling out Moscow and its allies for escalating tensions.


U.S. defense officials Monday declined to confirm media reports that President Joe Biden has decided to allow Kyiv to use Washington-supplied, long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russian territory. But they said Moscow has no grounds for any complaints.


"What's adding fuel to the fire is the fact that DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] soldiers are now entering a fight,” said Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh, in response to a question from VOA.


"We're talking about North Korean soldiers being used to take sovereign territory, Ukrainian sovereign territory, and continue to push this war forward,” Singh said. “That certainly we view as escalatory."


The U.S. estimates that there are at least 11,000 North Koreans troops moving into the Kursk region in southern Russia, which Ukraine captured in a surprise attack in August and still holds. 




Singh said Monday, “We have every expectation that they would be engaging in combat operations.” 


Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov slammed the reported U.S. decision on long-range missiles earlier Monday, saying it marks a "new spiral of tensions and a qualitatively new situation from the point of view of the U.S.'s engagement in the conflict.”


Peskov claimed that Western countries supplying long-range weapons also provide targeting services to Kyiv. "This fundamentally changes the modality of their involvement in the conflict," Peskov said.


Russian President Vladimir Putin did not comment publicly, but Peskov referred journalists to a Putin statement in September, in which he said allowing Ukraine to target Russia would significantly raise the stakes in the conflict.


It would change "the very nature of the conflict dramatically," Putin said at the time. "This will mean that NATO countries — the United States and European countries — are at war with Russia."  


Singh, however, pushed back, calling the Russian threats “reckless.”


"Any type of nuclear saber rattling is incredibly dangerous,” she said, adding, "It's something that we're going to continue to monitor, but we haven't seen any changes to their [nuclear] posture."


Russian officials have previously suggested that increased support for Ukraine by the U.S. and NATO could allow Moscow to respond with nuclear weapons.


Until now, the United States had allowed Ukraine to deploy shorter-range American weapons, like the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems the U.S. donated in the first months of the war, to hit Russian targets over the border from Ukraine's Kharkiv region. The range of these rockets was around 80 kilometers, but the Biden decision will allow the use of Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, rockets that can reach targets of up to about 300 kilometers.




Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had lobbied Washington for months to be allowed to use the longer-range rockets against military targets deep inside Russia, contending they were needed to hit rocket arsenals and other weaponry being stored by Russia before their use targeting Ukraine’s cities and electrical grids.


Biden, until now, had resisted allowing use of the longer-range missiles for fear it would escalate the war and tensions with the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. But North Korea’s deployment of troops to fight alongside Moscow’s forces alarmed Washington.


ATACMS are long-range guided missiles produced by U.S. aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin. The missiles carry a 227-kilogram fragmentation warhead and are tough to intercept due to their high speed.


The rockets are fitted with a specialized GPS and carry cluster munitions. When the clusters open in the air, hundreds of bomblets are released rather than a single warhead.


Whether the Biden decision to supply the missiles — and how many — remains in place when President-elect Donald Trump takes office January 20 is uncertain. Trump has expressed skepticism about continued U.S. support for Ukraine, declining during a September political debate to say that he wanted Ukraine to win the war.


Trump has claimed he would broker an end to the war before he takes office but not said how he would accomplish that.


The president-elect has not commented publicly on the Biden decision to supply Ukraine with the longer-range missiles, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., quickly criticized it.


“The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,” he said on social media.


Biden’s policy shift came as a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions on Sunday evening struck a residential area of Sumy, a city in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people, including two children, and injuring 84 others.




On Monday, another Russian missile attack started fires in two apartment blocks in Odesa, in southern Ukraine. At least eight people were killed and 18 were injured, including a child, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said.


The Sumy attack on Sunday followed a massive Russian bombardment of Ukraine’s power infrastructure earlier in the day.


Zelenskyy said Ukraine and its allies should focus on “really forcing Russia to end the war.”  


“Today marked one of the largest and most dangerous Russian attacks in the entire war — 210 drones and missiles launched simultaneously — including hypersonic and aeroballistic ones,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Sunday.


Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.

## Biden’s Climate Law Can’t Die. Wall Street Loves It Too Much.

date: 2024-11-18, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDUyMjE0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MDg0MzEyNH0.dEdYklCaNpkg91O8Y0kVze7rfDIq6ZRUKEn4WKI5sK4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The optimistic case for the Inflation Reduction Act — even under a Trump presidency, even with a Republican trifecta in Washington — rests on a “public investment first” view of climate policy. Public investment in the clean energy economy is not merely a second-best policy option to carbon pricing or other punitive regulations, the argument goes, but instead the first-best option in the marathon of politically durable decarbonization. </p><p>I am an outspoken proponent of this view. Public investment provides and encourages investment to drive down the cost of clean energy technologies, make them more market-competitive, and thereby reduces emissions by permanently shifting demand away from fossil fuel-dependent ones. Public investment in clean energy technologies can also create the conditions for new constituencies to gain political clout and defend their role in the economy, and for further policy ambition in the future. </p><p>The first major sign that public investment under the IRA might prove durable came in August, when a group of 18 House Republicans wrote to Speaker Mike Johnson in support of the clean energy tax credits that are the cornerstone of the legislation, emphasizing the job creation benefits of the policy. Even the American Petroleum Institute and U.S. Chamber of Commerce said back in May that <a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/biden-inflation-reduction-act-american-petroleum-institute-chamber-commerce-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>they would support the IRA</u></a> under a Trump presidency. Driving down costs? Check. New constituencies? Check.</p><p>It’s tempting to see this glimmer of change in favor of clean energy incentives as the consequence of groundswell political support, as voters see benefits arrive in their communities. Journalist Kate Aronoff calls this “pool party politics," named after the New Deal’s <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/174860/public-doesnt-know-well-inflation-reduction-act-working" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-visibility spending on public pools</u></a> which curried popular favor in the 1930s. The IRA’s benefits do <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/08/14/two-years-in-the-ira-has-benefitted-gop-districts-red-states-the-most/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tilt heavily toward red districts</u></a>, so it would be nice to imagine that Republican elected officials are hearing bottom-up support and dutifully reflecting constituent interest — democracy in action.</p><p>Let’s call that the optimist’s view. My view, which one might call the “cynical optimist’s,” is that politicians — red or blue — are often more responsive to the concentrated interests and influence of lobbyists and donors than the electorate. The IRA may have gained popularity in Congress, including among Republicans, as financial and corporate interests — “capital” — started becoming IRA fans. Tim Sahay of the Net Zero Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins has called the IRA’s tax credits a “<a href="https://x.com/70sBachchan/status/1683076054028546049" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bottomless mimosa bar</u></a>” for the financial market, and bankers are swanning up to get smashed on unlimited tax incentives for clean energy investment.</p><p>I favor the cynical optimist’s view because I believe it to be a more accurate picture of why the IRA is good politics. The “cynical” part recognizes that capital exerts disproportionate influence over the political process; the “optimist” part celebrates that the IRA is a powerful vehicle to appeal to their economic values. Bottomless mimosa bars aren’t just booze giveaways — they work by bringing in new customers who then stay and pay for their meals. Reformulating the interests of capital through public investment is a pragmatic and necessary antidote to the inertia of the incumbent fossil fuel industry. </p><p>A great example of the IRA gaining new types of fans is its program of expanded, transferable clean energy tax credits. Not only do these tax credits redirect tax revenue toward clean energy investment, making more projects economically justifiable, they may also develop their own market momentum. I advise <a href="https://www.buildwithbasis.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Basis Climate</u></a>, a platform for clean energy tax credit transfers, and when I asked co-founder Erik Underwood to tell me who is actually buying these tax credits, he told me it has mostly been savvy business people focused on minimizing their tax payments. Many of these buyers have never or only marginally participated in renewable energy deployment previously. </p><p>The tax credit transfer market has grown to <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/nasdaq-provides-access-to-ira-clean-energy-tax-credit-market-in-collaboration-with-sustainable-fintech-crux/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$20 billion to 25 billion</u></a> in a mere 20 months. By comparison, voluntary carbon markets have for decades attempted to enable green projects by creating a market for tradeable credits, yet the market is expected to reach just <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/mega-boost-for-carbon-offsets-market-seen-from-sbti-easing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2 billion</u></a> <em><em>globally </em></em>in 2024.</p><p>In other words, the market for clean energy tax buyers has vastly expanded the base of corporates benefiting from and supporting clean energy projects, led by transactional people who want to avoid paying taxes. Now, there are tax-hating business types of all political colors, but one can already see that the politics of the IRA are shaping up differently than, say, a pollution tax that steadily gets harsher over time. </p><p>All that said, it is important not to overstate the case in favor of the IRA’s durability. Those 18 House Republicans are down to no more than <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/house-republicans-ira" target="_self"><u>14 post-election</u></a>, and the remainder may find that falling in line with the President <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309072120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>politically safer</u></a> were he to mount a full-scale attack on the IRA. They and corporate America may also love clean energy tax credits in the abstract but happily give them up to <a href="https://thehill.com/business/4984127-trump-tax-cut-proposal-republicans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pay for a juicy tax cut for the wealthy</u></a>.</p><p>Still, the most clearly durable part of the IRA are the <a href="https://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/reports/tallying-the-two-year-impact-of-the-inflation-reduction-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$78 billion in public spending</u></a> and whopping $493 billion in business and consumer energy investment that it has already catalyzed as of June 2024, an estimated 71% increase in private investment from the two years before the IRA. That investment won’t be undone with policy change, and it will radically change the economics of many clean energy technologies. It also lays the foundation for later policymaking, as distant as that possibility may now feel. By creating an expanded tent of clean economy interests, the “carrot” of public investment may also help future politicians and their constituencies find “stick” policies more feasible. Penalties on high-carbon products — from gas cars to steel — become much more palatable if they are merely driving substitution to other technologies that compete on price and quality, than if they’re just making the only serviceable option more expensive.</p><p>This more nuanced telling of the politics, though, means you don’t need a star-eyed, <em><em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em></em> view of the American political process to see how the IRA is delivering political dividends. Whatever the fate of the IRA come January, the longer the benefits flow — to communities and to capitalists — the more difficult it will be to roll back the tide.</p>

G20 leaders try to succeed on climate finance where COP is failing </h3><p>We’re now entering the second week of COP29. Negotiations so far have not yielded much in the way of a new collective goal for climate finance, but this could change as climate ministers finally join the summit. Meanwhile, leaders at the G20 summit in Brazil seem to be taking matters into their own hands after U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell penned a letter over the weekend asking them to take action on climate finance. On Sunday, G20 negotiators <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/world-looks-g20-rio-breakthrough-climate-talks-2024-11-17/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--63i1-E1CDHcPlaPKbQkQMbfUGV_oT6ZvaIKkDwMGnir-_R5QT8DtPSXlSEM2oZh3lLFG3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> agreed on a text that mentions developing countries’ (voluntary) climate finance contributions. This line could help address a key sticking point for rich countries, who want some of the richer developing nations – China, for example – to contribute to a new climate finance goal. The G20 breakthrough “could unlock bigger numbers for the [New Collective Quantified Goal], as developed countries say this expanding of the contributor base is a condition of them raising their climate finance promise above $100 billion,” <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/11/18/cop29-g20-finance-breakthrough-emissions-mitigation-talks-collapse/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--63i1-E1CDHcPlaPKbQkQMbfUGV_oT6ZvaIKkDwMGnir-_R5QT8DtPSXlSEM2oZh3lLFG3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> <em><em>Climate Home News</em></em>.</p><h3>3.

## The risks of being an “angel” investor

date: 2024-11-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>A new report finds women now make up nearly half of angel investors, a field once dominated by men. These investors fund early-stage startups in return for partial ownership. Today, we speak with Deb Kemper, managing partner at Golden Seeds Venture Fund, and a seasoned pro in this risky business of getting promising new ventures off the ground. But first, we&#8217;ll look at what&#8217;s driving consumer spending as the holiday season kicks off.</p>

## Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy as financial losses pile up and debt payments loom

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.


Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year.


Spirit said it expects to operate as normal as it works its way through a prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers can continue to book and fly without interruption.


Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 — when Spirit was still making money.


CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority, and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible.


“The chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,” he told investors during an earnings call. “We are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.”


People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They’re just not paying as much.




In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit’s red ink.


It’s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.


Spirit’s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit’s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel — Spirit’s core business — have sagged because of a glut of new flights.


The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit’s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That is a huge change from Spirit’s longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.


In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.


Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.


The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.


Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.


U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.


The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.

## Philippines, United States sign military intelligence-sharing deal

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

Manila, Philippines — The Philippines and the United States signed on Monday a military intelligence-sharing deal in a further deepening of defense ties between the two nations facing common security challenges in the region.


Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signed the agreement with his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, at Manila's military headquarters where both officials also broke ground for a combined coordination center that will facilitate collaboration between their armed forces.


Called the General Security of Military Information Agreement or GSOMIA, the pact allows both countries to share classified military information securely.


"Not only will this allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States, it will also open opportunities to pursue similar agreements with like-minded nations," said Philippines' defense ministry spokesperson Arsenio Andolong.


Security engagements between the United States and the Philippines have deepened under President Joe Biden and his Philippine counterpart Ferdinand Marcos Jr., with both leaders keen to counter what they see as China's aggressive policies in the South China Sea and near Taiwan.


The two countries have a mutual defense treaty dating back to 1951, which could be invoked if either side came under attack, including in the South China Sea.


"I want to start by underscoring our ironclad commitment to the Philippines," Austin said during the groundbreaking ceremony for the coordination center.


Austin said the coordination center should enable real-time information sharing between the two defense treaty allies and boost interoperability.


‘’It will be a place where our forces can work side by side to respond to regional challenges," Austin said.


The Philippines has expressed confidence the alliance will remain strong under incoming U.S. president-elect Donald Trump.


Both the Philippines and the United States face increasingly aggressive actions from China in the South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship-borne commerce, which it claims almost entirely as its own.


In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague said China's claims had no legal basis, siding with the Philippines, which brought the case.


But China has rejected the ruling, leading to a series of sea and air confrontations with the Philippines that have turned the highly strategic South China Sea into a potential flashpoint between Washington and Beijing.


"The United States' presence in the Indo Pacific region is essential for maintaining peace and stability in this region," Teodoro said during the inauguration, echoing previous remarks made by Marcos.

## 2 killed, 10 wounded in shootings near New Orleans parade route

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

NEW ORLEANS  — Two people were killed and 10 others were wounded in two separate shootings along a New Orleans parade route and celebration attended by thousands on Sunday, authorities said. There were no immediate arrests.


Officers responding to reports of gunfire shortly after 3:30 p.m. on an avenue in the city's St. Roch neighborhood found eight victims with gunshot wounds, according to a news release from the New Orleans Police Department. All eight were taken to hospitals in unknown condition. Police later said a ninth wounded person arrived at a hospital via a private car.


About 45 minutes later, police received another report of gunfire as revelers were crossing the Almonaster Avenue Bridge, just over .8 km to the north. One person died at the scene and another died at a hospital, police said. A third victim was driven to a hospital in a private vehicle and is in stable condition, police said.


No arrests were announced and no suspect information was released. The St. Roch neighborhood is outside the city's French Quarter that is popular with tourists, located several blocks northeast of the quarter.


Thousands had gathered for the annual outing of the Nine Times Social Aid & Pleasure Club in the 9th Ward, organizer Oscar Brown told NOLA.com.


"It is a wonderful event, and we want to keep it a wonderful event," Kirkpatrick said.


The Almonaster Bridge was closed in both directions during the investigation.


Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said detectives didn't immediately know if the incidents were related.


"They were ... different kinds of approaches," she said of the shootings, which occurred in the area where a "second line," a celebration following a parade, was taking place.


It was the second major shooting in the South since gunfire marred a homecoming weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama on Nov. 10, leaving one person dead and injuring 16 others, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said.

## More logging is proposed to help curb wildfires in the US Pacific Northwest

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

U.S. officials would allow increased logging on federal lands across the Pacific Northwest in the name of fighting wildfires and boosting rural economies under proposed changes to a sweeping forest management plan that's been in place for three decades.


The U.S. Forest Service proposal, released Friday, would overhaul the Northwest Forest Plan that governs about 99,000 square kilometers in Oregon, Washington and California.


The plan was adopted in 1994 under President Bill Clinton amid pressure to curb destructive logging practices that resulted in widespread clearcuts and destroyed habitat used by spotted owls. Timber harvests dropped dramatically in subsequent years, spurring political backlash.


But federal officials now say worsening wildfires due to climate change mean forests must be more actively managed to increase their resiliency. Increased logging also would provide a more predictable supply of trees for timber companies, officials said, helping rural economies that have suffered after lumber mills shut down and forestry jobs disappeared.


The proposal could increase annual timber harvests by at least 33% and potentially more than 200%, according to a draft environmental study. The number of timber-related jobs would increase accordingly.


Harvest volumes from the 17 national forests covered by the Northwest Forest Plan averaged about 445 million board feet annually over the past decade, according to government figures.


Cutting more trees would help reduce wildfire risk and make communities safer, the study concluded. That would be accomplished in part by allowing cuts in some areas with stands of trees up to 120 years old — up from the current age threshold of 80 years.


The change could help foster conditions conducive to growing larger, old growth trees that are more resistant to fire, by removing younger trees, officials said.


A separate pending proposal from President Joe Biden's administration aims to increase protections nationwide for old growth trees, which play a significant role in storing climate change-inducing carbon dioxide.


"Much has changed in society and science since the Northwest Forest Plan was created," Jacque Buchanan, regional forester for the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Region, said in a statement. He said the proposal would help the agency adapt to shifting conditions, as global warming increases the frequency of droughts and other extreme weather events.


The proposed plan also calls for closer cooperation between the Forest Service and Native American tribes to tap into tribal knowledge about forest management. Tribes were excluded when the 1994 plan was crafted.


Environmentalists greeted the proposal with skepticism. The group Oregon Wild said it was "deeply troubling" that the Forest Service would release the proposal just ahead of a change in presidential administrations.


"It appears that the Forest Service wants to abandon the fundamental purpose of the Northwest Forest Plan–protecting fish and wildlife and the mature and old-growth forests they need to survive," John Persell, an attorney for the group, said in a statement.


During former President Donald Trump's first term, administration officials sought to open millions of acres of West Coast forest to new logging by stripping habitat protections for the imperiled spotted owl. The move was opposed by government biologists and reversed under Biden.


A draft environmental study examined several potential alternatives, including leaving the existing plan's components in place or changing them to either reduce or increase logging.


A timber industry representative who co-chaired an advisory committee on the Northwest Forest Plan said the proposed plan resulted from discussions involving committee members, the Forest Service and others.


"We want to see a modern approach to federal forest stewardship that protects us from catastrophic wildfires, reduces toxic smoke, meaningfully engages tribes, and delivers for our rural communities and workers," said Travis Joseph, president of the American Forest Resource Council.


The publishing of the proposal begins a 120-day public comment period. The Forest Service's environmental review is expected to be completed by next fall and a final decision is due in early 2026.

## Union workers picket for 3rd day at Las Vegas casino with no talks slated

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

Las Vegas, Nevada — Picketing continued Sunday outside a hotel-casino near the Las Vegas Strip that remained open with no talks scheduled between management and union members striking for a new contract. 


Workers are seeking a pay raise and benefits comparable to pacts reached last year at other resorts. 


The walkout by the Culinary Workers Union laborers at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas comes a week before the second annual Las Vegas Grand Prix is due to draw hundreds of thousands of fans for Formula 1 racing on the Strip and nearby streets. It's the first open-ended strike since 2002 for the largest labor union in Nevada, which has about 60,000 members. 


No new negotiations were scheduled, said union spokesperson Bethany Khan and Terri Maruca, media representative for Virgin Hotels, owner of the 1,500-room property. 


Maruca said the company has fielded applications from more than 600 prospective contract and temporary workers since Friday. The union pays striking workers $500 per week for at least five days for picketing shifts. 


Guest room attendants, cocktail and food servers, porters, bellmen, cooks, bartenders and laundry workers are among those carrying picket signs at the property, where workers also staged a 48-hour job action last May to call for Virgin Hotels to agree to a new five-year deal with expanded benefits and increased wages. 


Other casinos on and off the Strip reached deadline agreements with the union just before the Formula 1 race a year ago, with contracts containing salary increases of about 32% over five years for tens of thousands of workers at properties including the Bellagio, Paris Las Vegas, MGM Grand and Caesars Palace. 


In a statement on Sunday, Virgin Hotels called those contracts "economically unsustainable" and said it wants a "reasonable agreement" for its 1,710 employees. It has accused union leaders of refusing to engage in "meaningful negotiations." 


Culinary Union members last went on strike in 2002 for 10 days at the Golden Gate hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas.

## Wildfire threat continues in much of US Northeast as dry conditions persist

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

Firefighters in New York said Sunday that a voluntary evacuation overnight helped them protect more than 160 homes from a stubborn wildfire near the New Jersey border as officials in much of the Northeast coped with hundreds of brush fires in tinder-dry and windy conditions.


Communities in New England dealt with a similar surge in late fall fires, and many parts of the Northeast remained under red flag alerts this weekend. Across the country, California made good progress against a 83-square-kilometer fire in Ventura County that has destroyed more than 245 structures, most of them houses. The Mountain fire was 95% contained.


Windy conditions renewed a wildfire Saturday that escaped a containment line and prompted emergency officials to enact the voluntary evacuation plan affecting about 165 houses in Warwick, New York, near the New Jersey border. No structures were in danger as of Sunday afternoon as firefighters worked to tame the Jennings Creek blaze, New York Parks Department spokesman Jeff Wernick said. The voluntary evacuation will remain in place at least until Monday, Wernick said.


The wildfire had burned close to 20 square kilometers across the two states as of Friday and was burning primarily in New York's Sterling Forest State Park, where the visitor center, the lakefront area at Greenwood Lake and a historic furnace area remained open. Woodland activities including hunting were halted, Wernick said.


It was 90% contained on the Passaic County, New Jersey, side of the border, and about 88% contained in Orange County, New York, where a state of emergency was extended on Sunday, officials said. New York Army National Guard and state police helicopters dropped water on the blaze to support ground crews' efforts.


"Residents in the voluntary evacuation area are asked to continue sheltering so that crews can effectively suppress the fire," according to a statement posted on Facebook by village officials in Greenwood Lake, New York, where schools will be closed on Monday. "There is currently no threat to structures but crews are actively working to ensure structure protection."


The blaze claimed the life of an 18-year-old New York parks employee who died when a tree fell on him as he helped fight the fire in Sterling Forest on Nov. 9. The fire's cause remains under investigation.


New York City's Fire Department is creating its first-ever brush fire task force to respond to what officials say is a historic increase in brush fires throughout the city's five boroughs, Commissioner Robert S. Tucker announced Sunday. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 14, the FDNY responded to 271 brush fires, marking the highest two-week period in New York's history.


The task force will be made up of fire marshals, fire inspectors and tactical drone units in an effort to ensure rapid responses to brush fires and to help with investigations to determine their cause.


"Due to a significant lack of rainfall, the threat of fast-spreading brush fires fueled by dry vegetation and windy conditions have resulted in an historic increase of brush fires throughout New York City," Tucker said in a statement.


In Massachusetts, which typically has about 15 wildland fires every October, there have been about 200 this year. State officials said more fires were expected because of weather conditions and dry surface fuels.


The National Weather Service in Boston warned Sunday that elevated fire risk continued across southern New England, given gusty winds and dry conditions. In Connecticut, a portion of Interstate 84 in Plainville was closed briefly Sunday because of a brush fire.


A volunteer firefighter in Haddam, Connecticut, was injured Saturday while fighting a fast-spreading brush fire sparked by downed power lines. The firefighter was treated at a hospital and released, according to a Facebook post by the Haddam Volunteer Fire Company.


Much-needed rain was predicted for Thursday in the region.


In southern New Hampshire, the fire danger risk was "very high," state officials said.


The Maine Forest Service said the southern part of the state also faced high fire danger. Most of the state was abnormally dry or facing moderate drought conditions.


Some relief could be in sight in New York. The National Weather Service in Albany said Sunday that most of the region could see a "widespread soaking rain" of 0.5 to 1.5 inches beginning Wednesday night.

## Trump’s Cabinet picks will shake status quo, House speaker says

date: 2024-11-18, from: VOA News USA

Some of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks are being described as “controversial” in both Democratic and Republican circles. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson reminded critics Sunday that the American people voted to shake up the status quo, and that’s what these new Cabinet officials, if confirmed, will be tasked with doing. VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias has the story. Video editing by Henry Hernandez.

## In heart of Amazon, US President Joe Biden marks climate 'legacy'

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

Rio de Janeiro — U.S. President Joe Biden began a historic Brazil trip Sunday, becoming the first sitting American president to visit the Amazon rainforest to mark what the White House calls his "legacy" on fighting climate change, couching it in economic terms of the race between countries in “harnessing the clean energy revolution.”


Biden landed in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, doorway to the world's largest jungle. Biden announced that under his administration, the United States has surpassed the goal of providing $11 billion per year in international climate financing in 2024 -- a key component in the fight against climate change lobbied by countries of the Global South.


“The fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity for generations to come. It may be the only existential threat to all our nations and to all humanity,” Biden said. The remarks were delivered amid the backdrop of lush green vegetation at a nature reserve and “living museum” in Manaus that celebrates the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity.




During his brief Manaus visit -- sandwiched between the Asia Pacific Economic Forum meeting in Lima, Peru, and the summit of the 20 largest economies, the G20, in Rio de Janeiro -- Biden announced U.S. investments in several climate initiatives, including $50 million for the Amazon Fund. He met with Indigenous leaders and toured the Amazon jungle via helicopter.


During the flight, Biden saw the confluence of the Rio Negro and the Amazon River, and the ravages of shore erosion and fire damage to the jungle, according to the White House. The majority of fires in the Amazon are linked to deforestation.


In the past four years, the administration has “created a bold new playbook that has turned tackling the climate crisis into an enormous economic opportunity – both at home and abroad,” the White House said.


Scaling back climate efforts 


Several diplomatic sources at APEC and the G20, who spoke with VOA under condition of anonymity to discuss a diplomatically sensitive matter, expressed concern that U.S. efforts will be dramatically scaled back under the incoming administration. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated in January.


During his earlier administration, Trump sent shockwaves among climate activists when he withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, the world’s main multilateral forum to mitigate climate change. He has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax.”


Acknowledging the two months he has left in office, Biden said he is leaving his successor and the country a “strong foundation to build on, if they choose to do so.”


“It's true, some may seek to want to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that's under way in America, but nobody, nobody can reverse it,” Biden said, underscoring that the push toward clean energy has bipartisan support and that other countries are harnessing it for their economic progress.


“The question now is, which government will stand in the way, and which will seize the enormous economic opportunity,” he said, in what may be a reference to the future of U.S.-China rivalry on clean energy under his successor.


Biden’s remarks came a day after a meeting in Lima with Chinese President Xi Jinping, likely their last meeting while Biden is in office.


China is currently the world's leader in electric vehicles, or EVs, accounting for more than half of global production and exports. Trump, meanwhile, is reportedly trying to roll back the $7,500 EV purchase tax credit for American consumers, part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Biden’s signature legislation on clean energy and climate change.


Celso Amorim, chief adviser to the president of the Federal Republic of Brazil, said he will not prejudge the incoming Trump administration.


“I judge actions, so we’ll see later how these actions evolve,” he told VOA Saturday, ahead of the G20 summit that Brazil is hosting. “For now, Biden has been a good partner for Brazil, for President [Luis Inacio] Lula [da Silva].”


Beginning Monday in Rio, Biden will focus on workers’ rights and clean economic growth and attend the launch of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. It is Lula’s initiative aimed at accelerating global efforts in the fight against hunger and poverty by 2030.


Asked about Biden’s message to world leaders concerned about the durability of U.S. commitments on various issues, including climate change and poverty reduction, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden is “focusing on the moment” and continuing progress achieved in the past four years for the remainder of his term.


A senior administration official briefing reporters after Biden’s Amazon visit left open the possibility that the incoming administration may continue the fight against climate change.


“Maybe he'll come down here and see the forest and see the damage being done from the drought and other things and change his mind about climate change,” the official said, referring to Trump.

## Two Trump Cabinet nominees embroiled in sex controversies

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

Two of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s key nominations – Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary and former lawmaker Matt Gaetz as attorney general -- have become embroiled in sex controversies that could threaten their Senate confirmations to serve in Trump’s Cabinet.



Hegseth, 44, paid an undisclosed amount to a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 to avert the threat of what he viewed as a baseless claim becoming public, his lawyer, Tim Parlatore, told U.S. news media this weekend.



Gaetz, 42, resigned abruptly last week from the House of Representatives near the end of his fourth two-year term, just days before the House Ethics Committee was nearing conclusion of an investigation into whether he had had sex with a 17-year-old girl and engaged in illicit drug use. Some lawmakers have described Gaetz showing nude cellphone pictures of his sexual conquests in the House chamber.



Gaetz has denied the allegations and federal authorities had earlier this year decided not to bring charges.




Hegseth’s lawyer, Parlatore, described Hegseth’s hotel sexual encounter with the woman after a Republican women’s event in Monterey, California, in 2017 as consensual. Local police, after an investigation, did not file any charges.



Parlatore told The Washington Post that Hegseth settled the woman’s claim a few years later because he believed the filing of her threatened lawsuit “would result in his immediate termination from Fox,” where he was the popular host of a weekend talk show.



"He was falsely accused, and my position is that he was the victim of blackmail," Parlatore told The Associated Press, calling it a case of "successful extortion." The woman’s name has not been made public, and U.S. news media do not usually disclose the names of alleged sexual assault victims without their consent.



Parlatore’s statements to news outlets came after a woman who said she is a friend of the accuser sent a detailed memo to the Trump transition several days ago detailing the Hegseth incident with his accuser. The accuser alleged that Hegseth had raped her after drinking at a hotel bar.



Trump so far has stood by Hegseth, an unconventional selection as the Pentagon chief.



Some Democratic and Republican lawmakers have raised concerns about Hegseth’s lack of a managerial background, either at the Defense Department or at a business. The Pentagon chief would oversee more than 2 million U.S. troops and a civilian work force of nearly 800,000 people.



In addition, some critics have raised concerns about a large tattoo on Hegseth’s upper right chest, which he characterizes as a Christian symbol, a “Jerusalem cross,” but what his critics say is a white nationalist symbol. Hegseth told one interviewer that he was removed by superiors from a National Guard detail handling security for President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021 for fear that he was “an extremist” because of the tattoo.



When the allegations against Hegseth first emerged, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung contended that Hegseth “has vigorously denied any and all accusations. We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again.”




Even though voters in his Florida district had just reelected him to a fifth term, Gaetz resigned from his office Wednesday, ending the investigation.



Several U.S. senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, are seeking access to the House Ethics Committee findings in the Gaetz investigation as they carry out their constitutionally mandated “advice and consent” role in reviewing Cabinet nominees made by an incoming president.



House Speaker Mike Johnson, the leader of the narrow Republican majority in the chamber, is balking at the release of what he told CNN’s “State of the Union” show was a report in “rough draft form.”



Johnson contended that no ethics report should be made public because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress, although there have been instances where that has occurred in the past.



He said senators reviewing the Gaetz nomination as the country’s top law enforcement official will “have a vigorous review and vetting process” but that they did not need to see the House Ethics Committee’s report. Some senators have suggested they could move to subpoena it if it is not turned over to them voluntarily.



Trump has also stood by Gaetz’s nomination, but the president-elect also has sought – with little success so far – to get the Senate, in Republican control come January when he takes office, to agree to recess at times so he can name and install his Cabinet members without the need for contentious and time-consuming confirmation hearings.


Also Sunday, Trump named Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, as the new chairman of the agency.


The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, and tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband.


Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.

## Reports: Biden OKs Ukraine's use of US-supplied long-range missiles to strike Russia

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

In a major policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has for the first time authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike inside Russia, according to U.S. news accounts.


The reported decision comes two months before Biden leaves office and ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. The incoming president has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. support for the government in Kyiv and claimed, without offering any details, that he will end Russia’s 33-month war on Ukraine before he takes office.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has for months pushed the United States to agree to use of the long-range missiles, known as the Army Tactical Missile Systems, to help thwart Moscow’s continuing barrage of airstrikes and ground advances in eastern Ukraine.


But initially, the weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea's decision to send thousands of troops to Russia in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  


Pyongyang’s troops have been fighting alongside Moscow’s forces in Russia’s southern Kursk region at the Ukrainian border, which Kyiv invaded in August, shocking the Russian military command.


Trump sidestepped a direct question at his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris about whether he wanted Ukraine to win in its war against Russia, saying simply, “I want the war to stop.”  


He instead focused on the war’s human toll by saying that people were being killed “by the millions,” a number that far exceeds any confirmed death toll, although some estimates say about one million Russians and Ukrainians have been killed and injured.


Trump went on to say that if elected, he would negotiate a deal even before becoming president and suggested the United States was “playing with World War III” with its support for Ukraine against Russia.


Harris quickly claimed that if Trump had been president during the invasion, then “Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe,” and that in such a scenario the Russian president would move on to Poland.  


The U.S. support of Ukraine took a back seat among concerns for U.S. voters, who told pollsters they were most worried about the cost of consumers goods and the influx of undocumented migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico.   


Trump swept through seven U.S. political battleground states in the November 5 election to easily defeat Harris. He is set to be inaugurated on January 20.

## A dancing Trump finds internet fame in China

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Memes, inspirational quotes, and even dance videos have brought President-elect Donald Trump to a new height of fame on Chinese social media since his election.


On Xiaohongshu, a media platform most similar to Instagram, the search term “Trump” shows more than 200,000 posts on the topic and 880 million views, with recent top posts each accruing more than 72,000 views and thousands of comments.


Videos of the president-elect dancing to the song YMCA by the band Village People have been circulating in Chinese cyberspace.


Many commenters find the content funny, calling him a jokester or comedian, while others view it as inspirational, seeing the older soon-to-be two-time American president as a role model.


Trump’s popularity stems from a kind of vitality and enthusiasm that he displayed throughout his campaign, analysts said, attracting many young Chinese who grew up looking up to more somber and rigid communist idols within their own country.


Videos of Elon Musk at a pre-election Trump rally have also made an impression on Chinese social media platform users. On these posts, commenters describe him as “a good kind of capitalist” and “someone who will make America strong.”


'They need an idol'


These impressions come amidst a general malaise facing the Chinese economy that has sparked the young Chinese people to ‘lie flat’, meaning to cease striving for a better life in face of a competitive job market and other pressures.


One comment commonly posted under many Trump-related posts reads: “He is 78 years old, was hit by a bullet in the ear and bled profusely, was convicted of a felony and nearly sent to jail, had appealed over 60 times but still continued to work hard to find a job and found the best job for himself. What excuse do you have for not working hard?”


Liu, a writer from Jiangsu province, said Trump’s difficult path back to the presidency is precisely what inspires Chinese youth when compared to the traditional Communist Party heroes. Liu only gave his surname, because talking to foreign media is dangerous, he says.


“They need an idol who represents the possibility of individual success. Trump fits this image: he gets stronger with each setback, continually fights back, and still works hard even at an older age,” Liu said, adding that “more importantly, young Chinese long for the kind of fair and just environment that has allowed Trump to succeed.”


Trump stands in direct contrast to many revered Chinese figures, such as Xi Jinping, Mao Zedong, and communist soldier Lei Feng — a model hero in China.


“Their lives seem too hard and are not the kind of lives young people in China aspire to,” Liu said, adding that Trump stands for something different: the individualistic, opportunistic ‘American Dream’


“Whether you can wear a gold bracelet before New Years is all up to you!” comments one user ‘Sleepy Orange’ under a campaign rally video, referencing gold as an important gift typically exchanged on the Chinese New Year. It is a symbol of wealth and prosperity. More than 2,000 people liked this comment.


Liu said he also appreciates Trump’s straightforwardness, as he doesn’t preach lofty ideals and morals but is practical and realistic. Liu described Chinese authorities and their political slogans as "vague and empty."


Popularity reflects dislike of Xi, says influencer


Chen Weiyu, a Chinese media influencer living in the United States, told VOA that Trump’s popularity on Chinese social media represents a deep disdain toward Chinese leaders, calling people’s engagement with his content a form of “deprogramming.”


"Rather than admiration for Trump himself, it's more about a rejection and opposition to Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. By expressing their liking for Trump, they are in fact expressing their dislike and opposition to Xi Jinping," Chen said.


She stressed that people at the bottom of society in China, struggling to survive in an economy controlled by communist elites, feel that no one is concerned about or advocating for them.


In contrast, working-class individuals facing unemployment in the United States can use their votes to elect a leader who they believe will represent their interests and create a better policy environment for them.


Chen also attributed the abundance of Trump content on Chinese platforms to the increasing prevalence of virtual private networks as a way of accessing information that is normally forbidden in China.


However, Zhou “Zuola” Shuguang, one of the first Chinese citizen journalists to relocate to Taiwan, said the popularity of Trump on Chinese social media may have the "tacit approval" of the Chinese Communist Party.


Beijing's censorship system is consistently strict about controlling content, so the fact that Trump-related content is able to spread widely on social media suggests that the CCP is intentionally allowing the content to be seen, Zhou told VOA.


"In other words, if Trump's content appears on Chinese social media, it means that Trump is not seen as a major threat by the CCP," he said.


While Trump-related content is getting clicks, not all of them are positive.


“It’s not a good thing for Trump to come back, God bless China” said a netizen in one comment. Others simply poke fun at the president-elect, the color of his hair and the way his makeup makes him look on stage.


“60% of the tariffs will be given to China, how many free trade enterprises are going to be suppressed,” reads another comment liked by nearly 1,000 people.

## Australia, US and Japan strengthen military cooperation

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

Sydney — Australia, Japan and the U.S. on Sunday committed to closer military cooperation in training their forces as the countries deepened their ties in a bid to counter China's military strength.


Australia's minister of defense, Richard Marles, hosted U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani on Sunday for the trilateral ministers' meeting -- the first to be held in Australia.


Under the new agreement, Japan's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade -- an elite marine unit -- will be deployed to Darwin to regularly work and train alongside Australian and U.S. forces.


"It is a very important statement to the region and to the world about the commitment that our three countries have in working with each other," Marles said.


"This is going to build interoperability between our three countries."


Austin said the partnership would increase intelligence "surveillance and reconnaissance activities" among the three countries, which will "advance our goals for a secure and peaceful Indo Pacific."


The U.S. defense chief said he was proud of what his office had done to "strengthen alliances" in the region and work with "countries that share the vision of a free and open Indo Pacific."


Canberra has drawn ever nearer to longtime ally the United States, bolstering its military in an attempt to deter the might of a rising China.


Besides rapidly developing its surface fleet, Australia plans to deploy stealthy nuclear-powered submarines in a tripartite deal with the United States and Britain known as AUKUS.


Some fear U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could jettison or try to rewrite the pact, returning to his "America first" style of foreign policy.


But Australian officials said this month they have a "great deal of confidence" that the pact will remain.

## Trump spends hours at UFC fight at Madison Square Garden

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump celebrated his election victory on Saturday night by attending an Ultimate Fighting Championship event with billionaire friend Elon Musk and cheering fans at a heavily guarded Madison Square Garden in New York City.


Known by some in the mixed martial arts world as the "Combatant in Chief," Trump counts UFC President Dana White as a close friend and considers fans of the sport part of his political base.


Trump sat between White and Musk for much of the night and paid rapt attention to the fights, sometimes chatting with the fighters after their matches.


He entered the arena to loud music and waved to the crowd, many of whom returned the gesture. He spent hours at the event, watching five matches until past 1:30 a.m. on Sunday.


The headline event in the octagon at UFC 309 was a battle for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world between Jon Jones and Stipe Miocic. After Jones won, he thanked Trump in his victory speech and they shook hands.


Among those joining the president-elect were House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, Tesla CEO Musk, a close Trump adviser, singer Kid Rock and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom he plans to nominate for secretary of health and human services.


Trump intelligence chief pick Tulsi Gabbard and country singer Jelly Roll were also in his entourage.


Trump’s visit to the storied Manhattan arena brought him back to the scene of a controversial campaign rally he held there on October 27, when a warm-up comedian mocked Puerto Rico as a "floating island of garbage."


A handful of visitors in Madison Square Garden, an arena with a seating capacity of nearly 20,000, wore red "Make America Great Again" hats.


One of them, Sean Allen, 22, traveled to the event from Monroe in upstate New York, where he lives and works for a county department.


He said he had voted for Trump and borrowed his MAGA hat from a friend after learning that the Republican president-elect, who won a decisive victory on November 5 over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, might come to the fight.


"I’d never voted before. That was my first time voting," Allen said, adding that he could have voted at the previous election but did not care about politics.


"When I woke up, I was like, OK, wow, Trump won big."


Nicholas Defilippo, 39, another visitor in a MAGA hat, also put it on to express his support for Trump after voting for him. Defilippo lives in New Jersey and works in law enforcement.


"He’s the most courageous man on the planet," he said of Trump.


The president-elect's self-styled "Trump Force One" plane left Palm Beach airport shortly after nightfall for the two-hour flight. It was only the second time Trump has left the Palm Beach, Florida, area since winning the presidential election on November 5.


The 78-year-old Republican flew to Washington on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House, and has otherwise been filling Cabinet positions for his incoming administration from his oceanfront Mar-a-Lago resort.


A heavy security presence was in place around Madison Square Garden.

## Bela Karolyi, controversial Olympic gymnasts coach, dies at 82

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

Bela Karolyi, the charismatic if polarizing gymnastics coach who turned young women into champions and the United States into an international power in the sport, has died. He was 82.


USA Gymnastics said Karolyi died Friday. No cause of death was given.


Karolyi and wife, Martha, trained multiple Olympic gold medalists and world champions in the U.S. and Romania, including Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton.


"A big impact and influence on my life," Comaneci, who was just 14 when Karolyi coached her to gold for Romania at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, posted on Instagram.


Yet Karolyi's strident methods sometimes came under fire, most pointedly during the height of the Larry Nassar scandal.


When the disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor was effectively given a life sentence after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting gymnasts and other athletes with his hands under the guise of medical treatment, over a dozen former gymnasts came forward saying the Karolyis were part of a system that created an oppressive culture that allowed Nassar's behavior to run unchecked for years.


While the Karolyis denied responsibility — telling CNN in 2018 they were unaware of Nassar's behavior — the revelations led to them receding from the spotlight. USA Gymnastics eventually exited an agreement to continue to train at the Karolyi Ranch north of Houston, though only after American star Simone Biles took the organization to task for having them train at a site where many experienced sexual abuse.


The Karolyis receded from the spotlight in the aftermath after spending 30-plus years as a guiding force in American gymnastics, often basking in success while brushing with controversy in equal measure.


The Karolyis defected from Romania to the United States in 1981. Three years later Bela helped guide Retton — all of 16 — to the Olympic all-around title at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. At the 1996 Games in Atlanta, he memorably helped an injured Kerri Strug off the floor after Strug's vault secured the team gold for the Americans.


Karolyi briefly became the national team coordinator for USA Gymnastics women's elite program in 1999 and incorporated a semi-centralized system that eventually turned the Americans into the sport's gold standard. It did not come without a cost. He was removed from the position after the 2000 Olympics when it became apparent his leadership style simply would not work, though he remained around the sport after Martha took over for her husband in 2001.


While the Karolyis approach helped the U.S. become a superpower — an American woman has won each of the last six Olympic titles and the U.S. women earned the team gold at the 2012 and 2016 games under Martha Karolyi's leadership — their methods came under fire.


Dominique Moceanu, part of the "Magnificent 7" team that won gold in Atlanta, talked extensively about her corrosive relationship with the Karolyis following her retirement. In her 2012 memoir, Moceanu wrote Bela Karolyi verbally abused her in front of her teammates on multiple occasions.


"His harsh words and critical demeanor often weighed heavily on me," Moceanu posted on X Saturday. "While our relationship was fraught with difficulty, some of these moments of hardship helped me forge and define my own path."


Some of Karolyi's most famous students were always among his staunchest defenders. When Strug got married, she and Karolyi took a photo recreating their famous scene from the 1996 Olympics, when he carried her onto the medals podium after she vaulted on a badly sprained ankle.




Being a gymnastics pied piper was never Karolyi's intent. Born in Clug, Hungary, (now Romania) on September 13, 1942, he wanted to be a teacher, getting into coaching in college simply so he could spend more time with Martha.


After graduating, the couple moved to a small coal-mining town in Transylvania. Looking for a way to keep their students warm and entertained during the long, harsh winters, Karolyi dragged out some old mats and he and his wife taught the children gymnastics.


The students showed off their skills to their parents, and the exhibitions soon caught the eye of the Romanian government, which hired the Karolyis to coach the women's national team at a time when the sport was done almost exclusively by adult women, not young girls.


Karolyi changed all that, though, bringing a team to the Montreal Olympics with only one gymnast older than 14.


It was in Montreal, of course, where the world got its first real glimpse of Karolyi. When a solemn, dark-haired sprite named Nadia Comaneci enchanted the world with the first perfect 10 in Olympic history, a feat she would duplicate six times, Karolyi was there to wrap her in one of his trademark bear hugs.


Romania, which had won only three bronzes in Olympic gymnastics before 1976, left Montreal with seven medals, including Comaneci's golds in the all-around, balance beam and uneven bars, and the team silver. Comaneci became an international sensation, the first person to appear on the covers of Sports Illustrated, Time and Newsweek in the same week.


Four years later, however, Karolyi was in disgrace.


He was incensed by the judging at the Moscow Olympics, which he thought cost Comaneci a second all-around gold, and the Romanian government was horrified that he had embarrassed the Soviet hosts.


"Suddenly, from a position where we've been praised and considered the foremost athletes in the country, I was stigmatized," he once said. "I thought they could put me away for political misconduct."


When he and Martha took the Romanian team to New York for an exhibition in March 1981, they were tipped off that they were going to be punished upon their return. Despite not speaking any English and with their then-6-year-old daughter, Andrea, still in Romania, they decided to defect.


"We knew what kind of risks we were taking, because nobody was guaranteeing us anything," Martha Karolyi once said. "We started out with a suitcase and a little motel room. From there, it's gradually improved."


The couple made their way to California, where they learned English by watching television and Bela did odd jobs. A chance encounter with Olympic gold medalist Bart Conner — who would later marry Comaneci — at the Los Angeles airport a few months later led to the Karolyis' first coaching job in the United States.


Within a year, their daughter had arrived in the U.S. and the Karolyis had their own gym in Houston. It soon became the center of American gymnastics, turning out eight national champions in 13 years.




Three years after the Karolyis left Romania, Retton became the first American to win the Olympic all-around title, scoring a perfect 10 on vault to claim gold at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Retton also posted the highest score in the team competition as the Americans won the silver, their first team medal since 1948.


Four years later, Phoebe Mills, another Karolyi gymnast, won a bronze on balance beam. It was the first individual medal for an American woman at a non-boycotted games. And in 1991, Kim Zmeskal — "the little Kimbo," as Bela Karolyi called her — became the first American to win the world all-around title.


"My biggest contribution was giving the kids the faith that they can be the best among the best," Karolyi once said. "I knew that if the Americans could understand they were not inferior ... then they can be groomed like international, highly visible athletes."


But as Karolyi's resume grew, so did the criticism.


Other coaches were irritated by his brash personality and ability to always find his way into the spotlight. When Retton won gold, Karolyi leaped a barrier — he had an equipment manager's credential, not a coach's — so he could scoop Retton up in a hug — right in front of the TV cameras, of course.


He could be a harsh taskmaster, calling his gymnasts names, taunting them for their weight and pushing them to their limits.


Even those warm embraces weren't always quite what they seemed.


"A lot of those big bear hugs came with the whisper of 'Not so good,' in our ears," Retton wrote.


Yet Retton and Comaneci remained close with Karolyi, making appearances with him at gymnastics events or sitting with him at competitions. Zmeskal had her wedding at the Karolyi ranch.


Karolyi briefly retired after the 1992 Games in Barcelona, where he led the Americans to their first team medal, a bronze, at a non-boycotted Olympics in 44 years. But he kept his gym and summer camps, and by 1994 was again coaching elite-level gymnasts after Zmeskal asked him to help in her attempt to make the Atlanta Games.


Zmeskal didn't make the Atlanta squad. But two of Karolyi's other gymnasts, Strug and Moceanu, did, and it was Strug who provided one of the signature moments of the Olympics.


The Americans went into their final event in team finals, vault, trying to hold off Russia for their first-ever title at an Olympics or world championships. Despite injuring her left ankle when she fell on her first vault attempt, Strug went ahead with her second attempt, believing — wrongly — the Americans needed her score to clinch the gold.


With Karolyi shouting, "You can do it!" Strug sprinted down the runway, soared high above the vault and landed on both feet — ensuring it was a clean vault — before pulling her left leg up. After saluting the judges, she fell to her knees and had to be carried off the podium. Tests would later show she had two torn ligaments in her ankle.


As the rest of the Americans gathered on the podium to receive their gold medals, Karolyi carried Strug back into the arena, cradling her in his arms.


But even that drew criticism. Many said Karolyi never should have encouraged Strug to vault on her injured ankle in the first place and then should have stayed out of the spotlight rather than carrying her to the podium.


"Bela is a very tough coach and he gets criticism for that," Strug said at the time. "But that's what it takes to become a champion. I don't think it's really right that everyone tries to find the faults of Bela. Anything in life, to be successful, you've got to work really hard."


The Karolyis retired again after the Atlanta Olympics. But after the U.S. women finished last in the medal round at the 1997 world championships, USA Gymnastics asked Bela Karolyi to come back.


He agreed — but only if he could implement a semi-centralized training system. Rather than a patchwork system of individual coaches who had their own philosophies, Karolyi would oversee the entire U.S. program. Gymnasts could still train with their own coaches, but there would be regular national team camps to ensure they were meeting established training and performance standards.


Though the idea was sound, Karolyi was not the right person to be in charge. Coaches who had been his equal chafed at his heavy-handedness, and were annoyed by his grandstanding. Gymnasts resented his bluster and demands.


By the time the Americans left the Sydney Olympics, about the only thing everyone agreed on was that Karolyi needed to step away.


He stepped aside and was replaced by his wife. Martha Karolyi's standards were just as high — if not higher — than her husband's, but on the surface, she was more willing to listen to other opinions.


"She's more diplomatic. Absolutely," Bela Karolyi said before the 2012 Olympics. "I'm wild. The opposite."

## Health officials report first case of new form of mpox in US

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Health officials said Saturday they have confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo. 


The person had traveled to eastern Africa and was treated in Northern California upon return, according to the California Department of Public Health. Symptoms are improving and the risk to the public is low. 


The individual was isolating at home and health workers are reaching out to close contacts as a precaution, the state health department said. 


Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that's in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals. 


Earlier this year, scientists reported the emergence of a new form of mpox in Africa that was spread through close contact including through sex. It was widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. But in cases that were identified in travelers outside of the continent, spread has been very limited, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 


More than 3,100 confirmed cases have been reported since late September, according to the World Health Organization. Most of them have been in three African countries — Burundi, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 


Since then, cases of travelers with the new mpox form have been reported in Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom. 


Health officials earlier this month said the situation in Congo appears to be stabilizing. The Africa CDC has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the spread, and another 7 million vaccines for the rest of Africa. The spread is mostly through sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups. 


The current outbreak is different from the 2022 global outbreak of mpox where gay and bisexual men made up most of the cases.

## Trump chooses oil industry executive as energy secretary

date: 2024-11-17, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has selected Chris Wright, the founder of an oilfield services company, to lead the Energy Department, as his new administration continues to take shape.


The transition team officially announced the choice on Saturday afternoon. On Friday, Trump announced a new National Energy Council to be led by his Interior Department pick, former North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.




In this role, Burgum will direct a panel that crosses all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, Trump said in a statement. As chairman of the National Energy Council, Burgum will have a seat on the National Security Council, the president-elect said.




Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy based in Denver, Colorado, has no political experience. He is an advocate for the oil and gas industry, including fracking. In 2019, he drank fracking liquid to show that it was not dangerous.


According to a March 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. has produced more crude oil than any nation at any time, according to its International Energy Statistics, for the past six years in a row. Average monthly U.S. crude oil production established a monthly record high in December 2023 at more than 13.3 million barrels per day.


Earlier announcements 


The Trump-Vance transition team announced Steven Cheung will return to the Trump White House as communications director. He held the same position for the Trump-Vance 2024 presidential campaign and served in the White House during Trump's first term as director of strategic response.


On Friday evening, Trump announced that his campaign press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, would be his White House press secretary. She served as assistant press secretary in his previous term in office.


Trump has swiftly named an array of political loyalists to key Cabinet positions. Most of them are likely to win quick Senate approval after confirmation hearings.



Having won majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, Republicans are set to take full control of the U.S. government by the third week in January.


"Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate," newly reelected House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this week. "The American people want us to implement and deliver that 'America First' agenda."


Trump will be sworn in as the country's 47th president on January 20, two weeks after the new Congress has been seated.


The 78-year-old Trump campaigned on a sweeping agenda that Democrats will be largely powerless to stop.


Republicans will have a 53-47 edge in the Senate, and the tie-breaking vote of Vice President-elect JD Vance in the event of a 50-50 stalemate on any legislative proposal. Republicans have secured at least 218 seats in the 435-member House, pending the outcome of seven undecided elections for two-year terms.


During his bid to win a second, nonconsecutive four-year term, Trump called for the massive deportation of millions of undocumented migrants living in the United States to their home countries, an extension and expansion of 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025, further deregulation of businesses, a curb on climate controls, and prosecution of his political opponents.


Senator John Thune of South Dakota, newly elected by his fellow Republicans as the Senate majority leader, said, "This Republican team is united. We are on one team. We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump's agenda."


Trump also has called on Senate Republican leaders to allow him to make "recess appointments," which could occur when the chamber is not in session and would erase the need for time-consuming and often contentious confirmation hearings.


Despite the likelihood that most of his nominees will be approved, Trump this week named four who immediately drew disparaging assessments from several Democrats and some Republicans for their perceived lack of credentials.


They are former Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general; former Democratic congresswoman turned Republican Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence; former junior military officer and Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary; and former presidential candidate and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department.


The blowback presages tough confirmation fights for the four in the Senate, which reviews the appointments of top-level officials and then votes to confirm them or, on occasion, reject them, forcing the White House to make another choice.




The appointment of Gaetz, 42, could prove particularly problematic, with some senators openly questioning whether he can win a 51-vote majority to assume the government's top law enforcement position.


A House ethics committee probe was in the final stages of investigating whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use when he announced his resignation from the chamber late Wednesday, ending the probe.


The Justice Department that Gaetz hopes to lead had decided not to pursue criminal charges. Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing.



Gabbard, 43, has been criticized for her lack of direct experience in intelligence and accused of disseminating pro-Russian disinformation. If confirmed, she would be tasked with overseeing 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. She won over Trump with her switch from being a one-time Democratic House member from Hawaii to changing parties and staunchly advocating for his election.


Critics have assailed Hegseth, a 44-year-old decorated former military officer, as someone who lacks managerial experience in the business world. A weekend anchor on Fox News, he has voiced his opinions on military operations, including his opposition to women serving in combat roles.


A descendant of the Kennedy family political dynasty, Kennedy, 70, for years has been one of the country's most prominent proponents of anti-vaccine views. He also opposed water fluoridation.


On Thursday, Trump also selected former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to be Manhattan's top federal prosecutor, and former Representative Doug Collins to be secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.


Trump named one of his personal criminal defense attorneys, Todd Blanche, to be deputy attorney general, and another of his attorneys, D. John Sauer, to be solicitor general.



The Associated Press provided some information for this report.
