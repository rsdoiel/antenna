## Fossil Fuel Emissions Are Still Rising

Fossil fuel emissions are still going up </h3><p><strong></strong>Global fossil fuel emissions are projected to rise again this year, and there is “no sign” of a peak, <a href="https://globalcarbonbudget.org/fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-increase-again-in-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SRVKOvPhlIlV6NOihTyBOSFnvBnXhU1gBU4wd6o1cqptT3TC_d0aa2W3Oj04UFZ2J5j29" target="_blank">according to the Global Carbon Project</a>. Carbon dioxide emissions from burning oil, gas, and coal in 2024 will hit about 37.4 billion metric tons, up 0.8% from 2023. Total CO2 emissions – including from land-use changes like deforestation and wildfires – will rise to 41.6 billion metric tons, up from 40.6 billion metric tons last year. Projected emissions vary on a regional level: China’s are expected to rise by 0.2%, while U.S. emissions are expected to fall 0.6%. India’s will be up 4.6%, while the EU’s will be down by nearly 4%. Notably, emissions from land-use changes have been falling for a decade but are set to rise this year. And then there’s this sobering reminder: “Current levels of technology-based Carbon Dioxide Removal (excluding nature-based means such as reforestation) only account for about one-millionth of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuels.” The research team behind the project estimates that the 1.5 degrees Celsius target will be breached in six years.</p><p>Relatedly, in a speech at the COP29 climate summit in Baku, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2024/nov/13/cop-29-leaders-speak-after-report-finds-climate-pledges-not-kept-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&page=with%3Ablock-67345ae98f084e2f442699ed&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SRVKOvPhlIlV6NOihTyBOSFnvBnXhU1gBU4wd6o1cqptT3TC_d0aa2W3Oj04UFZ2J5j29#block-67345ae98f084e2f442699ed" target="_blank">asked</a>: “What does it mean for the future of the world if the biggest polluters continue as usual? What on Earth are we doing in this gathering, over and over and over, if there is no common political will on the horizon to go beyond words and unite for meaningful action?”</p><h3>2. Climate finance goal debate continues at COP</h3><p>In other news from Baku, nations have been debating the draft text for a new climate finance goal, the most anticipated initiative at this year’s conference. <em>Carbon Brief</em>’s Josh Gabbatiss <a href="https://x.com/Josh_Gabbatiss/status/1856604630865559874?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SRVKOvPhlIlV6NOihTyBOSFnvBnXhU1gBU4wd6o1cqptT3TC_d0aa2W3Oj04UFZ2J5j29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that the text had “ballooned” from 9 pages to 34. “Before there were just 3 options for what the goal would look like – now there are also 13 ‘sub-options,’” he said. A large number of developing countries <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/11/12/cop29-bulletin-day-2-aliyev-doubles-down-on-fossil-fuels/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SRVKOvPhlIlV6NOihTyBOSFnvBnXhU1gBU4wd6o1cqptT3TC_d0aa2W3Oj04UFZ2J5j29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> rejected the original document, asking for at least $1.3 trillion in adaptation finance and saying they don’t want to broaden the contributor base to include China and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, developed countries “are indicating that they don’t want to commit to providing more than $100 billion a year unless the contributor base is expanded,” <em><em>Climate Home News</em></em> <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/11/12/cop29-bulletin-day-2-aliyev-doubles-down-on-fossil-fuels/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SRVKOvPhlIlV6NOihTyBOSFnvBnXhU1gBU4wd6o1cqptT3TC_d0aa2W3Oj04UFZ2J5j29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.

Exclusive: Lawsuit threatens Michigan’s permitting reform law</h3><p>The most important legal challenge for the renewables industry in America may have just been filed in Michigan, <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/michigan-pa233-lawsuit-renewable-energy-permitting?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SRVKOvPhlIlV6NOihTyBOSFnvBnXhU1gBU4wd6o1cqptT3TC_d0aa2W3Oj04UFZ2J5j29" target="_self">reported Jael Holzman in a Heatmap exclusive</a>. On Friday afternoon, about 70 towns and a handful of Michigan counties appealed the rule implementing part of a new renewable energy siting law – PA 233 – providing primary permitting authority to the Michigan Public Services Commission and usurping local approval powers in specific cases. The law was part of a comprehensive permitting package passed last year by the state legislature and seen by climate advocates as a potential model for combatting NIMBYs across the country. The appeal challenges multiple aspects of the law’s implementation, saying it went beyond statute, as well as the rulemaking procedure itself, claiming it failed to follow proper processes. “The lawsuit aims to effectively undo the law going into effect,” Holzman <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/michigan-pa233-lawsuit-renewable-energy-permitting?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SRVKOvPhlIlV6NOihTyBOSFnvBnXhU1gBU4wd6o1cqptT3TC_d0aa2W3Oj04UFZ2J5j29" rel="noopener" target="_self">explained</a>, “or at least enjoin what opponents say are the most onerous restrictions on municipalities and county governments.”</p><h3>5.

## Trump, China, and Climate Change: What Happens Next?

date: 2024-11-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDQ3MDI2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNjY2ODUxMX0.TlmhqjyYAzyHH860-L2KLX_eGwjDanOl4j1za_nozhU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The rollbacks are coming. Donald Trump’s incoming administration is expected to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, weaken the Environmental Protection Agency’s rules for power plants and tailpipe pollution, and — potentially — rewrite or repeal big swaths of the Inflation Reduction Act. Each of those actions would seem to provide an opening for the world’s No. 1 polluter — China — to assert global leadership and zip ahead in the next generation of clean energy technology.
</p><p>
	How will it respond? On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse chat with <a href="https://sais.jhu.edu/users/jwalla62" target="_blank">Jeremy Wallace</a>, the A. Doak Barnett Professor of China Studies at Johns Hopkins University. Wallace, a Heatmap contributor, helps us understand how China is thinking about Trump, the current state of China’s economy, and why China sometimes flexes its climate leadership — but just as often doesn’t. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

<span></span>Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> While we have no idea what is in Trump’s head, he does have a set of voices around him. To the degree that you can see and briefly summarize those camps, Jeremy, what, what do you … What is he going to be hearing? What are the dominant intellectual threads, or self-interested economic-motivated threads that he’s likely to hear from different parts of his coalition?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jeremy Wallace: </strong>I would say three different camps. There will be as many as different advisors, but I think summarizing it into three different camps is helpful. There’s a Lighthizer camp that … Lightizer comes out of the steel industry, and thinking about domestic steel manufacturing and national security. So that’s a camp, and that’s a tariff, tariff, tariff world. We can China decouple in order to reduce their power.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a Musk camp, who is probably just singular, that is simultaneously extremely kind of right-wing in its orientation, but also runs a multi-trillion-dollar company that is principally Chinese-produced, and Chinese demand — not only, by any means, but is a major portion of that business. And then there is the, there are the Wall Street billionaires that we’re talking about as Treasury Secretary, where there is an interest in continued economic relations and not destroying U.S. credibility to pay its own debts, to make sure that the economy continues to run.
	<br/>
<br/>
And I think all of those would have very different views about what U.S.-China policy should be. There’s a Pentagon wing, right? There’s all kinds of other voices, as well. But I think from Trump world, I think those are probably the three principal voices that he actually cares about. And I don’t know what the right … I don’t know what the policies will be, other than my guess is that there would be a lot of cycling between those three different views.

## US Senate Democrats rush to confirm judges before Trump takes office

date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Senate's Democratic majority began a crusade on Tuesday to confirm as many new federal judges nominated by President Joe Biden as possible to avoid leaving vacancies that Republican Donald Trump could fill after taking office on Jan. 20.


With Republicans set to take control of the chamber on Jan. 3, the Senate on Tuesday held a confirmation vote on one of Biden's judicial nominees - former prosecutor April Perry - for the first time since Trump won the Nov. 5 presidential election. The Senate voted 51-44 in favor of her becoming a U.S. district court judge in Illinois.


All told, Biden has announced another 30 judicial nominees who are awaiting Senate confirmation votes. Sixteen have already have been reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting a final confirmation vote by the full Senate. Another 14 nominees are awaiting committee review.


The U.S. Constitution assigns to the Senate the power to confirm a president's nominees for life-tenured seats on the federal judiciary.


"We are going to get as many done as we can," Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.


Trump made 234 judicial appointments during his first four years in office, the second most of any president in a single term, and succeeded in moving the judiciary rightward - including building a 6-3 conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court with three appointees.


Biden has appointed a host of liberal judges. Since the beginning of his presidency in 2021, the Senate has confirmed 214 Biden judicial nominees, including liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. About two-thirds were women, and the same share were racial minorities.


Senate Democrats are under pressure to swiftly confirm the remaining nominees, along with any new picks Biden may name in the waning weeks of his presidency.


How many nominees Senate Democrats will be able to confirm remains to be seen. Trump in a social media post on Sunday called on the Senate to halt approving Biden's nominees, saying, "Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges."


Billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk on Tuesday wrote on social media that "activist" judicial nominees are "bad for the country." Mike Davis, a Trump ally at the conservative judicial advocacy group Article III Project, in another post urged Senate Republicans to vote down all judicial appointments until January.


"The American people voted for monumental change," Davis wrote on social media last week. "Grind the Senate to a halt."


Current Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's office declined comment. McConnell has consistently opposed Biden's nominees and, as majority leader, was instrumental in getting Trump's previous nominees confirmed.


Trump's judicial appointees have been involved in major decisions welcomed by conservatives including Supreme Court rulings rolling back abortion rights, widening gun rights, rejecting race-conscious collegiate admissions and limiting the power of federal regulatory agencies.


Judicial nominees require a simple majority for confirmation. Democrats currently hold a slim 51-49 majority, meaning that they can ill afford any defections or absences if Republicans show up in force to oppose Biden's nominees during the chamber's post-election "lame duck" session.


West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has said he would not vote for any nominee who does not garner at least one Republican vote. Must-pass legislation like a spending bill to avert a government shutdown also may consume precious time during the session.


'Every possible nominee'


Biden's allies have said a concerted push to confirm his remaining nominees would allow him to build on his legacy of helping to diversify a federal bench long dominated by white men.


He is not done nominating judges. On Friday, Biden announced his first post-election nominee, Tali Farhadian Weinstein, who after unsuccessfully running in the 2021 Democratic primary to be Manhattan district attorney was picked for a job as a federal district judge in New York.


A spokesperson for Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that he "aims to confirm every possible nominee before the end of this Congress."


White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Monday noted that during Trump's first term, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 18 judges after Biden had won the 2020 election but before he took office.


Pending nominees include five to the influential federal appeals courts. Republicans said before the election that they had the votes to block two of them: Adeel Mangi, who would become the first Muslim federal appellate judge, and North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park, who unsuccessfully defended the race-conscious admissions policies before the Supreme Court.


There are several others nominated to serve as trial court judges like Perry, a former prosecutor now working at Chicago-headquartered GE HealthCare who would join the bench in Illinois. Biden nominated her to a judgeship in April after her prior nomination to become Chicago's top federal prosecutor was blocked by Republican Senator JD Vance.


Vance began placing a hold on Biden's nominees to the U.S. Justice Department in 2023 after Special Counsel Jack Smith secured the first of two federal indictments against Trump, who subsequently picked the senator as his vice presidential running mate.

## Hezbollah, Hamas down but not out, US says

date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Israel's war against Hezbollah and Hamas, while inflicting considerable damage, has yet to strike a crippling blow to either of the Iran-backed terror groups, according to a top U.S. counterterrorism official.


The acting director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) said Tuesday that the impact of Israeli intelligence operations, along with repeated military airstrikes and ground offensives in Lebanon and Gaza, have severely diminished the ability of both groups to launch new attacks on Israel.


But he cautioned that both groups remain resilient, and in the case of Hezbollah, retain significant capabilities.


"Before the conflict, they [Hezbollah] had built up unprecedented numbers of rockets and missiles and other munitions," the NCTC's Brett Holmgren told an audience in Washington, adding that the Lebanese group was starting at a "very strong point."


And he said while Israeli strikes have decimated Hezbollah leadership, the group's ground forces in southern Lebanon "remain somewhat intact."


Additionally, Israel's actions have done little to damage Hezbollah's reach beyond the Middle East.


"Their external capabilities have largely been untouched," Holmgren said, noting the U.S. and its allies are on alert for any indication Hezbollah may seek to retaliate outside the region.


Hamas' staying power


Hamas, which touched off the war in Gaza when it launched its October 7, 2023, terror attack that killed about 1,200 mostly Israeli civilians, has also suffered greatly, according to the latest U.S. assessments.


"Militarily, they have been significantly diminished," Holmgren said. "They're essentially morphing into an insurgent force on the ground."


Yet despite being forced to keep a low profile and resort to hit-and-run-type tactics, U.S. intelligence sees few indications Hamas has lost its appeal.


"Hamas has been able to recruit new members to its ranks and will likely continue its ability to do so, so long as there is not another viable political option on the ground for these disaffected young men in Gaza to turn to," Holmgren said. 


"There has to be a more viable political actor on the ground in Gaza to give these new recruits for Hamas, to give them a better option," he added.


Hamas, Hezbollah numbers


Prior to Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, U.S. intelligence estimated that the U.S.-designated terror group had between 20,000 and 25,000 fighters, though some estimates put the number at 30,000 or more, citing support from about a dozen other terror groups that had pledged to fight under the Hamas banner.


Hezbollah, according to U.S. estimates, had about 40,000 fighters with "state-like military capabilities."




Holmgren on Tuesday did not elaborate on how many fighters from either group had been eliminated. 


Israeli officials, however, have said their forces have killed upward of 14,000 Hamas fighters and more than 2,550 Hezbollah fighters.


The Israel Defense Forces earlier this month said it estimates that about 80% of Hezbollah's arsenal of medium- and short-range rockets has been destroyed.


Health officials in Gaza have said the Israeli offensive there has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.  


Lebanon's Health Ministry said more than 3,000 people have been killed during the conflict, though it does not differentiate between civilians and Hezbollah fighters.


Terror spreading


There are growing concerns, though, that the death tolls in Lebanon and Gaza are serving as a spark for other terror groups around the world.


Less than a month after Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, U.S. counterterrorism officials warned that the event had begun to galvanize other terror groups, including Islamic State and al-Qaida.




Holmgren said it appears the Hamas attack, combined with growing political and economic turmoil, has in fact helped to reenergize other groups.


Islamic State 


"ISIS exploited reduced counterterrorism pressure last year to recover and to rebuild as governments shifted attention and resources to the conflict in Gaza," Holmgren said, using an acronym for the Islamic State terror group, also known as IS or Daesh.


Central Syria, he said, had become an epicenter for IS plotting against the U.S. and the West, at large.  




And although a series of recent operations by the U.S. and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces have again weakened IS, the group continues to benefit from improved finances and resurgent media campaigns, Holmgren said.


The IS affiliate in Afghanistan known as IS-Khorasan has likewise shown resilience.


State Department officials, in a recent inspector general's report, admitted that serious questions remain about whether Afghanistan's ruling Taliban "have the will and capability to fully eliminate terrorist safe havens or control the flow of foreign terrorist fighters in and through Afghanistan."




And although key elements of IS-Khorasan have fled Afghanistan for Pakistan, there are fears the group may be poised for a resurgence.


"Sustained pressure will be needed to prevent the group from expanding further," Holmgren said.


Africa


Holmgren further warned that groups affiliating themselves with IS and al-Qaida are also seeing their fortunes rise in Africa.


IS and al-Qaida attacks in West Africa and the Sahel alone are set to surpass more than 3,000 by the end of the year, he said, doubling the total number of attacks from 2021.


And it could get worse.


Holmgren said IS and al-Qaida affiliates have capitalized on turmoil in countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic, where governments have turned to the Russian military and Russian paramilitary groups to boost security.




The situation in Africa, "if left unchecked, could become a much more acute long-term threat to U.S. interests," he said. 


Younger terrorists


U.S. counterterrorism analysts have also picked up on several other trends that they say bear watching.


One is a propensity for younger people to join terror movements.


"The rising number of juveniles engaging in terrorism is a global phenomenon, and it may well worsen in the near term as the effects of the Israel-Hamas conflict take hold," Holmgren said.


Vulnerable young people the world over, he said, are turning to groups like IS for a sense of belonging and accomplishment.


"A lot of the propaganda — it's easily accessible on the social media platforms" he said. "A lot of it [is in] English."


Iran and Trump


There is also concern about how Iran will respond to Israel's degradation of Hezbollah and Hamas, and to the reelection of former U.S. President Donald Trump.


U.S. intelligence officials warned in the run-up to last week's election that Iran was engaged in a series of influence operations aimed at hurting Trump's chance of returning to power.


And late last week, the U.S. shed light on another in a series of efforts by Tehran to assassinate the once and future president.




In the short term, Holmgren said, Iran could try to leverage its proxy forces in Iraq and Syria to launch additional attacks against U.S. interests and against Israel.


But he also expressed concern that Iran continues to play host to al-Qaida's de facto leader, Saif al-Adel.


"I won't speculate on what the Iranian intentions are, but suffice to say, it is unhelpful with his presence there," Holmgren said Tuesday in response to a question from VOA.


Trump transition 


Holmgren promised Tuesday to work with the incoming Trump administration to keep the U.S. and its allies safe.


"I look forward to engaging with the Trump administration's national security team to conduct an orderly transition and to ensure that they are ready on Day One to address a dynamic threat environment," Holmgren said.


"The U.S. counterterrorism community will be working diligently, as they do each and every day, to keep threats at bay so that our democracy may continue to shine as a beacon of freedom and hope in the world," he added.

## At White House, Indonesia's new leader straddles US-China rivalry

date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA

white house — President Joe Biden and President Prabowo Subianto met Tuesday at the White House, marking the 75th anniversary of U.S.-Indonesia relations, part of a multination visit by the newly inaugurated leader of Southeast Asia's largest economy.


"I will work very hard to strengthen Indonesia and United States relationship," said Prabowo, who goes by his first name.


Biden said he looks forward to deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the highest level among nontreaty allies, which the two countries signed in 2023. "That includes deepening our security cooperation," he said before their meeting.


In brief remarks to the press, Biden twice raised an issue of concern for Washington: freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. He said he wanted to strengthen the U.S. partnership with Indonesia, "by advancing [a] free and open Indo-Pacific."


"We'll discuss, also, global challenges, including in Gaza and the South China Sea," he said.


China's nine-dash line 


The White House meeting came days after Prabowo's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, where Indonesia and China signed a series of agreements valued at about $10 billion and focusing on infrastructure, green energy, digital technology and agriculture.




"In the present situation, geopolitical and geoeconomic, Indonesia and China have become very close partners in many, many fields," Prabowo said.


One of the deals is to jointly develop fisheries, and oil and gas exploration in waters around Indonesia's Natuna Islands where China's "nine-dash line" marking its expansive claims in the South China Sea overlaps with Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone.


Critics say the agreement risks implicitly validating China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which, according to the United Nations, has no basis in international law.


VOA asked the White House whether Biden was specifically referring to this deal in his meeting with Prabowo.


"We continue to encourage Indonesia to work with their legal experts to make sure any agreement they make with the PRC [People's Republic of China] is in accordance with international law, especially the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea," said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.


Beijing claims the major shipping route almost entirely, infringing into the EEZs of Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines. All but Indonesia formally dispute the Chinese claim while Taiwan makes a claim to the sea similar to Beijing's.


"It's a big deal for Indonesia," as a non-claimant country in the South China Sea dispute that supports the concept of a "free and open Indo-Pacific," said Klaus Heinrich Raditio, author on South China Sea issues and lecturer at Indonesia's Driyarkara School of Philosophy. "People will question our position," he told VOA.


The Indonesian Foreign Ministry clarified Sunday that it remains firm in rejecting China's nine-dash line.




Beijing's claim, Jakarta said, "does not comply" with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and "therefore has no bearing" on Indonesia's sovereignty and jurisdiction over the North Natuna Sea.


Jakarta's agreement with Beijing highlights a "new phase of building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future," according to the joint statement.


This reference supports "China's vision of a new global order that is anti-Western hegemony," Raditio said.


It's unclear whether this language was an intentional signaling of a geopolitical shift or merely an overlook from a new administration eager to bolster ties with great powers. The Indonesian Embassy in Washington has not responded to VOA's queries.


"Most likely, it is a bureaucratic mistake," Raditio said. "We put too much attention on economic cooperation. How many investments that we can attract from China? We kind of sideline other important issues."


Prabowo's outreach to Trump 


Just as important to Jakarta as the White House meeting is Prabowo's outreach to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Jakarta is gearing up for Trump's new administration that begins in January.


"Wherever you are, I'm willing to fly to congratulate you personally, sir," Prabowo said in a call to Trump that was posted Monday on his social media.


The Trump team has not responded to VOA's queries on the conversation.


U.S. foreign policy under Trump "may become more transactional and more focused on elements related to U.S.-China, competition," said Andreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


"The downside risk of this as it relates to Southeast Asian countries, is that it may limit some of the decision-making space they have in their diplomatic affairs," Natalegawa said.


Prabowo has voiced ambitions to raise Indonesia's international profile and has made early foreign policy moves, including a surprise decision to join Southeast Asia's largest economy to the BRICS bloc.


BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is a growing group of emerging economies seen as a counterweight to the West. In October, BRICS added Indonesia as one of the group's 13 new "partner countries."


The move could be a shift away from the position taken by Prabowo's predecessor, Joko Widodo, who took in massive amounts of infrastructure investments from Beijing but remained mostly nonaligned geopolitically.


The White House visit marks a milestone for Prabowo, who was barred from entering the U.S. under the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations over his role in abducting activists of the 1998 "Reformasi" movement that ousted President Suharto, Prabowo's then father-in-law.


The Trump administration lifted the visa ban for then-Defense Minister Prabowo, for his visit in 2020.

## Jack Teixeira, who leaked Pentagon documents, sentenced to 15 years in prison

date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA

boston — A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced a Massachusetts Air National Guard member to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to leaking highly classified military documents about the war in Ukraine. 


Jack Teixeira pleaded guilty earlier this year to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act following his arrest in the most consequential national security case in years. Brought into court wearing an orange jumpsuit, he showed no visible reaction as he was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani. 


Before being sentenced, he apologized for his actions. 


"I wanted to say I'm sorry for all the harm that I brought and caused," Texeira said, referencing the "maelstrom" he caused to friends, family, and anyone affected overseas.


"I understand all the responsibility and consequences fall upon my shoulders alone and accept whatever that will bring," he said, standing as he addressed the judge. 


Afterward, Teixeira hugged one of his attorneys and looked toward his family and smiled before he was led out of court. 


The security breach raised alarm over America's ability to protect its most closely guarded secrets and forced the Biden administration to scramble to try to contain the diplomatic and military fallout. The leaks embarrassed the Pentagon, which tightened controls to safeguard classified information and disciplined members found to have intentionally failed to take required action about Teixeira's suspicious behavior. 


Earlier in Tuesday's hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jared Dolan argued that 200 months — or a little more than 16 1/2 years — was appropriate given the "historic" damage caused by Teixeira's conduct that aided adversaries of the United States and hurt the country's allies. He also said that the recommendation by prosecutors would send a message to anyone in the military who might consider similar conduct.  


"It will be a cautionary tale for the men and women in the U.S. military," Dolan said. "They are going to be told this is what happens if you break your promise, if you betray your country. ... They will know the defendant's name. They will know the sentence the court imposes." 


But Teixeira's attorney Michael Bachrach told the judge in court Tuesday that 11 years was sufficient. 


"It is a significant, harsh and difficult sentence, one that will not be easy to serve," Bachrach said. "It will serve as an extreme deterrent to anyone, particularly young servicemen. That is enough to keep them deterred from committing serious conduct." 


'His intent was to educate'


Teixeira, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, had pleaded guilty in March to six counts of the willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act. That came nearly a year after he was arrested in the most consequential national security leak in years. 


The 22-year-old admitted that he illegally collected some of the nation's most sensitive secrets and shared them with other users on the social media platform Discord. 


When Teixeira pleaded guilty, prosecutors said they would seek a prison term at the high end of the sentencing range. But the defense wrote in their sentencing memorandum earlier that the 11 years is a "serious and adequate to account for deterrence considerations and would be essentially equal to half the life that Jack has lived thus far." 


His attorneys described Teixeira as an autistic, isolated individual who spent most of his time online, especially with his Discord community. They said his actions, though criminal, were never meant to "harm the United States." He also had no prior criminal record. 


"Instead, his intent was to educate his friends about world events to make certain they were not misled by misinformation," the attorneys wrote. "To Jack, the Ukraine war was his generation's World War II or Iraq, and he needed someone to share the experience with." 


Prosecutors, though, had countered that Teixeira does not suffer from an intellectual disability that prevents him from knowing right from wrong. They argued that Teixeira's post-arrest diagnosis as having "mild, high-functioning" autism "is of questionable relevance in these proceedings." 




Teixeira, who was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, worked as a cyber transport systems specialist, which is essentially an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks. He remains in the Air National Guard in an unpaid status, an Air Force official said. 


Authorities said he first typed out classified documents he accessed and then began sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings. Prosecutors also said he tried to cover his tracks before his arrest, and authorities found a smashed tablet, laptop and an Xbox gaming console in a dumpster at his house. 


The leak exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine, including information about troop movements in Ukraine, and the provision of supplies and equipment to Ukrainian troops. Teixeira also admitted posting information about a U.S. adversary's plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas.

## Economists wonder whether Trump will follow through on campaign vows

date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has left little question about the sort of economic policies he will pursue when he is sworn in for a second term as president in January.


The once-and-future president has promised to extend existing tax cuts and implement new ones; to pursue a deregulation agenda, particularly when it comes to energy production; to reinstate a strong protectionist trade policy, including substantial tariffs on imports; and to undertake a "mass deportation" program that would remove a large number of the millions of undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States.


While there may be little doubt about the kind of policies Trump will implement, the degree to which he will pursue them is an open question.


"The problem that all economists are dealing with is they don't know how much of what Trump said on the campaign trail to take seriously," Steven B. Kamin, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told VOA. "They don't know if he's going to do a lot of these things, or if he is, how far he'll take it."


When it comes to tariffs, Trump has promised across-the-board 10%-20% levies on all imports, and charges of up to 60% on goods coming from China, which experts warn would be economically ruinous.


His rhetoric about fossil fuel extraction suggests he will drive up oil and gas production, even though the U.S. is currently producing more energy than it ever has.


On immigration, he and his advisers have vacillated between suggesting that all undocumented people will be forcibly removed and describing a much more targeted operation.


Tax policy 


One thing that appears certain is that Trump will work with Congress — which seems likely to be fully controlled by the Republican Party — to extend the tax cuts that became law as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which he signed into law in 2017.


Those tax cuts reduced the income taxes paid by many American workers and reduced taxable income by increasing the standard deduction. They also sharply cut the top business income tax bracket from 39% to 21%. Those provisions are all scheduled to expire over the next several years, some as soon as 2025, and Trump has proposed making them permanent.


Trump has also floated the idea of other tax cuts, including further reducing the business income tax to a maximum of 15%, and making income from overtime wages, tips and Social Security payments nontaxable, all of which would reduce government revenues.


Kamin said the stimulative impact of Trump's proposed additional tax changes would likely not be great, but the impact on the country's debt might be, because they will virtually guarantee additional government borrowing to finance deficit spending.


"The real concern for folks that are concerned about the fiscal balance — and I'm one of them — is that by cementing in place large fiscal deficits as far as the eye can see, even in environments of strong economic activity when we should be running surpluses, that leads to increases in the debt," he said.


"That, eventually, should lead to crowding out of private investment, rising interest rates, and more worries about the government's sustainability position," Kamin added. "But when the debt will reach a level that will be worrisome in that respect, nobody knows."


Cost-cutting 


In theory, some of the deficit spending made necessary by large tax cuts could be offset by a reduction in government spending, something Trump has also floated on the campaign trail.


In particular, the president-elect has proposed creating a Department of Government Efficiency, to be headed by Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of the electric car company Tesla and the rocket builder SpaceX, and the owner of X, the social network formerly known as Twitter.


For his part, Musk has mused that it should be possible to slash federal spending by as much as $2 trillion per year, or about 30%.


Reductions of that magnitude would require deep cuts to a vast array of programs, including elements of the social safety net such as Social Security and federal health programs like Medicaid. However, it is unclear how Trump would persuade even a Republican Congress to enact such a wide-ranging reduction in government services.


Immigration policy 


If Trump follows through on a policy of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, it is virtually certain to have a negative impact on economic sectors where they are present as laborers in significant concentrations, especially agriculture and construction, said Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.


"If you take lots of people out of the labor force, you reduce the amount of output, because there's less labor available, and you raise prices," Noland told VOA.


"These people are not distributed evenly across the United States economy," he said. "They're concentrated in agriculture and construction, so you would disrupt those sectors the most, especially if you combine it with tariffs."


Trade policy 


Trump's tariff proposals, especially if he follows through with his maximalist proposals from the campaign trail, could be significantly damaging. While theoretically meant to stimulate American manufacturing, Noland warned that they could have the opposite effect.


"Some modeling that I worked on suggest that those tariff policies, instead of reviving the industrial sector, will actually reduce industrial activity in the United States," he warned.


Blanket tariffs on imports, and especially high levies on Chinese goods, would create severe challenges for U.S. manufacturers.


"The reason is that you would increase the price of industrial inputs, and so, the United States would become a high-cost place to produce," he said. "Investment would fall — and investment is intensive in industrial materials — so, ironically, it has the opposite effect of what its proponents say."

## After Trump's reelection, calls grow to renew US focus on Uyghur rights

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory, leaders in the Uyghur American community are advocating for renewed U.S. attention on human rights abuses in Xinjiang in northwest China, where Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have reportedly faced severe repression.


Advocates urge Trump to continue his administration’s previous measures against China, citing the impact of his first-term policies on Uyghur rights.


During Trump’s first term, his administration formally labeled China’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, leading to sanctions on Chinese officials and entities connected with alleged abuses, including mass detentions, forced labor and sterilizations. China has consistently denied accusations of abuses against ethnic minorities, asserting its policies aim to combat extremism and terrorism.


Nury Turkel, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, pointed to the bipartisan support for Uyghur rights, underscoring that these concerns resonate across both U.S. legislative and executive branches.


“[Uyghur rights] concerns extend beyond typical human rights issues. They have profound national security implications tied to America’s long-term economic and strategic security,” Turkel told VOA.


Turkel expressed cautious optimism that Trump’s new administration will build on its previous actions, referencing the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act and the genocide designation.


“I am optimistic that the incoming administration will take concrete steps to address these urgent concerns affecting Uyghurs, as it had previously,” he said.


VOA contacted the Trump campaign for a comment regarding the new administration’s plans for Uyghur rights in China but did not receive a response at the time of publication.


Renewed calls for action


Uyghur American leaders plan to press Trump’s administration to bolster sanctions on Chinese officials and entities involved in abuses against Uyghurs, with the hope of strengthening the U.S. response.


“I anticipate that the Trump administration will impose additional sanctions on Chinese officials and entities responsible for atrocity crimes against the Uyghurs, potentially strengthening U.S. efforts to confront these abuses,” Turkel added.


Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Washington-based Campaign for Uyghurs, emphasized the need for strict enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act of 2021.




“Uyghurs are enduring a genocide, and Americans should know that addressing the genocide of Uyghurs is not just a foreign policy matter; it’s about preventing the U.S. from becoming complicit through the consumption of Chinese products tainted by forced labor,” Abbas told VOA. “[I]t’s about stopping China from using Americans’ hard-earned money to fuel their imperial ambitions and undermine the United States, and rejecting foreign intimidation on U.S. soil.”


Salih Hudayar, prime minister of the Washington-based East Turkistan Government in Exile, echoed these sentiments, urging the Trump administration to formally recognize the region — referred to as Xinjiang by China but called East Turkistan by many Uyghurs —as an occupied nation.


“An independent East Turkistan would directly challenge China’s ambitions for dominance across Central Asia and the Indo-Pacific, safeguarding American and broader global interests,” Hudayar told VOA. He suggested appointing a special coordinator for Uyghur issues to demonstrate U.S. support for Uyghur rights and those of other minorities in the region.


Current policy challenges


Despite calls for stronger actions, Uyghur American advocates remain concerned that economic and strategic interests with China may take precedence. Turkel highlighted that various advocacy groups have influenced the U.S. response to Uyghur issues in recent years.


“Climate activists have lobbied for closer cooperation with China on environmental initiatives; pro-engagement China watchers have advocated a softer, more conciliatory approach to 'lower the temperature' in U.S.-China relations; and business interests have warned of the economic risks of escalating tensions, pushing for policies that protect U.S.-China trade relations,” he said. “These pressures have contributed to a more nuanced stance and a quieter approach to human rights and Uyghur-related policies.”


Turkel added, “While steps like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act were commendable [during the Biden administration], the focus on Uyghur rights has often been eclipsed by broader geopolitical priorities,” pointing to how shifting U.S. economic priorities have impacted the response.


Addressing transnational repression


In addition to actions on Uyghur rights, Uyghur American leaders are urging the Trump administration to address transnational repression by China, specifically targeting covert operations that intimidate Uyghur Americans on U.S. soil.


“The administration should take immediate steps to multiply the efforts to counter transnational repression by Chinese authorities, particularly targeting the presence of covert Chinese police stations and agents who monitor and intimidate Uyghur Americans and China dissidents in the U.S.,” Abbas said.


Abbas noted Trump’s efforts in securing hostage releases in his first term, urging him to prioritize Uyghur detainees held in China.


“China continues to detain Uyghur [American] family members and community leaders as a tactic to silence Uyghurs abroad … with many forced to self-censor to protect their families,” she said, advocating for strong U.S. efforts to secure their release and end repression tactics targeting Uyghurs in the diaspora.

## New Lawsuit Threatens Michigan’s Permitting Reform Law

date: 2024-11-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDQ5MDI4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTAzMDE4Nn0.4xKB3Fx3LkwbPR_zaJZQMAPnPpSCbKaEAyDU73UOqv8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>The most important legal challenge for the renewables industry in America may have just been filed in Michigan. </p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, about 70 towns and a handful of Michigan counties appealed the rule implementing part of a new renewable energy siting law – PA 233 – providing primary permitting authority to the Michigan Public Services Commission and usurping local approval powers in specific cases, Heatmap can first report. The law was part of a comprehensive permitting package passed last year by the state legislature and <a href="https://graham.umich.edu/project/MI-energy-siting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seen by climate advocates</u></a> as a <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/states-renewable-energy-permitting-siting-incentives-wind-solar/724815/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>potential model for combatting NIMBYs</u></a> across the country.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mi-psc.my.site.com/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/068cs00000LJypEAAT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>appeal</u></a> challenges multiple aspects of the law’s implementation, saying it went beyond statute, as well as the rulemaking procedure itself, claiming it failed to follow proper processes. The lawsuit aims to effectively undo the law going into effect, or at least enjoin what opponents say are the most onerous restrictions on municipalities and county governments. </p>
<p>Some of the places involved in the litigation have solar, wind, or battery storage proposed in their backyards. But while it’s certainly the case that some opponents may just want to stop projects from being built, one of the attorneys behind the litigation – Michael Homier at Michigan law firm Foster Swift – told me the case represents how these laws inflame broader tensions between communities and their governments.</p>
<p>“[Renewables have] to be sited appropriately, because each community has unique priorities and circumstances that relate to them,” Homier said. “I think what it says is that local voices matter and when you try and implement policy on a one-size fits all approach with all of these local communities, they don’t like it.”</p>
<p>Local control laws like Michigan’s exist because, well, climate change is an imperative that calls for rapid action. Delays stemming from dissent at the municipal or county level can totally gum up the works, as we’ve shown you time and time again. Michigan’s no <a href="https://thecitizenonline.com/groveland-twp-pc-oks-battery-storage-ordinance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stranger to this problem</u></a>. Opponents of the Michigan law sought to repeal it via ballot initiative before the lawsuit was filed, but that effort failed, and some ballot petition backers have since <a href="https://www.michiganpublic.org/politics-government/2024-10-18/group-against-renewable-energy-law-violated-campaign-finance-laws-says-mich-secretary-of-state" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gotten a campaign finance complaint</u></a>. </p>
<p>But it’s important to note these laws feel like shots to the heart of small-d <em><em>democracy, </em></em>and the notion of locally-controlled land use planning, too. As these policies become a go-to for anxious Democratic politicians trying to get shovels into the ground to bring down carbon emissions, one should hardly expect towns and counties to take it lying down. </p>
<p>Take Maryland, where legislators have sought to pass bills similar to Michigand’s. Despite the state’s ambitious climate goals, the Maryland Association of Counties has vociferously opposed bills to <a href="https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2024/03/01/counties-object-to-total-abandonment-of-marylands-environmental-justice-principles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ban counties and towns</u></a> from setting ordinances that restrict renewable development and let community-scale solar advance <a href="https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2024/03/08/counties-oppose-narrowed-state-only-approval-for-energy-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>without strenuous local review</u></a>. Or take New Jersey, where <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-jersey-offshore-wind-project-new-law-bypass-local-approval/amp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>transmission cables</u></a> for offshore wind <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/atlantic-shores-transmission-opposition" target="_self"><u>may produce</u></a> similar litigation to what’s in Michigan, testing the constitutionality of the state’s local control law. </p>
<p>In Michigan, it’ll take upwards of a year or two for the case to wind its way through court proceedings. Until then, we’ll pour one out for any developer or climate wonk who thought that the state's stab at “permitting reform” was going to help. </p>

## How could US-China rivalry in Africa play out under Trump 2.0?

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

Johannesburg     — President-elect Donald Trump talked tough on China during his campaign, vowing to impose higher and sweeping tariffs on imports from the Asian giant. Beijing will now also be closely watching the incoming administration’s movements further afield, in Africa, where U.S.-China rivalry is high.


Experts disagree on what a second Trump term will mean for Beijing’s ambitions on the continent, with some saying it could be a boon for China – Africa’s biggest trade partner – if the U.S. pursues an isolationist, “America First” agenda that mostly ignores the region.


But Tibor Nagy, who served as Trump’s Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs from 2018 to 2021 has a different perspective. He said Trump grasped how powerful a player China had become on the continent.


“It was the Trump administration that was the first to kind of recognize the existential threat that China poses,” Nagy told VOA.

“We were on the front lines of that in Africa, and we saw what the Chinese were doing,” said Nagy, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to Guinea and Ethiopia during the administrations of presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.


Nagy told VOA he does not think the incoming Republican administration will neglect Africa because it sees China as a threat to U.S interests there. He also said the continent is a major source of critical minerals attractive to both superpowers.


Nagy credits the first Trump administration with introducing policies on the continent intended to counter China's influence.


“We had … the right focus because we made it about the youth. You know, our premise was that Africa is going to be undergoing a youth tsunami with the population doubling by 2050. And that more than anything, what the youth really wanted was jobs,” he said.


To this end, Nagy says, the first Trump administration set up Prosper Africa in 2018, an initiative designed to assist American companies doing business in Africa, and he expects the incoming administration will remain engaged there.


“Africa remains very much the front lines,” he said. “The United States is extremely concerned about our strategic minerals, and when a hostile power has a lock on strategic minerals, that's really not very good when you need the strategic minerals for your top-end technology and for weapon systems.”


But Christian-Geraud Neema, Africa editor for the China-Global South Project, is skeptical and said a second term for Trump could be an opportunity for Beijing.


“Looking at his first term, Trump didn't show much interest in Africa, which is likely to be the case still now,” he told VOA. “Only a few countries will matter — countries whose resources or position matter to the U.S. national security interests.”


“China will have room to maneuver and increase its influence in so many ways,” he added.


Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, echoed this.


“I doubt that Africa will be a featured priority for Trump,” she told VOA in an emailed response, adding that the United States’ absence on the continent “will boost the prominence of the Chinese position by its presence.”


Lobito corridor future


Views on how successfully President Joe Biden’s administration has engaged with Africa are also mixed. Many analysts said regardless of whether the Democrats or the Republicans are in office, the continent is usually an afterthought in U.S. foreign policy, which does not differ much from one administration to the next.


The current administration said it was “all in on Africa,” when Biden hosted dozens of heads of state at his first African Leaders Summit in 2022, an event seen as an attempt at reasserting U.S. influence in the face of a rising China.


Yet, “African leaders or the African Union were not consulted about the agenda of the 2022 US-Africa Leaders Summit. This was also the case with the US’s Africa strategy,” wrote Christopher Isike, the director of African Centre for the Study of the United States at the University of Pretoria, in an article co-signed by Samuel Oyewole, political science postdoctoral research fellow at the university


While Trump never traveled to Africa as president, top Biden administration officials did visit the continent, including the vice president. Biden is also expected to travel to Angola before the end of his term in December.


Under Biden, the U.S. agreed to develop the Lobito Corridor and Zambia-Lobito rail line, a project described by the State Department as “the most significant transport infrastructure that the United States has helped develop on the African continent in a generation.”


The rail line is seen as part of a transcontinental vision connecting the Atlantic and Indian oceans.


The undertaking is to be financed through a joint agreement calling for the U.S., African Development Bank, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and the European Union to support Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zambia.




Observers see it as an attempt to compete with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s global infrastructure project the Belt and Road Initiative, which has built railways, ports and roads across Africa.


There is concern among some analysts that Trump could pull back from this.


“Existing bilateral and multilateral business partnerships … such as the Lobito Corridor … might wane significantly during the next Trump administration,” said Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian analyst with the Institute for Security Studies, in an email to VOA.


“When that happens China will gain significant mileage in areas where the US Government’s exit creates a vacuum on the continent,” he added.


But Nagy disagreed, saying the Lobito Corridor is the “kind of project which would have come right out of the Trump administration.”


Therefore, there’s likely to be continuity, he added, noting: “The deal is done. Again, I can't speak for President Trump, or the people who are going to be coming in … but it's logical.”


‘Other Friends’


When asked how African leaders will navigate the next Trump administration, Sun said they could play the U.S. and China against each other.


“Africa could highlight its role in the US-China great power competition in order to strengthen its position in the US grand strategy,” she said in an email to VOA.


But she is doubtful African leaders will take that route because it “will carry the effect of being forced to choose, which I doubt that Africa will want to do.”


However, at least one African politician has already alluded to this option.


Kenya’s Raila Odinga, who is in the running to take over as chair of the African Union Commission next year, was blunt in his assessment of how African governments would handle a more isolationist U.S. under Trump.


“If he does not want to work with Africa,” Odinga told Agence France-Presse last week, “Africa has got other friends.”

## Trump’s Other Big Threat to Renewables

date: 2024-11-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDQ3MDEyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTIxNzAxMH0.Ev8y-McfZHoxV4sFbxwuvh-y1gSk0dYn9_EEA4NfUsw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts were supposed to be a 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy" target="_blank">bonanza</a> for the clean energy business. Renewables, with their high upfront costs compared to their costs of operating (the “fuel” — i.e. the wind and the sun — is free), are especially sensitive to the cost of borrowing money. When rates go up, it becomes more difficult for projects to hit the profitability targets necessary to lure investors without jacking up prices for customers beyond the realm of the possible. When rates comes down — which the Fed has been working on doing since September — suddenly those investments start to look a lot more appealing.
</p><p>
	But there’s more to financing costs than the Fed. There’s also the president.
</p><p>
	While much of the focus on Donald Trump’s electoral victory has been trying to discern what a Republican trifecta could do to the Inflation Reduction Act, Trump’s effect on the bond market may be just as important. We may still living in 
	<a href="https://policyexchange.org.uk/blogs/beware-the-bond-markets/" target="_blank">James Carville’s world</a>, where the bond market can “intimidate everybody.” And it’s rearing its head against the president-reelect.
</p><p>
	Since Trump came to be seen as the likely winner in the months before election day, yields on U.S. government debt — that is, the returns bondholders and issuers have to offer to entice investors — began to shoot up. Interpreting moves in the bond market is always tricky, but many market commentators interpreted the recent run-up as at least in part a reaction to Trump, whether they thought he was going to juice economic growth or stoke inflation, or some combination of the two.
</p><p>
	“If Trump is proposing a broadly inflationary high-tariff, low-tax agenda, anyone expecting inflation is looking for a higher return,” explained  Advait Arun, a climate and infrastructure finance analyst at the Center for Public Enterprise.
</p><p>
	Each of these policies — high tariffs and low taxes — could have an inflationary effect. Tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices (especially the kind of 
	<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/tariffs-donald-trump-strategy/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broad-based tariffs</a> Trump has proposed) while tax cuts act as stimulus by keeping more cash in the economy. Combined with higher defense spending and a reduced labor force if Trump follows through on his plan for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/12/mexico-trump-mass-deportation/" target="_blank">mass deportations</a>, the whole policy agenda could wind up reversing some of the progress the economy has made recovering from the high inflation of the immediate post-COVID period, or at least make it so the Federal Reserve sees no further need to cut interest rates.
</p><p>
	“Tariffs, especially if universally placed on all imports, is broadly viewed as an inflationary policy, which may pose a risk to the outlook for lower interest rates,” Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Perocco wrote in a note to clients. “All else equal, higher rates are seen as a headwind for the renewable energy sector due to higher financing costs.”
</p><p>
	Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, a widely used benchmark throughout the global economy, were sitting at around 3.6% in mid-September when the Fed began cutting rates, but had risen to 4.36% the week before the election. Yields shot up again last week 
	<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-07/us-yield-spike-sends-message-to-trump-bond-vigilantes-are-awake" target="_blank">after Trump’s win</a>, which confirmed the market’s suspicion that his inflationary plans will be realized. Today they’re around 4.43% and rising.
</p><p>
	“Interest rates are moving higher in much the same way they did when he won in 2016,” aid Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America told me. “There’s a Trump trade people do — the dollar gets stronger, interest rates are higher.” These policies may be “more stimulative to the economy on some level,” and in turn, “maybe this means the Fed is more cautious about lowering interest rates.”
</p><p>
	The market certainly seems to think Trump will run the economy hot. Expectations for where the federal funds rate could end up by the end of 2025 have risen from 
	<a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/falling-interest-rates-alone-may-not-imminently-boost-investments-in-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"><u>3% in September to about 3.8%</u></a>, Gautam Jain, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. Several analysts <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/wall-street-fed-watchers-dial-back-2025-rate-cut-expectations" target="_blank"><u>have scaled back their forecasts</u></a> for the number of future Federal Reserve rate cuts next after the Fed lowered rates by another quarter percentage point last week. Yields on two-year Treasury notes, which are considered to be highly sensitive to expectations of Federal Reserve action, have risen from 3.55% in mid-September to 4.34% today, the highest level since July.
</p><p>
	And sustained high rates mean sustained high costs for renewable energy companies. Jain had previously estimated that a 2 percentage point drop in the cost of debt would lower offshore wind costs by as much as $10 per megawatt-hour and utility-scale solar by as much as
	<strong> </strong>$12 per megawatt-hour, which would help make them more competitive even in the absence of federal subsidies. If the cost of capital stays high, that potential boost goes away.
</p><p>
	“For renewables, they are more capital intensive, so they are more impacted” by rising rates, Jain told me.  “The headwind will hurt them more.”
</p><p>
	Bipartisan budget watchdogs have been skeptical of Trump’s policies, 
	typically projecting 
	<a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans" target="_blank">larger deficit increases</a> than would have arisen from the policy agenda of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. That said, not everyone is worried.
</p><p style="">
	The hedge-fund investor Scott Bessent, 
	<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/key-advisers-to-trump-back-bessent-for-treasury-secretary" target="_blank">widely tipped</a> to be Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/possible-trump-pick-for-treasury-lays-out-3-point-economic-plan-that-calls-for-deregulation-lower-deficit-b9a1e4c7" target="_blank">has been promoting a “3-3-3” plan</a> — deficits reduced to 3% of gross domestic product from around 7% currently by the end of Trump’s term; annual growth kicked up to 3% from around 2.8% today; and oil production increased by 3 million barrels, all of which could allow the Federal Reserve to bring down rates.
</p><p style="">
	Trump “understands financial markets and the bond markets. He would not want deficits to get out of control,” Stephen Miran, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and former Trump Treasury official told me. “There's a lot of focus to rein that in.”

## Jury awards Abu Ghraib detainees $42 million, holds contractor responsible

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A U.S. jury on Tuesday awarded $42 million to three former detainees of Iraq's notorious Abu Ghraib prison, holding a Virginia-based military contractor responsible for contributing to their torture and mistreatment two decades ago. 


The decision from the eight-person jury came after a different jury earlier this year couldn't agree on whether Reston, Virginia-based CACI should be held liable for the work of its civilian interrogators who worked alongside the U.S. Army at Abu Ghraib in 2003 and 2004. 


The jury awarded plaintiffs Suhail Al Shimari, Salah Al-Ejaili and Asa'ad Al-Zubae $3 million each in compensatory damages and $11 million each in punitive damages. 


The three testified that they were subjected to beatings, sexual abuse, forced nudity and other cruel treatment at the prison. 


They did not allege that CACI's interrogators explicitly inflicted the abuse themselves, but argued CACI was complicit because its interrogators conspired with military police to "soften up" detainees for questioning with harsh treatment. 


CACI's lawyer, John O'Connor, did not comment after Tuesday's verdict on whether the company would appeal. 


Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which filed the lawsuit on the plaintiffs' behalf, called the verdict "an important measure of Justice and accountability" and praised the three plaintiffs for their resilience, "especially in the face of all the obstacles CACI threw their way." 


The $42 million fully matches the amount sought by the plaintiffs, Azmy said. 


"Today is a big day for me and for justice," said Al-Ejaili, a journalist, in a written statement. "I've waited a long time for this day. This victory isn't only for the three plaintiffs in this case against a corporation. This victory is a shining light for everyone who has been oppressed and a strong warning to any company or contractor practicing different forms of torture and abuse." 




Al-Ejaili traveled to the U.S. for both trials to testify in person. The other two plaintiffs testified by video from Iraq. 


The trial and subsequent retrial were the first time a U.S. jury heard claims brought by Abu Ghraib survivors in the 20 years since photos of detainee mistreatment — accompanied by smiling U.S. soldiers inflicting the abuse — shocked the world during the U.S. occupation of Iraq. 


None of the three plaintiffs were in any of the notorious photos shown in news reports around the world, but they described treatment very similar to what was depicted. 


Al Shimari described sexual assaults and beatings during his two months at the prison. He also said he was electrically shocked and dragged around the prison by a rope tied around his neck. Al-Ejaili said he was subjected to stress positions that caused him to vomit black liquid. He was also deprived of sleep, forced to wear women's underwear and threatened with dogs. 


CACI had argued it wasn't complicit in the detainees' abuse. It said its employees had minimal interaction with the three plaintiffs in the case, and CACI questioned parts of the plaintiffs' stories, saying that military records contradict some of their claims and suggesting they shaded their stories to support a case against the contractor. Fundamentally, though, CACI argued that any liability for their mistreatment belonged to the government. 


As in the first trial, the jury struggled to decide whether CACI or the Army should be held responsible for any misconduct by CACI interrogators. The jury asked questions in its deliberations about whether the contractor or the Army bore liability. 


CACI, as one of its defenses, argued it shouldn't be liable for any misdeeds by its employees if they were under the control and direction of the Army, under a legal principle known as the "borrowed servants" doctrine. 


Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that CACI was responsible for its own employees' misdeeds. They said provisions in CACI's contract with the Army, as well as the Army Field Manual, make clear that CACI is responsible for overseeing its own workers. 


The lawsuit was first filed in 2008 but was delayed by 15 years of legal wrangling and multiple attempts by CACI to have the case dismissed. 


Lawyers for the three plaintiffs argued that CACI was liable for their mistreatment even if they couldn't prove that CACI's interrogators were the ones who directly inflicted the abuse. 


The evidence included reports from two retired Army generals, who documented the abuse and concluded that multiple CACI interrogators were complicit in the abuse. 


Those reports concluded that one of the interrogators, Steven Stefanowicz, lied to investigators about his conduct and that he likely instructed soldiers to mistreat detainees and used dogs to intimidate detainees during interrogations. 


Stefanowicz testified for CACI at trial through a recorded video deposition and denied mistreating detainees.

## Trump picks key political loyalists for top jobs

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is moving quickly to fill his nascent administration with Republican officials who have been the most politically loyal to him in the four years he was out of office.


Trump, according to various U.S. news accounts, intends to nominate Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, the country’s top diplomat, but that announcement has yet to be made.


On Tuesday night, he announced South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as his choice for Homeland Security chief. Other Cabinet-level picks announced Tuesday night include Pete Hegseth as the head of the Department of Defense, and John Ratcliffe as the director of the CIA.


Both Rubio and Noem were on Trump’s short list of possible vice presidential running mates several months ago. While Trump later picked first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, to join him on the Republican national ticket, both Rubio and Noem remained Trump stalwarts as he easily won the election last week over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.


Ratcliffe was the nation’s sixth Director of National Intelligence, serving for the last eight months of the Trump administration after a rocky confirmation process. Hegseth is a veteran and a Fox News host.


Trump also announced that billionaire businessman Elon Musk and entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead what he called the Department of Government Efficiency. The announcement said they would provide advice and guidance to “drive large-scale structural reform” of the federal government.


Trump also announced on Tuesday that he has chosen William McGinley as White House counsel.


Trump also has settled on Michael Waltz, a Florida congressman, as his national security adviser. Waltz earlier this year supported a long-shot Republican legislative effort to rename Washington's international airport for Trump.


Trump on Monday also named Thomas Homan, his former acting immigration chief, to be his "border czar" to head efforts to deport undocumented migrants living in the U.S., possibly millions, back to their home countries. News accounts reported that Stephen Miller, another vocal anti-migrant adviser who served in Trump's first term, would be named as Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy.


The president-elect picked another ardent supporter, Elise Stefanik, a New York congresswoman, as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He nominated former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee to be ambassador to Israel.


Just ahead of the election, Trump, who only rarely publicly admits making any mistakes, told podcaster Joe Rogan that his biggest error during his term from 2017 to 2021 was hiring "bad people, or disloyal people."


"I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked," he said.


Some of the top officials Trump chose then, including former chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton, became sharp public Trump critics after he ousted them. Kelly said during this year's campaign that Trump met the definition of a fascist ruler. Trump attacked both former officials, calling Kelly "a bully but a weak person" and disparaging Bolton as "an idiot."


Ahead of the election, Bolton said, "What Trump will look for in senior nominees in a second term is fealty. He wants 'yes men' and 'yes women.'"


Rubio sparred sharply with Trump during their 2016 run for the Republican presidential nomination, which Trump captured enroute to his first term as president. Rubio mocked Trump as having small hands and sporting an orange spray tan, while Trump derided Rubio as "little Marco."


But Rubio, like numerous other one-time Trump critics, was a staunch Trump supporter in this year's campaign. In recent years, Rubio has proved to be an outspoken foreign policy hawk, taking hard lines on U.S. relations with China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba.


He has at times been at odds with Republicans who were skeptical about U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, such as helping to fund Ukraine's fight against Russia's 2022 invasion. But more recently, he voted against sending more U.S. military aid to Ukraine, while Trump has also voiced skepticism about the extent of U.S. assistance to Kyiv.


Rubio told NBC News in September, "I think the Ukrainians have been, such incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia. But at the end of the day, what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set back 100 years."


"I'm not on Russia's side — but unfortunately, the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement," Rubio said.


Noem rose to national prominence and won conservative plaudits after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.


Trump was reportedly considering her as his vice-presidential running mate. But she faced widespread criticism and fell in the stakes to be Trump's No. 2 in April when she wrote in a memoir that she shot to death an "untrainable" dog that she "hated" on her family farm.


Waltz is a former Army Green Beret who shares Trump's views on illegal immigration and skepticism of America's continued support for Ukraine.


Waltz, who also has served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and said the United States needs to be ready for a potential conflict in the region.


Just as notable as Trump's initial selections are two former officials he has rejected for top jobs in his new administration: Nikki Haley, his former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Haley ran against Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and Pompeo considered opposing Trump before backing off.


Trump is heading to Washington on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election, about the transfer of power when Trump is inaugurated on January 20. Trump is also planning to meet with Republicans in the House of Representatives.

## Federal judge blocks Louisiana law that requires classrooms to display Ten Commandments

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — A new Louisiana law that requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public classroom by Jan. 1 has been temporarily blocked after a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Tuesday. 


The judge said the law is "unconstitutional on its face" and plaintiffs are likely to win their case with claims that the law violates the First Amendment. 


The ruling marks a win for opponents of the law, who argue that it is a violation of the separation of church and state and that the poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. Proponents say that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. 


U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles in Baton Rouge issued the order in an ongoing lawsuit filed by a group of parents of Louisiana public school children. They say that the legislation violates First Amendment language forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty. 


The new law in Louisiana, a reliably Republican state that is ensconced in the Bible Belt, was passed by the state's Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year. 


The legislation, which has been touted by Republicans including President-elect Donald Trump,  is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms — from Florida legislation allowing school districts to have volunteer chaplains to counsel students to Oklahoma's top education official ordering public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons. 


In recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, none have gone into effect. 


In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can "make no law respecting an establishment of religion." The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose. 


Louisiana's legislation, which applies to all public K-12 school and state-funded university classrooms, requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed on a poster or framed document at least 28 by 36 centimeters where the text is the central focus and "printed in a large, easily readable font." 


Each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph "context statement" describing how the Ten Commandments "were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries." 


Tens of thousands of posters would likely be needed to satisfy the new law. Proponents say that schools are not required to spend public money on the posters, and instead that they can be bought using donations or that groups and organizations will donate the actual posters.

## Climate change is front of mind for homebuyers

date: 2024-11-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>According to new research from Zillow, nearly 90% of would-be homebuyers say it&#8217;s important to find a house with at least one &#8220;climate-resilient feature,&#8221; like a flood barrier, seismic retrofitting or a water catchment system. More listings are starting to highlight those features, too. But first: what a stronger dollar means for the U.S. economy and where bitcoin prices stand after the election.</p>

## Supreme Court rejects push to move Georgia case against ex-Trump chief of staff Meadows

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to let former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows move the election interference case against him in Georgia to federal court. 


Meadows was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia and accused of participating in an illegal scheme to keep then-president Donald Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election. Trump was also charged, though after he won reelection last week to a second term any trial appears unlikely, at least while he holds office. Both men have denied wrongdoing. 


It's unclear what effect the election results could have on others charged in the case, which is largely on hold after an appeals court agreed to review whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had hired to lead the case. 


Meadows had gone to the Supreme Court in an effort to move the charges out of Georgia courts. He argues the case belongs in federal court because it relates to his duties as a federal official, and he pointed to the Supreme Court ruling giving Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution to support his argument. 


"A White House chief of staff facing criminal charges based on actions relating to his work for the president of the United States should not be a close call — especially now that this court has recognized that federal immunity impacts what evidence can be considered, not just what conduct can form the basis for liability," his attorneys wrote. 


But prosecutors said that Meadows failed to show he was carrying out official duties during the alleged scheme, including participating in a phone call where Trump suggested Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could help "find" votes he needed to win the state. 


They argued the case should stay with Georgia courts, and Meadows can raise immunity defenses there. Prosecutors also pushed back against the contention that the charges could have ripple effects on other federal officials. 


"His references to the overheated words of opinion editorials cannot suffice to demonstrate that a new era of ubiquitous prosecution of former federal officials is at hand," government attorneys wrote. 


A U.S. district judge and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled that the case against Meadows and some of his co-defendants should remain in state court. A federal judge has also refused to move an Arizona fake elector case against him there to federal court. 


Four people have already pleaded guilty in the Georgia election case after reaching deals with prosecutors. The remaining 15, including Trump and Meadows, have pleaded not guilty.

## Judge delays ruling on whether to scrap Trump's conviction in hush money case

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

New York — A judge is postponing a decision on whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump's conviction in his hush money case because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.


New York Judge Juan M. Merchan had been set to rule Tuesday. Instead, he told Trump's lawyers Tuesday he'd delay the ruling until Nov. 19.


According to emails filed in court, Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked for the delay over the weekend, arguing that putting the case on hold — and then ending it altogether — is “necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.”


Prosecutors agreed to the delay.


Trump won back the White House a week ago but the legal question concerns the Republican's status as a past president, not an impending one.


A jury convicted Trump in May of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in 2016. The payout was to buy her silence about claims that she had sex with Trump.


He says they didn't, denies any wrongdoing and maintains the prosecution was a political tactic meant to harm his latest campaign.


Just over a month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents can't be prosecuted for actions they took in the course of running the country, and prosecutors can't cite those actions even to bolster a case centered on purely personal conduct.


Trump's lawyers cited the ruling to argue that the hush money jury got some evidence it shouldn't have, such as Trump's presidential financial disclosure form and testimony from some White House aides.


Prosecutors disagreed and said the evidence in question was only "a sliver" of their case.


Trump's criminal conviction was a first for any ex-president. It left the 78-year-old facing the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison.


The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal attorney for the Daniels payment.


The lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it through a series of payments that Trump's company logged as legal expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks himself.


Prosecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first campaign.


Trump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and that Daniels' story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump's family, not to influence the electorate.


Trump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office.


Trump has been fighting for months to overturn the verdict and could now seek to leverage his status as president-elect. Although he was tried as a private citizen, his forthcoming return to the White House could propel a court to step in and avoid the unprecedented spectacle of sentencing a former and future president.


While urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also has been trying to move the case to federal court. Before the election, a federal judge repeatedly said no to the move, but Trump has appealed.

## What to Know About Shell’s Big Court Victory

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>The Philippines is bracing for another major storm, the fifth in under a month • Warnings are in place for Guam as Tropical Storm Man-Yi approaches • It is about 60 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny in Washington, D.C., where Congress is back in session.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Shell wins appeal to overturn landmark emissions ruling</h3><p>
	A Dutch court has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-wins-appeal-against-landmark-dutch-climate-ruling-2024-11-12/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overturned</a> a 2021 ruling that ordered oil giant Shell to significantly curb its greenhouse gas emissions. The decision is a “big set back for efforts to use the courts to compel companies to transition faster,” <a href="https://x.com/thomas_m_wilson/status/1856249474454061443?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Tom Wilson, an energy correspondent with the <em><em>Financial Times</em></em>. The original ruling, issued by a lower court in a case brought by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens, said Shell had to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. The landmark decision marked the first time a court ordered a private company to align its efforts with the goals of the Paris Agreement. But Shell appealed, arguing that it was already working to reduce its emissions (aiming for a 15-20% reduction by 2030 compared to 2016), that it can’t be held responsible for how customers use its products, and that such rules should be made by governments, not courts. “The Dutch court case may serve as a bellwether, with potential ripple effects on future decisions across the region,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/shell-wins-appeal-in-latest-dutch-court-ruling-over-emissions?srnd=phx-green&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>. The case could go to the Dutch Supreme Court, but it would likely take years to play out.
</p><h3>2. A few updates from COP29</h3><p>
	It’s day two of the COP29 climate summit in Baku. Yesterday began with “more than nine hours of backroom bickering over what should be on the agenda,” <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-cop29-opening-da9c05754b766dc868d09cd7116826ba?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. But even so, there has been some noteworthy progress:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Negotiators yesterday agreed on rules for international carbon markets</strong>. The agreement could provide a mechanism for rich countries to help fund adaptation efforts to the tune of some $250 billion annually. Some hailed the decision as a bright spot, while others said it had been rushed and wasn’t scrutinized by all parties. “We are a long way from halving emissions this decade, but this will help get us back in the race,” <a href="https://x.com/simonstiell/status/1856257092513841428?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell.</li>
<li><strong>The U.K. is expected to unveil its updated Nationally Determined Contribution</strong> (NDC) today, becoming one of the first major countries to do so ahead of the February deadline. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/keir-starmer-to-unveil-ambitious-new-uk-climate-goal-cop29-ndc?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> announce a goal of curbing emissions by 81% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels, through decarbonizing the grid and expanding offshore wind, plus carbon capture and storage investments.</li>
</ul><h3>3. Guterres says COP climate finance deal is ‘a must’</h3><p>
	COP figureheads are giving forceful keynote speeches in an attempt to set the tone for the summit at the outset. “The sound you hear is the ticking clock,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/11/12/cop29-baku-azerbaijan-un-climate-conference-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" target="_blank">said</a> UN Secretary General António Guterres. “We are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. And time is not on our side.” He called 2024 a “masterclass in climate destruction,” and urged countries to deliver on their promise to move away from fossil fuels, accelerate the energy transition, and put forward bold NDCs in line with the Paris Agreement. And he said “developing countries must not leave Baku empty-handed. A [climate finance] deal is a must.”
</p><p>
	Ahead of Guterres’ speech, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev slammed Western critics of his country’s fossil fuel industry. As <em><em>Reuters</em></em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/cop29-pay-up-or-face-climate-led-disaster-humanity-warns-un-chief-2024-11-12/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" target="_blank">put it</a>, “the airing of these opposing views on the main stage underscore the challenge at the heart of the climate negotiations: many Western states remain dependent on fossil fuels while at the same time seeking to pressure others who produce them into shifting to greener energy sources.”
</p><h3>4. Trump selects Lee Zeldin to lead EPA</h3><p>
	President-elect Donald Trump tapped former Long Island Congressman and New York Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. In his four terms in Congress as the representative from New York’s easternmost congressional district on Long Island, Zeldin did not cut any particular profile on climate, environment, or energy issues, and was best known for his hawkish foreign policy position, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-epa-lee-zeldin?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" rel="noopener" target="_self">reported Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. To the extent Zeldin has defined himself on the environment beyond standard-issue Republican opposition to restrictions on fossil fuels and car purchasing, it’s been in the context of issues specific to his coastal Long Island constituency. During his 2018 congressional campaign, he pointed to his membership in the “shellfish and national estuary caucuses,” as well as federal programs for estuaries and his opposition to expanded offshore drilling exploration at an event hosted by the League of Conservation Voters. Throughout his surprisingly close run against Kathy Hochul for New York’s governor’s mansion in 2022, Zeldin assailed New York’s ban on fracking and criticized New York’s planned phase-out of sales of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, as well as the proposal to institute congestion pricing in Lower Manhattan.
</p><h3>5. EPA finalizes methane fees for oil and gas sector</h3><p>
	The Biden administration today <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-rule-reduce-wasteful-methane-emissions-and-drive-innovation-oil-and-gas?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" target="_blank">finalized</a> a rule that sets a fee for excessive methane emissions for major oil and gas producers. Fossil fuel operations are the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the U.S., and the Environmental Protection Agency estimates this rule would prevent 1.2 million metric tons of methane emissions through 2035. The new fees start at $900 per metric ton of methane emitted this year, increasing to $1,200 next year, and $1,500 thereafter. The rule is paired with incentives for companies that fix their leaky infrastructure, and mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which CNN <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/climate/methane-rule-biden-trump/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Fyw5U33IciRcyGSa2YM8Jj5gu7yJZ90B113CTDq5tJ_hyQ9oS3YT7MTObZZvYmSHKOaAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> could make it harder for the incoming Trump administration to revoke.

## Blinken heads to Brussels to push for Ukraine aid

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday as Washington looks for ways to “surge” military aid to Ukraine in the final days of President Joe Biden’s term.  


After Brussels, Blinken will proceed to Lima, Peru, for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, followed by stops in Manaus and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for a summit of the 20 largest economies, the G20. He will join Biden in Peru and Brazil.


President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to hold face-to-face talks on Saturday on the sidelines of the APEC summit, a meeting anticipated to last about one-and-a-half hours, according to sources familiar with the plans who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity.


On Wednesday, Blinken will engage in discussions with his NATO and European Union counterparts to coordinate continued support for Ukraine, while President Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House. Officials said Biden will ask Trump not to “walk away” from Ukraine.  


North Korea’s direct support for Russia’s war in Ukraine is expected to be a focal point during Blinken’s discussions with European counterparts and will likely feature on the agenda in talks between U.S. officials and their counterparts at APEC.


Ukraine has reported that North Korean troops are actively engaged in combat operations in Russia’s Kursk region, prompting condemnation from several European nations over the increasing military collaboration between Russia and North Korea.


Meanwhile, Ukraine remained on high alert for air attacks on Monday, with the country’s top military commander reporting that tens of thousands of Russian troops were prepared to advance on Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine seized territory in August this year.




Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told VOA that Trump might attempt to “broker a cease-fire in Ukraine,” a prominent foreign policy pledge he made during his campaign.


Kupchan, however, noted, “It will not be as easy as he promised...  It will take a long time to bring [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to common ground,” as the conflict has stretched on for more than two-and-a-half years.


Trump’s political allies have indicated that the incoming administration will prioritize achieving peace in Ukraine over enabling the country to reclaim Crimea and other territories occupied by Russia.


After the U.S. presidential election, the State Department said that Blinken spoke with his European counterparts. They included the French minister for Europe and foreign affairs, Jean-Noël Barrot, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, and the United Kingdom’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, among others. Officials say talks covered the situation in Ukraine and the implications and threats posed by Russia’s decision to introduce North Korean troops into the war on Ukraine.


Blinken’s coming meetings in Brussels also follow a gathering of European leaders Thursday in Budapest, where they addressed transatlantic relations, support for Ukraine, and other pressing issues in light of Trump’s victory in last week’s U.S. presidential election.

## US will not cut military aid to Israel over Gaza aid

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

The United States said Tuesday that Israel has made limited progress on increasing the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip as Washington requested, so the Biden administration will not limit arms transfers to Israel.


State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters that "we at this time have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of U.S. law."


The administration told its ally on October 13 that it had one month to increase aid to Gaza, where the situation after 13 months of war between Israel and Hamas militants has unleashed a catastrophic humanitarian situation, or face a reduction in military aid. The deadline was Tuesday.


“We are not giving Israel a pass," Patel said, adding that "we want to see the totality of the humanitarian situation improve, and we think some of these steps will allow the conditions for that to continue to progress."


Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israel’s top national security adviser, Ron Dermer, in Washington on Monday to go over the steps that Israel has taken.


At the United Nations, U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council that Israel has taken some important steps, including restoring aid deliveries to the north, but that it must ensure its actions are “fully implemented and its improvements sustained over time.”


“And we continue to reiterate, there must be no forcible displacement nor policy of starvation in Gaza, which would have grave implications under U.S. and international law,” she said.


A senior U.N. human rights official said at the same meeting that the entry and distribution of aid into Gaza has fallen to “some of the lowest levels in a year” and criticized Israel’s conduct of military operations in the north.


“All states, consistent with their obligations under international law, must therefore assess arms sales or transfers and provision of military, logistical or financial support to a party to the conflict, with a view to ending such support if this risks serious violations of international law,” Ilze Brands Kehris, U.N. assistant secretary-general for human rights, said.




Israel denies it is limiting aid to Gaza, blaming the U.N. and aid agencies for slow distribution and Hamas for stealing it.

Earlier Tuesday, eight international aid organizations said that of 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands, Israel failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four.


"Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza," the report said. “That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.”


Asked what grade the United Nations would give Israel, spokesperson Stephane Dujarric would not offer one, but said, “I think from what we've been telling you over the last few days and frankly much longer, it's pretty clear that we're nowhere near what we need.”


While aid entering Gaza is insufficient overall, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says it is especially bad in northern Gaza, where 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and humanitarian visits in October were denied or impeded.


“As I brief you, Israeli authorities are blocking humanitarian assistance from entering North Gaza, where fighting continues, and around 75,000 people remain with dwindling water and food supplies,” acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya told the Security Council meeting.


“Conditions of life across Gaza are unfit for human survival,” she said.


Famine alert


On Friday, U.N.-backed food security experts issued an urgent warning, saying there is a strong likelihood that famine is occurring or imminent in parts of northern Gaza and that immediate action is needed to avert a catastrophe.


“By the time famine has been declared, people are already dying of hunger, with irreversible consequences that can last generations,” Rein Paulsen told the Security Council meeting. Paulsen is the director of the Office of Emergencies and Resilience at the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization.


“The window of opportunity to deliver this assistance is now, today, not tomorrow,” he said.


Israel’s U.N. ambassador told reporters ahead of the council meeting that the report by the famine committee of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC as the experts are known, is “harmful propaganda” and “filled with baseless and slanderous claims” against Israel.


“As I have said here in the past, there are agencies dedicated to real humanitarian work, and then there are those like the IPC, which prioritize smearing Israel over actually helping those in need,” Danny Danon said.


Inside the council, he said IPC claims of imminent famine in northern Gaza are “simply false,” and that Israel facilitated over 713 trucks into the north in October. He said across Gaza, a dozen bakeries produce pita bread, and overall, Israel is allowing aid in through multiple crossing points, including the Kissufim crossing to central Gaza, which was opened on Tuesday after having been shuttered 19 years ago.


“Are these the actions of a state wishing to cause a famine?” Danon asked.


Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour said Israel should allow international journalists into Gaza to see for themselves whether there is famine or not.


“We need international media, independent media, to go and to document exactly what is happening,” Mansour told reporters. “It is genocide in northern Gaza, and we need the international media to go and tell the story.”


In 13 months of war, Israel has allowed only a few handpicked reporters to accompany its troops into Gaza on brief tours to see the Hamas tunnels. It has also shuttered the bureau of Qatar-based news channel Al Jazeera in Israel. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 137 journalists and media workers have been killed, nearly all of them Palestinian.


As the situation worsens, the Security Council’s 10 elected members are working on a draft resolution on the protection of civilians in the conflict and the need for an immediate cease-fire, release of hostages and scaling up of aid.


Biden reaffirms support for Israel


President Joe Biden reiterated his support of Israel during a Tuesday Oval Office meeting with Israel’s president and echoed the wish to see the return of the remaining hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza for more than a year.




“My commitment to Israel is ironclad,” Biden told President Isaac Herzog during their morning meeting in the White House. “And we share a deep friendship.”


Herzog underscored his government’s main objective: “First and foremost, we have to get the hostages back.”


As President-elect Donald Trump begins to put his government together, his transition office announced Tuesday that former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is his nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, and real estate investor Steve Witkoff will be his special envoy to the Middle East.


Air strikes in Gaza, Beirut


Israeli airstrikes killed at least 14 people in Gaza on Tuesday, Palestinian authorities said, while in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose above Beirut’s southern suburbs less than an hour after Israeli forces told residents to evacuate.


A strike early Tuesday hit a house at a refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties.


Israel's new defense minister, Israel Katz, said on X that during a meeting with military officials Tuesday, he reiterated that Israel will continue hitting Hezbollah with full force, and that there will be no cease-fire in Lebanon.


The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead.


Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants.


The war spread to Lebanon in mid-September, after months of rocket fire from Hezbollah into Israel and drone and airstrikes by Israel’s military in south Lebanon escalated. More than 3,200 Lebanese have been killed, most of them in the past six weeks.


Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States.

## Russia and China must counter any US attempt at containment, Shoigu says

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

MOSCOW — The key task for Russia and China is to counter any attempt by the United States to contain their countries, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin told China's foreign minister on Tuesday.


U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on China and other countries, raising fears of a trade war and the United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat.


China's Xi Jinping and Putin in May pledged a "new era" of partnership between the two most powerful rivals of the United States, which they cast as an aggressive Cold War hegemon sowing chaos across the world.


Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that the strong relations between Moscow and Beijing were a stabilizing influence on the world.


"I see the most important task as countering the policy of 'dual containment' of Russia and China pursued by the United States and its satellites," Shoigu was quoted as saying by Russian state news agencies.


Xi and Putin believe the post-Cold War era of extraordinary U.S. dominance is crumbling after the perceived humiliations of the 1991 Soviet collapse and centuries of European colonial dominance of China.

## NYC Mayor Eric Adams requests earlier trial date so he can focus on reelection campaign

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seeking to move up the start of his trial on corruption and bribery charges so he can focus on his campaign for reelection this spring.


In a letter sent to the federal judge on Monday, an attorney for Adams, Alex Spiro, requested the trial begin on April 1 rather than the current planned date of April 23.


"An earlier trial date will ensure that Mayor Adams's speedy trial rights are upheld, that the Mayor will be able to fully participate in his reelection campaign and that this City's voters can be rid of the distraction of this misguided indictment as they hear from and evaluate the Democratic candidates for Mayor on their merits," Spiro wrote.


Adams, a Democrat, was indicted in September on charges that he accepted luxury travel perks and illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official seeking political favors. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and insisted he will remain in office as he fights the case.


He is expected to face a contested Democratic primary in June, with several opponents already announcing their interest in challenging him.


Inquiries to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan were not returned.


At a hearing earlier this month, prosecutors said they would be ready for a trial whenever it is scheduled, but noted they were still making their way through reams of seized records and had not yet accessed Adams' personal cellphone. According to his indictment. Adams changed his password just before giving the phone to authorities, then claimed he forgot it.


In his letter on Monday, Spiro said he would waive access to certain discovery materials if it meant speeding up the date of the trial. Under the current schedule, he predicted a verdict would come in late May, giving the mayor only a short window of time to clear his name among voters.


"Given the realities of the news and election cycle, this earlier trial date is not only feasible, but essential here," Spiro wrote.

## Voters in Oakland oust Mayor Sheng Thao just 2 years into her term

date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA

OAKLAND, Calif.  — Voters in Oakland, California, have ousted Mayor Sheng Thao just two years after she narrowly won office to lead the liberal San Francisco Bay Area city.


The Associated Press called the race Monday.


"Thank you for choosing me to serve as your Mayor. As the first Hmong American woman to become the mayor of a major American City, it has been the honor of my lifetime," she said in a statement last week.


She committed to ensuring a smooth transition.


Thao must vacate the office as soon as election results are certified Dec. 5 and the Oakland City Council declares a vacancy at its next meeting, which would be Dec. 17, Nikki Fortunato Bas, City Council president, said in a statement.


A special election for a new mayor will be held within 120 days, or roughly four months.


Until then, Bas — as president of the City Council — would serve as interim mayor unless she wins a seat on the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. As of Monday, Bas was trailing in that race.


Thao was elected mayor in November 2022 and became the first Hmong American to lead a major city. She faced criticism almost immediately after taking office for firing popular Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong. Frustrated voters, including the local NAACP, blamed Thao for a long list of city woes related to public safety, homelessness and the city's budget.


In her statement, Thao said she was proud of her administration's accomplishments.


Thao was not the only official booted from office in Tuesday's election. Pamela Price, district attorney for Alameda County, which includes Oakland, also was ousted by voters in a recall election. Critics of both Thao and Price disagreed with the officials' progressive politics.


Thao went into Tuesday's election weakened by an FBI raid in June of her home — along with properties owned by a politically influential family that controls the city's recycling contract. Thao has maintained her innocence and authorities have not said what they are investigating.


Oakland uses a ranked choice voting system that allows voters to list multiple choices in order of preference. Thao narrowly beat Loren Taylor in 2022 despite getting fewer first-place votes than Taylor.


Oakland has about 400,000 residents and is, at times, more politically liberal than San Francisco. It is Vice President Kamala Harris' hometown.


In recent years, Oakland has lost three professional sports franchises, including Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sent state highway patrol officers, state prosecutors, and surveillance cameras to help Oakland battle crime.

## Trump set to go after measures mitigating climate change

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts. 


When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he'll target.


These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities.


Here are some of the measures


The Inflation Reduction Act, the nation's landmark climate law


This law is significant because it is expected to reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% by 2030, if it unfolds as planned in the coming years.


It funnels money to measures that substitute clean energy for dirty. One major way it does so is by giving credits to businesses people who build new solar and wind farms.


But it's not limited to that. It encourages developers of geothermal energy and businesses that separate the carbon dioxide from their smokestacks and bury it underground. It incentivizes the next generation of nuclear power. It gives a $7,500 tax credit to people who buy electric cars. People who buy their cars used can get a credit too, as long as they don't earn too much to qualify.


Trump, by contrast, has summed up his energy policy as “drill, baby, drill” and pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats’ “green new scam” in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, the main causes of climate change.


He vows to end subsidies for wind power that were included in the landmark 2022 climate law.


If Trump does target the climate law, there are provisions that are likely safe. One is a credit for companies in advanced manufacturing, because it is perceived as “America first and pro-U.S. business,” said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa. Incentives for electric vehicles are likely most at risk, he added.


Pollution from electric power plants


The main U.S. rule aimed at reducing climate change that comes from making electricity at power plants that burn coal is also considered vulnerable. This rule from the Environmental Protection Agency, announced in April, would force many coal-fired plants to capture 90% of their carbon emissions or shut down within eight years, Shepheard said.


It was projected to reduce roughly 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2047, along with tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants.


The United States has been reducing carbon dioxide emissions primarily by replacing coal-fired power plants with clean, renewable power, said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries’ carbon dioxide emissions.


"I hope that we don’t lose sight of the benefits of clean energy,” he said. “It’s not just about the climate. It’s about our lives and our health.”


Limiting leaks from damaging methane, or natural gas


The Biden administration was under pressure to reduce one of the main pollutants contributing to drought, heat waves, flooding and stronger hurricanes — methane or natural gas. It leaks out of oil and gas equipment, sometimes deliberately when companies consider it too expensive to transport.


The Biden administration issued the first national rules on this.


Industry groups and Republican-leaning states challenged the rule in court. They say the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards.


The EPA said the rules are within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.


Fuel-efficient vehicles


The EPA issued its strongest rules on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks under the Biden administration.


Under Trump, the EPA is considered likely to begin a lengthy process to repeal and replace a host of standards including the one on tailpipe emissions, which Trump falsely calls an electric vehicle “mandate."


Trump has said EV manufacturing will destroy jobs in the auto industry and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don’t work in cold weather and aren’t able to travel long distances. Trump softened his rhetoric in recent months after Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election.


Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars.


Drilling in Alaska refuge


Trump is almost certain to reinstate oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, continuing a partisan battle that has persisted for decades. Biden and other Democratic presidents have blocked drilling in the sprawling refuge, which is home to polar bears, caribou and other wildlife. Trump opened the area to drilling in a 2017 tax cut law enacted by congressional Republicans. No drilling has occurred in the refuge, although the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Wednesday proposed a lease sale by the end of December that could lead to oil drilling. The sale is required under the 2017 law.


Transition to cleaner energy, transport will continue


Trump, who has cast climate change as a “hoax,” has said he will also eliminate regulations by the Biden administration to increase the energy efficiency of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.


Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown said climate action will continue to move forward at the state and local level.


Zara Ahmed, who leads policy analysis and science strategy at Carbon Direct, agreed. While there may be an abdication of leadership at the federal level on climate, she’s optimistic that states including California will continue to lead.


Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said Wednesday that states, cities, utilities and businesses that have committed to net zero emissions will keep working toward those goals, driving record installations of wind and solar energy.


Governors of both parties are also interested in ramping up nuclear energy as a carbon-free source of electricity, Cohen said.


Trump has said he, too, is interested in developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional reactors.


Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who was Biden’s first national climate adviser, said Trump will be unable to stop clean energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power.


“No matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back,” McCarthy said.

## Trump breaks Republican losing streak in nation's largest majority-Arab city

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

DEARBORN, Michigan — Faced with two choices she didn't like, Suehaila Amen chose neither. 


Instead, the longtime Democrat from the Arab American stronghold of Dearborn, Michigan, backed a third-party candidate for president, adding her voice to a remarkable turnaround that helped Donald Trump reclaim Michigan and the presidency. 


In Dearborn, where nearly half of the 110,000 residents are of Arab descent, Vice President Kamala Harris received over 2,500 fewer votes than Trump, who became the first Republican presidential candidate since former President George W. Bush in 2000 to win the city. Harris also lost neighboring Dearborn Heights to Trump, who in his previous term as president banned travel from several mostly-Muslim countries. 


Harris lost the presidential vote in two Detroit-area cities with large Arab American populations after months of warnings from local Democrats about the Biden-Harris administration’s unwavering support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Some said they backed Trump after he visited a few days before the election, mingling with customers and staff at a Lebanese-owned restaurant and reassuring people that he would find a way to end the violence in the Middle East. 


Others, including Amen, were unable to persuade themselves to back the former president. She said many Arab Americans felt Harris got what she deserved but aren’t “jubilant about Trump.” 


“Whether it’s Trump himself or the people who are around him, it does pose a great deal of concern for me,” Amen said. “But at the end of the day when you have two evils running, what are you left with?” 


As it became clear late Tuesday into early Wednesday that Trump would not only win the presidency but likely prevail in Dearborn, the mood in metro Detroit’s Arab American communities was described by Dearborn City Council member Mustapha Hammoud as “somber.” And yet, he said, the result was “not surprising at all.” 


The shift in Dearborn — where Trump received nearly 18,000 votes compared with Harris' 15,000 — marks a startling change from just four years ago when Joe Biden won in the city by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. 


No one should be surprised 


The results didn't come out of nowhere. For months, in phone calls and meetings with top Democratic officials, local leaders warned, in blunt terms, that Arab American voters would turn against them if the administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war didn’t change. 


The Biden-Harris administration has remained a staunch ally of Israel since the brutal Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took over 200 hostages. The war between Israel and Hamas has killed more than 43,000 people in Gaza, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. 


While Harris softened her rhetoric on the war, she didn't propose concrete policies toward Israel or the war in Gaza that varied from the administration’s position. And even if she had, that might not have made much of a difference in places like Dearborn. 


“All she had to do was stop the war in Lebanon and Gaza and she would receive everyone’s votes here,” said Hammoud. 


More voters thought Trump would be better able to handle the situation in the Middle East than Harris, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. About half of voters named Trump as better suited, compared with about a third who said Harris. 


Among those who opposed more aid for Israel, 58% backed Harris in the presidential election; 39% supported Trump. 


Even some Harris voters had their doubts. About three-quarters of Harris voters in Michigan said she was the better candidate to handle the situation. Few preferred Trump, but about 2 in 10 Harris voters said they were equivalent or neither would be better. 


In the absence of support for Harris in the Arab American community, Trump and his allies stepped in. 


A key part of Michigan’s electorate — a state Trump won by nearly 11,000 votes in 2016 before he lost it by nearly 154,000 to Biden in 2020 — Arab Americans spent months meeting with Trump allies, who encouraged community leaders to endorse him. 


Things began to move in September, when Amer Ghalib, the Democratic Muslim mayor of the city of Hamtramck, endorsed Trump. Shortly afterwards, Trump visited a campaign office there. 


That was a turning point, said Massad Boulos, who led Trump's outreach with Arab Americans. Boulos' son Michael is married to Trump's daughter Tiffany. 


“They very, very much appreciated the president’s visit and the respect that they felt,” said Massad Boulos. “That was the first big achievement, so to speak. After that, I started getting endorsements from imams and Muslim leaders.” 


An apparent shift toward Trump in final week 


While support for Harris had been declining for months — especially after her campaign did not allow a pro-Palestinian speaker to take the stage at August’s Democratic National Convention — some voters say the last week of the campaign was pivotal. 


At an October 30 rally in Michigan, former President Bill Clinton said Hamas uses civilians as shields and will “force you to kill civilians if you want to defend yourself.” 


“Hamas did not care about a homeland for the Palestinians, they wanted to kill Israelis and make Israel uninhabitable," he said. "Well, I got news for them, they were there first, before their faith existed, they were there.” 


The Harris campaign wanted Clinton to visit Dearborn to speak in the days following the rally, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The potential visit never materialized after backlash over Clinton’s comments. 


“That comment was the talk of the town. It hurt many like me, who loved him,” said Amin Hashmi, who was born in Pakistan and lives in suburban Detroit. A self-proclaimed “die-hard Dem,” Hashmi said casting a ballot for Trump “was a seismic move” that came after he stood in the voting booth for 25 minutes. 


On the Friday before the election, Trump visited The Great Commoner in Dearborn, a Lebanese-owned restaurant. That stood in sharp contrast with Harris, who met with Dearborn’s Democratic mayor, Abdullah Hammoud — who didn’t endorse in the race — but never came to Dearborn herself. 


“He came up to Dearborn. He spoke with residents. Whether some people say it wasn’t genuine, he still made the effort. He did reach out and try to work with them, at least listen to them,” said Samia Hamid, a Dearborn resident.

</p><p>Much of the country has been warmer than usual since the start of fall, with some areas 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit above average “consistently,” Fuchs went on. “I’m in Nebraska, so typically in the fall, I’m thinking, ‘Oh, it’s going to be cool in the morning, I’ll grab a jacket, and maybe some nice sun in the afternoon will warm it up, and then it’s cool in the evenings.’ And a lot of the country has not had that. They’ve really had an extended summer.” Those increased temperatures have also meant increased moisture loss, which is what triggers a formal drought designation. </p><p>But while 2024 is <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2024-track-be-hottest-year-record-warming-temporarily-hits-15degc#:~:text=The%20global%20mean%20temperature%20in,2023%2C%20the%20current%20warmest%20year." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on track to be the hottest year on record</u></a>, the United States is not, in fact, in one giant drought. Rather, “there are different factors” driving several droughts happening simultaneously, Fuchs explained. “It’s not all tied to the same mechanism.”</p><p>In the Northeast, for example, the drought is linked to eastward-tracking storms dissipating before they reach the region, as well as activity in the tropics during late September and October, which robbed the atmosphere of moisture and contributed to “a stronger upper high-pressure area dominant over the Ohio Valley, Midwest, Great Lakes,” Paul Pastelok, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, wrote to me in an email on Friday. That high-pressure area has acted “like a block to prevent any significant precipitation for weeks in these areas.” It’s also why drought experts expect “potential improvement” in the coming weeks.</p><p>There are severe drought conditions across the Southeast, too, which may be a surprise if flooding from Hurricane Helene <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-hurricane-helene" target="_self"><u>is still top of mind</u></a>. But much of that water quickly ran off into streams, rivers, and the ocean, and “since then, there has not been a lot of rain in this area, and the top soil has dried out,” Pastelok said. Other areas experiencing drought include the Southwest, where a mild summer monsoon season has <a href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/110524_drought_declaration/climate-experts-recommend-arizona-drought-declarations-stay-effect/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extended emergency declarations</u></a>, and the central and northern Plains, which have been dry since early September and where drought conditions are <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Drought/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expected to last</u></a> through at least the early winter. Reservoirs in California, meanwhile, are in “great shape” after last winter’s snows; still, due to “months without rain in many areas, the topsoil has dried out, resulting in an abnormal dryness level — a lower category of drought,” Pastelok said.</p><p>Brett Anderson, another senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, pointed out that drought is a natural part of the climate cycle, and reassured me, “This is not unprecedented.” He added that there is “no real trend in U.S. drought severity over the past 25 years.” </p><p>That doesn’t mean these droughts don’t bear signs of climate change. Fuchs noted that “rapid swings from very wet conditions to very dry conditions, right on top of each other,” is a pattern associated with global warming, and one that can be seen both in the post-Helene dry spell in the Southwest and the deluge last week that broke up a drought in Oklahoma and Missouri, which are having some of their <a href="https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-rainfall-totals-okc-wettest-novembers/62853533" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>wettest</em></em></u></a> Novembers on record.

## Young Black, Latino men say they chose Trump because of economy, jobs

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Brian Leija, a 31-year-old small-business owner from Belton, Texas, was not surprised that a growing number of Latino men of his generation voted for Donald Trump for president this year. Leija had voted for the Republican in 2016 and 2020. 


Leija's rationale was simple: He said he has benefited from Trump's economic policies, especially tax cuts. 


"I am a blue-collar worker," Leija said. "So, tax breaks for small businesses are ideal for what I do." 


For DaSean Gallishaw, a consultant in Fairfax, Virginia, a vote for Trump was rooted in what he saw as Democrats' rhetoric not matching their actions.  


"It's been a very long time since the Democrats ever really kept their promises to what they're going to do for the minority communities," he said. 


Gallishaw, 25, who is Black, also voted for Trump twice before. This year, he said, he thought the former president's "minority community outreach really showed up." 


Trump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and most notably among men under age 45, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters. 




Even as Democrat Kamala Harris won majorities of Black and Latino voters, it wasn't enough to give the vice president the White House, because of the gains Trump made. 


Economy, jobs made men under 45 open to Trump 


Voters overall cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue the country faced. That was true for Black and Hispanic voters as well. 


About 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double the share he got in 2020. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden. 


Juan Proano, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation's largest and oldest civil rights organization for Hispanic Americans, said the election results make it clear that Trump's messaging on the economy resonated with Latinos. 


"I think it's important to say that Latinos have a significant impact in deciding who the next president was going to be and reelected Donald Trump," Proano said. "[Latino] men certainly responded to the populist message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues, inflation, wages and even support of immigration reform." 


The Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, has overseen outreach to Black American religious communities for more than a decade. He said that Trump's hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color. 


"I think that Trump with this bogus machismo has been effective amongst the young men, Black, white, Hispanic," Harkins said. "And I think unfortunately, even if it's a very small percentage, you know, when you're talking about an election like we just had, it can be very impactful." 


Black, Latino voters' priorities changed from 2020 


While about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic groups identified the economy as the top issue facing the country, older white and Latino voters were likely to also cite immigration, with about one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue. 


A clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as "not so good" or "poor," compared with about half of older Black voters. Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age, said the economy is in bad shape. 




That belief made it more difficult for Harris to highlight the actual numbers in the economy, which show that inflation has receded dramatically, unemployment remains low and wages have risen. These voters simply did not feel that progress. 


This is the first time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student from Brownville, Texas, voted in a presidential election. The economy and immigration are the issues that drove him to vote for Trump, he said. 


"Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me," Uscanga said. "Gas, grocery shopping, even as a college student, everything has gone up in price, and that is a big concern for me, and other issues like immigration." 


Having grown up washing cars and selling tamales and used cars, Uscanga knows how hard it can be to make a living. When Trump was president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said. 


"I was not very fond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in 2016, but I look aside from that and how we were living in 2018, 2019." Uscanga said. "I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the media was saying, and that's why I started supporting him after that." 


Though the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was impactful, Trump could not have won without the support of a majority of white voters. 


"Men of color are really beginning to emerge as the new swing voters," said Terrance Woodbury, co-founder of HIT Strategies, a polling and research firm that conducted studies for the Harris campaign. 


"For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who can swing the outcome of elections. Now men of color are really beginning to emerge as that, especially younger men of color, who are less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely to swing either between parties or in and out of the electorate," Woodbury said. 


Desire for strong leadership  


A majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader; slightly fewer than half said the same about Harris. Among Hispanic voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. Roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who said that in 2020. About half of Hispanic women said Trump was a strong leader, up from 37%. 


Black men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe Trump as a strong leader. 


David Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained from voting in the election because he did not feel either Harris or Trump was making the right appeals to Black men. But the results of the election did not disappoint him. 


"I'm satisfied with the result. I don't feel slighted. I wasn't let down. I wasn't pulling for Trump or Kamala, but I did not want a woman in that position," he said. And if it were to be a woman, Means said, "I'd rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like Judge Judy."

## California voters reject measure to ban forced prison labor

Sacramento, California — California voters have rejected a measure on the November ballot that would have amended the state constitution to ban forced prison labor.


The constitution already prohibits so-called involuntary servitude, but an exception allows it to be used as a punishment for crime.


That exemption became a target of criminal justice advocates concerned that prisoners are often paid less than $1 an hour for labor such as fighting fires, cleaning cells and doing landscaping work at cemeteries.


The failed Proposition 6 was included in a package of reparations proposals introduced by lawmakers this year as part of an effort to atone and offer redress for a history of discrimination against Black Californians.


Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law in the package in September to issue a formal apology for the state's legacy of racism against African Americans. But state lawmakers blocked a bill that would have created an agency to administer reparations programs, and Newsom vetoed a measure that would have helped Black families reclaim property taken unjustly by the government through eminent domain.


Abolish Slavery National Network co-founder Jamilia Land, who advocated for the initiative targeting forced prison labor, said the measure and similar ones in other states are about “dismantling the remnants of slavery” from the books.


“While the voters of California did not pass Proposition 6 this time, we have made significant progress,” she said in a statement. “We are proud of the movement we have built, and we will not rest until we see this issue resolved once and for all.”


George Eyles, a retired teacher in Brea who voted against Prop 6, said he found it confusing that the initiative aimed to ban slavery, which was outlawed in the U.S. in the 19th century. After finding out more about the measure, Eyles decided it likely would not be economically feasible since prison labor helps cut costs for upkeep, he said.


“I really couldn’t get any in-depth information about ... the thinking behind putting that whole Prop 6 forward, so that made me leery of it,” Eyles said. “If I really can’t understand something, then I’m usually going to shake my head, ‘No.’”


Multiple states — including Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama and Vermont — have voted to rid their constitutions of forced labor exemptions in recent years, and this week they were joined by Nevada, which passed its own measure.


In Colorado — the first state to get rid of an exception for slavery from its constitution in 2018 — incarcerated people alleged in a 2022 lawsuit filed against the corrections department that they were still being forced to work.


Proposition 6’s ballot language did not explicitly include the word “slavery” like measures elsewhere, because the California Constitution was amended in the 1970s to remove an exemption for slavery. But the exception for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime remained on the books.


The 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bans slavery and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime.


Proposition 6 saw the second-least campaign spending among the 10 statewide initiatives on the ballot this year, about $1.9 million, according to the California Secretary of State’s office. It had no formal opposition.

## Fire crews on both US coasts battle wildfires

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

RINGWOOD, New Jersey — Fire crews battled small wildfires across the Northeast U.S. on Monday, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey that killed a parks employee over the weekend and postponed Veterans Day plans. Just over half a centimeter (1/4 inch) of rain fell overnight from Sunday into Monday in a forest area straddling the border between the two states, giving a slight respite to firefighters.


The fire is one of several burning on the East Coast amid a lack of much rainfall since September. An employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree.


The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California.


Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds.


The Mountain Fire in Ventura County prompted thousands of residents to flee their homes and was 36% contained as of Monday. The fire's size remains about 83 square kilometers (around 32 square miles). The Mountain Fire has destroyed more than 170 structures, most of them homes, officials said. The cause is under investigation.




Across the country on the New Jersey and New York border, the 12.2 square-kilometer (4.7 square-mile) fire dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire was 10% contained as of midmorning Monday, and 25 structures were considered threatened, although no evacuations had been ordered, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.


Officials said the overnight rainfall was far less than what was needed to extinguish numerous brush fires that have broken out around New Jersey since the middle of last week. At least four other wildfires in central to northern New Jersey were mostly or completely contained as of Monday.


In order to find and fight the fires, crews are navigating a maze of country roads, lakes and steep hills amid dense forests. Trees there have dropped most of their leaves onto parched ground, masking a potential danger.


"Beneath the surface leaf litter that falls off the trees, that stuff is bone dry," Bryan Gallagher, a forest ranger with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said at a media briefing. "So right now you get a little bit of rain that puts that surface fire out. But if it's in the duff it's going to stay there. It's going to smolder like a cigar until it gets dry enough and then that fire can pop up again."


In some areas, narrow columns of white smoke could be seen creeping out of a lakeside tree canopy Monday afternoon.


With the smell of smoke permeating the air in some areas, residents negotiated a string of road closures, and even some firefighters struggled driving on winding roads with weak cellphone signals.


A firefighting helicopter capable of dropping 1,325 liters (350 gallons) at a time was being used to help combat the Jennings Creek fire.


In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander.


"Many of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order protect our great communities in that area," he posted online.


Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, the 18-year-old state parks employee killed Saturday while fighting a fire near New York state's Greenwood Lake.


Health advisories had been issued over the weekend for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality produced by smoke from the fires, but conditions improved after the rainfall and changes in wind direction.


In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned around 400 acres (162 hectares) in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 8.8 square kilometers (3.4 square miles) in the city some 16 kilometers (10 miles) north of Boston.


The Lynn Fire Department cited "a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years."


"We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn't spread further," Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday.


The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a hearing on Tuesday to review its water supply conditions. Before Sunday night, the last measurable rainfall in New Jersey occurred on Sept. 28.

## Abolitionist Harriet Tubman posthumously named 'general' in Veterans Day ceremony

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

CHURCH CREEK, Maryland — Revered abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who was the first woman to oversee an American military action during a time of war, was posthumously awarded the rank of general on Monday. 


Dozens gathered on Veterans Day at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park in Maryland's Dorchester County for a formal ceremony making Tubman a one-star brigadier general in the state's National Guard. 


Gov. Wes Moore called the occasion not just a great day for Tubman's home state but for all the U.S.  


“Today, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of veteran," Moore said. "Today we celebrate one of the greatest authors of the American story.” 


Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849, settling in Philadelphia in 1849. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina. 


Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in Philadelphia and  


coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said. 


“She knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion’s den,” Moore said. “She knew that leadership means you have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.” 


The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning ceremony with Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt. 


Wyatt hailed her aunt's legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other service member. 


“Aunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally, she gave up any rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for others,” Wyatt said. “She is a selfless person.” 


Tubman's status as an icon of history has only been further elevated within the last few years. The city of Philadelphia chose a Black artist to make a 14-foot (4.3-meter) bronze statue to go on display next year. In 2022, a Chicago elementary school was renamed for Tubman, replacing the previous namesake, who had racist views. However, plans to put Tubman on the $20 bill have continued to stall.

## The Pro-IRA House Republicans Who Lost Their Jobs

Also definitively leaving the House is Utah Republican John Curtis, founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, who is headed across the hall to the Senate.</p><p>Of the remaining 15 Republicans, four are in races that still have not been called, and three look to be in moderate-to-severe jeopardy. The current chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus, for instance, Iowa’s Mariannette Miller-Meeks, is leading challenger Christina Bohannan by just 0.2% — i.e. <a href="https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/iowas-1st-congressional-race-still-up-for-grabs-as-of-now-no-recount-requested" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>799 votes</u></a> — with all precincts reporting. The state has no automatic recount law, but candidates can request one at little to no expense when the margin is within 1%; a spokesperson from the Iowa Secretary of State’s office told a local TV network that if a request comes in, it’ll likely be after the results are certified early this week. As Heatmap’s Jeva Lange wrote in our <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/election-results" target="_self"><u>climate election tracker</u></a>, “Bohannan has attacked Miller-Meeks for slow-walking action on addressing climate change through her soft hand with the oil and gas industry,” and as of the final weeks of the race was out-raising Miller-Meeks by a 2-to-1 ratio, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/conservative-climate-caucus-chair-in-danger-of-losing-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>E&E News</em></em></u><u> reported</u></a>. </p><p>Another seat Democrats saw an opportunity to flip was Arizona’s 6th Congressional District, where letter signatory Juan Ciscomani has, as of this moment, squeaked out ahead of Democrat Kirsten Engel by 0.6% after appearing to trail for much of last week, though that could change again as more votes are counted. The news is worse for Oregon’s Lori Chavez-DeRemer, however, who with 87% of precincts reporting is behind Democrat Janelle Bynum in the vote by close to 3%. </p><p>If all these races were to be certified as they currently stand, that would leave 14 of the original group of 18 representatives still in Congress. If <em><em>all </em></em>the House races with results still outstanding fall into line per their current leanings, then Johnson will have just an 11-vote majority. That means this group of lawmakers can still derail the House’s agenda if they so choose, though just barely. </p><p>As for the three House seats Republicans have flipped so far, two are in Pennsylvania and one is in Michigan, both states Biden won in 2020. The victors in the two Pennsylvania races, campaigned against the “<a href="https://www.mackenzieforcongress.com/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>radical climate agenda</u></a>” and the “<a href="https://pennsylvaniaindependent.com/politics/house-representatives-rob-bresnahan-matt-cartwright-fossil-fuels-climate-change-stocks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate crazies</u></a>,” respectively. Yet the new representative from Michigan’s 7th district, Tom Barrett, has earned a <a href="https://www.michiganlcv.org/lawmaker/tom-barrett/" target="_blank">score of 32%</a> from the Michigan League of Conservation Voters during his time in the state Senate, making him a potential Conservative Climate Caucus recruit. The group’s current chair, Miller-Meeks, has a LCV score of <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/mariannette-miller-meeks" target="_blank">just 12%</a>.</p><p>So where does that leave us? About where we started, with the politics of repeal teetering on a wind turbine blade-edge. It’s one thing to campaign against the IRA, but the actual business of gutting is another thing entirely. On election night, my colleague Robinson Meyer cited a <em><em>Washington Post</em></em> analysis showing that Trump 2020 districts have received <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/climate-bill-biden-clean-energy/#:~:text=congressional%20districts%20that%20favored%20Trump%20in%20the%202020%20election%20received%20three%20times%20as%20much%20clean%20energy%20and%20manufacturing%20investments%20as%20those%20that%20leaned%20toward%20Biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three times as much</u></a> funding from Biden’s signature climate law as those that went the other way. Though that won’t necessarily convince every voter to welcome solar developments in their backyard, when the margins of victory are this slim, every tenth of a percent of the vote counts.</p>

## Harris appears with Biden for first time since election loss

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden laid a wreath Monday to honor the nation's fallen soldiers on Veterans Day, an event marking his first appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris since her election defeat last week.


The ceremony, at historic Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington, is also the first time Harris has been seen in public since her Nov. 6 speech in which she conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump.  


Democrats, facing a painful reckoning over their drubbing, have begun soul-searching internal discussions — and some not-so-private blaming — over what caused Harris's loss, with some pointing to Biden's initial insistence on running again at age 81, despite having promised to be a bridge president to the next generation.


Criticism of Harris herself has been more muted, and Biden heaped praise on Harris last Thursday in a televised White House address.  


Earlier Monday, Biden hosted veterans at the White House to mark the holiday before heading to Arlington, the final resting place of two presidents, generals from all major U.S. wars, and thousands of other military personnel.  


Biden and Harris, both dressed in dark suits, placed their hands on their hearts before participating in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  


The president was to deliver remarks at the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater.


The ceremony comes ahead of Biden hosting Trump at the White House on Wednesday.


The Republican has begun naming loyalists to his new administration. He announced he is bringing a hard-line immigration official, Tom Homan, back into the fold to serve as his so-called "border czar," and congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.


Trump himself has long claimed he is a fierce supporter of America's military, but he has made a series of controversial comments about veterans.  


His longest-serving White House chief of staff, retired general John Kelly, has said the Republican leader privately disparaged U.S. service members, including describing those who died or were imprisoned defending America as "suckers" and "losers."  


Trump denies the accusation.  


But the soon-to-be 47th president has been on record expressing contempt for late American war hero and senator John McCain, who spent years in a Hanoi prison during the Vietnam war.

## Trump names US 'border czar' to oversee migrant deportations

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Thomas Homan, his one-time acting immigration chief, to serve as “border czar” and fulfill his campaign vow to deport large numbers of undocumented migrants, potentially millions, back to their home countries.


Trump said on his Truth Social media platform late Sunday that the 62-year-old Homan would be “in charge of our Nation’s Borders,” south to Mexico and north to Canada. He added that he has “no doubt” that Homan “will do a fantastic, and long-awaited for, job.”


“I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders,” Trump wrote.


Trump is also set to appoint another immigration hard-liner, Stephen Miller, as deputy chief of staff for policy, U.S. news media reported.


“This is another fantastic pick by the president,” Vice President-elect JD Vance said of the prospect of Miller, 39, joining Trump’s nascent administration.


In another appointment, Trump named one of his staunchest Republican advocates in Congress, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, to serve as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, calling her “an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.”


Stefanik, 40, arrived in the House of Representatives in 2015 as a political moderate but over time has emerged as a vocal Trump defender.


She drew national attention last year for her sharp questioning of Ivy League university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses in the wake of student protests against Israel’s conduct of its war on Hamas militants. Two of the academics, the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, stepped down in the fallout from the hearing.




Trump also is expected to tap U.S. Senator Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, Reuters reported Monday, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Representatives for Trump and Rubio did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.


Trump has asked U.S. Representative Michael Waltz to be his national security adviser, The Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Waltz, a retired National Guard officer, has served as the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on readiness and as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.


Trump picked a former New York congressman, Lee Zeldin, 44, to head the Environmental Protection Agency, saying he would “ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet.”


Both Stefanik and Zeldin will face Senate confirmation hearings.


Homan’s appointment as “border czar” does not require Senate confirmation, nor does Miller’s as a White House aide.


Homan served as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, from January 2017 to June 2018 during Trump’s first presidential term but left in frustration when the White House failed to push his nomination toward the required confirmation in the Senate.


Homan, a former police officer and Border Patrol agent, subsequently became a Fox News analyst on immigration and border issues.


Hours after his appointment, Homan on Monday told the “Fox & Friends” show: "I've been on this network for years complaining about what [President Joe Biden’s] administration did to this border. I've been yelling and screaming about it and what they need to do to fix it.”


“So, when [Trump] asked me, ‘Would you come back and fix it?’ Of course. I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't,” he said. “I'm honored the president asked me to come back and help solve this national security crisis, so I'm looking forward to it.”


Trump recaptured the White House in last week’s election after repeatedly telling thousands of his supporters at campaign rallies that he would round up undocumented migrants in the U.S. – perhaps 11 million or more – and send them back to their home countries.


“We’re going to have to seal up those borders,” Trump often said, claiming that other countries had emptied their prisons and mental health hospitals so migrants could flee to the U.S. He said the migrants in the U.S. are now causing a crime wave. Government statistics show that no such massive increase in crime has occurred.




In addition, immigration officials two months ago told Congress that more than 13,000 immigrants convicted of homicide — either in the United States or abroad — are living in the U.S. outside of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.


The immigrants are part of ICE’s “non-detained” list of migrants in the United States.


Officials told Congress that means the migrants have pending immigration cases in the U.S., but they are not currently in detention either because they are not prioritized for detention, they are serving time in a jail or prison for their crimes, or because ICE cannot find them.


In another interview, Homan told Fox’s “Sunday Morning Futures” show that military troops would not be used to round up and arrest undocumented immigrants.


ICE, he said, would work to carry out Trump’s plans in a “humane manner" in what will be a “necessary” and “well-targeted, planned operation.”


Another Trump advocate, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, told CNN’s “State of the Union” show on Sunday that deportation efforts would first focus on 1.3 million migrants who have already had court hearings and been rejected for asylum in the U.S., with Homeland Security agents and local police arresting them.


Asked whether 3.6 million children who entered the U.S. with their undocumented parents and have been living for years in the U.S. should also be deported, Jordan said, “That question will be addressed later on.”


Advocates for these migrants, now often young adults, call them “Dreamers,” and some U.S. lawmakers have, unsuccessfully so far, attempted to put them on a path to U.S. citizenship.




In his first term, Trump had pledged to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. Some of the wall was built but Mexico paid for none of it.


In addition, he sought to deport millions of immigrants but fell far short for lack of government financing, legal challenges brought by advocates of migrants and a public outcry over deportation tactics, including the separation of migrant children from their parents, a policy that Homan advocated.


During his tenure as the acting ICE chief, Homan pushed back against allegations that enforcement agents acted too aggressively. In the past, Homan has praised Trump for “taking the shackles” off ICE agents by allowing them to make a broader range of immigration arrests in the U.S. interior.

## What to Expect from COP29

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. COP29 kicks off in Azerbaijan </h3><p>
	The UN COP29 climate summit starts today in Baku, Azerbaijan. It’s being <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a7e2874-3ecb-45f8-bcae-379ab82d79ac?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> “the toughest climate talks in almost a decade,” as countries work to set a new finance target to help developing nations adapt to climate change. In 2022, industrialized nations pledged to provide $100 billion annually for climate finance, and the new goal could run into the trillions of dollars. Clashes are expected over how much money should be paid and by whom, plus the mechanisms for managing and structuring the funding. Donald Trump’s election win looms large at the event, with the world’s largest economy and the second largest greenhouse gas emitter expected to slow climate action under the next administration. Still, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev said the finance target was the meeting’s top priority. Negotiators are also likely to put the finishing touches on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which calls for the creation of a global carbon credit market. And there will be a big push to get nations to outline their new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), or emissions reduction plans, well ahead of the February deadline.

Absent are President Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. A bunch of banking bigwigs have also bowed out. So who <em>is</em> going?
</p><ul>
<li><strong>U.S. climate envoy John Podesta, as well as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse</strong> (D-R.I.), the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, who last week <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-cop-climate-confrence-summit-joe-biden-politics-donald-trump-climate/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he would head to Baku to “reassure the international community that large swaths of the U.S. remain committed to steering the planet away from climate catastrophe.”</li>
<li><strong>Chinese climate spokesperson Liu Zhenmin</strong>. There will be pressure on China to contribute to the climate finance pool. “China could step up and take a leadership role on climate now that the U.S. looks likely to relinquish its crown,” <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-11/cop29-trump-win-upends-climate-cash-fight-in-baku?srnd=phx-green&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. “Conversely, it could use Trump’s victory as an excuse for it to take less action to curb fossil fuels.” </li>
<li><strong>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband</strong>. They will unveil the UK’s NDC and try to steady the ship as U.S. climate commitments wobble.</li>
<li><strong>Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados</strong>, who will be “a linchpin for developing countries seeking climate justice in the face of inaction by the worst greenhouse gas emitters,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/10/whos-who-at-cop29-the-world-leaders-and-others-who-will-attend?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>The Guardian</em>. </li>

	President-elect Donald Trump is considering North Dakota’s Republican governor Doug Burgum for a position as “energy czar,” the <em><em>Financial Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c390cc1-f5b8-4096-a361-c53d8145b85a?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" target="_blank">reported</a>. The role would replace that of National Climate Advisor – created by President Biden and currently occupied by Ali Zaidi – and “coordinate Trump’s deregulatory agenda across a patchwork of agencies including the Department of Energy, Department of Interior, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Environmental Protection Agency.” North Dakota is a major oil producer, and Burgum is an “oil industry favorite” for the role, the <em><em>FT</em></em> said.<span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span>
</p><h3>4. Fires plague tri-state area amid drought</h3><p>
	An 18-year-old New York State parks employee died over the weekend while fighting a fire in Orange County, New York. Dariel Vasquez died when a tree fell and struck him as he was working to clear a wooded area, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/nyregion/orange-county-fire-sterling-forest.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" target="_blank">according to</a> <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. The blaze, which is also burning in Passaic County, New Jersey, has charred at least 3,000 acres and is 10% contained. It’s one of several recent fires in the drought-stricken region. A brush fire ignited in Prospect Park Friday and burned 2 acres. Air quality warnings were in place over the weekend for the tri-state area. Some rain fell on Sunday but didn’t do much to relieve the dry conditions.<span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span>
</p><h3>5. Climate-related weather losses surpass $2 trillion over 10 years</h3><p>
	A recent <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/25285058-2024-icc-oxera-the-economic-cost-of-extreme-weather-events/?embed=1&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" target="_blank">report</a> from the International Chamber of Commerce found that extreme weather related to climate change has cost the global economy more than $2 trillion over the last 10 years. The biggest losses, totaling about $935 billion, were felt in the U.S. And the costs have been growing faster in more recent years. For example, in 2022 and 2023 alone, the economic damages reached $451 billion, up nearly 20% compared to the annual average of the 8 years that came before. And the number of climate-related extreme weather events between 2000 and 2019 was 83% higher than in the years between 1980 and 2000. “Our findings indicate that without enhanced climate action and mitigation efforts, the economic burden of climate-related extreme weather events will persist and likely grow,” the report said. The ICC is a business organization “championing the global economy as a force for economic growth, job creation and prosperity.”<span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span>

## Trump’s Gift to China

Some thought the war on terror, in which the U.S. spent on the order of <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$6 trillion</u></a> turning half the Middle East into a Stygian wasteland, would crack it. Others thought the financial crisis of 2008 would sour the world on America-centered financial capitalism.</p><p>Yet nothing of the sort happened. America is simply so rich that it absorbed the burden of 20 years of war without even raising taxes. There was and is simply no alternative to the U.S. dollar for settling international transactions. The 2008 crash caused a run <em><em>towards</em></em> dollars, not away from them, and the U.S. Federal Reserve became the lender of last resort for half the planet — a role it replayed during the initial panic of the pandemic.</p><p>And under the Biden administration, American preeminence seemed to have gotten another lease on life. Thanks to his stimulus and industrial policy, the U.S. economy has recovered much faster than any other rich nation. The European Union is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/european-union-risks-sad-bad-future-2024-09-16/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stagnating</u></a>, struggling to escape from its lack of a coherent fiscal system and its decision to depend heavily on imported Russian fossil gas. China’s growth model has crashed into the middle income trap, as it <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-economic-woes-give-markets-week-forget-public-little-cause-opti-rcna174466" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>struggles to pivot</u></a> from an investment-driven model to a consumption-driven one.</p><p>That all changes with the second election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Him winning again, this time even the popular vote, has thrown radical uncertainty into America’s international standing — particularly when it comes to climate change and the green economy. It’s a golden opportunity for China, if it cares to seize it.</p><p>It has been obvious for years now that renewable energy and green industry are going to be the growth engines of the world economy for the rest of this century at least. Every fossil fuel power plant must be replaced with some combination of wind, solar, batteries, geothermal, or nuclear, and every power grid must be overhauled and upgraded to deal with the intermittency of renewables. All carbon-based industry and agriculture must be modified or replaced with electric-powered versions, requiring a lot more generation capacity.</p><p>It will be a transformation on par in significance with the original Industrial Revolution, requiring trillions in investment per year. Indeed, it is already happening around the world and, given the price trends of renewable energy, it is practically inevitable at this point.</p><p>China already has manifold advantages in this area. It is already the workshop of the world, accounting for almost a third of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.CD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>global manufacturing</u></a>. It produces <a href="https://worldsteel.org/wp-content/uploads/World-Steel-in-Figures-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than half</u></a> of the world’s steel and <a href="https://www.harboraluminum.com/en/top-aluminum-producing-countries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two-thirds of its aluminum</u></a>. It is also far ahead of anyone else in most green industry. It produces <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd8e7175-9423-4042-a6f7-c404afdfcda4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80%</u></a> of global solar panels, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-breaking-china-ev-supply-chain-dominance/?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80% of lithium-ion batteries</u></a>, about <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/how-china-became-the-worlds-clean-tech-giant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>60% of wind turbines</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/20/are-chinese-evs-taking-over-the-car-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>58% of EVs</u></a>. It also has installed more <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/installed-solar-pv-capacity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solar</u></a> and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1421763/global-wind-energy-generation-leading-countries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wind</u></a>, both onshore and offshore, than any other country by far.</p><p>Frankly, China was already positioned to more or less dominate the green energy and industry space. But under Biden, America has belatedly attempted to stand up a competing green manufacturing base, and it is working. Solar and battery investment is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/soaring-us-tax-credit-deals-boost-solar-storage-build-2024-09-06/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>skyrocketing</u></a>, as is <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/C307RC1Q027SBEA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>manufacturing</u></a>.</p><p>Trump has promised to flush all that down the toilet. He has promised to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed4b352b-5c06-4f8d-9df7-1b1f9fecb269" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>repeal the Inflation Reduction Act</u></a>, the keystone Biden climate law, and gut the entire environmental protection apparatus. It’s an open question whether or not he will go that far, but if markets are any judge, the stocks of many American renewable and green industry companies <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/trump-market-ishares-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>plunged</u></a> on the news of his victory. If Republicans win the House (which is not yet counted at time of writing), then I suspect at least a partial repeal of Biden’s climate achievements. That is basically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>what Trump did</u></a> during his last term.</p><p>It might not even take that much. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/opinion/trump-electric-vehicles-china.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Robinson Meyer outlines</u></a>, Trump already strangled an incipient transition to EVs among U.S. automakers during his first term simply with some regulatory adjustments. The ongoing transition has been rocky for some companies, particularly Ford, and it would not take much to tip them back towards traditional cars.</p><p>If that happens then China will not have even a potential peer competitor — it will own more or less the whole green economy going forward. European, Japanese, and Korean companies might carve out a modest niche, but Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia will by and large be decarbonized and powered by Chinese products.</p><p>China has an even bigger opportunity when it comes to diplomacy. The keystone of American dominance is its alliance system. Its relationships through NATO and with New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, and so on provides a public good of security in which those countries feel less need to spend hugely on defense, in return to submitting to U.S. control of global financial pipelines and other international institutions.</p><p>Electing a madman as president back in 2016 led many to question whether America was not too politically rotten to be trusted as world hegemon, and sure enough Trump, with his arrogant, erratic, and supremely transactional diplomacy, deeply alienated much of the EU, the most important ally. Biden successfully patched up the relationship, but a second Trump election could be the final straw. One election could be a fluke, but two is a pattern, and in any case Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has suggested</u></a> he might unilaterally tear up NATO. Frankly you’d be a fool to trust American diplomatic promises of any kind from now on, and a huge military buildup among jittery American allies is all but certain. As French President Emanuel Macron <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-german-coalition-collapse-loom-large-european-leaders-meet-budapest-2024-11-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently said</u></a> at an EU summit, “We cannot delegate our security to the Americans forever.”</p><p>This in turn threatens international financial pipelines, either owned or regulated by the U.S. government, like Fedwire, CHIPS, Nacha, and SWIFT, that the U.S. uses for power projection. Sanctions against Russia, for instance, rely on other nations complying with American rules and surveillance on these systems.</p><p>Many, many countries are not going to be happy about the prospect of Donald Trump being able to set the rules and conditions on their international transactions. It will be a ripe opportunity for China to step in with an alternative system, and thereby knock out another pillar of American global power.</p><p>Let me emphasize that none of this is going to happen automatically. China, with its opaque and autocratic regime, has many serious domestic problems. As noted above, its domestic economy is struggling to rebalance towards consumption, and its population is rapidly aging. That said, the government recently announced a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2feba22-5064-4eb1-84b1-3003cac36def" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major stimulus package</u></a>, which should boost consumption to some degree.</p><p>If China wanted to replace the dollar as reserve currency, it would have to give up capital controls and currency management, which would require even more wrenching reforms. Similarly, if it wants a lot of uptake on an alternative payments system, it would be well advised to not give in to its usual habit of totalitarian police state surveillance. </p><p>But the opportunity still remains. America has been one of the luckiest countries in world history — blessed in its geographic position, resource base, and with a 160-year record of not suffering major wars on its territory. But with sufficient stupidity, even the largest advantages can be canceled out. Electing one of the worst people in the country to the presidency, again, might just do it.</p>

## 'I got my life back': Veterans with PTSD making progress thanks to service dog program

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

KANSAS CITY, Kan.  — After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.


A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet.


Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.


“A lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,” said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. “They’re isolated. They’re very nervous. They won’t make eye contact. Some won’t leave the house at all.”


The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.


The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.


O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.


"When I got out of the military, I just assumed that you’re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,” O’Brien said.


O’Brien’s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.


Now, O’Brien said she can get back out in public — she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, “things that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.”




Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.


Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi on chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.


“I don’t really like leaving the house because I’m safe there, you know?" Atkinson said. “And having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.”


Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.


“We come from the same backgrounds, different branches,” Atkinson said. “Same issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they’re all very welcoming as well. There’s no judgment.”


O’Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.


“The best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,” O’Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.


“I have to decide to walk out and just deal with life," O'Brien said. "And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it’s it’s getting manageable.”


Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.


“I’m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,” Atkinson said. “Or even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.”


Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and Army, deploying 18 times.


“You’re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness," Siebenmorgen said. "So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can’t do it on your own.”


Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.

## Trump and trade worries cloud COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

Baku, Azerbaijan — The annual U.N. climate summit kicks off Monday with countries readying for tough talks on finance and trade, following a year of weather disasters that have emboldened developing countries in their demands for climate cash.


Delegates gathering in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku are hoping to resolve the summit's top agenda item – a deal for up to $1 trillion in annual climate finance for developing countries.


The summit's negotiating priorities, however, are competing for governments' resources and attention against economic concerns, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and last week's U.S. re-election of Donald Trump, a climate-change denier, as president of the world's biggest economy.


COP29 host Azerbaijan will be tasked with keeping countries focused on agreeing to a new global finance target to replace the current $100 billion pledge expiring this year.


The Caspian Sea nation, often proud of being home to the world's first oil wells, will also be under pressure to show progress from last year's COP28 pledge to transition away from fossil fuels.


The country's oil and gas revenues accounted for 35% of its economy in 2023, down from 50% two years prior. The government says these revenues will continue to decline, to roughly 32% of its GDP this year and 22% by 2028.


Before the summit talks can even begin, countries will need to agree on an agenda by consensus – including an 11th-hour proposal by China to bring trade disputes into the mix.


The Chinese proposal - made on behalf of the fast-developing "BASIC" group of countries including Brazil, India and South Africa - asked for the summit to address "restrictive trade measures" such as the EU's carbon border tariffs going into effect in 2026.


Those concerns have been compounded by Trump's campaign promise to impose 20% tariffs on all foreign goods – and 60% on Chinese goods.


China's request showed it was flexing power following Trump's re-election, which signaled the United States' likely disengagement from global climate cooperation, said Li Shuo, director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.


Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the global treaty to reduce planet-warming emissions.


The European Union, along with current U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, have been pressing China and Gulf oil nations to join the pool of climate finance donor countries.


"If the EU wants to talk about climate finance with China, if it wants to talk NDCs, part of the conversation should be how to resolve our differences on trade and your tariffs," Shuo said.


Extreme pressure


With this year on track to be the hottest on record, experts noted that climate extremes were now challenging rich and poor countries alike – from flooding disasters in Africa, coastal Spain and the U.S. state of North Carolina, to drought gripping South America, Mexico and the U.S. West.


Most countries are not prepared.


"Election results don't alter the laws of physics," said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.


"Unless the world collectively steps up its efforts, the impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe and frequent and will be felt by an increasing number of people in all countries, including in the United States."


Many in Baku were worried that a U.S. disengagement could lead other countries to backpedal on past climate pledges or to scale back future ambitions.

## Trump pressures candidates for Senate Republican leader to fill Cabinet quickly

date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote.


Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.


Trump has not endorsed any candidate in the race, but Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader "must agree" to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.


"Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner," Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled "IMMEDIATELY!"


The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president's power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief "pro-forma" sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.


But with Trump's approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, "100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible." And Thune said in a statement that they must "quickly and decisively" act to get nominees in place and that "all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments."


Cornyn said that "It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump 's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent." He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution.


The social media exchange Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term.


Trump's relationship with Congress — especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations — was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections.


Trump also posted Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year — a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold most of the votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that "Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE."


With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux.


Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott — a longtime friend of Trump's and fierce ally — has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump's endorsement.


Senators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and other people who have Trump's ear.


"We have to be the change," Scott said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures." "That's what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change."


All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a "despicable human being" behind closed doors.


As the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump's Cabinet, many of his allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC's "This Week" that there are "a couple of great options on the table." Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS's "Face the Nation" that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas. He said he would advance "the positions that President Trump has articulated."


"I'll do that in whatever role necessary," said Hagerty, who has endorsed Scott in the leadership race.


While Trump has made only one personnel move public so far, naming Susie Wiles his chief of staff, he has already ruled out two names for top positions.


Trump said Saturday that he would not be inviting Mike Pompeo, his former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as his U.N. ambassador and challenged him for the Republican nomination. Pompeo rallied with Trump on the night before Election Day.


"I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country," Trump posted on his network Truth Social.


Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., reposted on X a message by podcaster Dave Smith suggesting to put pressure to "keep all neocons and war hawks out of the Trump administration."


"The 'stop Pompeo' movement is great, but it's not enough," Smith posted on X. "America First: screw the war machine!"

## 1 dead, 16 hurt after shooting at Alabama’s Tuskegee University

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Atlanta, Georgia — A shooting early Sunday that marred homecoming weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama left one person dead and left 16 others injured, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said. One arrest was announced hours later.


The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Jaquez Myrick, 25, of Montgomery, was taken into custody while leaving the scene of the campus shooting and had been found with a handgun with a machine gun conversion device.


The agency's statement said Myrick faces a federal charge of possession of a machine gun. It did not say whether he was a student at the historically Black university, where the shooting erupted in the early hours on Sunday as the school's 100th Homecoming Week was winding down. Authorities said an 18-year-old man who died was not a university student but that some of the injured were students.


It was not immediately known if Myrick had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.


Twelve people were wounded by gunfire, and four others sustained injuries not related to the gunshots, the state agency said earlier. Their conditions were not immediately released.


The FBI joined the investigation and said it is seeking tips from the public, as well as any video witnesses might have. It set up a site online for people to upload video.


Tuskegee University announced that classes Monday have been canceled. Grief counselors will be available to help students in the university's chapel.


The parents of the victim were notified, and several of the injured were being treated at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist South Hospital in Montgomery, the university said in a statement.


An autopsy on the 18-year-old was planned at the state's forensic center in Montgomery, Macon County Coroner Hal Bentley told The Associated Press on Sunday.


Tuskegee city's police chief, Patrick Mardis, said the injured included a female student who was shot in the stomach and a male student who was shot in the arm.


City police were responding to an unrelated double shooting off campus when officers got the call about the university shooting at the West Commons on-campus apartments, Mardis said.


"Some idiots started shooting," Mardis told the news site Al.com. "You couldn't get the emergency vehicles in there, there were so many people there."


A person who answered the phone at the office of Tuskegee's police chief said no other information was available.


"Special Agents are still in the process of gathering and examining information relative to the sequence of events which ultimately led to the shooting," the state law enforcement agency said in a statement.


In his 37 years as coroner, Bentley said he couldn't recall any shootings during the school's past homecoming celebrations. The mood around the small town of around 9,000 people was somber, he said.


The shooting left everyone in the university community shaken, said Amare' Hardee, a senior from Tallahassee, Florida, who is president of the student government association.


"This senseless act of violence has touched each of us, whether directly or indirectly," he said at the school's homecoming convocation Sunday morning.


A pastor who leads the Tuskegee National Alumni Association told those at Sunday's convocation service that the shooting is a reminder of the fragility of life.


"It is in moments like these that we need to be reminded not to stand on our own understanding because in a moment like this, I don't have understanding," said the Rev. James Quincy III.


"I can only rely on my faith, and my prayer for our entire family, this community, as we close out this marvelous family reunion that we shared this week," Quincy said, "and most importantly because of that faith walk and that trust in God, that we have resilience, resilience in the time of trouble."


Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama — the school's opponent for Tuskegee's homecoming football game on Saturday — released a statement expressing sympathy.


"Today, our hearts are with the Tuskegee family as they face the tragic aftermath of the recent shooting on campus," the college said. "We extend our deepest condolences to those impacted and pray for healing and justice. Miles College stands with you in this difficult time."


Sunday's shooting comes just over a year after four people were injured in a shooting at a Tuskegee University student housing complex. In that shooting, two visitors to the campus were shot and two students were hurt while trying to leave the scene of what campus officials described as an "unauthorized party" in September 2023, the Montgomery Advertiser reported.


About 3,000 students are enrolled at the university about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Alabama's capital city of Montgomery.


The university was the first historically Black college to be designated as a Registered National Landmark in 1966. It was also designated a National Historic Site in 1974, according to the school's website.


Norma Clayton, chairwoman of the board of the trustees, said at the Sunday morning service that "we will get through this together because in tough times, tough people band together and they survive."

## Biden to lobby Trump not to walk away from Ukraine

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss top domestic and foreign policy priorities with President-elect Donald Trump when the two meet Wednesday, and will urge him not to abandon Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.


Republican Trump will take office on Jan. 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said.


In an interview on CBS News' "Face the Nation" show, Sullivan said Biden's top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what's happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East.


"The president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand, and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these issues when he takes office," Sullivan said.


While Sullivan did not specify which topics the two would discuss, their conversation will almost certainly feature Ukraine's war with Russia, which Trump has pledged to end swiftly, although he did not say how.


"President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe," Sullivan said.


When asked if that means Biden will ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred.


"I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term," Sullivan said.


Ukraine funding


Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars' worth of U.S. military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February of 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticized and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers.


Sullivan's comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war.


Trump insisted last year that Russian President Vladimir Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the time. He told Reuters Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject, and Biden has never suggested.


Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday he was not aware of any details of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to end the Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail major concessions for Kyiv.


According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take control of the U.S. Senate with a 52-seat majority.


Control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the next Congress is not yet clear with some votes still being counted. Republicans have won 213 seats, according to Edison Research, just shy of the 218 needed for a majority. If Republicans win both chambers, it will mean most of Trump's agenda will have a significantly easier time passing through Congress.


Republican U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state, criticized U.S. funding for Ukraine in a CBS interview.


"The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation," Hagerty said.


The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war.


Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war.


Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies.

## California farmers enjoy pistachio boom, with much of it headed to China

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Lost Hills, California — In a sprawling plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and shipped off to groceries around the world.


Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the United States has surpassed Iran to become the world's top exporter of the nut.


"There has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online," said Zachary Fraser, president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. "You are starting to see the fruit of people's vision from 40 years ago."


California grows more than a third of the country's vegetables and three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the state's sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows.


Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during the Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey roasted.


The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as 40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards.


Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts hauled to a massive processing facility to be prepped for sale.


"There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios," Yraceburu said. "The world wants more."


Pistachios are poised to weather California's dry spells better than its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said.


Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for decades longer, Yraceburu said.


Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out.


Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said.


The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' shift into perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton, according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of California.


Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can't just be swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute's Water Policy Center.


But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don't. They can go longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the critical resource, he said.


When farmers decide what to plant, "I think the biggest thing is the market and where is the market," Franklin said. "And water is right below that."


Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014 state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some rural areas. About a fifth of California's pistachio crop is grown in areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out of production.


But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David Magana, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California.


Pistachios require about 3,700 cubic meters (3 acre-feet) of water per 0.4 hectares (acre) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while fetching a higher price, he said.


"You see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less acreage," Magana said. "I haven't seen pistachio orchards being pulled out."

## New York parks employee dies fighting fires as air quality warnings issued in region

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

POMPTON LAKES, N.J. — A New York parks employee died battling one of a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions that have prompted air quality warnings in both states, authorities said Sunday. 


The worker died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border, according to reports from the Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue and the New York state forestry services. 


“Rip brother your shift is over job well done,” the New York State forestry services post said. 


New York State Police said they were investigating the death amid the fire in Sterling Forest located in Greenwood Lake and identified the victim as Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state Parks and Recreation aide employed by the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department. 


The fires in New York and New Jersey come as firefighters are also battling a wildfire in California. 


The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to 10 square kilometers near the border in Passaic County’s West Milford and Orange County, New York. Officials said Sunday the blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek wildfire, was now threatening 14 Greenwood Lake structures as well as two New Jersey homes and eight buildings in that state's Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. 


Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease. 


New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a 70-hectare fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered. 


Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County. 


Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 142-hectare Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of “incendiary or tracer ammunition” was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday. 


In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves burned more than 81 hectares in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park that comprises about 8.8 square kilometers in the city 16 kilometers north of Boston. 


“This is a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years,” the Lynn Fire Department said in a statement on social media as firefighters continued to battle the blaze, blaming its intensely on low humidity as well as winds and dry leaves on the ground. 


It was one of many brush fires that cropped up across the region. In Foxborough, fire crews said that containing a wildfire at the F. Gilbert Hills State Forest would be a “a multi-day event.” 


Wind gusts topped 64 kph on Saturday, and less-powerful gusts continued Sunday. 


Firefighters and forest agencies warned against outdoor burning. 


The drier-than-normal weather is expected to continue, and virtually all of New England is categorized as being in drought or being abnormally dry. Most of the region was expected to see some light rain Sunday night, but there are no large rainfall events in the forecast, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jerry Combs. 


Firefighters in California were also battling a scattering of blazes over the weekend, including one north of Los Angeles that had burned more than 100 structures. 


Evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings for residents in several areas of Ventura County, where the Mountain Fire held at about 83 square kilometers and was 26% contained, authorities said.

## Donald Trump's US presidential victory was sweeping

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — In the end, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s victory in last week’s 2024 national election for a new four-year presidential term in the White House was sweeping.


Ahead of the Nov. 5 election, national polling showed Vice President Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Trump, maybe a percentage point or two, depending on the survey.




Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Trump, a Republican, were virtually deadlocked, the surveys indicated, in seven political battleground states that election analysts viewed as critical to the election outcome.


Trump, however, captured all seven states, leading to his lopsided edge in the state-by-state vote count in the Electoral College, 312 to 226, which determines the outcome of U.S. presidential elections. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270. He won the seven battleground states by a range of just under 1% in Wisconsin to more than 6% in Arizona.


Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:




On January 20, 2025, the 78-year-old Trump will take office as the country’s 47th president and the first president to win two nonconsecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. He is the oldest elected president in U.S. history.


Trump also won the popular vote, the first Republican candidate to do so since former President George W. Bush in 2004.


While the last ballots are still being counted, Trump already is the clear winner, capturing nearly 75 million votes so far to just under 71 million for Harris, a 50.5% to 47.9% edge for Trump.


Trump’s 2024 vote tally was about the same as the 74 million he received in losing the 2020 election to Democratic President Joe Biden, but the vote for Harris was about 10 million fewer than Biden received.




U.S. pollsters often like to say their surveys are just a snapshot in time, and not necessarily predictive.


But over Trump’s three runs for the presidency since 2016, his level of support has consistently been underestimated in polling, no matter how many times pollsters have tried to adjust their published results to account for a hidden Trump vote from people unwilling to tell even anonymous surveyors that, yes, when they went to polling centers or cast mail-in ballots, he was their choice.


Exit polls showed that women voters favored Harris and men Trump. More educated voters went for Harris, while those without college degrees voted for Trump, but nearly two-thirds of Americans do not have a college degree.




In amassing his majority vote, Trump cut into two traditional Democratic constituencies, Black and Latino voters.


According to The Associated Press’ VoteCast survey of voters, 16% of Black voters supported Trump in 2024, double that from his 2020 campaign. In comparison, 83% of Black voters supported Kamala Harris, down from the 91% who supported Biden in 2020.


Democrats also lost ground among Latino voters, with 56% voting for Harris in 2024 compared to 63% for Biden in 2020. Trump’s support grew from 35% four years ago to 42% this year.

## VOA immigration weekly recap, Nov. 3-9, 2024

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Editor's note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.


What to expect on immigration under a new Trump administration 


President-elect Donald Trump put immigration at the front of his campaign agenda, pledging to bring what he calls “unprecedented order” to the southern border and launch the nation’s largest mass deportation operation of undocumented immigrants on his first day in office. VOA immigration reporter Aline Barros has more.


US judge rules against Biden legalization program for immigrant spouses


A U.S. judge in Texas ruled Thursday against President Joe Biden's program offering a path to citizenship for certain immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens, a blow that could keep the program blocked through Biden's final months in office. U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker found the program exceeded Biden's executive authority. The program offers a path to citizenship to about 500,000 immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally if they are married to U.S. citizens. Reuters reports.


After election, Kenya-born legislator heads to Minnesota Capitol


Huldah Momanyi Hiltsley made history November 5 by becoming the first Kenya-born immigrant elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. She describes her victory as a testament to resilience, determination and the realization of the American dream. Standing in the State Capitol for the first time on the morning of her orientation, Hiltsley told VOA she was overwhelmed with emotions and eager to start her journey as an elected official. Produced by Abdushakur Aboud.


Families separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious minutes


Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in different countries. Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with their loved ones. The Associated Press reports.


Immigration around the world


Migrant caravan of 3,000 heads north in Mexico


A caravan of approximately 3,000 migrants set off Tuesday from southern Mexico, headed toward the United States on the day when U.S. voters were deciding between U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Immigration has been a key issue in the U.S. election campaign. Before heading northward, the migrants gathered in Tapachula, the capital of the southern Chiapas state, carrying banners with messages such as "NO MORE MIGRANT BLOOD" and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe, an important religious and cultural symbol in Mexico, according to witnesses. Reuters reports.


Ukrainian physicians find homes – and jobs – in Latvia



More than 160,000 Ukrainians fled their home country and headed to the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania since the Russian invasion. Physicians were among the 50,000 or so refugees who went to Latvia. Vladislavs Andrejevs spoke with some of them in Riga. Anna Rice narrates his story.


Israel notifies UN it will not cooperate with UN agency for Palestinian refugees 


Near-universal concern and condemnation have followed Israel’s formal announcement to the United Nations that it will not cooperate with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, after Israel’s parliament voted to cut ties last week. In Washington, at the U.N. and on the ground, officials and residents are raising alarms over the disintegrating humanitarian situation in Gaza and elsewhere. VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell reports from Washington.


News brief 


— Former U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer Leonard Darnell George, 42, of San Diego was sentenced in federal court Oct. 25 to 23 years in prison for accepting bribes to allow unauthorized migrants and vehicles containing methamphetamine and other illicit drugs to pass through the border into the U.S.

## 1760 schoolhouse for Black US children holds complicated history of slavery, resilience

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia — A Virginia museum has nearly finished restoring the nation's oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children, where hundreds of mostly enslaved students learned to read through a curriculum that justified slavery. 


The museum, Colonial Williamsburg, also has identified more than 80 children who lined its pinewood benches in the 1760s. 


They include Aberdeen, 5, who was enslaved by a saddle and harness maker. Bristol and George, 7 and 8, were owned by a doctor. Phoebe, 3, was the property of local tavern keepers. 


Another student, Isaac Bee, later emancipated himself. In newspaper ads seeking his capture, his enslaver warned that Bee "can read." 


The museum dedicated the Williamsburg Bray School at a large ceremony on Friday, with plans to open it for public tours this spring. Colonial Williamsburg tells the story of Virginia's colonial capital through interpreters and hundreds of restored buildings. 


'An amazing mirror'


Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch told the crowd outside the refurbished school that it was one of the most important historic moments of the last decade. 


"History is an amazing mirror," Bunch added. "It's a mirror that challenges us and reminds us that, despite what we've achieved, despite all our ideals, America still is a work in progress. But, oh, what an amazing work it is." 


The Cape Cod-style home was built in 1760 and still contains much of its original wood and brick. It will anchor a complicated story about race and education, but also resistance, before the American Revolution. 


The school rationalized slavery within a religious framework and encouraged children to accept their fates as God's plan. And yet, becoming literate also gave them more agency. The students went on to share what they learned with family members and others who were enslaved. 


"We don't shy away from the fact that this was a pro-slavery school," said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William & Mary's Bray School Lab, a partnership between the university and museum. 


But she said the school takes on a different meaning in the 21st century. 


"It's a story of resilience and resistance," Lee said. "And I put the resilience of the Bray School on a continuum that brings us to today." 


To underscore the point, the lab has been seeking descendants of the students, with some success. 




They include Janice Canaday, 67, who also is the museum's African American community engagement manager. Her lineage traces back to the students Elisha and Mary Jones. 


"It grounds you," said Canaday, who grew up feeling little connection to history. "That's where your power is. And those are the things that give you strength — to know what your family has come through." 


Franklin's idea


The Bray School was established in Williamsburg and other colonial cities at the recommendation of founding father Benjamin Franklin. He was a member of a London-based Anglican charity that was named after Thomas Bray, an English clergyman and philanthropist. 


The Bray School was exceptional for its time. White leaders across much of Colonial America forbade educating enslaved people, fearing literacy would encourage them to seek freedom. 


The white teacher at the Williamsburg school, a widow named Ann Wager, taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3 to 10. The school closed with her death in 1774. 


The schoolhouse became a private home before it was incorporated into William & Mary's growing campus. The building was moved and expanded for various purposes, including student housing. 


Historians identified the structure in 2020 through a scientific method that examines tree rings in lumber. Last year, it was transported to Colonial Williamsburg, which includes parts of the original city. 


The museum and university have focused on restoring the schoolhouse, researching its curriculum and finding descendants of former students. 


The lab has been able to link some people to the Jones and Ashby families, two free Black households that had students in the school, said Elizabeth Drembus, the lab's genealogist. 


But the effort has faced steep challenges: Most enslaved people were stripped of their identities and separated from their families, so there are limited records. And only three years of school rosters have survived. 


They 'weren't considered people'


Drembus is talking to people in the region about their family histories and working backward. She also is sifting through 18th-century property records, tax documents and enslavers' diaries. 


"When you're talking about researching formerly enslaved people, records were kept very differently because they weren't considered people," Drembus said. 


Researching the curriculum has been easier. The English charity cataloged the books it sent to the schools, said Katie McKinney, an associate curator of maps and prints at the museum. 


Materials include a small spelling primer, a copy of which was located in Germany, that begins with the alphabet and moves on to syllables, such as "Beg leg meg peg." 


Students also received a more sophisticated speller, bound in sheepskin, as well as the Book of Common Prayer and other Christian texts. 


Meanwhile, the schoolhouse has been mostly restored. About 75% of the original floor has survived, allowing visitors to walk where the children and teacher placed their feet. 


Canaday, whose familial roots include two Bray School students, wondered on a recent visit if any of the children "felt safe in here, whether they felt loved." 


Canaday noted that the teacher, Wager, was the mother of at least two kids. 


"Did some of her mothering bleed over into what she showed those children?" Canaday said. "There are moments when we forget to go by the rules and humanity takes over. I wonder how many times that happened in these spaces."

## With holidays approaching, US stores stock more supersize TV sets

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.


Forget the 165-centimeter TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 2.4 meters diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.


Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.


The 38,100 televisions of at least 246 centimeters sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs — the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 — and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.


"It's really taken off this year," Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.


Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 246 centimeters was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 249-centimeter TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.


Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 949-centimeter Sony for his 1,300-square-meter house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 216-centimeter TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.


"We just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, 'Why not?'" he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. "You get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You're sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene."


The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.


Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.




The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of 5 centimeters in both 2021 and 2022, and 216-centimeter TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 249-centimeter TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 279-292 centimeters are on the market right now, he said.


"You get better resolution over time," Kowalski said. "You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it's easier to produce those sets and improve the technology."


Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as "incredible."


"If you're watching YouTube TV content or ' NFL Sunday Ticket,' you can actually get four screens up, and that's four 48-inch (122-centimeter) screens on it," he said.


Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 249-centimeter lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.


James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.


"It's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience," Fishler said. "They want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. "


Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, its Sam's Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.


TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 254- to 305-centimeter image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.


"A dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors," Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. "But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV."


Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, "It's still a niche business."


"A lot of people just don't have the space to put one of those in," he added.


Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 249-centimeter TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.


But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 249-centimeter TV is actually just 1.8-3.6 meters feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.


If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?


"I think we'll have to wait and see," Fishler said.

## A Texas border county backed Democrats for generations; Trump won it decisively

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas — Jorge Bazán's family has lived on the U.S.-Mexico border for generations and voted for Democrats as long as he can remember.


He broke the family tradition this year and voted for Donald Trump because he doesn't trust the Democratic Party's economic policies.


"I think they forgot about the middle class," said Bazán, who works for the utility company in Rio Grande City, seat of the most Hispanic county in the nation. "People are suffering right now. Everything's very expensive."


The South Texas region — stretching from San Antonio to the Rio Grande Valley — has long been a Democratic stronghold. A slide toward Trump in 2020 rattled Democrats in the predominately Hispanic area, where for decades Republicans seldom bothered to field candidates in local races. However, few Democrats expected the dramatic realignment that happened Tuesday, when Trump flipped several counties along the border including Hidalgo and Cameron, the two most populous counties in the Rio Grande Valley.


In Starr County, where Bazán lives, voters backed a Republican presidential candidate for the first time in a century. The predominantly Hispanic and working-class rural county, with a median household income of $36,000 that's one of the lowest in the nation, gave Trump a 16 percentage-point victory margin over Vice President Kamala Harris. Roughly 2 million residents live at Texas' southernmost point, among vast tracts of farmland and many state and federal agents patrolling the border.


Trump's victories in the Rio Grande Valley starkly showed how working-class voters nationwide are shifting toward Republicans. That includes voters on the Texas border, where many Democrats long argued that Trump's promised crackdowns on immigration would turn off voters.




"I was always a lifelong Democrat, but I decided to change to Republican with the political landscape that it is now," said Luis Meza, a 32-year-old Starr County voter. "I felt that going Republican was the better choice, especially with the issues of immigration and everything like that that's going on."


Meza said that he was against Trump at first but noticed too few changes under President Joe Biden to justify voting for Harris.


Biden won Hidalgo County by less than half the margin that Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Since then, Republicans have invested millions of dollars to persuade Hispanic and working-class voters soured by Democratic policies.


A similar scenario played out in the state's three most competitive races in nearby counties. Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz claimed a decisive victory in the 15th Congressional District. In the two other races, seasoned Democratic incumbents barely held on to their seats.


Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar narrowly escaped defeat against a political newcomer in the most competitive race of his two-decade career. Cuellar, whose district includes Rio Grande City, was indicted this year on bribery and other charges for allegedly accepting $600,000 from companies in Mexico and Azerbaijan. His support for abortion restrictions makes him one of the most conservative Democrats in the House.


Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez also narrowly escaped defeat by an opponent he comfortably beat two years ago.


Nationally, Black and Latino voters appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, according to AP VoteCast data. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris, but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in 2020. Trump's support among those groups appeared to rise slightly compared to 2020.


In McAllen, Texas, Jose Luis Borrego said that inflation and the promise of tougher border restrictions made him vote for a Republican presidential candidate for the first time.


"I wanted to see change and that's why I did vote for Trump. I did vote red. I would not call myself a Republican" Borrego, 37, said. He said that he voted for Hillary Clinton and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in prior elections.


Borrego's whole family voted Trump.


"We just (made) this choice, because we didn't have another choice that we felt comfortable with," he said.


Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he had months of visits to the region during his campaign race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. In a victory speech on Election Day, Cruz said Hispanic voters are leaving the Democratic Party because of immigration.


"They are coming home to conservative values they never left. They understand something the liberal elites never will: There's nothing progressive about open borders," Cruz said. "There is nothing Latino about letting criminals roam free."


Michael Mireles, the director of civil engagement for labor rights group La Unión del Pueblo Entero, believes that Democrats did not engage Hispanic voters enough about the issues that concern them.


"I think that folks on the Democratic side have been really slow to have those conversations with Latino households and families." Mireles said in Hidalgo County after Election Day.


"We can't wait for a big election to have those conversations. By that point, it's too late."

## Florida's iconic Key deer face uncertain future as seas rise

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

BIG PINE KEY, Florida — The world's only Key deer, the smallest subspecies of the white-tailed deer, are found in piney and marshy wetlands bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico on the Florida Keys. For years, their biggest threat was being struck by vehicles speeding along U.S. Highway 1 or local roads.


But those waters surrounding the islands now pose the biggest long-term risk for this herd of about 800 deer as sea rise jeopardizes their sole habitat.


These charismatic diminutive deer have been listed as endangered for almost 60 years after their numbers dipped to about 50 from hunting and poaching long ago. Yet they've made a tremendous comeback, with a peak population of about 1,000 in the mid-2010s before a deadly parasite and Hurricane Irma took a heavy toll.


However, experts and wildlife advocates say this conservation success story today is at risk of being undone by climate change. Sea level rise is already altering the landscape of Big Pine Key and at least 20 smaller islands the deer call home.


The bulk of the deer live on Big Pine Key, a marshy island 48 kilometers from Key West. They roam neighborhoods where about 4,500 people live, browsing on lush gardens and drinking water from buckets residents put out for them as natural freshwater supplies dwindle.


Key deer are far smaller than their North American counterparts, with the biggest bucks standing less than 1 meter tall at the shoulder and weighing around 34 kilograms.


"They were always vulnerable," said Chris Bergh, the South Florida program manager for the Nature Conservancy, who oversees sea level rise projects and lives in Big Pine Key. "They're much more vulnerable now. And with the sea level rising and their habitat shrinking, they're becoming even more so."


Highway deer deaths


On Big Pine Key, mom and pop bars and restaurants dot either side of bustling U.S. 1, along with gas stations and small motels. The main industry revolves around the water — charter boats, fishing, diving, vacation rentals.


To protect the deer from being hit by vehicles, signs tell motorists they're entering deer habitat. A 3.2-kilometer stretch of U.S. 1 is elevated and fenced, allowing deer to cross under the road. And speed limits are strictly enforced, often frustrating tourists driving to Key West.


Deer still are struck at an alarming rate. "The bottom line is that some 90 to 120 deer are known to be killed by vehicles each year," said Jan Svejkovsky, chief scientist for Save Our Key Deer.


Wildlife officials have worked hard get out the message: Don't feed Key deer. They fear deer will approach cars and go near roadways for handouts.


Even with the traffic deaths, the population has remained stable. But a larger threat looms.




Climate change impacts on deer


The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that by 2100, seas will rise 0.5 to 2 meters in parts of the Florida Keys. The threat is greatest to low lying islands like Big Pine Key, where the highest point is only about 2.4 meters above sea level.


Sea rise will continue to shrink freshwater and food sources Key deer need to survive, experts say.


"So as the sea rises, that shrinks the amount of available freshwater, the amount of available, palatable vegetation, the places for bearing their young," said Bergh of the Nature Conservancy. "It puts them increasingly in conflict with people who are also occupying those higher grounds."


In addition to sea rise, climate change brings the threat of stronger hurricanes, with storm surges that can damage deer habitat and freshwater supplies.


Salt water intrusion also is responsible for killing many of the Florida slash pines that gave Big Pine Key its name. Mangroves are growing in their place in an ever-changing environment, choking deer habitat even more.


Shrinking habitat drives deer to neighborhoods


Key deer on Big Pine Key move through neighborhoods, munching on gardens. Some people even have names for ones that frequent their yards.


"They are very gentle, very, very gentle," said Connie Ritchie, who sometimes sees about 30 deer a day. "And the longer you live here, the more you want to protect them. Big time. Protect them because they're so innocent."


"They have certain plants that they really love," Ritchie said, noting that the federal deer refuge here hosts events where it gives away native plants. "So they're trying to teach us to plant the plants that the deer won't eat."


Development on Big Pine Key began in the 1970s and 1980s "when entire swaths of land on islands that still held deer were developed into planned subdivisions, complete with saltwater canal networks to provide lot-buyers with direct water access," said Svejkovsky of Save Our Key Deer.


While the key remains mostly rural with modest Florida bungalows and more palatial places, development has taken away some deer habitat.


"We have lots of people and the wildlife living in the same really concentrated area," said Katy Hosokawa, a park ranger at the National Key Deer Refuge, established in 1957 on 3,457 hectares of Big Pine Key. "So the more houses that we build, or the less lands that we have protected, the less areas that they have that are safe."


The deer have adapted to the humans and move freely between wild spaces and the neighborhoods. "They roam, they spend their day grazing," Hosokawa said. "We don't have a really nutritionally dense soil, so they need to eat a lot of food to get what they need. But trust me, they're very good at it. If it's soft and tender, they will try to eat it."


Future of the deer


The future, while uncertain, looks grim.


Just 15 centimeters of sea rise, expected by 2030, would mean loss of 16% of the freshwater holes on Big Pine Key, said Nova Silvy, professor emeritus with Texas A&M University who has studied Key deer since 1968 and has lived here for several years.


By 2050, sea rise is expected to overtake about 84% of the 805 hectares of the preferred habitat on Big Pine Key — and "the deer will already be gone," Silvy said.


What happens if the deer can't survive in the Keys?


Bergh said he prefers to buy more time to keep the deer viable here. "And at some point, if that's no longer possible, I personally think zoos are the most responsible alternative," he said. "But that's a terrible alternative. Who wants that for a wild animal?"


In rare instances, scientists have been allowed to relocate endangered species threatened by climate change as a last resort. But Silvy said, "The problem is if you take them any other place with deer, they're going to interbreed and then you've lost the Key deer."

## Why AP called Arizona for Trump

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Associated Press declared President-elect Donald Trump the winner in Arizona on Saturday night after vote updates in Maricopa and other counties added to his overall lead, putting the state out of reach for Vice President Kamala Harris.


At the time the AP called the race at 9:21 p.m. ET, Trump led Harris, 52.6% to 46.4%, a margin of about 185,000 votes. Harris needed to win about 7 out of every 10 votes of the roughly 443,000 uncounted ballots remaining, a percentage that has steadily grown as additional votes were counted.


Trump has now swept all seven of the hotly contested presidential battlegrounds, winning 312 electoral votes, compared to 226 for Harris. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270.


In 2020, President Joe Biden carried the state narrowly over Trump, but he won Maricopa County by a margin of 50 percentage points to 48. On Saturday, Trump was leading Harris 52 to 47.


The AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can't close the gap and overtake the vote leader.


Here's a look at how the AP called this race:


Candidates: President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver (Libertarian) vs. Jill Stein (Green).


Winner: Trump.


Poll closing time: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET.


About the race: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state, where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election Day.


Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border.


Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by Republicans, then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate contests and the governorship since 2018.


Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than 70 years.


Both candidates made a play for vote-rich Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe. Trump carried the county by 3 points in 2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%.


Why AP called the race: In statewide elections going back a dozen years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz.


Harris had large leads over Trump in all four counties, but she far underperformed Biden's showing from 2020.


She was trailing Trump in decisive Maricopa County, which Biden won in 2020 and has been a must-win county for statewide Democratic candidates in recent elections.


Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on election night, Trump has consistently led since then.


The AP's analysis of Arizona's voting history and political demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris' favor, they would not be enough to give her the lead.

## Trump completes swing state sweep by taking Arizona

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Donald Trump won the state of Arizona in this week's U.S. presidential election, U.S. TV networks projected on Saturday, completing the Republican's sweep of all seven swing states.


After four days of counting in the southwest state with a large Hispanic population, CNN and NBC projected Trump had obtained its 11 electoral votes as he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris.


Outgoing President Joe Biden scored a narrow but crucial victory in Arizona in 2020 that condemned Trump to defeat after his first term in office.


The scale and strength of Trump's comeback, which also saw the real estate tycoon win the popular vote by a margin of around 4 million votes, has sent shockwaves through the defeated Democratic Party.


The Republicans have already regained control of the Senate and look well set to retain a majority in the House of Representatives thanks to support from white working-class voters and a large share of Hispanics.


CNN has called Republican victories for 213 seats in the House, with 218 needed for a majority in the lower chamber.


The networks' figures show Democrats on 205 seats, although senior party figures are still hoping they can pull off a slim victory that would significantly curtail Trump's powers.


NBC sees the Republicans with 212 seats so far, and 204 for the Democrats.


The other six swing states won by Trump in the presidential race are Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia.


The latest good news for Trump came as the White House said Biden would meet with the president-elect at the White House on Wednesday.


Trump -- who never conceded his 2020 loss -- sealed a remarkable comeback to the presidency in the November 5 vote, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of U.S. politics dominated by his hardline right-wing stance.


This type of meeting between the outgoing and incoming presidents was considered customary, but Trump did not invite Biden for one after making unsubstantiated election fraud claims that culminated in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.


Trump also broke with precedent by skipping Biden's inauguration, but the White House has said the Democratic president will attend the upcoming ceremony.


Biden's meeting with Trump will take place in the Oval Office, the White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the ex-president's return to power.


Trump, the 78-year-old ex-reality TV star, won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a fascist.


Exit polls showed that voters' top concerns remained the economy and inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID pandemic.


The 81-year-old president, who dropped out of the White House race in July over concerns about his age, health and mental acuity, called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on the election win.


Trump 2.0


Democrats have been pointing fingers over who is to blame for Harris' decisive loss after she replaced Biden at the top of the ticket roughly 100 days before the election.


Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took aim at Biden, telling The New York Times that "had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race."


As the Democrats weigh what went wrong, Trump has begun to assemble his second administration by naming campaign manager Susie Wiles to serve as his White House chief of staff.


She is the first woman to be named to the high-profile role and the Republican's first appointment to his incoming administration.


Jockeying for jobs


Trump on Saturday ruled out re-appointing two senior figures from his first administration, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.


Former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is seen as a front-runner for the secretary of state position, as is Florida Senator Marco Rubio who called Trump a "con artist" and the "most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency" in 2016.


The other front-runners for a place in the Trump 2.0 administration reflect the significant changes it is likely to implement.


Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading figure in the anti-vaccine movement for whom Trump has pledged a "big role" in health care, told NBC News on Wednesday that "I'm not going to take away anybody's vaccines."


The world's richest man, Elon Musk, could also be in line for a job auditing government waste after the right-wing SpaceX, Tesla and X boss enthusiastically backed Trump.

## Trump says Haley, Pompeo will not join his administration

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. 


"I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation," Trump posted on social media. "I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our country." 


Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his January 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee. 


Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries.  


Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Trump, has been mentioned in some media reports as a possible defense secretary and also had been seen a potential Republican presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 he would not run. 


Haley and Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. 


During his first term as president, Trump made some key personnel announcements via social media posts. 


Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and former Senator Kelly Loeffler.

## Record 13 women will be governors in US next year

date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA

The election of Republican Kelly Ayotte as New Hampshire's governor means 13 women will serve as a state's chief executive next year, breaking the record of 12 set after the 2022 elections.


Governors hold powerful sway in American politics, shaping state policy and often using the experience and profile gained to launch campaigns for higher offices.


"It matters to have women in those roles to normalize the image of women in political leadership and even more specifically in executive leadership, where they’re the sole leader, not just a member of a team," said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics.


Governor Gretchen Whitmer was floated as a potential Democratic nominee for president after President Joe Biden exited the race. Republican South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem was thought to be in the running for President-elect Donald Trump's vice presidential post.


Ayotte, a former U.S. senator, defeated the Democratic nominee Joyce Craig, a former mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city.


Still, 18 states have never had a woman in the governor’s office.


"This is another side of political leadership where women continue to be underrepresented," Dittmar said. "Thirteen out of 50 is still underrepresentation."


With two women vying for governor in New Hampshire, a new record for female governors was inevitable. The state has a long history of electing women. As a senator, Ayotte was part of the nation’s first all-female congressional delegation. It was also the first state to have a female governor, state Senate president and House speaker at the same time, and the first to have a female majority in its Senate. Ayotte will be the state's third woman to be governor.


"Being a woman isn’t really that critical to her political persona," Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College, said of Ayotte.


Both Ayotte and Craig said their gender hasn’t come up on the campaign trail although reproductive rights often took front and center.




In her campaign, Craig attacked Ayotte’s record on abortion, and both candidates released TV ads detailing their own miscarriages. Ayotte said she will veto any bill further restricting abortion in New Hampshire where it is illegal after 24 weeks of pregnancy.


When Ayotte is sworn in, five Republican women will serve as governor at the same time, another new high. The other eight are Democrats.


New Hampshire's was one of the few competitive gubernatorial races among the 11 this year. More inroads or setbacks for women’s representation could come in 2026 when 36 states will elect governors.Most voters tend to cast their ballots based on party loyalty and ideology rather than gender, Dittmar said. However, she noted female candidates often face layers of scrutiny that male counterparts largely avoid, with voters judging such things as a woman's intelligence, appearance and even dating history with a sharper lens.


The small gain for women in governor’s offices comes as Vice President Kamala Harris failed in her effort to become the first female president.


"I would not suggest to you that Kamala Harris lost a race because she was a woman, because she was a Black and South Asian woman," Dittmar said. "We would also fail to tell the correct story if we didn’t acknowledge the ways in which both gender and race shapes the campaign overall, and also had a direct effect on how Kamala Harris was evaluated by voters, treated by her opponents and even in the media and other spaces."


Executive roles, especially the presidency with its associations like commander in chief, often carry masculine stereotypes that women must work harder to overcome, Dittmar said.


Experts say women confront these perceptions more acutely in executive races, such as for governor and president, than in state legislatures, where women are making historic strides as leaders, filling roles such as speaker and committee chairs.


"Sexism, racism, misogyny, it’s never the silver bullet. It’s never why one voter acts one way or another," said Erin Vilardi, CEO of Vote Run Lead, a left-leaning group that supports women running for state legislatures. "But we have so much of that built in to how we see a leader."
