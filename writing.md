## When the Moon Hits Your Eye by John Scalzi: Review by Adrienne Martini

date: 2025-04-18, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>When the Moon Hits Your Eye</strong>, John Scalzi (Tor 9780765389091, $29.99, 336pp, hc) March 2025.</p>
<p>In <strong>When the Moon Hits Your Eye</strong>, John Scalzi posits a question: What will humanity as a whole do when forced to confront something truly impossible happening right before their eyes? And because this is Scalzi, that impossible thing also needs to be thoroughly ridiculous. In the blink of an eye, the moon  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/04/when-the-moon-hits-your-eye-by-john-scalzi-review-by-adrienne-martini/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## How 'Drop' Creates a Single Location Thriller

<p><em>Drop</em> is a fairly simple concept: Kill your date or your son dies. Sure, you can go into more details but those 7 words are intriguing enough that it almost doesn’t need further explanation.</p>

## Write On: 'NCIS: Origins' Showrunners David J. North and Gina Lucita Monreal

date: 2025-04-17, from: Final Draft blog

 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-ncis-origins-showrunners-david-j-north-and-gina-lucita-monreal" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20NCIS%20Origins%20Showrunners%20David%20J.%20North%20and%20Gina%20Lucita%20Monreal.png" alt="Write On logo of a cell phone with headphones around it featuring the poster of the show NCIS: Origins" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>“If you can make the twists [in the story] hit your character in an emotional way and set up their emotional arc, then when the case twist intersects with them, if it’s hitting them in the deepest way, in the most unexpected way, maybe – then you’ve done your job. So it’s getting that emotional arc to really bounce off of the crime story in the most impactful way,” says Gina Lucita Monreal about the most powerful way to fuse together story and character.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode, we talk with David J. North and Gina Lucita Monreal, showrunners and creators of the CBS show <em>NCIS: Origins</em> that brings a fresh perspective to one of television’s most beloved franchises as it dives into the early career of a young Leroy Jethro Gibbs (played by Mark Harmon in the original <em>NCIS</em>). Set in the 90s, <em>NCIS: Origins</em> taps into the nostalgia of the era, from great music from bands like Pearl Jam to life with pagers and payphones.&nbsp;<br><br>North and Monreal discuss getting to know each other a decade ago writing for the original <em>NCIS</em>, and how now they are pushing the boundaries of procedural television by creating more complex, character-driven storylines.<br><br>“The biggest challenge for us isn’t the going back to the 90s. I mean, I think for a lot of procedural writers, that would have been a challenge, that you’re losing the DNA and the fingerprints, all that stuff. But for Gina and I, that’s not really ever the way we leaned into <em>NCIS</em> or wrote the show. Our episodes were definitely more about the characters, so that’s what we looked forward to. And obviously in each episode of <em>Origins</em>, it’s very character based. I would say the most difficult part of going back is just sticking to canon, knowing it. Weaving in and out, trying to, when you hit something and saying, ‘Okay, well, we know this happened in season three of <em>NCIS</em>,’ so trying to honor it while also using it to our advantage – that’s difficult.&nbsp;<br>We get beat up a lot on X, and sometimes we have to just pick a path,” says North about the challenges of writing beloved characters with a lot of well-known history.&nbsp;<br><br>To learn more about North and Monreal’s writing process and hear their advice for emerging TV writers, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

It happens to many each and every year.&nbsp;<br><br>You just need to persevere through the difficult times — and use the knowledge and experience gained to evolve as a screenwriter.&nbsp;</p>

## ‘The Studio’: How to Craft a Hollywood Satire

<p>Screenwriters are always told to write what they know — and let’s be honest, what you know is how hard it is to break into Hollywood or get the green light for your passion project. The good news? That struggle is incredibly relatable to anyone who’s been inside (or even just curious about) the industry. And no show makes that more apparent than Seth Rogen and Apple TV+’s latest Hollywood satire, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23649128/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_The%2520Studio"><em>The Studio</em></a>.</p>

<p>Ever watched a TV show and wondered ‘How did they make this?’<br><br>From a writer first getting an idea to a showrunner delivering a finished season to a network, there are numerous steps in the making of a TV show, and not every journey from page to screen is the same. Some TV shows get made after years – sometimes even decades – of a TV writer paying their dues. Other TV shows are quickly greenlit. Some shows are shot in a studio. Other shows are shot at multiple locations. Some are designed for a network. Others for cable. Every scenario is different and dependent on various factors.<br><br>That being said, there are <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 stages</span> to the making of pretty much any TV show:</p>

## khōréō: Short Fiction Reviews by A.C. Wise

date: 2025-04-14, from: Locus Magazine

<p>khōréō 4.3</p>
<p>“<strong>The Last Flesh Figure Skaters</strong>” by <strong>Claire Jia-Wen </strong>opens khōréō 4.3 on a strong note, following the rivalry between two competi­tive skaters, each using different kinds of body modifications. The rivalry between them leads to fascination, which develops into a romantic relationship. The story is beautifully written, ex­ploring parents living vicariously through their children and the pressure often put on young athletes to succeed.

## The Fake Muse by Max Besora: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2025-04-13, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Fake Muse</strong>, Max Besora (Open Letter 978-1-96038-533-8, $16.95, 176pp, tp) February 2025.</p>
<p>It will be a bizarre (but wonderful) year if I en­counter another novel as chaotic, obscene, and metatextual as Max Besora’s <strong>The Fake Muse </strong>(translated by Mara Faye Lethem).
