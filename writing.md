## City of Dancing Gargoyles by Tara Campbell: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2024-12-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>City of Dancing Gargoyles</strong>, Tara Campbell (Santa Fe Writers Project 978-1-95163-139-0, $16.95, 280pp, tp) September 2024.</p>
<p>What struck me about Tara Campbell’s 2019 collection, <strong>Midnight at the Or­ganporium</strong>, was the breadth of her imagination and the way she switched between surrealism, revisionist fairytales, and horror. Her story ‘‘Speculum Crede’’ about a very odd work picnic (an understatement) still makes me smile. Campbell’s second novel, <strong>City of Danc­ing Gargoyles </strong> <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/city-of-dancing-gargoyles-by-tara-campbell-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Dark, The Sunday Morning Transport, and Reactor: Short Fiction Reviews by Paula Guran

date: 2024-12-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p>The Dark 8/24, 9/24
The Sunday Morning Transport 7/21/24 – 9/15/24
Reactor 7/24/24 – 9/4/24</p>
<p>Both originals in The Dark #111 are centered on homes. The haunting “<strong>Once There Was Water</strong>” by <strong>Katie McIvor </strong>is really two tales. One is about the past of the fenlands where children are transformed into darkly furred creatures with webbed, clawed hands; the other about a time closer to our present when  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/the-dark-the-sunday-morning-transport-and-reactor-short-fiction-reviews-by-paula-guran/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## 5 Ways To Find a Screenwriting Manager

<p>Many beginner screenwriters wonder how to get an <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/the-differences-between-an-agent-and-a-manager">agent or manager</a> to represent them.&nbsp;<br><br>Agents are a little trickier to get at the early stages, so it’s advisable for a beginner screenwriter to shoot for a manager first: most managers are open to reading <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-is-a-spec-script">spec scripts</a> and developing talent. Managers are generally viewed as “a filtering system” in <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-ways-screenwriters-can-adapt-to-the-marketplace">the screenplay marketplace</a>, so a screenplaywriter with a manager — especially one with a good track record — will be taken more seriously and agents are more likely to take on a writer client with a manager than one without (although there are <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-things-i-did-to-become-a-professional-screenwriter">some exceptions</a>). &nbsp;<br><br>If you think you have <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/3-must-ask-questions-before-you-write-a-sellable-script">a marketable script</a> or a decent writing sample and you’re ready to take that next step, here are <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 ways a screenwriter can find a manager</span>:</p>

## The Tapestry of Time by Kate Heartfield: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

<p><strong>The Tapestry of Time</strong>, Kate Heartfield (Harper Voyager 978-0-00-856781-1, £16.99, 384pp, hc) October 2024.</p>
<p>Sometimes a trope seems so familiar that it begins to feel like a tire that’s lost its tread, even though it’s still fun to drive on. The Nazi preoccupation with occult powers has itself been a preoccupation for writers from all over the spectrum – horror (F.
