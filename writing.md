## Embracing Failure Is a Screenwriter’s Greatest Tool

date: 2025-03-13, from: Final Draft blog

 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/embracing-failure-is-a-screenwriters-greatest-tool" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Image%20of%20a%20woman%20working%20at%20a%20table%20writing%20in%20a%20journal%2c%20crumpled%20paper%20scattered%20around%20her.png" alt="Image of a woman working at a table writing in a journal, crumpled paper scattered around her" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a>

<p>One of the most stressful parts of being a creative is dealing with failure. What if the transition between act two and act three doesn’t work? What if your secondary character’s story arc doesn’t make sense? Even worse – what if your protagonist’s story arc doesn’t make sense?&nbsp;<br><br>The endless possibility of “what-ifs” that highlight the shortcomings of your screenplay can stop you midsentence and make you never return to your draft.&nbsp;<br><br>But what if failure was a part of the process? Instead of looking at it like a bad word with baggage, failure can help screenwriters – at least that’s the philosophy that <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-inside-out-2-co-writers"><em>Inside Out 2</em> screenwriters</a> Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein and the rest of the Pixar team live by.&nbsp;</p>

## We Lived on the Horizon by Erika Swyler: Review by Jake Casella Brookins

date: 2025-03-12, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>We Lived on the Horizon</strong>, Erika Swyler (Atria 9781668049594, $28.99, 336pp, hc) January 2025. Cover design by Laywan Kwan.</p>
<p>The ingredients of Erika Swyler’s <strong>We Lived On the Horizon </strong>are familiar enough: embodied AI, a highly stratified society, a postapocalyptic city os­sifying from techno-utopia to classist nightmare. But Swyler’s combination feels fresh; the main characters here move almost, though not entirely, outside the “real” plot, the revolution planners and  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/03/we-lived-on-the-horizon-by-erika-swyler-review-by-jake-casella-brookins/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## What Is an Antagonist in Screenwriting?

</div> 
<p>An antagonist is a character whose story arc and character arc run in direct opposition to that of the protagonist — the central character driving the plot forward and facing the central conflict of the story head-on.&nbsp;<br><br>The antagonist is usually the driving force behind the conflict the protagonist is facing. They are not always villains, mind you. Antagonists don’t always have to be evil and terrorizing forces. They can also have the best of intentions and oppose the protagonist in more ethical, honorable, and well-meaning ways.&nbsp;<br><br>Here we’ll discuss everything you need to know about antagonists and villains, including what purposes they serve in a story, what types of antagonists/villains you can use, and how you can create the best antagonists for your stories.</p>

## The Year’s Best Science Fiction on Earth 2, edited by Allan Kaster: Review by Alexandra Pierce

<p><strong>The Year’s Best Science Fiction on Earth 2</strong>, Allan Kaster, ed. (Infinivox 978-1-88461-276-3, $19.99, 275pp, tp) December 2024. Cover by Maurizio Manzieri.</p>
<p>With anthology series that focus on robots and AI, and on space and time, I was surprised to come across Infinivox and Allan Kaster doing a series about science fiction on Earth itself; it seemed too mundane.
