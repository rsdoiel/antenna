## Write On: 'Matlock' Creator & Showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman

date: 2025-06-09, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-matlock-creator-showrunner-jennie-snyder-urman" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Matlock%20Creator%20%26%20Showrunner%20Jennie%20Snyder%20Urman.png" alt="Write On Podcast logo of headphones around a cell phone.

<p>“The most important thing that I’ve learned as a storyteller is that I have to treat every character in the show as though they’re the lead in the show, and they are never doing anything so that I can prompt a move from another character. They are doing things that are true to what they want and their motivation. So that’s what makes that architecture hard, because you know you want things to happen, but they have to happen coming out of character, not coming out of what the room wants to see happen. So it’s like the merging of those two. We know what architecture we want, but if it doesn’t feel true to the character, the character wouldn’t do it. Every time, you’ve got to say no, even though it’s tempting, because that is who you have to protect – your characters,” says Jennie Snyder Urman, creator and showrunner of <em>Matlock</em>, about creating story architecture in a series.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode, we talk with Jennie Snyder Urman, who created the reboot of <em>Matlock</em> starring Kathy Bates as Madeline Matlock. We chat about reinventing the beloved character once played by Andy Griffith, the joy of building a show around an older female lawyer and the generational changes in social attitudes women experience, and the sacrifices women often make when it comes to sexual harassment, including Matty herself.&nbsp;<br><br>“[Matty] realizes now, coming back [to the legal profession], what it cost her. And it’s not like every day she was thinking about it. It was just, ‘Oh my gosh, I made these changes to avoid this. And why do I have to make these changes? Why didn’t that person make the changes so I could be in the space where I was comfortable?’ And I think what’s so exciting about Maddie is that she’s still learning new things at 75. I think there’s also a little bit of a wish fulfillment, that you can still evolve, and you still learn, and you still feel new things,” says Urman.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more about <em>Matlock</em>, what we can expect from season 2, and Urman’s advice for writers, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

## 50 Best Dialogue Prompts for Screenwriters

<p>Screenwriting is about more than just plot—it’s about <span style="font-weight: bold;">voice</span>. And nowhere does a screenwriter’s voice shine more clearly than in their characters’ dialogue.<br><br>The best known screenwriters are highly regarded for their dialogue. When you hear dialogue written by screenwriters such as Diablo Cody, Aaron Sorkin, and Quentin Tarantino, you can recognize their distinctive voices almost immediately.&nbsp;<br><br>Dialogue is more than just words on a page. It’s action and depth. It’s how characters flirt, fight, confess, distract, manipulate, and reveal themselves. The best dialogue cuts just a bit deeper than exposition. You feel it suggesting more than it is actually saying — forcing us to start hearing or reading between the lines. That’s where the action part of dialogue lies.&nbsp;<br><br>And when you ground dialogue into character and conflict, it creates unforgettable scenes that could have otherwise been forgettable without a little extra effort and inspiration.&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here are 50 dialogue prompts built specifically for screenwriters. They are designed to inspire character-driven moments, layered scenes, and amazing conflict (the driving force of every scene).&nbsp;</p>

## Unhallowed Halls by Lili Wilkinson: Review by Colleen Mondor

date: 2025-06-09, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Unhallowed Halls</strong>, Lili Wilkinson (Delacorte Press 978-0-593-81098-9, $19.99, 444pp, hc) February 2025. Cover by Stevie Dutson.</p>
<p>The dark academia appeal remains strong for YA fans, and Lili Wilkinson’s <strong>Unhallowed Halls </strong>takes readers into what is now a classic setting of iso­lated elite boarding school (Agathion College in “gloomy” Scotland), misunderstood teen (possibly pyrotechnic Page), and professors hiding nefari­ous purposes (pretty much everyone at Agathion).

## A Drop of Corruption by Robert Jackson Bennett: Review by Jake Casella Brookins

date: 2025-06-08, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>A Drop of Corruption</strong>, Robert Jackson Bennett (Del Rey 9780593723821, $30.00, 480pp, hc) April 2025. Cover by Will Staehle.</p>
<p>I was quite charmed by Robert Jackson Bennett’s <strong>The Tainted Cup</strong>, though left curious about some of the politics brewing behind its flashier world-building. With its sequel, <strong>A Drop of Corruption</strong>, Bennett has doubled down on what I enjoyed in the first one – a decidedly action-packed mystery  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/06/a-drop-of-corruption-by-robert-jackson-bennett-review-by-jake-casella-brookins/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
