## Write On: 'The Order' Writer Zach Baylin

date: 2024-12-06, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-zach-baylin-writer-of-the-order" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Zach%20Baylin.png" alt="Write On: Zach Baylin Writer of 'The Order'" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<div>
  ‚ÄúI find action scenes really hard to write, I usually save them for the end. I need to get very caffeinated and then just try and get into the adrenaline of what they should feel like. With this [film] in particular, those robberies and the heist‚Ä¶ I kind of like to really understand an environment and a landscape before I can write an action sequence. Because if I can‚Äôt figure out when a car is overtaking another car or where characters are in relation to it, then it‚Äôs impossible to write dialogue. I really try and map out the choreography of things and when to have those spikes of violence. I think you just feel it. You feel it on the page where hopefully you‚Äôve built the tension. There needs to be some kind of release. And that‚Äôs maybe a gunshot or maybe it‚Äôs a line of dialogue that pulls someone in another direction. I‚Äôm pretty prescriptive in the way I write action and I write it in the way I hope it will be shot and it‚Äôs not just like an overview of a scene,‚Äù says screenwriter Zach Baylin on writing action sequences in his new film, 
 <em>The Order</em>.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <em>The Order</em> stars Jude Law and Nicholas Hoult and tells the true story of an FBI agent (Law), who‚Äôs determined to bring down a group of domestic terrorists in the Pacific Northwest in the 1980s.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>In this episode of the podcast, we talk with Zach Baylin about writing action sequences and also his film 
 <em>King Richard</em>, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. He also shares this advice for writing a period film that might have parallels to today‚Äôs society: 
 <br> 
 <br>‚ÄúIn terms of keeping things entertaining and not wanting to be preachy and didactic, I think that the approach that I took was just to try and tell the story of what happened in 1983 and ‚Äò84 accurately and not to over relate it to today. The parallels to today are so obvious that if we were to throw in lines about things that felt like they were alluding to the present, it would totally take out both the veracity and the intention, which was, I want to tell this story correctly. And if I do, then you‚Äôll walk out of it, both having been entertained and informed,‚Äù says Baylin.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <em>The Order</em> is out now in theaters. To hear more about Baylin‚Äôs writing process, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;

## 'An Almost Christmas Story': David Lowery Talks Animation Writing

date: 2024-12-06, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/an-almost-christmas-story-david-lowery-talks-animation-writing" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/%E2%80%98An%20Almost%20Christmas%20Story%E2%80%99_%20David%20Lowery%20Talks%20Animation%20Writing.png" alt="Image from the Disney+ Original Short Film 'An Almost Christmas'" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>As a storyteller, David Lowery has a flair for the formidable. His films are often steely and stern, even as his characters find themselves in fantastical situations‚Äîbecoming a ghost, befriending a dragon, or pursuing a medieval knight.<br><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1108007/">Lowery</a> is the writer, director, and editor behind films like <span style="font-style: italic;">The Green Knight, Ain‚Äôt Them Bodies Saints</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Old Man &amp; the Gun</span>, his stories taking us through fantasy, psychological drama, true heists, and more. His roots are in indie film, though he‚Äôs taken on bigger budgets of late, particularly to give his spin to beloved Disney classics.<br><br>A screenwriter/director with such a singular voice and vision is going to produce work like no one else, and that‚Äôs certainly the case for his new original holiday short, <span style="font-style: italic;">An Almost Christmas Story</span>, now streaming on Disney+.<br><br>Cowritten with Alfonso Cuar√≥n and Jack Thorne, the short is an animated tale of a young owl lost in New York City after being spirited away in the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. He meets Luna, an equally adrift little girl. These delicate, paper-like characters inhabit a world of harsh cardboard cars and two-dimensional adults, where they have to find their own way during the holiday season. There‚Äôs a mix of whimsy and weight that feels distinctly like Lowery in the work.<br><br>Final Draft jumped into Zoom with Lowery to discuss his approach to his first animated project and the discoveries he‚Äôll bring to his next live-action film, including economy in screenwriting and the importance of storyboards.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: This is your first animated project. Did your approach as a writer change as you started working on this?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">David Lowery</span>: Definitely. It was an entirely new experience and one that I really loved. I loved the process of writing this film because I‚Äôve been writing screenplays my entire life, it feels like at this point, and I felt like I was relearning the art form with this film. It was nice to be knocked out of my comfort zone and forced to relearn how to tell a story for the screen in a way that I had never done before.<br></p>

## City of Dancing Gargoyles by Tara Campbell: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2024-12-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>City of Dancing Gargoyles</strong>, Tara Campbell (Santa Fe Writers Project 978-1-95163-139-0, $16.95, 280pp, tp) September 2024.</p>
<p>What struck me about Tara Campbell‚Äôs 2019 collection, <strong>Midnight at the Or¬≠ganporium</strong>, was the breadth of her imagination and the way she switched between surrealism, revisionist fairytales, and horror. Her story ‚Äò‚ÄòSpeculum Crede‚Äô‚Äô about a very odd work picnic (an understatement) still makes me smile. Campbell‚Äôs second novel, <strong>City of Danc¬≠ing Gargoyles </strong> <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/city-of-dancing-gargoyles-by-tara-campbell-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

Managers are generally viewed as ‚Äúa filtering system‚Äù in <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-ways-screenwriters-can-adapt-to-the-marketplace">the screenplay marketplace</a>, so a screenplaywriter with a manager ‚Äî especially one with a good track record ‚Äî will be taken more seriously and agents are more likely to take on a writer client with a manager than one without (although there are <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-things-i-did-to-become-a-professional-screenwriter">some exceptions</a>). &nbsp;<br><br>If you think you have <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/3-must-ask-questions-before-you-write-a-sellable-script">a marketable script</a> or a decent writing sample and you‚Äôre ready to take that next step, here are <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 ways a screenwriter can find a manager</span>:</p>
