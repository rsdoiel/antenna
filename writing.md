## Write On: 'Sirens' Creator/Showrunner Molly Smith Metzler

date: 2025-08-12, from: Final Draft blog

<p>“Our goal in writing [<em>Sirens</em>] was to write something that makes you think, and offers the opportunity to re-examine your own assumptions that you made about these characters. And it’s taxing. We ask some difficult questions. It’s not <em>The Perfect Couple</em>. It’s not a murder show. We’re going after something thematically that’s really large and really ambitious, and that’s why the Greek mythology came to mind. These are epic stories. These are about blood, and moms, and torture, and trauma, and pain. These themes are not tiny. These are complicated, juicy stews,” says showrunner and creator, Molly Smith Metzler about why she wanted to invoke big themes from Greek drama in her TV show <em>Sirens</em>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On today’s episode, we chat with Molly Smith Metzler, showrunner and creator of the hit Netflix limited series <em>Sirens</em> starring Julianne Moore, Meghann Fahy and Kevin Bacon. The show is based on her stage play <em>Elemeno Pea</em> from 2011. Smith Metzler talks about making the transition from playwriting to television and what she learned about being in the writer’s room for <em>Orange is the New Black</em>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Everything you do in a [writer’s] room is an offering. I’m here to serve, I’m here to serve you. Come in with ideas, offer them. If they don’t hit, back off of them. You are a sous chef and a waiter,” she says.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She also talks about writing edgy female characters unapologetically, like the ones in <em>Sirens</em>, and the numerous times she was asked to remove a certain risqué scene from the pilot script – which she refused to do. “We have to write these women in their truest form – they’re complicated, and they don’t have to explain themselves, either. My job is not to soften her so an audience won’t turn off the TV show,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Mild Spoilers Ahead! </em>Zach Cregger’s movies are wildly unique. With his breakout film <em>Barbarian</em>, he played with the fears of anyone staying at an Airbnb realizing that the house is not what it seems. He has followed up this surprise box office hit with <em>Weapons</em>, a twisty, creepy psychological horror movie that plays into every parent’s worst nightmare: their child runs away in the middle of the night.</p>

## Top Social Media Tips for Writers with Screenwriter & Influencer Nic Curcio

<p>If you’re an emerging screenwriter, you’ve likely heard it’s a good idea to build a brand or grow your online presence. But putting yourself “out there” can be intimidating, especially if you don’t want to look like a cringey self-promoter or some kind of screenwriting hack.&nbsp;<br><br>The good news is that screenwriter Nic Curcio has figured out a path that feels authentic and engaging and has shared his advice with us. Nic, who wrote on the upcoming animated feature <em>Goat</em> (in theaters February 2026), has steadily grown a loyal following on TikTok by posting screenwriting-related videos that are both educational and entertaining. What started as a side hobby during the pandemic has helped him land meetings, earn extra cheddar, and connect with a larger writing community.<br><br>Before working on <em>Goat</em> and finding a social media following, Nic studied English at UCLA and later earned his MFA in Film/TV Production from USC. His studies at USC gave him hands-on experience in various aspects of filmmaking, but writing is where he found his strongest voice.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2019, his feature script <em>Barron: A Tale of Love, Loss and Legacy</em>, was featured on the annual Black List, a ranking of Hollywood’s best unproduced scripts (yes, it’s a fictional story about a young Barron Trump!). From there, he landed a job as an in-house writer at Sony Animation, where he spent over a year rewriting and shaping <em>Goat</em> while working closely with the animation team. He has since written projects for Paramount and Universal, including a feature adaptation of the comic <em>Planet of the Nerds</em> and a new take on <em>The Magic School Bus</em>. In addition to all of this, he also finds time to co-host the podcast <em>Hollywood Hang</em> with fellow screenwriter Kristen Tepper.&nbsp;</p>
