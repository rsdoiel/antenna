## Needy Little Things by Channelle Desamours: Review by Colleen Mondor

date: 2025-05-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Needy Little Things</strong>, Channelle Desamours (Wednesday Books 978-1-250-33481-7, $20.00, 320pp, hc) February 2025.</p>
<p>Debut author Channelle Desamours has crafted a compelling mystery with her twisty, turning, keeps-you-guessing-until-the-end novel, <strong>Needy Little Things</strong>. (And that ending! Wow!)

## Commentary: Cory Doctorow: Strange Bedfellows and Long Knives

date: 2025-05-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p>If a group of people have been trying to get something done for some time without success, there are two possibilities: Either they’re failing because of bad tactics, or they’re failing because they simply lack the power to achieve their goals.
