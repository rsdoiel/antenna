## The City in Glass by Nghi Vo: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2024-10-29, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The City in Glass</strong>, Nghi Vo (Tordotcom 978-1250348272, $24.99, 224pp), October 2024.</p>
<p>Nghi Vo is full of surprises. I suppose one could argue that her first novel, the Gatsbyesque <strong>The Chosen and the Beautiful</strong>, and her second, the very different Hollywood fantasy historical <strong>The Siren Queen</strong>, had a few things in common – like early 20th-century American settings and the classic themes of the need for acceptance  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/the-city-in-glass-by-nghi-vo-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Creating a Sympathetic Monster

</div> 
<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sympathetic Monster</span> is <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/mean-screenplay-arch">an archetype</a> that can be found in various “monster movies.” In addition to <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-scare-your-reader">scaring us</a>, these monsters also tug at our heartstrings, and we find ourselves caring about them despite the carnage they cause.&nbsp;<br><br>Over the decades, there have been many Sympathetic Monsters that have resonated with filmgoers, and some of them are still at the center of several film franchises, remakes or modern reinterpretations. Because of this, if you’re writing a script that features a monster of some sort, it might be a more <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/inspiring-an-emotional-response-through-your-screenplay">emotionally-resonating</a> story if that monster is sympathetic.&nbsp;</p>

## A Jura for Julia by Ken MacLeod: Review by Niall Harrison

date: 2024-10-28, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>A Jura for Julia</strong>, Ken MacLeod (NewCon Press 978-1-91495-383-5, 220pp, £26.99, hc) August 2024. Cover by Fangorn.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s entirely unrecognised that one of the most notable qualities of Ken MacLeod’s fic­tion is its dry humour, but I’m not sure it’s much discussed. So here’s a moment from “The Shadow Ministers”, one of a baker’s dozen of enjoyable stories collected in <strong>A Jura for Julia</strong>, that  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/a-jura-for-julia-by-ken-macleod-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Tongue Trade by Michael J. Martineck: Review by Paul Di Filippo

date: 2024-10-27, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Tongue Trade</strong>, Michael J. Martineck (Edge 978-1770532410, hardcover, 224pp, $34.95) October 2024</p>
<p>Michael Martineck has had the kind of respectable bubbling-under career that many writers enjoy—but which they also might ambitiously seek to surpass. (Has any writer ever been truly satisfied with his or her current status?) He sold his first story in 1999, then several novels, with the most recent being <b>The Link Boy</b> in 2017.

## Ultra 85 by Logic: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2024-10-27, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Ultra 85</strong>, Logic (Simon &#38; Schuster 978-1-98215-827-9, $18.99, 304pp, tp) September 2024.</p>
<p>I’d never heard of the rapper Logic (AKA Sir Robert Bryson Hall II) or his work (both musi­cal and literary) until I was sent a copy of <strong>Ultra 85</strong>. That’s not an indictment of Logic but instead speaks to my narrow, stunted musical tastes. <strong>Ultra 85 </strong>is Logic’s sophomore effort, the follow-up to his debut <strong>Supermarket</strong> <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/ultra-85-by-logic-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
