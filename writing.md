## Write On: Long Bright River Showrunner Nikki Toscano

date: 2025-03-07, from: Final Draft blog

<p>“With an adaptation, you can never give back your first read. So, what are you taking away? What fills your soul? Why do you want to tell this story? And then that becomes sort of the North Star. And I’m tethered more by that North Star than by the actual moves that are happening in the book,” says <em>Long Bright River</em> showrunner, Nikki Toscano, about adapting Liz Moore’s best-selling novel for television.&nbsp;<br><br><em>Long Bright River</em> is an emotional suspense thriller that follows Mickey (Amanda Seyfried), a police officer in a Philadelphia neighborhood hit hard by the opioid epidemic. As a string of murders unfolds, Mickey must find her missing sister who’s also battling addiction before it’s too late – but long buried family secrets stand in the way.&nbsp;<br><br>On the surface, the show is a highly engaging murder-mystery, but beneath the whodunnit is a love story between two sisters. We chat with Toscano about delving into the sisterly dynamic that is both compassionate and toxic at the same time.&nbsp;<br><br>Toscano shares tools for building an enticing mystery that includes giving your characters secrets to help drive the story.&nbsp;<br><br>“I think that in the beginning of anything, you have to determine what your character wants and then put a bunch of people or things in that character’s way. So that’s how secrets are born, right? And that’s how you have your audience leaning in. Is the secret going to come out? Who’s going to tell the secret? You and I could be having a conversation and I say, ‘Don’t tell anybody!’ And then the next scene is you being in a situation where do you tell, do you not tell? It’s about setting up those kinds of things. I mean, whenever building any kind of show, whether it’s an adaptation or not, determine what your character wants and then stick a bunch of people between them and that goal that either complement or compromise your character’s journey,” says Toscano.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more, listen to the podcast. <em>Long Bright River</em> streams on Peacock March 13.&nbsp;</p>

## Screenwriter Mike White’s Journey Before ‘The White Lotus’

<p>With the third season of HBO’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1" style="font-style: italic;">The White Lotus</a> the acclaimed and popular series is once again capturing audience’s imaginations. With its mixture of exotic locales, sexual intrigue and existential conflict, <span style="font-style: italic;">The White Lotus</span> has become an event show and not surprising, a fourth season has already been ordered before the third has even finished airing.<br><br>At the center of the show is its creator and showrunner: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925234/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_mike%2520white">Mike White</a>. In addition to his showrunning duties, White writes and directs every episode of the series. Between its cinematic flourishes and each season having its own self-contained narrative, <span style="font-style: italic;">The White Lotus</span> feels more like a 6 to 8 hour-long movie than a traditional TV show. Not surprisingly, prior to creating <span style="font-style: italic;">The White Lotus</span>, White was a screenwriter and filmmaker.<br><br>However, his career <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> start in TV, and White’s journey from staff writer to showrunner is an illuminating one. Here are some lessons screenwriters can learn from the career of Mike White.</p>

<p>At this year’s Oscars, <em>Anora</em> filmmaker Sean Baker made history by personally receiving 4 Academy Award wins for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Editing. Only Warren Beatty, Alan Menken, Alfonso Cuaron and Chloe Zhao had achieved the record 4 nominations for a single film before him. And while the film’s success has introduced Baker to his biggest audience yet, he’s been steadily releasing independent films about misfits, immigrants and sex workers on the margins of American society for 25 years. Here are the 7 films that paved the way to <em>Anora</em>.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259255/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_four%2520letter%2520words" style="font-weight: bold;"></a></p>

## Commentary: Cory Doctorow: There Were Always Enshittifiers

date: 2025-03-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p>In my new novel <strong>Picks and Shovels</strong>, we learn the origins of Martin Hench, my bestselling, two-fisted, scambusting forensic accountant who debuted in 2023’s <strong>Red Team Blues </strong>and whose adventures continued in 2024’s <strong>The Bezzle</strong>.</p>
<p>Marty’s origin story starts at MIT in 1982, where he joins the proud lineage of computer science students who flunk out of their degrees because they’re too busy hacking code to do their  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/03/commentary-cory-doctorow-there-were-always-enshittifiers/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>Here’s an admission that would elicit a gasp from the Australian literary elite: I have never read a Tim Winton novel. Worse, I read the opening of one of his most famous novels and I hated it. But then I read <strong>Juice. </strong>And if all his novels hit like that for people who like realism&#8230;  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/03/juice-by-tim-winton-review-by-alexandra-pierce/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
