<p><strong>Gogmagog </strong>is the first novel I’ve read by Jeff Noon since the publication of <strong>Nyphomation </strong>in 1997. The books he wrote immediately after his Vurt phase – <strong>Needle in the Groove </strong>and <strong>Falling Out of Cars </strong>– didn’t appeal to twenty-something Ian (though <strong>Falling Out of Cars </strong>looks right up the al­ley of fifty-something Ian).  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/09/ian-mond-reviews-gogmagog-by-jeff-noon-steve-beard/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
