## Write On: 'Abraham's Boys' Writer/Director Natasha Kermani

date: 2025-07-14, from: Final Draft blog

<p>“Vampires hold incredible destructive power, and so we’re very drawn to them, sort of like moths to a candle, right? I think that’s sort of eternal, and that’s the reason every culture, pretty much around the globe has some version of the vampire because it represents that very human conflict of what we desire which is so in tune with and aligned to things that can also destroy us. That just feels very honest and eternal, so I don’t think [vampires] will ever go away. I think they will be an eternal part of our mythologies,” says writer/director Natasha Kermani, about the everlasting appeal of vampires on film.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode, we chat with Natasha Kermani about her new movie <em>Abraham’s Boys</em> that extends the world of Dracula into a psychological family drama with its own chills and thrills. The movie centers on brothers Max (Brady Hepner) and Rudy (Judah Mackey) Van Helsing, who have spent their lives under the strict rule of their father, Abraham Van Helsing (Titus Welliver). Unaware of their father’s dark past as a vampire hunter, they struggle to understand his paranoia and increasingly erratic behavior. But when the brothers begin to uncover the violent truths behind Abraham’s history with Dracula, their world unravels, forcing them to confront the terrifying family legacy.<br><br>Kermani talks about adapting the Joe Hill short story of the same name, shares tips for structuring a short story into a feature film, and ways a writer can bring a classic monster story like Dracula into a modern setting. &nbsp;<br><br>“I think it’s about examining our world through an eternal lens of these mythologies that don’t change. Power dynamics. Authority. Submission. These are eternal. So the question is, if you take that structure, and apply it to our world, how do things fall into place? And when you can start to look at the world around us through that lens, I think you start to get really interesting, truthful stories because you’re not trying to come up with a new structure, or a new classic. You are obeying the laws of how our brains work and how our stories work.”<br><br>“I think it’s a question of, ‘What are the things that you desire, but also fear? What are you drawn to, like a moth to flame?’ For me, with <em>Abraham’s Boys</em>, it’s that we’re so drawn to the idea of someone coming to you and saying, ‘I know what the monsters are, I know what the heroes are. Follow me and you’ll be safe.’ That’s very dangerous,” says Kermani.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>
