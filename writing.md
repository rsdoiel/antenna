**@Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky** (date: 2024-01-29, from: Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky)

I had not heard and I'm sad. Brian was a character, and he was immensely kind to me when I was a 22 year old baby journalist, trying to interview fantasy and horror writers.

I get fascinated by the videos that purport to reveal the secret story behind something that isn't hard to follow. (Coraline's plot is not tortuous or complex. It doesn't make it a better story to claim all the adults in it are dead or whatever.)

## Gary K. Wolfe Reviews Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead by K.J. Parker

date: 2024-01-28, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Readers of K.J. Parker are by now familiar with his affable scoundrels – by turns digressive, philo­sophical, deeply cynical, petulant, and somehow both self-loathing and self-justifying in the same breath.

**@Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky** (date: 2024-01-28, from: Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky)

Since August I've been watching Doctor Who with an obsessed 8 year old. So far we have dived deeply into Doctors 9, 10 and 11, but he's skipped 12 (don't know why) and we are deep in 13 (which I had skipped much of).
