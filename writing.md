## Dan Gilroy on Writing ‘Andor’s’ Most Tragic Character: “He Would’ve Joined the Rebellion”

</div> 
<p>Dan Gilroy has spent decades mastering the art of character-driven storytelling, from his gritty noir thriller <em>Nightcrawler</em> to his work on <em>Andor</em>, the <em>Star Wars</em> series that has redefined what science fiction television can accomplish.&nbsp;<br><br>Gilroy wrote the three-episode arc that includes the Ghorman massacre and Mon Mothma’s (Genevieve O’Reilly) dramatic escape from the Senate. The episodes are standouts in a magnificent season of rich, complex TV.&nbsp;<br><br>As someone who has loved <em>Star Wars</em> since infancy, <em>Andor</em> feels like a miracle to me. It’s adult, dark, and grounded writing that deals with complicated people in impossible situations, making for some of the realest, most complicated <em>Star Wars</em> adventures in the franchise. Little 1999 me could have never imagined she’d get the chance to dissect some of her favorite intergalactic moments with its writers, but here we are.<br><br>And I learned a ton from our conversation. As a writer, Gilroy understands that the biggest conflicts mean nothing without intimate human stakes, a philosophy that shines through in his episodes, in which personal betrayals and political awakenings unfurl against the backdrop of a growing rebellion.<br><br>In our discussion, he told us about his habit of developing a unique visual style for every script and his philosophy on trusting audiences with minimal exposition. He also shares his wisdom about finding your voice as a writer, why writers don’t need interpersonal skills to succeed, and how to write action sequences that prioritize character over spectacle.<br><br><em>Editor’s note: The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em><br></p>

## Transmentation | Transience by Darkly Lem: Review by Jake Casella Brookins

date: 2025-06-18, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Transmentation &#124; Transience</strong>, Darkly Lem (Black­stone 9798212185998, $28.99, 382pp, hc) March 2025. Cover by Kathryn English.</p>
<p>It’s uniquely refreshing to encounter a novel that genuinely breathes new life into a trope or a subgenre that seemed to be played out. I’ve been experiencing “multiverse fatigue” for quite a while now, immediately skeptical that an alternate-reality narrative can go anywhere meaningful; and I was completely charmed by <strong>Transmentation &#124; Transience</strong> <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/06/transmentation-transience-by-darkly-lem-review-by-jake-casella-brookins/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Bartz v. Anthropic: Class Certification at Issue for Book Authors in AI Copyright Litigation

date: 2025-06-18, from: Author's Union blog

Back in October, I asked a simple but unresolved question: “Who represents you in the AI copyright suits?” Now, eight months later, we’re getting closer to an answer—at least for some authors. In Bartz v. Anthropic, one of the fastest-moving lawsuits over the use of copyrighted works to train generative AI systems, the plaintiffs have asked the court to certify a class of authors whose books were allegedly copied without permission.

## Write On: 'Apple Cider Vinegar' Creator & Showrunner Samantha Strauss

<p>“In my mind, Belle is going through life, at least our version of Belle – I’ve never met the real Belle – she’s going through life with this hole inside, this overwhelming need for approval, that social media absolutely capitalizes on, and she just keeps trying to feed the beast. She hasn’t grown up with the healthiest of role models herself. She has learnt that being sick is a shortcut to being loved and to getting attention,” says Samantha Strauss, creator and showrunner for the Netflix limited series <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em>, about understanding her main character’s disgraceful motivation to lie about having brain cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>Adapted from the book, <em>The Woman Who Fooled the World</em>, by Beau Donelly and Nick Toscano, <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> chronicles the incredible and heartbreaking rise and fall of the real Belle Gibson (Kaitlin Dever), a notorious health and wellness “scamfluencer.”<br><br>Strauss talks about starting her young life in Australia as a ballet dancer before a terrible injury led her to discover TV writing. She also talks about how her previous TV show, <em>The End</em>, got the attention of Nicole Kidman who championed her writing career. Strauss gushes about how she was inspired by Kidman’s “fierce intelligence, just exactly what you’d expect, and rigor. You know, she would be giving notes at the end of a really long day of filming. She wasn’t resting on her laurels at all. There’s just such a generosity of spirit there and to think she’s helped other emerging Australian creatives is pretty special.”<br><br>Strauss discusses the challenges of adapting a true story while the subject is still alive, tips and tricks for making the show feel immediate and seductive while mimicking the addictive nature of social media, and getting the primal relationship of mothers and daughters authentic on screen.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more about <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> and Strauss’s advice for writers adapting true stories, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

## From Lilo to Dragons: The Animated Career of Dean DeBlois

</div> 
<p>Among the most hotly anticipated movies of the summer are two live-action remakes of recent animated classics, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11655566/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_3_nm_4_in_0_q_lilo%2520"><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em></a>, releasing May 23, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26743210/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_how%2520to%2520train%2520your%2520dr" style="font-style: italic;">How To Train Your Dragon</a>, coming just a few weeks later on June 13. What many may not know, is that both of the original animated films share the same writing/directing team. One half of that team is <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0761498/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_chris%2520sanders">Chris Sanders</a>, who wrote and directed last year’s Academy Award-nominated hit, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29623480/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520wild%2520robot" style="font-style: italic;">The Wild Robot</a> (2024). The other half, who is returning to direct the live action remake of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dragon</span>, is Canadian animator and filmmaker <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0213450/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_in_0_q_dean%2520debloi">Dean DeBlois.</a> The return may seem almost obligatory for the man who spearheaded the animated franchise, but in tracing DeBlois’ origins and filmmaking ambitions back to his boyhood love of comic books and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_star%2520wars" style="font-style: italic;">Star Wars</a> in the 1980s, it’s easy to see why writing and directing the live action remake of his own film makes all the sense in the world.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read more: </span><a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/the-wild-robot-screenwriter-chris-sanders-tells-how-to-write-for-animation" style="font-weight: bold;">‘The Wild Robot’ Screenwriter Chris Sanders Tells How to Write for Animation</a><br>&nbsp;<br>DeBlois started out drawing homemade comics, transitioned into animation, and rose the ranks at Disney until Sanders took note of his innate, passionate storytelling sense, and brought him on to co-write/co-direct the original <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275847/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_lilo%2520%2526%2520stit" style="font-style: italic;">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a> (2002) and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892769/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_how%2520to%2520train" style="font-style: italic;">Dragon</a> (2010) with him. All the while, DeBlois dreamed of being able to direct a live action film until he finally received his shot with this summer’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Dragon</span>. The common thread between every step he took is a very pure love and reverence for the creative process and craft of visual storytelling, and a hard work ethic. DeBlois’ story is truly a case study for when preparation meets opportunity. By taking his career one story, one scene, one frame at a time, Dean DeBlois carved his way into cinema history.</p>

## City of All Seasons by Oliver K. Langmead & Aliya Whiteley: Review by Niall Harrison

date: 2025-06-16, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>City of All Seasons</strong>, Oliver K. Langmead &#38; Aliya Whiteley (Titan 978-1-8354-1144-5, $18.99, 304pp, tp) April 2025.</p>
<p>I spent a bit of time, while reading Oliver K. Langmead &#38; Aliya Whiteley’s <strong>City of All Seasons,</strong> wondering whether the title was careless or a clue, because the novel appears to describe a city, or versions of a city, in which only two of the four seasons matter.

## Anima Rising by Christopher Moore: Review by Paul Di Filippo

date: 2025-06-15, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Anima Rising</strong>, Christopher Moore (Morrow 978-0062434159, hardcover, 400pp, $30.00) May 2025.</p>
<p>I sincerely doubt whether I will encounter another novel as sheerly enjoyable as <b>Anima Rising</b> over the rest of my reading days during 2025—and perhaps beyond. It now occupies the spot formerly held by <b>Fluke</b>, which was always my favorite Moore book. Beneath its nonstop but never overdone gonzo humor (which would provoke envy among the Marx  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/06/anima-rising-by-christopher-moore-review-by-paul-di-filippo/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
