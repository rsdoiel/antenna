## The Year in Review 2024 by Ian Mond

date: 2025-02-06, from: Locus Magazine

<p>After the slam dunk that was 2023, I had high hopes for 2024 ‚Äì too high, as it turns out. 2023 was a rare vintage, the 1999 of films in book form (Okay, maybe not that good). To expect that 2024 would scale those same heady heights was asking too much of the year, especially one already burdened by a world-shaping American election. Not that genre fiction schedules are influenced  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-year-in-review-2024-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## How To Write a Contained Screenplay: 8 Great Scripts With One Location

<p>Contained screenwriting can be challenging. Not everyone is wired to tell a story that involves only a small amount of characters and that mostly happens in just one or two locations. But like most creative endeavors, the right kind of limitations can produce surprising benefits. Placing boundaries on your screenplay can create dynamic storytelling opportunities, not to mention that contained screenplays typically have a lower budget. And that could make the difference between being an aspiring screenwriter versus <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/3-must-ask-questions-before-you-write-a-sellable-script">a produced screenwriter</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about writing a contained screenplay, and why limitations might just launch your screenwriting career.</p>

## What Editing Can You Teach You About Screenwriting

date: 2025-02-05, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-editing-can-you-teach-you-about-screenwriting" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/What%20Editing%20Can%20You%20Teach%20You%20About%20Screenwriting.png" alt="Image of a film editor's video timeline on a computer screen." class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>There‚Äôs a clich√© in Hollywood that a film is made three times: once on the page in the form of a screenplay, the second time is on set when it‚Äôs shot with the director and actors, and the third time is in the editing bay. While any filmmaker can argue that each stage of ‚Äúmaking‚Äù the movie is equally important, it‚Äôs in the edit where the story is finalized and often defined more by what is cut out than by what is left in.&nbsp;<br><br>Many of the industry‚Äôs greatest screenwriters started their careers as editors, including Steven Zaillian (<em>Schindler‚Äôs List</em>, 1993), Steven Soderbergh (<em>Traffic</em>, 2000), and Joel Coen (<em>No Country for Old Men</em>, 2007). All three filmmakers have distinct visual styles, a knack for clear and concise storytelling and the ability to create effective pacing. These skills were no doubt formed and strengthened while spending hundreds of hours going over raw footage and slowly piecing it all together.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/tag/podcast">Final Draft‚Äôs Write On podcast</a> recently interviewed Josh Salzberg, co-screenwriter (along with Shira Piven), for the new film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15300212/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520performance" style="font-style: italic;">The Performance</a>, starring Jeremy Piven and Robert Carlyle, about a vaudeville dance troupe hired to perform in Nazi Germany. <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-the-performance-co-writer-josh-salzberg">Salzberg shared how being an editor helped him learn the craft of screenwriting</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## Filmmaker Cooper Raiff Talks "Bumping" in Screenwriting

</div> 
<p>If there‚Äôs one writer/director whose work I‚Äôve been consistently excited by and whose name at festivals promises a project both heartbreakingly raw and funny, it‚Äôs <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4323708/">Cooper Raiff</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>He was a SXSW breakout in 2020 with college comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">Shithouse</span>, which snagged him the fest‚Äôs Grand Jury Award. And in 2022 took a step into more adult territory with the Sundance Film Festival premiere of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cha Cha Real Smooth</span>, which won the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/01/cha-cha-real-smooth-sundance-win-cooper-raiff-dakota-johnson.html">Audience Award</a> in the U.S. Dramatic category.<br><br>This year, he is back at Sundance with an episodic work, <a href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6753360063b9434588c22178" style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</a>. The series follows two codependent siblings (Raiff and Lili Reinhart) who, years after a traumatic event in their family, still haven‚Äôt quite recovered. That pain seeps into their messy present-day relationships, including the ones they have with their dad (Mark Ruffalo) and his new partner (Betty Gilpin). When we get flashbacks into their childhood, Raiff and Reinhart play their grade-school versions of the characters, forced to mature too soon.<br><br>Raiff is always highly involved in his projects, writing and directing as well as starring, and he brings a singular sensibility to the work that‚Äôs a bit hard to pin down‚Äîsomething about an awkward honesty, naturalistic dialogue, moments of emotional punch that feel familiar and real. &nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</span> is no different, but as an episodic, the story is a bit more freewheeling, interwoven with <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/frame-story-flashback">past and present threads</a> that slowly unravel the family‚Äôs anguish.<br><br>Final Draft spoke with Raiff ahead of Sundance to learn what was different about his approach to episodic work, his methods for building characters that he might not fully understand in the beginning, and how the writing comes together on set.&nbsp;</p>

## Augur: Short Fiction Reviews by A.C. Wise

date: 2025-02-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Augur 7.2</p>
<p>‚Äú<strong>Telling the Soul of Mars</strong>‚Äù by <strong>Alina Pete </strong>starts Augur 7.2 on a strong note. It‚Äôs a lovely story that explores the power and limits of language and narrative, and how the traditions of storytelling might change and evolve with space travel. A storyteller born on Mars visits Earth for the first time and struggles with how to express the es¬≠sence of her home to those  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/augur-short-fiction-reviews-by-a-c-wise-2/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Year in Review 2024 by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2025-02-02, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>2024: Descent </strong><strong>(or Ascent) into </strong><strong>Multiplicity</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs a bit bracing to be reminded that I‚Äôve been writing these yearly re¬≠view columns for more than three decades, but it does put things in per¬≠spective. Some of the books mentioned in those first couple of col¬≠umns, of course, are barely remembered now, but others still seem to be a significant part of the discussion ‚Äì Connie Willis‚Äôs <strong>Doomsday Book</strong>, Neal Stephenson‚Äôs  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-year-in-review-2024-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Sunday Morning Transport, The Deadlands, and The Dark: Short Fiction Reviews by Paula Guran

date: 2025-02-02, from: Locus Magazine

<p>The Sunday Morning Transport (9/22/24 ‚Äì 12/01/24)
The Deadlands Fall ‚Äô24
The Dark 12/24</p>
<p>The Sunday Morning Transport publishes out¬≠standing fiction weekly. All the stories are commendable, but here are my favorites of their fall offerings. If, as I did, you felt sympathy for Hermione‚Äôs muggle parents, ‚Äú<strong>F*** These Wizards</strong>‚Äù by <strong>Alex London </strong>(9/22) is a story you will enjoy. And even if you aren‚Äôt a Harry Potter  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-sunday-morning-transport-the-deadlands-and-the-dark-short-fiction-reviews-by-paula-guran/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## From the 2024 Recommended Reading List: Rest in Peaches by Alex Brown

date: 2025-02-01, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a highlight from our 2024 Recommended Reading List: </strong><strong>Rest in Peaches</strong> by Alex Brown, out from Page Street Publishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thoughtful social commentary about race and the justice system is baked into this entertainingly absurd, page-turning slasher [&#8230;]. Delightfully heart-pounding, suspenseful, and campy horror.&#8221;

## Rules for 2024 IFDB Awards

date: 2025-02-01, from: IF Database News

The IFDB Awards is an annual competition designed to award excellence in creating interactive fiction.It is held from February 1st to the first weekend after February 15th each year on the Interactive Fiction Database, and take the form of polls.</P>

Votes are public but anonymized. Every IFDB member is eligible to vote, except for one special poll, the Author‚Äôs Choice Poll. Eligibility to vote in the Author‚Äôs Choice competition is determined by having a game linked to your IFDB profile (this can be found by editing a game page and use the ‚ÄòLink to Author‚Äôs Profile‚Äô feature. Authors added incorrectly to a game will not be permitted to vote (for instance, if someone associates a random game they didn‚Äôt make to their account).</P>

Rules for discussion and voting
<br>
-Voting must be in good faith and be based on personal experience with the games involved.<br>

-Campaigning or organizing voting is not allowed if it breaks the above rule.<br>

-Discussion of games on merit is allowed and encouraged.<br>

-There is no hard limit on how many votes a person can cast in each poll for different games. A player voting for so many games that it makes voting difficult for others (such as voting for every game from the whole year) may have their votes removed, but only after warning.<br>

-Author cannot vote for their own games. Such votes will be removed so that the running tallies are correct. Authors can post about their own games (for instance on intfiction) as long as doesn‚Äôt encourage people to break the rules (such as telling people to vote for your game even if they haven‚Äôt played it).
</P>

Code of conduct
</P>
-Voters must abide by the <A HREF="https://ifdb.org/code-of-conduct">IFDB Code of Conduct</A>. Harassment of other voters (including on other platforms) and creating multiple accounts for one person are prohibited.
</P>
Moderation
-Votes that are cast incorrectly (for instance, voting for a Twine game in a Choicescript poll) or fraudulently (for instance, using sockpuppet accounts) may be removed.
</P>
Eligibility
<br>
-For most polls, games are eligible if they are listed on IFDB and have a publication date during 2024.<br>

-For system-specific polls, games additionally must have the appropriate system or genre listed on their IFDB page under the specified field.<br>

-Each poll will have a link to an IFDB search listing suggested games. Outside of system-based polls, users can vote for any game they feel fits the criteria.<br>

-Any IFDB user can edit game pages to confirm eligibility. However, malicious editing (such as adding every genre to a game or adding incorrect systems to a game) will be reverted or removed.<br>

-Any game author can opt out of the competition. Adding a note to the game page during the competition may be helpful to let others know not to vote for it, but opting out should be officially done by messaging the organizer (me, for now).<br>

</P>
Results
<br>
-Results will be clearly visible throughout the poll. However, there will be a grace period of up to 3 days at the end to allow checking of votes before the official announcements, which will be made on Intfiction and IFDB.<br>

-Polls with very low traffic will not have a winner awarded. This is left up to organizer discretion, but low traffic may include less than 5 votes for the winning game or less than ten votes total cast.</P>


Future of Awards
</P>
One of the main purposes of these new awards is to be community-owned and regular. They need to keep working even if I don‚Äôt keep working.</P>


The awards begin on February 1st of each year. If Feb 1st passes without the current organizer having created the polls, anyone can create the polls themselves.</P>

The community can propose new changes to awards or new organizers via public discussion. A public yes/no poll on intfiction with more than 50% voting yes can be used to add new organizers. Current organizers can also add in other organizers or successors, subject to a public veto.
