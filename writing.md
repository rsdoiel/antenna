## The Dagger in Vichy by Alastair Reynolds: Review by Alexandra Pierce

date: 2025-05-30, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Dagger in Vichy</strong>, Alastair Reynolds (Subter­ranean 978-1-64524-280-2, $40.00, 120pp, hc) August 2025. Cover by Andrew Davis.</p>
<p><strong>The Dagger in Vichy </strong>is very different from Alastair Reynolds’s other recent work. His most recent novel, <strong>Machine Vendetta </strong>(2024), saw him return to the Revelation Space universe. This novella, on the other hand, is set on Earth – albeit (it becomes clear) many centuries in the future.

## 3 Screenwriting Traps to Avoid

</div> 
<p>It’s easy to fall into the many screenwriting traps that most screenwriters face during those first few screenplays. We learn best by making mistakes, and then learning from those mistakes. It’s the natural process of any learning curve — especially when you’re trying to become a professional screenwriter. But what if you could peek into the future and learn how to avoid those traps well before you fall into them?&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here are the most common screenwriting traps new screenwriters can find themselves in, and how you can avoid them.&nbsp;</p>

## What Screenwriters Can Take Away from ‘Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning’

</div> 
<p>Are you a new screenwriter? If so, there’s probably a good chance you weren’t even born 29 years ago when Tom Cruise took over the role of Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible, one of many films inspired and adapted from their TV counterparts. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9603208/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2_tt_6_nm_0_in_0_q_mission" style="font-style: italic;">Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning</a> is a love letter to the seven films that came before it, referencing the others as if everything Ethan Hunt did or didn’t do to save the world all came to a (wait for it) final reckoning.</p>

<p><strong>Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil</strong>, V.E. Schwab (Tor 978-1-2503-2052-0, $29.99, 544pp, hc) June 2025.</p>
<p>I knew absolutely nothing about V.E. Schwab’s <strong>Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil </strong>before I started reading it.

I’m not sure Nina Allan has yet written anything that would unambiguously fail that test, at least in my eyes,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/05/a-granite-silence-by-nina-allan-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
