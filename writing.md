## The Country Under Heaven by Frederic S. Durbin: Review by Paul Di Filippo

<p><strong>The Country Under Heaven</strong>, Frederic S. Durbin (Melville House 978-1685891695, trade paperback, 336pp, $19.99) May 2025.</p>
<p>Surely the gold standard for supernatural tales involving a picaresque wanderer was set by Manly Wade Wellman’s Silver John cycle, recently collected in a handsome two-volume set by Haffner Press (<b>The Complete John the Balladeer</b>). But I can affirm that Frederic Durbin’s new novel, his fourth, climbs high to that same  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/06/the-country-under-heaven-by-frederic-s-durbin-review-by-paul-di-filippo/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>We are currently living through a new Golden Age of television, which, over the last twenty-five years, has expanded from the major network television platform (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) to the addition of cable television (HBO, Showtime, AMC, FX, etc.), and into the current expansion of streamers (Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV, etc.). That’s three platforms dedicated to episodic storytelling, amounting to hundreds upon hundreds of current TV shows — with thousands of series that came and went before them. &nbsp;<br><br>And all of them started with one particular type of episode — a <span style="font-weight: bold;">TV pilot</span>.&nbsp;<br><br>If you want to break into television writing, you first need to know and understand:</p>

<p>You don’t always need outright inspiration as a screenwriter. Sometimes you just need <em>ignition</em> — a spark that fires up your creative juices to get them flowing from your mind to your fingers, and through your fingers to the keys.&nbsp;<br><br>Whether you’re stuck on page 30, struggling to find a character’s voice — or just trying to write <em>anything</em> — these 75 creative writing prompts and exercises can help. Think of these prompts and exercises as a craft-driven toolbox that you can go to anytime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharks don’t hold a great reputation when it comes to movies. They’re predators and killers - you simply don’t see cult classics called ‘Puppynado’. Instead, sharks dominate horror movies, lurking in the dark water and attacking unsuspecting tourists, or wreaking havoc on fishing boats.&nbsp;</p>

## The Antidote by Karen Russell: Review by Ian Mond

<p><strong>The Antidote</strong>, Karen Russell (Knopf 978-0-59380-225-0, $30.00, 432pp, hc) March 2025.</p>
<p>After reading and listening to several “most anticipated books of 2025” articles and podcasts that linked Karen Russell’s <strong>The Antidote </strong>to <strong>The Wizard of Oz</strong>, I expected her new novel to be heavily influenced by L.

Not so much a retelling, like Gregory Maguire’s <strong>Wicked</strong>, but a narrative that would draw on  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/06/the-antidote-by-karen-russell-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Write On: 'Matlock' Creator & Showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman

</div> 
<p>“The most important thing that I’ve learned as a storyteller is that I have to treat every character in the show as though they’re the lead in the show, and they are never doing anything so that I can prompt a move from another character. They are doing things that are true to what they want and their motivation. So that’s what makes that architecture hard, because you know you want things to happen, but they have to happen coming out of character, not coming out of what the room wants to see happen. So it’s like the merging of those two. We know what architecture we want, but if it doesn’t feel true to the character, the character wouldn’t do it. Every time, you’ve got to say no, even though it’s tempting, because that is who you have to protect – your characters,” says Jennie Snyder Urman, creator and showrunner of <em>Matlock</em>, about creating story architecture in a series.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode, we talk with Jennie Snyder Urman, who created the reboot of <em>Matlock</em> starring Kathy Bates as Madeline Matlock. We chat about reinventing the beloved character once played by Andy Griffith, the joy of building a show around an older female lawyer and the generational changes in social attitudes women experience, and the sacrifices women often make when it comes to sexual harassment, including Matty herself.&nbsp;<br><br>“[Matty] realizes now, coming back [to the legal profession], what it cost her. And it’s not like every day she was thinking about it. It was just, ‘Oh my gosh, I made these changes to avoid this. And why do I have to make these changes? Why didn’t that person make the changes so I could be in the space where I was comfortable?’ And I think what’s so exciting about Maddie is that she’s still learning new things at 75. I think there’s also a little bit of a wish fulfillment, that you can still evolve, and you still learn, and you still feel new things,” says Urman.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more about <em>Matlock</em>, what we can expect from season 2, and Urman’s advice for writers, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Screenwriting is about more than just plot—it’s about <span style="font-weight: bold;">voice</span>. And nowhere does a screenwriter’s voice shine more clearly than in their characters’ dialogue.<br><br>The best known screenwriters are highly regarded for their dialogue. When you hear dialogue written by screenwriters such as Diablo Cody, Aaron Sorkin, and Quentin Tarantino, you can recognize their distinctive voices almost immediately.&nbsp;<br><br>Dialogue is more than just words on a page. It’s action and depth. It’s how characters flirt, fight, confess, distract, manipulate, and reveal themselves. The best dialogue cuts just a bit deeper than exposition. You feel it suggesting more than it is actually saying — forcing us to start hearing or reading between the lines. That’s where the action part of dialogue lies.&nbsp;<br><br>And when you ground dialogue into character and conflict, it creates unforgettable scenes that could have otherwise been forgettable without a little extra effort and inspiration.&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here are 50 dialogue prompts built specifically for screenwriters. They are designed to inspire character-driven moments, layered scenes, and amazing conflict (the driving force of every scene).&nbsp;</p>

## A Drop of Corruption by Robert Jackson Bennett: Review by Jake Casella Brookins

date: 2025-06-08, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>A Drop of Corruption</strong>, Robert Jackson Bennett (Del Rey 9780593723821, $30.00, 480pp, hc) April 2025. Cover by Will Staehle.</p>
<p>I was quite charmed by Robert Jackson Bennett’s <strong>The Tainted Cup</strong>, though left curious about some of the politics brewing behind its flashier world-building. With its sequel, <strong>A Drop of Corruption</strong>, Bennett has doubled down on what I enjoyed in the first one – a decidedly action-packed mystery  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/06/a-drop-of-corruption-by-robert-jackson-bennett-review-by-jake-casella-brookins/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
