## Write On: 'Hurry Up Tomorrow' Director/Co-Writer Trey Edward Shults

date: 2025-05-16, from: Final Draft blog

<p>“It was a lot of empathizing. I would do long phone calls with Abel (Tesfaye, aka the Weeknd) after we had met, just basically talking to him and finding out more of his history, where he was at in different phases of his life, where he’s at today, and using those to create a character. And part of creating that character is I’ll find my own personal stuff to attach to it… Portions of his life I can relate to very much. And past all of that, I think this is the deepest I’ve gone with my therapy background and my mom and stepdad being therapists. I tried to make the movie work to where if you just want to watch the movie at surface value and go on a ride with it and experience it and not think about it again, hopefully it works on that level. But also if you want to look at it and interpret it on a whole deeper, hopefully richer level, there’s a lot going on,” says Trey Edward Shults, director and co-writer of the new film <em>Hurry Up Tomorrow</em> on how he took Abel&nbsp;“the Weeknd” Tesfaye’s story and made it personal to him.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode, we sit down with writer/director Trey Edward Shults to discuss his new film <em>Hurry Up Tomorrow</em> that stars the Weeknd, Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan, about a rock star who goes on an existential odyssey after losing his voice on stage.&nbsp;<br><br>Shults shares his journey to becoming a filmmaker, working with visionary director Terrence Malick, making the highly biographical film <em>Krisha</em> (2014), and the shockingly ominous horror film <em>It Comes at Night</em> (2017).&nbsp;<br><br>He also shares this advice for writing your first film:<br><br>“It has to be something you are so hungry to tell. And it has to be something you would die to make. You know what I mean? At least to me, my approach was I like to make stuff personal and they always say like, write what you know, write the personal thing. But I just think it needs to be something you’re crazy hungry to do no matter what,” says Shults.<br><br>To hear more, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

## 7 essential films of Nora Ephron

date: 2025-05-15, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/7-essential-films-of-nora-ephron" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Meg%20Ryan%20and%20Billy%20Crystal%20sitting%20on%20chatting%20in%20a%20park%20with%20autumn%20leaves%20in%20the%20background.png" alt="Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal sitting on chatting in a park with autumn leaves in the background" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>Few names in the romantic comedy genre loom as large as writer/director Nora Ephron. Her trilogy of Meg Ryan hits,<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_when%2520harry%2520met%2520sally"><span style="font-style: italic;">When Harry Met Sally… </span>(1989)</a>,<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108160/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_4_nm_0_in_0_q_sleepless%2520in%2520seattle"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sleepless In Seattle</span> (1993)</a> and<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128853/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_you%27ve%2520got%2520mail"><span style="font-style: italic;">You’ve Got Mail </span>(1998)</a>, sit mightily atop the genre canon, but her talents and influence go much deeper than these classics. The romance of the films is tinged with a darkness and cynicism that carries over from the wry, caustic writing she did for years as a reporter, essayist and novelist. Indeed, her unique voice comes from an inherent contradiction - that between the fairytale, Hollywood romances she grew up loving, and the world-weary edginess of the hard-drinking Jewish screenwriters who raised her.<br><br>Ephron was born in New York City, a location that would become an indelible character in many of her films, but her parents, the playwright and screenwriting team of Henry and Phoebe Ephron, soon whisked her and her three sisters off to Beverly Hills. There, they wrote such comedy classics as the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050307/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_desk%2520set">Spencer Tracy / Katharine Hepburn vehicle <span style="font-style: italic;">Desk Set</span></a>, but after much success, their screwball comic stylings went out of fashion in the counterculture 60s. Phoebe slowly succumbed to drinking and died at 57 from cirrhosis of the liver, but not before she achieved her life’s mission: to make sure that all four of her daughters became writers.&nbsp;<br><br>Though Nora Ephron had many great mentors across a long career, the first and most important was her mother. And chief among Phoebe’s pearls of wisdom were: “everything is copy” and “write it funny.” Over a career that spanned countless articles and upward of a dozen films, with the highest of highs and many rocky lows, Nora Ephron distinguished herself by hitting that narrowest of targets over and over again - pulling out truths from the rawest and most painful parts of her own experience, and making sure to deliver them with a cutting sense of humor that was all her own.&nbsp;<br><br>Much can be learned by taking a journey through the career of the great Nora Ephron.&nbsp;</p>

## Write On: 'Nonnas' Screenwriter Liz Maccie and Director Stephen Chbosky

date: 2025-05-15, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper">

In the center of the screen is the poster for 'Nonnas' featuring Susan Sarandon, Vince Vaughn, Lorraine Bracco, Talia Shire, and Brenda Vaccaro" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>“Sometimes it’s easier to find and access your truth through ‘pretend’ characters. So I had this embarrassment of riches of this true story but in my heart, I was like, ‘I totally get to tell my truth!’… So my advice is find a way to do it, and if you have to do a mind trick by saying, ‘I’m writing this pretend character’ that’s fine, but put all the stuff that’s real to you into that pretend character, because I find there is an immense amount of freedom in being able to write through these characters because they aren’t exactly my family, they are pieces of them. Writing your truth is possibly the scariest thing, but your truth only belongs to you, you are the person who experienced it in the exact way you experienced it. Know that you are giving a great gift to the world by doing it,” says Liz Maccie, screenwriter for the new film <em>Nonnas</em>, about how to make someone else’s story personal to you.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode we chat with <em>Nonnas</em> screenwriter Liz Maccie and director Stephen Chbosky about turning this true story into a heartfelt movie about a man who risks everything to honor his late mother by opening an Italian restaurant with actual grandmothers as the chefs. &nbsp;<br><br>Maccie and Chbosky, a real-life married couple, talk about their own families and how they were able to put pieces of themselves on the screen. They discuss the hilarious <em>Nonnas’</em> food fight scene and how to balance grief with humor in the writing. &nbsp;<br><br>“I feel that the other side of grief is hope,” says Maccie, adding, “Because I have lost so much of my family, sometimes you’re drowning in the grief. Then you have that moment when you suddenly feel that spark of hope again… we are all going to lose someone, even losing a pet. When we love something, someone and it goes away it’s a devastating feeling and I think that connects us.”&nbsp;<br><br>Chbosky shared this advice for writers:&nbsp;<br><br>“The one bit of solace or encouragement that any writer of any age can find is that sometimes, the more specific you write about your experience the more universal the script and the movie is… I really am a humanist at heart. I believe in using this art form to find ways to unify people, inspire them and certainly give them hope, put on their shoes and go at it the next day, I just think that when you write about your own personal experience it can lead to great things. And it doesn’t mean that it has to be a dramedy or comedy, it could be horror, it could be sci-fi, it could be any genre that you feel as long as it is specific to you.”<br><br>To hear more, listen to the podcast. <em>Nonnas</em> is currently streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a perfect world, we’d all have unlimited time to work on our scripts. Studying for school, working to pay the bills, and family obligations would be taken care of, and there would be plenty of free time consisting of nothing more than you, your laptop, and the worlds and characters you create.&nbsp;<br><br>But it’s not a perfect world, and we have responsibilities to attend to. Even if you become a professional screenwriter, you’ll still need to balance your writing with social engagements, health objectives and family duties. Part of any job is learning to balance that job with this thing we call <em>life</em>. So whether you’re a beginner or professional, it’s essential to learn how to balance your life with your writing.&nbsp;<br><br>Below we’ll discuss various methods and ways of thinking that can help you f<span style="font-weight: bold;">ind the time to write your screenplay</span>.&nbsp;</p>

## Brighter than Scale, Swifter than Flame by Neon Yang: Review by Alexandra Pierce

date: 2025-05-12, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Brighter than Scale, Swifter than Flame</strong>, Neon Yang (Tordotcom 978-1-25035-734-2, $21.99, 176pp, hc) May 2025. Cover by Tran Nguyen.</p>
<p>There’s something about a masked character that allows for particular stories. Self-evidently, it encourages questions and mysteries about the character’s identity and the purpose of the mask. The Mandalorian’s vow not to remove his helmet makes more poignant those moments when he chooses to do so; masks conceal many a  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/05/brighter-than-scale-swifter-than-flame-by-neon-yang-review-by-alexandra-pierce/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Where the Axe Is Buried by Ray Nayler: Review by Niall Harrison

date: 2025-05-10, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Where the Axe Is Buried</strong>, Ray Nayler (MCD 978-0-374-61536-9, $28.00, 336pp, hc) April 2025.</p>
<p>I came to Ray Nayler’s <strong>Where the Axe Is Bur­ied </strong>on a fool’s errand. I am not American, but I have loved America, in spite of its sins, the imperfect ideals of it, the casually confident literature of it, the soul-shaping landscapes of it, all filtered through my own partial personal experiences of it in  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/05/where-the-axe-is-buried-by-ray-nayler-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
