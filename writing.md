## The Sapling Cage by Margaret Killjoy: Review by Alex Brown

date: 2024-12-24, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Sapling Cage</strong>, Margaret Killjoy (The Femi­nist Press 978-1-55861-331-7, $17.95, 336pp, tp) September 2024.</p>

Besides the whole gender essentialism thing, I just find it to be lazy and uninspired. At this point, the only time I’ll read a ‘‘girls do this magic and boys do  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/the-sapling-cage-by-margaret-killjoy-review-by-alex-brown/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## AUTHORS ALLIANCE SUBMITS AMICUS BRIEF IN SEDLIK v. DRACHENBERG

date: 2024-12-23, from: Author's Union blog

The case Sedlik v. Drachenberg, currently pending before the 9th Circuit, presents the 9th Circuit a first opportunity to interpret the fair use right in the wake of the Warhol decision. Anticipating the far-reaching consequences for artists and authors, Authors Alliance filed an amicus brief in support of KVD. In our brief, we explained that (1) a distinct purpose is required for the first factor to tilt in favor of fair use, (2) a successful social media presence does not automatically render all postings “commercial,” and (3) concrete evidence is needed to prove the existence of a licensing market or the likelihood of it developing.

## New Year, New You edited by Chris Campbell: Review by Alexandra Pierce

date: 2024-12-23, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>New Year, New You</strong>, Chris Campbell, ed. (Im­mortal Jellyfish Press 979-8-99077-550-3, 312pp, $25.00, tp). Cover by Melinda Smith. October 2024.</p>
<p>In my experience, it’s often the case that once you hear a good idea, you think “Of course! Why has no one done that before?” In that spirit: the “new year, new you!” slogan seems a perfect theme for a speculative fiction anthology – now that Chris Campbell has  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/new-year-new-you-edited-by-chris-campbell-review-by-alexandra-pierce/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## A Simple Intervention by Yael Inokai: Review by Niall Harrison

One, as in the case of Rajaniemi above, or Greg Egan occasionally, is to crank up the verisimilitude and extrapolate specific diseases or treatments in the best net-up hard-SF fashion; another is to lean into medicine as a system rather than a sci­ence and build  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/a-simple-intervention-by-yael-inokai-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
