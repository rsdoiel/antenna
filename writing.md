## Mechanize My Hands to War by Erin K. Wagner : Review by Paul Di Filippo

date: 2025-01-13, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Mechanize My Hands to War</strong>, Erin K. Wagner (DAW 978-0756419349, hardcover, 320pp, $28.00) December 2024</p>
<p>Erin Wagner’s debut novel is a highly sophisticated tale, constructed in clever fashion, which revolves around the classic motif of human versus nonhuman, specifically man against android. It does not necessarily expand the frontiers of this theme—Wagner’s sociological and technological speculations about androids and their uses hew pretty closely to the standard SF textbook,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/mechanize-my-hands-to-war-by-erin-k-wagner-review-by-paul-di-filippo/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
