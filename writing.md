## Vanishing World by Sayaka Murata: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2025-07-17, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Vanishing World</strong>, Sayaka Murata (Grove Press 978-0-80216-466-7, $28.00, 240pp, hc) April 2025.</p>
<p>Published in Japan in 2015, Sayaka Murata’s <strong>Vanishing World </strong>is the earliest of her novels (so far) to be translated into English (by the always-excellent Ginny Tapley Takemori). I note this because, conceptually, it feels to me like <strong>Vanish­ing World </strong>should come after – not before – both <strong>Convenience Store Woman </strong>and <strong>Earthlings</strong>.</p>

## Former Big Break Top 3 Finalist Pivots From Screenplay to Graphic Novel to Share Powerful Story

<p>When filmmaker Eric D. Howell’s screenplay <em>The Revolution of Cassandra</em> placed in the top three of the <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/big-break-screenwriting-contest/">Final Draft Big Break Screenwriting Contest</a> in 2018, he was excited to be recognized by the people behind the software he relied on every day. But what he didn’t know was that recognition would send him on a journey that would take his story beyond the screen and into the dazzling illustrated world of graphic novels. His story about belief, activism, and the power of sisterhood is now being published as a three-part comic book series. For Howell, this pivot wasn’t just about finding a new platform for <em>The Revolution of Cassandra</em>, it was about staying true to a story he believed the world needed to hear.</p>

<p>1996 was a fascinating year for independent and low-budget filmmaking. Visionary writer/directors were making big splashes in arthouse cinemas, film festivals and even major theaters. Filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and Wes Anderson had made names for themselves with groundbreaking movies, and leveraged their success into studio-backed films.&nbsp;</p>

## Write On: 'Abraham's Boys' Writer/Director Natasha Kermani

date: 2025-07-14, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-abrahams-boys-writer/director-natasha-kermani" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Abrahams%20Boys%20WriterDirector%20Natasha%20Kermani.png" alt="Write On logo of headphones situated around a mobile device featuring a poster of 'Abraham's Boys'" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>“Vampires hold incredible destructive power, and so we’re very drawn to them, sort of like moths to a candle, right? I think that’s sort of eternal, and that’s the reason every culture, pretty much around the globe has some version of the vampire because it represents that very human conflict of what we desire which is so in tune with and aligned to things that can also destroy us. That just feels very honest and eternal, so I don’t think [vampires] will ever go away. I think they will be an eternal part of our mythologies,” says writer/director Natasha Kermani, about the everlasting appeal of vampires on film.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode, we chat with Natasha Kermani about her new movie <em>Abraham’s Boys</em> that extends the world of Dracula into a psychological family drama with its own chills and thrills. The movie centers on brothers Max (Brady Hepner) and Rudy (Judah Mackey) Van Helsing, who have spent their lives under the strict rule of their father, Abraham Van Helsing (Titus Welliver). Unaware of their father’s dark past as a vampire hunter, they struggle to understand his paranoia and increasingly erratic behavior. But when the brothers begin to uncover the violent truths behind Abraham’s history with Dracula, their world unravels, forcing them to confront the terrifying family legacy.<br><br>Kermani talks about adapting the Joe Hill short story of the same name, shares tips for structuring a short story into a feature film, and ways a writer can bring a classic monster story like Dracula into a modern setting. &nbsp;<br><br>“I think it’s about examining our world through an eternal lens of these mythologies that don’t change. Power dynamics. Authority. Submission. These are eternal. So the question is, if you take that structure, and apply it to our world, how do things fall into place? And when you can start to look at the world around us through that lens, I think you start to get really interesting, truthful stories because you’re not trying to come up with a new structure, or a new classic. You are obeying the laws of how our brains work and how our stories work.”<br><br>“I think it’s a question of, ‘What are the things that you desire, but also fear? What are you drawn to, like a moth to flame?’ For me, with <em>Abraham’s Boys</em>, it’s that we’re so drawn to the idea of someone coming to you and saying, ‘I know what the monsters are, I know what the heroes are. Follow me and you’ll be safe.’ That’s very dangerous,” says Kermani.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>
