## Five Lessons in Horror Writing from 'Smile 2' Filmmaker Parker Finn

</div> 
<p>Writer/director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6475689/">Parker Finn</a> has mastered a specific brand of horror with 2022‚Äôs <span style="font-style: italic;">Smile</span> and this year‚Äôs Halloween hit, <span style="font-style: italic;">Smile 2</span>. It‚Äôs dour, it‚Äôs high-concept, it‚Äôs ghastly and gory and great. The story might lead viewers to ask certain questions. How does he come up with such unique scares, and write them visually on the page? How does a focus on character influence the tension? Also, is he okay? (Just kidding.)&nbsp;<br><br>Finn has tapped into something that is resonating with <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/why-horror-never-dies">horror</a> fans and everyday moviegoers alike, and is doing so with original storytelling and deft direction that has landed him in the nation‚Äôs number-one box office spot.&nbsp;<br><br>In this film, his smiley contagion lands on Skye Riley (Naomi Scott), one of the world‚Äôs biggest pop stars on the cusp of a comeback. The year before, she suffered a deadly accident and heavy substance abuse.&nbsp;<br><br>As she preps for her tour, she visits old friend Lewis (Lukas Gage), who has just had the curse transferred to him. After he dies in front of her, Skye finds herself rehearsing and handling appearances as everything crumbles around her. She grows increasingly manic, not sure what‚Äôs real and who she can trust.</p>

## The City in Glass by Nghi Vo: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2024-10-29, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The City in Glass</strong>, Nghi Vo (Tordotcom 978-1250348272, $24.99, 224pp), October 2024.</p>
<p>Nghi Vo is full of surprises. I suppose one could argue that her first novel, the Gatsbyesque <strong>The Chosen and the Beautiful</strong>, and her second, the very different Hollywood fantasy historical <strong>The Siren Queen</strong>, had a few things in common ‚Äì like early 20th-century American settings and the classic themes of the need for acceptance  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/the-city-in-glass-by-nghi-vo-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sympathetic Monster</span> is <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/mean-screenplay-arch">an archetype</a> that can be found in various ‚Äúmonster movies.‚Äù In addition to <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-scare-your-reader">scaring us</a>, these monsters also tug at our heartstrings, and we find ourselves caring about them despite the carnage they cause.&nbsp;<br><br>Over the decades, there have been many Sympathetic Monsters that have resonated with filmgoers, and some of them are still at the center of several film franchises, remakes or modern reinterpretations.

<p>Michael Martineck has had the kind of respectable bubbling-under career that many writers enjoy‚Äîbut which they also might ambitiously seek to surpass.

## Ultra 85 by Logic: Review by Ian Mond

<p><strong>Ultra 85</strong>, Logic (Simon &#38; Schuster 978-1-98215-827-9, $18.99, 304pp, tp) September 2024.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd never heard of the rapper Logic (AKA Sir Robert Bryson Hall II) or his work (both musi¬≠cal and literary) until I was sent a copy of <strong>Ultra 85</strong>. That‚Äôs not an indictment of Logic but instead speaks to my narrow, stunted musical tastes. <strong>Ultra 85 </strong>is Logic‚Äôs sophomore effort, the follow-up to his debut <strong>Supermarket</strong> <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/ultra-85-by-logic-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
