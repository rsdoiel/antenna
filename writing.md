## The Final Orchard by C. J. Rivera : Review by Paul Di Filippo

date: 2025-01-01, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Final Orchard</strong>, C.J. Rivera (Angry Robot 978-1915998262, trade paperback, 400pp, $18.99) November 2024</p>
<p>As her CV informs us: until now, C.J. Rivera’s creative output has occurred in media other than print, making this not only her debut novel, but apparently her debut prose fiction of any sort. (ISFDB believes so too.) But we need fear not, because her skills earned elsewhere translate to a rousing good tale benefiting  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/the-final-orchard-by-c-j-rivera-review-by-paul-di-filippo/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Suite 13 by David J. Schow : Review by Paul Di Filippo

<p><strong>Suite 13</strong>, David J. Schow (Subterranean 978-1645241621, hardcover, 384pp, $45.00) November 2024</p>
<p>When I reviewed Cixin Liu’s story collection <b>A View from the Stars </b>a few months ago, I made a big deal of how Liu had pulled a radical move by issuing a hybrid volume of fiction and non-fiction. Well, now comes an identical blend from master of shocks David Schow, half tales, half essays.

## SHORT TAKE: The Wood at Midwinter by Susanna Clarke: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

<p><strong>The Wood at Midwinter</strong>, Susanna Clarke (Bloomsbury 978-1-63973-448-1, $16.99, 64pp, hc) October 2024.</p>
<p>Except for children’s books, I can think of relatively few authors for whom a relatively spare short story would be the occasion for a pricey hardcover, but between the holiday gift-book market, the 20th anniversary of <strong>Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</strong>, and the anticipation surrounding anything Susanna Clarke writes, one can hardly blame Bloomsbury for  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/short-take-the-wood-at-midwinter-by-susanna-clarke-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>Asimov’s 9-10/24</p>
<p>“<strong>Heartshock</strong>” by <strong>Nick Wolven </strong>gets the Sep­tember/October issue of Asimov’s off to a strong start, looking at the immediate aftermath of a war and the hard decisions facing an injured captain who must choose whether to show mercy to an enemy offering surrender and information.

## Write On: 'Dune: Part One & Part Two' Screenwriter Jon Spaihts

date: 2024-12-30, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-dune-part-one-part-two-screenwriter-jon-spaihts" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Jon%20Spaihts%20-%20Dune%202_.png" alt="Write On logo with the 'Dune: Part Two' movie poster on a phone with headphones around it" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<div>
  “In most genre fiction where heroes and villains clash, the hero is intrinsically reactive. The villain starts making trouble and that’s the beginning of the story. If the villain had never showed up, the hero would have lived a pleasant and unremarkable life and had a lovely time. And nothing novel-worthy would have popped up. But the villain comes along and does something terrible and that makes heroic action necessary. So if that’s the function of the hero in the story, to be called to heroic action, then the first conflict that’s readily available to you is reluctance or a sense of being unworthy… and then after that, the hero will be called to take on a new shape and often that will be in response to the shape of the danger, in response to the shape of the wickedness a foot,” says Oscar-nominated screenwriter, Jon Spaihts, about the classic hero-villain relationship in 
 <em>Dune: Part One</em>&nbsp;and 
 <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, based on the books by Frank Herbert.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>In this episode, Jon Spaihts talks about the importance of hand-to-hand combat in mythic storytelling, his favorite scene in 
 <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, and we do a deep dive into his most adored character, Lady Jessica, played by Rebecca Ferguson. We explore the nature of her mystical powers and why she’s so feared by the men in the story.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>Spaihts also shares his advice about what it really means to get personal with your writing.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>“When people say to make your story personal, they don’t really mean look at yourself. You are the least qualified person to say something meaningful about yourself. What people are really talking about is that you should focus on the things that obsess you. You can look at the things that are most plangent to your feelings, that are most itchy and sticky for your intellect, the things you can’t stop thinking about. You can focus on the experiences that have impacted you most profoundly. Those things – the things that push on you and pull on you – that is personal storytelling. You look not at yourself, you look at the things that have moved you, that have affected you, that have changed you, redirected your life and the things that preoccupy you. Those are your seeds of personal storytelling,” says Spaihts.&nbsp;

## Wooing the Witch Queen by Stephanie Burgis: Review by Liz Bourke

date: 2024-12-29, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Wooing the Witch Queen</strong>, Stephanie Burgis (Bramble 978-1250359599, $19.99, 304pp, tp) February 2025.</p>
<p>Given my hit-and-miss track record with fantasy romances – a record far more miss than hit – I didn’t expect to enjoy Stephanie Burgis’s <strong>Wooing the Witch Queen </strong>nearly as much as it turns out I did. But this playful, tongue-in-cheek, not-exactly enemies-to-lovers romp won me over with aston­ishing rapidity.</p>
