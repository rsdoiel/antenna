## Children of Anguish and Anarchy by Tomi Adeyemi: Review by Eugen M. Bacon

date: 2024-09-18, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Children of Anguish and Anarchy</strong>, Tomi Ad­eyemi (Henry Holt 978-1250171016, $22.99, 356pp, tp) June 2024.</p>
<p>As a reader new to Tomi Adeyemi, I hadn’t read the first two books in the Legacy of Orïsha trilogy, before approaching <strong>Chil­dren of Anguish and Anarchy</strong>. I don’t believe it affected my reading experience, because the novel, while part of a trilogy, clearly allows for new readers.</p>

## The Bricks of Breaking In: 'Bob Hearts Abishola' Co-Showrunner Gina Yashere On Following Your Passion

<p>There are many <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/the-bricks-of-breaking-in-writer-ray-utarnachitt-on-finding-your-own-path">pathways in</a> when it comes to making it as a writer. For Gina Yashere (<span style="font-style: italic;">Bob Hearts Abishola</span>), that path was anything but direct. In fact, for the longest time she didn’t even think of being a writer. She was an engineer, but her love of comedy, when given the chance to thrive, won out, leading her to perform stand-up, write sketch comedy in the UK, and even become a finalist on NBC’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Last Comic Standing</span>. To get through that door as a working writer in Hollywood, it literally came down to a fortunate Google search by a veteran show creator in need of a Nigerian woman writer that opened the way for her television career.&nbsp;</p>

## She Who Knows by Nnedi Okorafor: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2024-09-17, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>She Who Knows</strong>, Nnedi Okorafor (DAW 978-0-75641-895-3, $23.00, 176pp, hc) August 2024.</p>
<p>As with any good fantasy setting, Nnedi Okorafor’s 2010 World Fantasy Award-winning <strong>Who Fears Death </strong>introduced us to a world that seemed far more expansive than what was contained in the text. Set in a far-future Sudan in which the Okeke people face brutal oppression by the Nuru, it combined hints of a bygone technological age with  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/09/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-she-who-knows-by-nnedi-okorafor/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Write On: 'Pachinko' Showrunner Soo Hugh

</div> 
<div> 
 <p>“Sometimes I think [the show <em>Pachinko</em>] is almost too personal. I feel like every show, you look at it and say, ‘How much of myself is in this show?’ I did a show [<em>The Whispers</em>] about children who were communicating with an invisible alien force and somehow, I had to figure out how to make it part of me as well. We try to put ourselves in as much of our work as possible. But with this show, the tipping point almost fell in the other direction, where I felt so personally invested. I felt very much like this is my family’s story, as well. That responsibility sometimes felt burdensome. So many of the cast and crew have said that there's a responsibility with this show that almost feels too much. But at the end of the day I think it's a thing that made us work harder. I think the show is as good as it is because people cared,” says <em>Pachinko</em> showrunner and creator Soo Hugh about making the story personal to her.</p> 
 <p>In this episode, we speak to Hugh about the challenges of writing a show where characters speak in three languages, making the characters relatable to an American audience, and the responsibility of telling the stories of strong women over generations.</p> 
 <p>“In Korean families, we always have these jokes that everyone knows who’s running the house – your mother! I think it's the strength of Korean women that have just carried us through,” she says.</p> 
 <p>We even ask Hugh about her work on one of my favorite shows <em>The Terror</em>, and what she thinks really happened to the real-life British crew on the Terror and Erebus ships that got stuck in the Artic ice. Her answer may surprise you.</p>

## Using Film Tropes in Screenwriting

date: 2024-09-16, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper">

</div> 
<p>A film trope is a thematic storytelling device that conveys an idea to the audience.&nbsp;<br><br>If a trope is utilized enough over time, avid filmgoers and critics will become aware of the device and will be able to spot it when it appears. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">the Hero’s Journey</a> is a popular story template for movies, and within this template are several common tropes: the protagonist has lost a parental figure, they initially refuse a calling, they get initiated into a new world by a mentor, and eventually they come into their own and become a hero.</p>
