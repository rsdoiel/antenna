## The Secret To Writing Good Jokes in a Script

 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/the-secret-to-writing-good-jokes-in-a-script" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Tragedy%20Girls.jpg" alt="Two girls in cheerleading uniforms smiling at their phones in 'Tragedy Girls,' The Secret To Writing Good Jokes in a Script" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p><span>Any comedic writer will tell you there’s nothing more satisfying than a well-placed joke. That’s probably because writing comedy isn’t easy. Just like any other screenplay, a comedic screenplay has to have a well-developed story and three-dimensional characters while making audiences laugh. You have to be funny while trying not to be funny while remaining true to the situation at hand and the character’s personality. This is no easy feat.&nbsp;</span></p>
