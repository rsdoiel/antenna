## Charles Payseur Reviews Short Fiction: Understudies by Priya Sridhar, Diabolical Plots, Samovar, and Strange Horizons

date: 2024-02-13, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Diabolical Plots 10-11/23
<strong>Understudies</strong>, Priya Sridhar (Hiraeth) Febru­ary 2023.
Samovar 10/23/23
Strange Horizons 10/30/23, 11/6/23</p>
<p>Over at Diabolical Plots, the publishing schedule has been temporarily compacted, leading to an October and November with only one story each instead of the regular two. Both stories are quite good, though, and both stay in the Halloween spirit with witches and ghosts aplenty. Both also twist expectations regarding these classic elements, as  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/charles-payseur-reviews-short-fiction-understudies-by-priya-sridhar-diabolical-plots-samovar-and-strange-horizons/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Year in Review 2023 by Alex Brown

<p><strong>2023 </strong><strong>by Alex Brown</strong></p>
<p>In an unintentional yet perfect synchronicity of events, I’m writing this 2023 speculative fiction wrap-up on the last day of the year with a glass of Martinelli’s while waiting for the ball to drop. It was a strange, contradictory year, one with several professional wins and sev­eral more personal hardships.

<p>I have watched a lot of episodes of the British TV show <strong>Midsomer Murders</strong>.
