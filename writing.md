## khōréō: Short Fiction Reviews by A.C. Wise

date: 2025-04-14, from: Locus Magazine

<p>khōréō 4.3</p>
<p>“<strong>The Last Flesh Figure Skaters</strong>” by <strong>Claire Jia-Wen </strong>opens khōréō 4.3 on a strong note, following the rivalry between two competi­tive skaters, each using different kinds of body modifications. The rivalry between them leads to fascination, which develops into a romantic relationship. The story is beautifully written, ex­ploring parents living vicariously through their children and the pressure often put on young athletes to succeed.

## The Fake Muse by Max Besora: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2025-04-13, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Fake Muse</strong>, Max Besora (Open Letter 978-1-96038-533-8, $16.95, 176pp, tp) February 2025.</p>
<p>It will be a bizarre (but wonderful) year if I en­counter another novel as chaotic, obscene, and metatextual as Max Besora’s <strong>The Fake Muse </strong>(translated by Mara Faye Lethem).
