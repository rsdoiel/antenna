<p><strong>Blade</strong>, Linda Nagata (Mythic Island Press 978-193719-744-5, $7.99, 308pp, eb) March 2024. Cover by Sarah Anne Layton</p>
<p>Subtract the mystery/thriller-family elements and most of the same tropes and devices enable Linda Nagata’s <strong>Blade</strong>, the fourth entry in her Inverted Frontier sequence, itself a continuation of the Nanotech Succession series.

</div> 
<p><span>Crafting <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-steps-for-developing-great-characters">memorable characters</a> is the first step in writing engaging short stories. As the reader, we are choosing to spend a brief period of time inside the head of the main character, going on an emotional ride with them that may bring us a new perspective on life, like the resilience of human nature. Although the wants and needs of your protagonist drive the plot forward, all the characters, including your antagonist and any supporting characters, should each leave a lasting impression.</span></p>
