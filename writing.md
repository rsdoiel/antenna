<p>Screenwriter <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1151425/?ref_=ttfc_fcr_wr_1">Alan Trezza</a> discovered the concept for his new horror film <span style="font-style: italic;">Rosario</span> during the pandemic. The project went from concept to completed script in just four weeks in a creative sprint fueled by 5 a.m. wake-ups and late-night writing sessions.<br><br>It all started when he wondered what it would be like to have to spend a night with a loved one’s body. This idea evolved further when Trezza, the son of an immigrant, began examining cultural assimilation in America.<br><br>These themes coalesced for <span style="font-style: italic;">Rosario</span>, a claustrophobic horror film starring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3014089/?ref_=ttfc_fcr_cst_1">Emeraude Toubia</a> as a Wall Street stockbroker who returns to her deceased grandmother’s apartment during a snowstorm. While waiting for EMTs to collect the body, she uncovers a hidden chamber filled with occult artifacts tied to dark rituals. It becomes a race against the sunrise for her to break an ancestral curse.<br><br>We spoke with Trezza about how he finished the screenplay so quickly, keeping the second act interesting, the importance of plant-and-payoff for horror, and more. Explore his process with us.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</span></p>

## Write On: 'Good American Family' Creator & Co-Showrunner Katie Robbins and Co-Showrunner Sarah Sutherland

date: 2025-05-07, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-good-american-family-co-showrunners-katie-robbins-and-sarah-sutherland" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Good%20American%20Family%20Co-showrunners%20Katie%20Robbins%20and%20Sarah%20Sutherland%20%281%29.png" alt="Write On logo of a cell phone with headphones around it featuring the poster of the show Good American Family" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>“One of the things we talked a lot about in the room is that very rarely do people set about their day saying, ‘Okay, I’m going to go do some evil.’ But for most people, we’re all sort of the leads in our own stories and we’re all crafting the narrative of who we want the world to see us as. And we do start to believe that. You tell yourself these stories about yourself that you want to be true and you move through the world and you make decisions based on that narrative. And I think that one of the things that as writers, we really try to do is get into the shoes and the heads of the characters that we’re writing and really try to break down why they’re doing what they’re doing and make it feel as real and true as possible. The things that these characters believe – or convince themselves that they believe – have to feel really real and grounded to us,” says Katie Robbins, creator and co-showrunner of<em> Good American Family</em>, on writing flawed characters who prefer to live in fantasy, not reality.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode of Write On, we speak to Katie Robbins (creator) and Sarah Sutherland, co-showrunners on the explosive limited series, <em>Good American Family</em>. The show tells the story of a midwestern couple who adopts what they believe is little girl with dwarfism. Soon they are in the midst of a battle fought in the tabloids, the courtroom and ultimately their marriage. The show is based on the real-life story of Natalia Grace that made many headlines.<br><br>Robbins and Sutherland talk about the unusual yet brilliant structure of telling various episodes from different characters’ points of view, and how the tone changed when they got to the episodes told from Natalia’s perspective. They also talked about the messiness of writing a dysfunctional family while still keeping the story grounded.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“We all know family is this wonderful, beautiful thing, but it’s so complex. And I think that it’s really hard to talk about the complexities of family because we’re afraid to undermine the sacredness of it. It’s my view that if we are actually more open about what is hard about coexisting as a unit who loves each other, but also what’s not perfect, it would make us all better. And I think that that’s true both for family but also even for our enemies. We’re not writing autobiographies, but I think that we take those very real emotional experiences that we all have and then put them into a story that is cinematic, that is more interesting than our lives, but that is deeply steeped in those real moments of heartache and joy and confusion,” says Sutherland.&nbsp;<br><br>To learn more, listen to the podcast but be aware there are SPOILERS ahead.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>Thirty years ago, comic book movies were hardly popular. Batman seemed to be the only reliable franchise character igniting the 1995 summer with <em>Batman Forever</em>. <em>Spider-Man</em> in 2002 launched the real possibility of superhero and comic book movies before the genre hit the gas in 2008 with <em>Iron Man</em>. Studios and producers then dug deep into the comic book world turning the obscure <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> into a major piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and also creating acclaimed television shows like <em>The Boys</em> and <em>The Penguin</em>.</p>

## Commentary: Cory Doctorow: Strange Bedfellows and Long Knives

<p>If a group of people have been trying to get something done for some time without success, there are two possibilities: Either they’re failing because of bad tactics, or they’re failing because they simply lack the power to achieve their goals. When things start changing in big, dramatic ways, that means that some group in society has either discovered a new tactic, or they’ve found some new coalition partners.</p>
