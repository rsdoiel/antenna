## ‘Novocaine’: How to write an Action Movie with a Twist

<p>It’s hard to write an original action movie. How different can car chases really be? And hasn’t a fight in a restaurant kitchen been done countless times already? Action movies can be a lot of fun, but creating a truly good story with action can be really tough. To make something original, you have to go beyond what the action is and look at the people in the story: What drives them? What was their call to action? And why do we even care?</p>

## It’s Not Cheating If It’s With Your Clone: Josh Pearce and Arley Sorg Discuss Mickey 17

date: 2025-03-20, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Capitalism, in fiction and in real life, depends on expendable (that is, cheap) labor. Slaves, serfs, indentured servants, children, undocumented migrants, gig workers, (now science fiction and real life start to blur) robots, assembly-line automation, &#8220;AI.&#8221; <strong>Mickey 17 </strong>extends logically next to clones, which are worked literally to death and then simply reprinted in fresh bodies for their next job.</p>

## How to Sell a Screenplay

</div> 
<p>Selling a screenplay is the ultimate goal for every screenwriter. The general process itself seems simple enough to most at first glance. You write a screenplay. You get that screenplay into the hands of decision-makers in Hollywood. They buy your script and then attach a talented director, crew, and cast to make your cinematic story come to life. While that encompasses the general process of selling a screenplay overall, there’s a “little” more that goes into it than that. With that in mind, here we offer a closer look into the process of selling a screenplay.</p>

## Death and Other Speculative Fictions by Caroline Hagood: Review by Jake Casella Brookins

date: 2025-03-20, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Death and Other Speculative Fictions</strong>, Caroline Hagood (Spuyten Duvvil 9781963908503, $18.00, 116pp, tp) January 2025.</p>
<p>Caroline Hagood’s <strong>Death and Other Speculative Fictions </strong>is an astonishing read, comforting and discomforting in equal measure. A philosophical, poetic meditation on the death of a parent, it’s a whirl of reflections on what fantastic stories can say about death, and vice versa. Don’t be dismayed by the fact that this doesn’t look like  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/03/death-and-other-speculative-fictions-by-caroline-hagood-review-by-jake-casella-brookins/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Dagger in Vichy by Alastair Reynolds: Review by Alexandra Pierce

<p><strong>The Dagger in Vichy</strong>, Alastair Reynolds (Subter­ranean 978-1-64524-280-2, $40.00, 120pp, hc) August 2025. Cover by Andrew Davis.</p>
<p><strong>The Dagger in Vichy </strong>is very different from Alastair Reynolds’s other recent work. His most recent novel, <strong>Machine Vendetta </strong>(2024), saw him return to the Revelation Space universe. This novella, on the other hand, is set on Earth – albeit (it becomes clear) many centuries in the future.

<p>“Sameness is terrible. Your goal is to cut through it. If you have a unique perspective, you’re going to take vampires or anything that everybody thinks they know and do it in a way that’s really exciting and gets people really pumped up about it. There are all these incredible worlds to explore, but there just needs to be somebody that can take you there that has a different way of doing it… I want to see creators that offer something specific and unique. Specificity is key to me. I don’t want a cover band. I don’t want people covering what has been before. I want to see something new. I want to see a badass band with a new singer or new lyrics, a new style of music,” says Peter Katz, founder of Story Driven, a literary management and production company.&nbsp;<br><br>On today’s episode, we speak to Peter Katz, a manager and producer championing writers with fresh, unique voices who are forging new ground. We talk about what he looks for in a writing sample, why he loves being a judge in Final Draft’s Big Break screenplay competition, and why short stories are having a bright moment in the film industry.&nbsp;<br><br>“Recently, I’ve actually seen TV executives starting to think about short stories as a foundation for potential shows. It’s a really effective way to communicate an idea quickly, in a really conceptual way, but also, it’s not like a pitch. It’s very tonal, you have character perspective and you have the style that the author brings to it. So I think it has a really unique marriage between pitching the concept, but also immersing you in a world in a very short period of time. That’s why I think it’s been effective in selling to a market because you could share a short story with somebody and it doesn’t demand a lot of time If it’s developed properly, you’re able to learn about the potential of this project and then quickly share with somebody else on your team. And overnight, a lot of people can sign on to a project because it doesn’t take as long as other mediums,” says Katz.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more about Katz’s perspective on the industry and what he looks for in a writer’s voice, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About 30 years ago, something changed in Hollywood. Big blockbuster movies by top-notch filmmakers were no longer the clear-cut favorites to win Academy Awards. Small films were breaking through the surface and gaining appeal among a wide audience. Suddenly, filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh, the Coen Brothers and Kevin Smith, whose films’ budgets were miniscule compared to studio feature films, were finding niche audiences and building box office credibility.</p>

## Lessons for Screenwriters from SXSW

<p>The South by Southwest Conference &amp; Festival, held annually in Austin, TX, crackles with a creative energy no other film festival can match, offering screenwriters lessons from its wildly diverse slate.<br><br>While studios were certainly present at the fest, with big-name sequels like <em>The Accountant 2</em> and <em>Another Simple Favor</em> nabbing splashy premieres, it also feels like a remarkably scrappy place. You’ll find swing-for-the-fences high-concept projects sharing space with adult animation series, self-funded comedy pilots paired with deeply personal autobiographical stories, and concepts so audaciously weird they shouldn’t work but somehow do.<br><br>I saw as many features, shorts, and pilots as possible and spoke with writers from projects of all sizes and genres, putting together some of this year’s common themes and hearing what they’ve learned.&nbsp;</p>

## Writing Action Set Pieces

date: 2025-03-18, from: John August blog

John welcomes back Christina Hodson (The Flash, Bumblebee) to ask, how do you to construct a great action sequence?

## The Dream Hotel by Laila Lalami: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2025-03-18, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Dream Hotel</strong>, Laila Lalami (Pantheon 978-0593317600, $29.00, 336pp, hc) March 2025.</p>
<p>This may sound like an odd question, but are algorithms starting to take over the narrative func­tion that psi powers once served in SF? The idea of preventing crimes by pre-emptively arresting supposed perpetrators has been around at least since Orwell’s notion of ‘‘thoughtcrimes,’’ and in the 1950s this became the province of psioni­cally gifted folks like  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/03/the-dream-hotel-by-laila-lalami-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Scriptnotes, Episode 677: Puzzle Box Storytelling, Transcript

date: 2025-03-17, from: John August blog

The original post for this episode can be found here. John August: Today’s episode has no bad language, but it does have some mild spoilers for Severance. If you’re trying to go into that show clean, without any spoilers, about midway through the show when Craig starts spouting wild theories, just skip ahead 30 seconds [&#8230;]

## How ‘The Righteous Gemstones’ Premiere Surprised Fans

</div> 
<p>The premiere episode of the fourth and final season of <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em> has a lot of people talking.&nbsp;<br><br>The episode, titled simply “Prelude,” doesn’t feature any of the series’ regular cast. It also takes place during the Civil War, and not during the show’s present-day setting, as it follows an ancestor of the Gemstone family: Elijah Gemstone (played wonderfully by Bradley Cooper).<br><br>One of the main reasons the episode has created such a buzz is how much of a departure it is from the rest of the show. Cowritten and directed by <em>Gemstones</em> creator and star Danny McBride, “Prelude” is highly cinematic and carries far more gravitas than a typical episode of the comedic series.&nbsp;<br><br>There <em>have </em>been tonal shifts previously in <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em>, largely due to the acting chops of John Goodman (playing family patriarch Eli Gemstone), as well as the occasional dramatic-leaning turn. The same can be said for McBride’s other HBO series <em>Eastbound &amp; Down</em> and <em>Vice Principals</em>. Whether it’s a shocking burst of violence or a cathartic moment set to an evocative piece of music, McBride’s comedy — alongside frequent collaborators Jody Hill and David Gordon Green — has always been offset by not only a cinematic flair, but also a willingness to embrace different tones. &nbsp;</p>

A couple married for 15 years travels to Greenland to study a mysterious sludge causing the local wildlife population to act like a single-cell organism, sharing thoughts and knowledge.

<p><strong>Combat Monsters: Untold Tales of World War II</strong>, edited by Henry Herz (Blackstone 979-8874748432, trade paperback, 384pp, $18.99) February 2025</p>
