## Jake Casella Brookins Reviews House of Open Wounds by Adrian Tchaikovsky

date: 2024-03-10, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>House of Open Wounds</strong>, Adrian Tchaikovsky (Head of Zeus 978-1-0359-0138-8, $27.99. 608pp, hc) December 2023. Cover by Joe Wilson.</p>
<p>Although it is set in the same world as <strong>City of Last Chances</strong>, Adrian Tchaikovsky’s <strong>House of Open Wounds </strong>is very much a standalone sequel. The previous novel introduced us to a large cast of characters in Telmark, a formerly independent nation conquered by the aggres­sively expanding Palleseen Sway.  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/03/jake-casella-brookins-reviews-house-of-open-wounds-by-adrian-tchaikovsky/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
