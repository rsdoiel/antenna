<p>Your screenwriting journey is all about evolving as a screenwriter. Everyone generally starts at the same place. As we progress by educating ourselves (screenwriting books, screenwriting blogs, reading produced screenplays, etc.), we begin to add to our knowledge base. We build a go-to tool belt. Then, as we begin to write scripts, we learn through trial by fire and trial by error. We slowly get better and better with each script.&nbsp;<br><br>But there comes a time, even after those first two or three scripts, when you begin to hit a ceiling of sorts.&nbsp;<br><br>Becoming a better screenwriter is all about leveling-up. You get to stages that teach you valuable lessons. You advance to the next stage after applying what you’ve learned. This evolution is great, but there are a few ways that can help you jumpstart your evolution even more, catapulting you past many of those sometimes mundane stages.&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here are five fast ways you can be a better screenwriter.&nbsp;</p>

## Harmattan Season by Tochi Onyebuchi: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2025-04-22, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Harmattan Season</strong>, Tochi Onyebuchi (Tor 978-1250782977, 240pp, $27.99, hc) May 2025.</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say, on the basis of <strong>Riot Baby </strong>and <strong>Goliath </strong>alone, that we didn’t have any idea what to expect next from the adventurous Tochi Onyebuchi. But I doubt that even his most assidu­ous readers were anticipating a hardboiled his­torical/political private-eye postcolonialist noir fantasy mystery (and even at that, I’ve probably left some stuff  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/04/harmattan-season-by-tochi-onyebuchi-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
