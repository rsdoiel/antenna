## James Mangold talks ‚ÄòA Complete Unknown‚Äô and how to make your writing better

date: 2024-12-13, from: Final Draft blog

 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/james-mangold-talks-a-complete-unknown" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/A%20Complete%20Unknown%20-%203.png" alt="Timoth√©e Chalamet as Bob Dylan, walking down the street in 'A Complete Unknown' " class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>James Mangold has carved out a fascinating place in Hollywood as a director and writer who really can do it all‚Äîhe‚Äôs elevated genre films into compelling character studies and tackled everything from Westerns to hard-hitting dramas to romantic comedies to comic book adaptations.<br><br>He made one of the best superhero films in history (2017‚Äôs <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/filmmaker-insight-james-mangold-give-new-focus-storytelling-logan"><em>Logan</em></a>), then a couple of years later told a true motorsport story in the brilliant <span style="font-style: italic;">Ford v Ferrari</span>. He‚Äôs twice Oscar-nominated, once for each of these films, but fans will also recall the much-feted <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358273/awards/?ref_=tt_awd"><span style="font-style: italic;">Walk the Line</span></a>, which in 2006 captured a slew of awards across acting and technical categories. We could go on and on.&nbsp;<br><br>It‚Äôs fitting that Mangold has come back around to music with this year‚Äôs Bob Dylan biopic, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Complete Unknown</span>. Starring Timoth√©e Chalamet as Dylan, the film follows the musician‚Äôs early years‚Äîhis arrival in New York City, finding his place in music, and then turning the Newport Folk Festival upside-down when he chose not to play acoustic.&nbsp;<br><br>Mangold and his lead actor just received the Visionary Tribute at the <a href="https://awards.thegotham.org/">2024 Gotham Awards</a>, not to mention a couple of Golden Globe nominations. Final Draft chatted with the writer/director the day before those nominations were announced, and Mangold laid out some vital writing wisdom for us.</p>

## Good Night, Sleep Tight by Brian Evenson: Review by Ian Mond

<p>The best horror fiction is about dislocation, the growing feeling that something is askew or lopsided with the world and only you, no one else, is aware. Brian Evenson gets this. In a recent article for Lit Hub, he points out that:</p>

## Write On: 'The Bikeriders' Writer and Director Jeff Nichols

date: 2024-12-12, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-the-bikeriders-writer/director-jeff-nichols" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Jeff%20Nichols%20%281%29.png" alt="Write On Podcast Logo: Image of a phone with headphones around it featuring the movie poster for 'The Bikeriders'" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<div>
  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre reading these interviews [in the book 
 <em>The Bikeriders</em> by Danny Lyon] and they‚Äôre all interesting, but Kathy‚Äôs are just fascinating. You could just tell she was a character, meaning she was just this interesting, dynamic person, a person that was trying to figure out how she found herself in this world because she really talks about walking into this bar and meeting this charismatic young bike rider. And so, it was a really beneficial crutch for me to kind of get into this world. And then before you know it, by the middle of the script, I‚Äôm writing words for Kathy that never existed. It didn‚Äôt hurt that, in my research, I reached out to Danny and he turned over hours and hours of recordings. I would drive around town just listening to Kathy talk. I mean, I had this woman in my head and I felt pretty confident midway through the script that I could write in her voice. It just gave this perspective to a very masculine, aggressive subculture. It gave this feminine point of view, but to me it was just a really interesting point of view,‚Äù says writer/director Jeff Nichols about writing the character Kathy, played by Jodie Comer, in his film 
 <em>The Bikeriders</em>.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>In this episode of the podcast, we speak to Jeff Nichols about his departure from Southern Gothic storytelling and going deep into the world of a 1960s motorcycle club for 
 <em>The Bikeriders</em>, starring Austin Butler and Tom Hardy. We also discuss some of his other films like 
 <em>Loving, Take Shelter</em> and 
 <em>Mud</em>, starring Matthew McConaughey ‚Äì a film Nichols thought would never get released.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>‚ÄúI thought 
 <em>Mud</em> was a failure. We had taken 
 <em>Mud</em> to the Cannes Film Festival, and although we had a really nice reception there, you know, standing ovations and whatnot ‚Äì no one bought the film. And we went an entire year with no one buying that film. In fact, no one ever did buy that film. The financier put up half the money to market and distribute that film and luckily, Roadside Attractions came in and put up the other half and then it became the film that everybody knows,‚Äù says Nichols.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>To hear more about Nichols‚Äôs writing process, and his advice for building stories around ‚Äúemotional impact,‚Äù listen to the podcast.&nbsp;

## Surprising Ways 'Nightbitch' Uses Dog Metaphor to Explore Motherhood

date: 2024-12-11, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/surprising-ways-nightbitch-uses-dog-metaphor-to-explore-motherhood" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Nightbitch%20%281%29.png" alt="Amy Adams in 'Nightbitch'" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>Directed by Marielle Heller, the new film <em>Nightbitch</em> stars Amy Adams as a stay-at-home mother who‚Äôs losing her dang mind. After giving up a fulfilling (though not necessarily lucrative) career as an artist, she now focuses fulltime on her husband and young son. ‚ÄúMother‚Äù (Adams), as she‚Äôs called in the story because her identity, including her name, has completely faded away, has lost her sense of self along with her grip on reality. Based on Rachel Yoder‚Äôs novel of the same name, <em>Nightbitch</em> uses metaphor to dig deep into the female psyche to expose the animalistic nature of being a mother. In this case, the metaphor is a mother who transforms into a dog.&nbsp;<br><br>Movies about humans becoming canine aren‚Äôt new. There‚Äôs a long history of werewolf films including a whole string of them in the 1980s: <em>The Howling</em> (1981), <em>An American Werewolf in London</em> (1981), <em>Wolfen</em> (1981), <em>The Night of the Werewolf</em> (1981), <em>The Company of Wolves</em> (1984), <em>Silver Bullet</em> (1985), <em>Teen Wolf</em> (1985), and <em>Night Shadow</em> (1989). (Not sure why this one decade needed so many werewolf movies, perhaps it has something to do with societal changes, but that‚Äôs the subject for another article). &nbsp;<br><br>Typically, the transformation of a human into a werewolf is symbolic of our primal instincts getting the best of us, our repressed desires coming to the surface, and the way civilized human behavior rightfully clashes with our animalistic impulses. But Mother doesn‚Äôt turn into a wolf, she turns into a dog. Why? It allows the story to take a much more domestic turn and bends the metaphor into something more relatable to suburban family life. Also, if she became a wolf, the audience would worry for the safety of her son. Let‚Äôs delve into three clever ways <em>Nightbitch</em> uses the dog metaphor in the film.&nbsp;</p>

## The Enchanted Lies of C√©leste Artois by Ryan Graudin: Review by Alexandra Pierce

<p>Paris, 1913, saw the first public performance of Stravinsky‚Äôs <strong>The Rite of Spring</strong>, and it caused a sensation ‚Äì indeed, some have said it caused a riot, but there seems to be disagreement over that interpretation.

<p>British writers Chris and Michael Mul, known as the Mul Brothers in the screenwriting world, have some fantastic news: their Big Break-winning screenplay, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ansel-elgort-in-bear-grylls-produced-survival-thriller-faster-than-horses-afm2024-1236047326/" style="font-style: italic;">Faster Than Horses</a>, is in pre-production with director James Erskine (<span style="font-style: italic;">Shooting for Socrates</span>), producer Bear Grylls (<span style="font-style: italic;">Running Wild with Bear Grylls</span>) and starring Ansel Elgort (<span style="font-style: italic;">Baby Driver</span>).&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Faster Than Horses</span> is a survival-thriller about a former Olympic runner, Mauro Prosperi (Elgort), who attempts a comeback in the grueling Marathon des Sables across the treacherous Sahara Desert. Based on a true story, the athlete disappeared for nine days in a sandstorm that left him fighting for his life.&nbsp;<br><br>We sat down with the Mul Brothers to find out about their writing journey and hear how winning the Big Break competition helped progress their career to the next level.<br><br>The Mul Brothers have always been fans of survival stories and are obsessed with movies like <span style="font-style: italic;">127 Hours</span>. But when they read an article about <a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/travel/crazy-in-the-desert-w474055">Prosperi‚Äôs harrowing journey</a> in 2017, they knew the shocking endurance story had particular cinematic appeal. &nbsp;<br><br>‚ÄúThe amount of things that went wrong for Mauro while he was in the desert ‚Äì you couldn‚Äôt believe it!‚Äù says Michael, adding, ‚ÄúA missed plane that went past and then he just so happened to not be in the right place when they sent out a rescue team, it was one thing after another. And then right at the end of the story, he tried to take his own life but somehow survived because the blood just congealed. He saw that as a sign of divine intervention to keep going.‚Äù&nbsp;<br><br>After that, Prosperi faced down the guns of Algerian soldiers when he accidentally wandered from Morocco into Algeria. No wonder survival expert Bear Grylls signed on to produce the movie!<br><br>But a great true-life story doesn‚Äôt always translate easily into a great movie script. Beyond just the true events, the story must also include a highly emotional and cathartic journey for its protagonist. The Mul Brothers were able to craft that journey by focusing on Prosperi‚Äôs deep need to reclaim his former athletic glory ‚Äì something the judges of the Final Draft Big Break competition recognized. <span style="font-style: italic;">Faster Than Horses</span> was awarded the prize for Best Feature Drama in 2021.&nbsp;<br><br>‚ÄúEvery screenplay competition has a different caliber and it took us a little while to figure out who the big players were. So with the Final Draft submission, we were just like fingers crossed!‚Äù says Chris, who admits he was thrilled to find out they‚Äôd won considering they had entered the year before.&nbsp;<br><br>The prize package that came with the Big Break win made all the difference.&nbsp;<br><br>‚ÄúMike and I say, 100 percent, one of the best prize packages we ever received was the fellowship that we got as a result of Final Draft. It wasn‚Äôt so much about the money. It was more about the opportunity that led to us writing more material. I think it was 10 weeks and over that time, we wrote an entirely new TV pilot in one of the classes [as part of the New York Film Academy, included in their prize package] which was a really cool experience. The guy who was running it, George McGrath, who we‚Äôve stayed in contact with and was super lovely, shared it with a friend of his at HBO just off the bat and he‚Äôd never shared anything with anybody before, but he just felt like the color of the writing was great. So just off that, it was like, ‚ÄòOkay, this is why Final Draft is that much higher in caliber.‚Äô For us, it was one of the best experiences we‚Äôve had when it came to placing or winning in contests,‚Äù says Chris.<br><br>The Mul Brothers want to share this advice for emerging writers: ‚ÄúKeep writing. I think that that is the best way to find your voice as a writer. The more Chris and I wrote, we started to find that we would continually revisit the same themes in our work. And ultimately that‚Äôs what really grounds you as a writer in terms of the things that you like to explore,‚Äù says Michael.&nbsp;<br><br>Chris‚Äôs advice is to read produced screenplays for this reason: ‚ÄúA lot of writers starting out don‚Äôt realize how important the first 10 pages of the screenplay are because sometimes that‚Äôs all a producer is going to read. You see in those opening 10 pages of a lot of produced screenplays, they‚Äôre almost perfect in how they‚Äôre delivering character and introductions to the world and themes, and the economy of those pages.‚Äù&nbsp;<br><br>For more information on Big Break visit <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/big-break-screenwriting-contest/">https://www.finaldraft.com/big-break-screenwriting-contest/</a>.<br><br></p>

## Sleep Like Death by Kalynn Bayron: Review by Colleen Mondor

<p><strong>Sleep Like Death</strong>, Kalynn Bayron (Bloomsbury 978-1-547-60976-5, $19.99, 368pp, hc) June 2024.</p>
<p>As she previously did with Cinderella, author Kalynn Bayron turned another classic on its head this year with <strong>Sleep Like Death</strong>, her smart and scary reimagining of Snow White. There‚Äôs a temptation when an author revisits a famous tale to assume they will simply modernize or dress it up a little, all of which can be  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/sleep-like-death-by-kalynn-bayron-review-by-colleen-mondor/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>Augur 7.1</p>
<p>Grief, loss, healing, and recovery are themes running through Augur 7.1, and it‚Äôs interesting to see how different authors approach similar subject matter. ‚Äú<strong>Sagal, the-Witch-in Training</strong>‚Äù by <strong>Ardo Omer </strong>follows the titular witch-in-training on her first solo case, trying to help a young woman with a broken heart.
