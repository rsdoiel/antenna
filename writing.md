## Six Degrees of a Spec Sale

date: 2025-01-14, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/six-degrees-of-a-spec-sale" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Filmmaker%20Writing.png" alt="Six Degrees of a Spec Sale" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>If you‚Äôre a beginner writer and you‚Äôve read about a new ‚Äúspec sale‚Äù in the trades, you might not know what all the fuss is about.&nbsp;<br><br>A spec sale is when <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-is-a-spec-script">a spec script</a> has been purchased by a studio or production company (a spec script being an original screenplay that you‚Äôve written on your own and not on assignment). &nbsp;<br><br>Spec sales have always piqued the imagination of aspiring screenwriters and people working in the film business, especially in a marketplace that‚Äôs increasingly dependent on established IPs (intellectual properties). Just the idea that someone came up with <span style="font-style: italic;">an original idea for a movie</span> and then <span style="font-style: italic;">sold it</span> almost seems like a fantastical feat, and the bigger the sale, the more wonder it inspires.&nbsp;<br><br>Big spec sales aren‚Äôt a daily event, and when they do happen, everyone gets very excited about the news. It can create a long-lasting career for a screenwriter if they have good representation and make the most of their newfound ‚Äúheat‚Äù (i.e. industry buzz).&nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes the spec script you sold doesn‚Äôt even have to end up getting produced in order for it to create a career for you. I broke into the film business with <a href="https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/carrey-reitman-team-for-pierre-1117981909/">a big spec sale</a> that got a lot of attention for several years. In fact, that script <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> gets brought up to me whenever I meet someone who was working in the industry back when we sold it. This proves that spec sales not only pique the imagination, stir excitement and create a buzz: they stick in the minds of people for years to come.<br><br>Every screenwriter‚Äôs journey is going to be different, but for me there were six degrees to my spec sale.</p>
