## 5 Screenwriting Lessons from Golden-Globe Winner ‘The Brutalist’

date: 2025-01-27, from: Final Draft blog

 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-screenwriting-lessons-from-golden-globe-winner-the-brutalist" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Adrien%20Brody%20in%20The%20Brutalist.png" alt="Adrien Brody stands above sparks smoking a cigarette" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>This year’s winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Drama) and Best Performance by a Male Actor for Adrien Brody (Drama), <em>The Brutalist</em> has become one of the most intriguing films to come out of 2024. Writer/Director Brady Corbet’s mid-century tale follows László Tóth (Adrien Brody), a renowned architect whose ambition and talent lands him in the good graces of a wealthy client who hires him to build a monument on a Pennsylvania hillside. In many ways <em>The Brutalist</em> is an unconventional biopic as it is about a largely unknown figure and clocks in at 3.5 hours long (with an intermission!).&nbsp;</p>

## Fortress Sol by Stephen Baxter: Review by Alexandra Pierce

date: 2025-01-27, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Fortress Sol</strong>, Stephen Baxter (Gollancz 978-1-39961-461-0, £25.00, 480pp, hc). October 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Fortress Sol </strong>is classic Stephen Baxter. It’s driven by big ideas: Humanity’s response to a perceived existential threat includes both dispersing to the stars and mind-boggling engineering projects. Like 2021’s <strong>Galaxias</strong>, the focus is not so much on the alien threat as on humanity’s response. There’s a relatively small cast of characters, who are engag­ing enough but  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/fortress-sol-by-stephen-baxter-review-by-alexandra-pierce/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Shutouts by Gabrielle Korn: Review by Abigail Nussbaum

date: 2025-01-26, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Shutouts, </strong>Gabrielle Korn (St. Martin’s 978-1-2503-2348-4, $29.00, 304pp, hc) December 2024.</p>
<p>As climate change has become an ever-growing and more insistent presence in our lives, it has also begun inflecting and informing works of fiction, whose authors imag­ine how the remainder of the 21st century will play out. Interestingly, it is writers coming from outside the traditional venues of SFF writing and publishing who have most readily embraced this  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/the-shutouts-by-gabrielle-korn-review-by-abigail-nussbaum/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
