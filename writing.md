<p>“I think what Tim [Burton] does is he’s always trying to simplify. That’s the essence of a classic filmmaker. People think he’s wild and crazy and does all these things. His movies are brilliantly composed frames and he’s always looking for simplicity. All of his big movies, they’re really family dramas dressed up in whatever genre he’s in. That’s really what they are. And I think people think he’s always strange and weird and likes dark things, but no! It’s a classic story with good drama. And then he brings his sensibility to it,” says about the biggest lesson Al Gough has learned working with director Tim Burton on both the TV show <em>Wednesday</em> and the new film <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>.</p>

## The Bricks of Breaking In: Lucifer Showrunner Joe Henderson on the Power of Notes

</div> 
<p>There’s a common piece of advice for writers, and that’s to always be writing. Showrunner Joe Henderson (<em>Lucifer</em>) got a jump start on those words of wisdom as he was already writing stories in second grade, never knowing where those stories, and that creativity, would take him. Henderson recalls:<br><br><em>“I was reading Dungeons and Dragons books and would write stories that either took place in that world or extended it out. I moved on to Star Wars novels and would write my versions of that. I was just always writing.”</em></p>

## Archangels of Funk by Andrea Hairston: Review by Sean Dowie

date: 2024-09-08, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Archangels of Funk</strong>, Andrea Hairston (Tor­dotcom 978-1-25080-728-1, $29.99, 384pp, hc) July 2024.</p>
<p>Andrea Hairston’s <strong>Archangels of Funk </strong>forced me to rewire my brain chemistry. The book contains a stew of dense but rewarding elements as people, dogs, spirits, and bots dot a literary canvas unlike anything I’ve read. It’s a cozy dystopia that demands attention, demands that you think on its wavelength. The book largely contains good but flawed  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/09/sean-dowie-reviews-archangels-of-funk-by-andrea-hairston/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p><strong>Key Lime Sky</strong>, Al Hess (Angry Robot 978-1915998125, trade paperback, 304pp, $18.99) August 2024</p>
<p>It has been said that Irish fantasist Flann O’Brien had a penchant for involving the humble bicycle in his surreal fiction, until the vehicle became a kind of numinous totem or idiosyncratic symbol. A few other writers of fantasy have deployed such a technique—recurring enigmatic touchstone with multiple meanings—and now Al Hess joins their ranks,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/09/paul-di-filippo-reviews-key-lime-sky-by-al-hess/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
