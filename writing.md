## Hollywood Got Old

date: 2024-11-05, from: John August blog

John and Craig look at how writers (and other humans) handle the anxiety of uncertainty, from election nights to green lights. We’ll talk through strategies for navigating situations where your circle of concern doesn’t match your circle of control. Then we travel back to the 1980s and 90s, when many studios were run by ambitious [&#8230;]

## State of Paradise by Laura van den Berg: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2024-11-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>State of Paradise</strong>, Laura van den Berg (Farrar, Straus, Giroux 978-0-37461-220-7, $27.00, 224pp, hc) July 2024.</p>
<p>I move from one instance of weird Florida (Area X is a distorted version of North Florida) to another: Laura van den Berg’s <strong>State of Paradise</strong>. I’d say that reading VanderMeer and van den Berg back-to-back (alliterative surnames aside) is a remarkable coincidence, except that Florida, to outsiders such as myself, has  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/11/state-of-paradise-by-laura-van-den-berg-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## At the table with Kamala Harris

date: 2024-11-04, from: John August blog

I first met Kamala Harris at a small lunch in 2010. Just four or five of us around a table. Harris was running to become California’s next attorney general, so a friend suggested we meet her. I found Harris to be incredibly bright and charismatic. I donated to her campaign on the spot. Afterwards, I [&#8230;]

## Write On: 'Here' Screenwriter Eric Roth

date: 2024-11-04, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper">

</div> 
<div>
  “I think [ 
 <em>Here</em>] has some of the imagination of 
 <em>Forrest Gump</em>, but it’s not 
 <em>Forrest Gump</em>. It’s a different animal. I mean, it has the same kind of humanity to it, which is what I’m pretty good at,” says Eric Roth about his latest film 
 <em>Here</em>, co-written and directed by Robert Zemeckis and reuniting actors Tom Hanks and Robin Wright.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>On today’s podcast, we speak with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth about the challenges of writing the screenplay for 
 <em>Here</em> that mostly takes place in one room, with a fixed camera that never moves. The movie explores the ordinary lives of multiple generations of families in a way that many will find relatable, heartbreaking and, at times, claustrophobic.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>“I’m not sure [the characters in 
 <em>Here</em>] are extraordinary or not, but they show the length and breadth of what people can and can’t do and when they’re trapped. I think when it works that way dramatically, it’s quite lovely and quite beautiful. I don’t want to use the word profound, but I think the [movie] is profound to a certain extent because it is just about the regularity of life. And that, from dinosaurs to the future, it’s going to keep going. Hopefully people will find great joy in how they’re living and I’m sure great pain too, but I think that’s just sort of the circle of life,” he says.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>We also discuss some of his other films like 
 <em>Forrest Gump</em>, for which he won an Oscar, and 
 <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>He shared this advice about using subtext in screenplays. “I think that I’m always trying to find a way to enhance the scene with not only subtext, but with some kind of metaphor and make it possibly more interesting as to getting to the root of people’s feelings without them having to vomit out what they’re saying you know. It’s not easy, but I think as I’ve gotten more successful and more accomplished at it,” he says.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>To hear more of Eric Roth’s advice for screenwriters, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;

## Smothermoss by Alisa Alering: Review by Colleen Mondor

date: 2024-11-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Smothermoss</strong>, Alisa Alering (Tin House 978-1-959-03058-4, $17.95, tp, 256pp) July 2024.</p>
<p>Alisa Alering’s debut novel <strong>Smothermoss </strong>is a master class in conveying both a physically and psychologically oppressive atmosphere. Set in a small rural Appalachian town in the early 1980s, the novel follows the tough adventures of sisters Sheila and Angie. At seventeen years old, Sheila is acutely aware of her ‘‘otherness,’’ a kid all too often bullied and  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/11/smothermoss-by-alisa-alering-review-by-colleen-mondor/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Cory Doctorow: Hard (Sovereignty) Cases Make Bad (Internet) Law

date: 2024-11-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Let’s start with two obvious facts:</p>

<li>The internet is a communications medium, that</li>
<li>crosses international borders.</li>

<p>That means that every single policy question related to the internet will have:</p>

<li>a) A free expression dimension, and</li>
<li>b) A national sovereignty dimension.</li>

<p>With that out of the way&#8230;.</p>
<p>Late last August, Pavel Durov – the billionaire owner of the Telegram app – was arrested by French authorities after he landed his private  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/11/cory-doctorow-hard-sovereignty-cases-make-bad-internet-law/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Fiyah, Flash Fiction Online, Escape Pod, and Strange Horizons: Short Fiction Reviews by Charles Payseur

date: 2024-11-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Fiyah Summer ’24
Flash Fiction Online 7/24
Escape Pod 7/25/24
Strange Horizons 7/15/24, 7/29/24, 8/12/24</p>
<p>The Summer ’24 Fiyah theme is disability. The issue seeks to break down stereotypes and expectations that Black people are monolithic and separate from experiences with disability, and it does sharp work of just that, as in <strong>F. Kirk</strong>’s “<strong>Worms Fill My Mouth</strong>”, which finds Isaac experiencing an acute horror that the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/11/fiyah-flash-fiction-online-escape-pod-and-strange-horizons-short-fiction-reviews-by-charles-payseur/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
