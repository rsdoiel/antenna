## A.C. Wise Reviews Short Fiction: khōréō

date: 2024-09-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p>khōréō 3.4</p>
<p>Due to an error in my logging stories for review, I acciden­tally left three stories out of my initial review of khōréō 3.4. The stories are reviewed here with apologies to the authors, editors, and publisher of the magazine.</p>

## The AI Copyright Hype: Legal Claims That Didn’t Hold Up

date: 2024-09-03, from: Author's Union blog

Over the past year, two dozen AI-related lawsuits and their myriad infringement claims have been winding their way through the court system. None have yet reached a jury trial. While we all anxiously await court rulings that can inform our future interaction with generative AI models, in the past few weeks, we are suddenly flooded [&#8230;]

## Cory Doctorow: Marshmallow Longtermism

date: 2024-09-02, from: Locus Magazine

<p>There are many ways to cleave the views of the political right from the political left, but none is so science fictional as the right’s confidence in the role of individual self-discipline on one’s life chances. Dip into any political fight about crime and poverty and you’re sure to turn up someone confidently asserting that these social ills are rooted in impatience. Poverty, we’re told, is rooted in an unwillingness  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/09/cory-doctorow-marshmallow-longtermism/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Ian Mond Reviews Gogmagog by Jeff Noon & Steve Beard

date: 2024-09-02, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Gogmagog</strong>, Jeff Noon &#38; Steve Beard (Angry Robot 978-1-91520-282-6, $18.99, 353pp, tp) February 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Gogmagog </strong>is the first novel I’ve read by Jeff Noon since the publication of <strong>Nyphomation </strong>in 1997. The books he wrote immediately after his Vurt phase – <strong>Needle in the Groove </strong>and <strong>Falling Out of Cars </strong>– didn’t appeal to twenty-something Ian (though <strong>Falling Out of Cars </strong>looks right up the al­ley of fifty-something Ian).  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/09/ian-mond-reviews-gogmagog-by-jeff-noon-steve-beard/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Colleen Mondor Reviews A Tempest of Tea by Hafsah Faizal

<p><strong>A Tempest of Tea</strong>, Hafsah Faizal (Farrar Straus Giroux 978-0-374-38940-6, hc, 336 pp) February 2024. Cover by Valentina Remenar.</p>
<p>Hafsah Faizal has written a banger of a caper novel with <strong>A Tempest of Tea</strong>. Her tale of thieves, forgery, and political malfeasance set in the town of White Roaring takes readers on a ride with twists and turns they can never expect. Reminiscent of 19th-century London, White Roaring  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/09/colleen-mondor-reviews-a-tempest-of-tea-by-hafsah-faizal/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
