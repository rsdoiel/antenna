## The River Has Roots by Amal El-Mohtar: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2025-02-26, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The River Has Roots</strong>, Amal El-Mohtar (Tordotcom 978-1-250-34108-2, $24.99, 144pp, hc) March 2025.</p>
<p>Amal El-Mohtar‚Äôs <strong>The River Has Roots </strong>is an absolutely lovely take on classic murder ballads, with distinct echoes of the Tam Lin story and a soundtrack that might as well be wall-to-wall Steeleye Span. It might come as a bit of a surprise to readers who know El-Mohtar‚Äôs work only from the popular and multiple award-winning  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-river-has-roots-by-amal-el-mohtar-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## How To Write a Screenplay

</div> 
<p>So you‚Äôve decided you want to be a screenwriter and write your very own screenplay for a feature film, TV show, or new media platform.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a unique skillset, because film and television are visual mediums and collaborative art forms. Because of this, a screenplay needs to be formatted in a specific way. These days, most writers invest in <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/company/why-screenwriting-software/">screenwriting software</a> that automatically formats their scripts to industry standard formatting, so this part of the process is not nearly as daunting as it was in the past.&nbsp;<br><br>However, even with screenwriting software, if you‚Äôre a beginner writer, you might not know the best way to approach the blank page and fill it with ideas for a movie, TV series or any kind of narrative content you‚Äôre looking to create. And just like any skillset, it‚Äôs possible to learn and eventually excel at screenplay writing.<br><br>Below are <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 Easy Steps to Writing a Screenplay</span>:</p>

## The Year in Review 2024 by Graham Sleight

date: 2025-02-24, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Some years, it feels like there‚Äôs a central book in SF and fantasy, one around which the conversation orbits.
