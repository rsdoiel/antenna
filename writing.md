## Lessons from the 9 Films of Charlie Kaufman

date: 2025-04-30, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/lessons-from-the-9-films-of-charlie-kaufman" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Being%20John%20Malkovich.jpg" alt="Lessons from the 9 Films of Charlie Kaufman" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>If you were to survey the new voices of American cinema across smaller, auteur-driven outfits like A24 and Neon, there’s one pervading influence that seems to crop up more than any other, that of writer/director Charlie Kaufman. The New York-born filmmaker made his name writing scripts that used absurdist, comic premises to grapple with the personal anxieties and neuroses he experienced in mundane everyday life, oftentimes exploring the blurry line between performance and reality. The earliest of these films were lent a whimsical visual style by such inventive music video directors as Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry, before Kaufman eventually took the directorial reins himself, resulting in a darker, rawer expression.&nbsp;<br><br>A quarter century on from Kaufman’s debut feature film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_0_in_0_q_being%2520john%2520malkovich"><em>Being John Malkovich</em></a>, his style still echoes prevalently in contemporary works as diverse as The Daniels’ Oscar-winning <span style="font-style: italic;">Everything Everywhere All At Once</span>, Boots Riley’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Sorry To Bother You</span>, Ari Aster’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Beau Is Afraid</span>, Kristofer Borgli’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Dream Scenario</span>, Aaron Schimberg’s Oscar-nominated <span style="font-style: italic;">A Different Man</span>, and the dark comic works of Yorgos Lanthimos. Even Apple TV’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Severance</span> and sci-fi romances like <span style="font-style: italic;">Palm Springs</span> and Jonze’s own screenplay for <span style="font-style: italic;">Her</span>, owe a debt to Kaufman’s unique voice.&nbsp;<br><br>In studying his career, one can trace how Kaufman developed and fought hard to stay true to his weird, distinct sensibility in a system increasingly averse to originality, from struggling sitcom writer, to inventive screenwriter-for-hire, and finally, to a singular filmmaker who would influence a generation. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_0_in_0_q_being%2520john%2520malkovich" style="font-style: italic;"></a></p>

## Sour Cherry by Natalia Theodoridou: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2025-04-30, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Sour Cherry</strong>, Natalia Theodoridou (Tin House 978-1963108194, 312pp, $17.95, tp) April 2025.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to take a whack at Blue­beard, it seems. While many of those old Charles Perrault fairy tales have given rise to endless variations over the centuries, this one seems particularly fascinating to modern writers, including Kurt Vonnegut, Donald Barthelme, and Angela Carter. More recently, we’ve seen variations from Margaret Atwood, Gregory Frost, T.

## The Incandescent by Emily Tesh: Review by Liz Bourke

<p><strong>The Incandescent</strong>, Emily Tesh (Tor 978-1-250-83501-7, $28.99, 432pp, hc.) May 2025. Cover by Jess Kiley.</p>
<p>I have never been a teacher. And I have never gone to school in England. But the extent to which Emily Tesh’s portrayal of a centuries-old boarding school on the public-school model of Rugby or Winchester in <strong>The Incandescent </strong>is both instantly recognisable from my own school experience and eerily alien – less in  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/04/the-incandescent-by-emily-tesh-review-by-liz-bourke/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
