<p><strong>The Devils</strong>, Joe Abercrombie (Tor 978-1-250-88005-5, $29.99, 560pp, hc) May 2025.</p>

## A Granite Silence by Nina Allan: Review by Niall Harrison

date: 2025-05-25, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>A Granite Silence</strong>, Nina Allan (riverrun 978-1-529-43557-3, £20.00, 352pp, hc) April 2025.</p>
<p>And then I picked up <strong>A Granite Silence </strong>as exam­iner rather than examinee, wondering if it would pass the test that a work must pass to be covered in these pages, of departing sufficiently from consensus reality. I’m not sure Nina Allan has yet written anything that would unambiguously fail that test, at least in my eyes,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/05/a-granite-silence-by-nina-allan-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
