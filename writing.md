## ‘Witchboard’ Writer/Director Chuck Russell Says Horror ‘Better Be Scary’ to Work

 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/witchboard-writer-director-chuck-russell-says-horror-better-be-scary-to-work" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Madison%20Iseman%20in%20Witchboard.png" alt="Image of Madison Iseman being burned at the stake in Witchboard" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>In the original horror film <em>Witchboard</em> from 1986, a young woman (Tawny Kitaen) becomes obsessed with a Ouija board at a party. She is then terrorized by a malevolent spirit, leaving her boyfriend and her ex to try to figure out what’s going on. It’s a cult film, although definitely of its time, and was inspired by the writer’s real experience with a Ouija board.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, writer/director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0751080/">Chuck Russell</a> (a horror icon in his own right) is giving the film an update with 2025’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2256055/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_cst_sm_2#writer" style="font-style: italic;">Witchboard</a>, expanding the world and lending the scary premise a fresh, modern spin. The story is bigger, unfolding across two distinct yet interconnected timelines: one reveals the board’s origin, while the present-day story follows the board as it falls into the hands of Emily (Madison Iseman). The film also stars Jamie Campbell Bower as a mysterious occultist who will do anything to get the artifact.<br><br>Russell rose to prominence with some of the major genre films of recent memory, like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110475/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520mask" style="font-style: italic;">The Mask</a> starring Jim Carrey and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093629/?ref_=nm_knf_t_2" style="font-style: italic;">A Nightmare on Elm Street 3</a>. He also wrote and directed the 1988 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094761/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_t_11" style="font-style: italic;">The Blob</a> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mummy</span> franchise entry <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277296/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_t_6" style="font-style: italic;">The Scorpion King</a>.<br><br>We spoke to Russell ahead of the wide release of his new film to learn how he approaches structure and character in the horror genre, and more.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</span><br></p>

## Dive Deeper: What Is Theme in Film?

</div> 
<h2>What Is Theme in Writing?</h2> 
<p>A theme is the underlying message or larger idea that a piece of writing is conveying. Themes in stories are often associated with a moral or the reader’s takeaway from what has occurred in the narrative. However, a theme can sometimes simply reflect some truth or observation about life and society without any judgement.&nbsp;</p>

## Selwyn Seyfu Hinds explores Steampunk and Identity in 'Washington Black'

date: 2025-07-28, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/selwyn-seyfu-hinds-explores-steampunk-and-identity-in-washington-black" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Sterling%20K.%20Brown%20and%20Iola%20Evans%20in%20Washington%20Black.png" alt="Sterling K. Brown and Iola Evans walking through a clearing in Washington Black" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>When Selwyn Seyfu Hinds first picked up the award-winning novel <em>Washington Black</em> by Esi Edugyan, he was on a break during the holidays in his homeland of Guyana. “I have a longstanding rule not to read material over Christmas,” he says. But Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, producer of <em>The Maze Runner</em> films, convinced him to break that rule. He was glad he did.<br><br>“The book was just astonishing,” says Hinds. The journey of a young Caribbean boy navigating trauma, identity, and freedom deeply resonated with Hinds’ own experience immigrating to America at 14.&nbsp;<br><br>“The emotional arc felt the same,” he says. “Learning new ecosystems, new languages and new people – understanding the opportunities and the dangers in the place that you exist. And all of it on your road to finding your agency, finding your method, finding love, you know, finding your existential self. All of that came together and I said this is something that I have to write.”&nbsp;<br><br><em>Washington Black</em> is now a lush, genre-bending TV series on Hulu, executive produced by Hinds, who also serves as showrunner. It’s a steampunk reimagining of the 19th century from a perspective rarely seen on screen. Set in the early 1800s, it follows George Washington “Wash” Black (Eddie Karanja), a boy born into slavery on a Barbados plantation. After an unfortunate event endangers his life, he flees with British explorer Titch (Tom Ellis), embarking on a globe-spanning journey that takes him into adulthood.&nbsp;<br><br>The series weaves back and forth between 20-something Wash (Ernest Kingsley Junior), with flashbacks to Young Wash, delving into matters of race, resilience and a young America. Actor Sterling K. Brown even has a supporting role and serves as Executive Producer. But it’s the unexpected playfulness and optimism that the steampunk tropes – like the depiction of fantastic steam-powered flying machines – that really make it extraordinary.&nbsp;</p>
