## Co-Writer of REZ BALL Talks Writing Sports Drama And Avoiding Tropes

<p>It can be incredibly difficult to venture into an established genre like the <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-reasons-you-should-write-a-sports-biopic-like-clipped">sports drama.</a><br><br>It’s a tried-and-true narrative with some equally tested—and beloved—tropes. Sometimes the team is a ragtag group of misfits, the underdogs no one believes in. Sometimes the coach has taken on this post after failing in the big leagues. Often, the most dramatic moment comes down to the last play in the big game.<br><br>Writer/director Sydney Freeland (Diné) knows all these tropes. And instead of fighting against them during the writing process, she embraced them, flipped them, gave them a unique spin, and made them work for the story.&nbsp;</p>

## How to sell Big Fish

date: 2024-10-09, from: John August blog

This afternoon, I came across the letter I wrote in 1998 trying to convince Columbia Pictures to option the rights to Daniel Wallace&#8217;s novel Big Fish for me to adapt. It&#8217;s strange seeing this letter now. In it, I describe the very broad shape of the movie, but at the time I didn&#8217;t know so [&#8230;]

## Joker: Folie à Deux Movie Review by Erin Underwood

date: 2024-10-09, from: Locus Magazine

<p class="p1"><strong>Joker: Folie à Deux</strong> starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga follows up the 2019 smash hit <strong>Joker.</strong>  The film was easily one of the most anticipated movies of 2024, which automatically puts it at a disadvantage when trying to meet the audience’s expectations. However,<strong> Joker: Folie à Deux</strong> just might be a prime example of why studios need to rethink their current approach to filmmaking when a film that should  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/joker-folie-a-deux-movie-review-by-erin-underwood/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Craft: Stories I Wrote for the Devil by Ananda Lima: Review by Jake Casella Brookins

date: 2024-10-09, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Craft: Stories I Wrote for the Devil</strong>, Ananda Lima (Tor 978-1-25029-297-1, 192pp, $24.99, hc) Cover by Jamie Stafford-Hill. June 2024.</p>
<p>Ananda Lima’s <strong>Craft: Stories I Wrote for the Devil </strong>is pleasingly hard to classify. One could take the easy route and call it a debut collection – and an exciting one, to be sure, an excellent mix of stories magical, speculative, and wholly grounded.

## HOLD YOUR BREATH Writer Explores Dark Side of Motherhood in Horror Tale

date: 2024-10-07, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hold-your-breath-writer-explores-dark-side-of-motherhood-in-horror-tale" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Hold%20Your%20Breath.png" alt="Sarah Paulson in HOLD YOUR BREATH" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p><em>Hold Your Breath</em> is an achingly beautiful film that resonates in many powerful ways. While hitting many of the necessary tropes of psychological horror, it’s the incredible acting performances that hook you and won’t let you escape – even when it’s hard to breathe.&nbsp;<br><br>Set in Oklahoma in the 1930s Dust Bowl, famine, disease and death abound. But for Margaret (Sarah Paulson), and her two daughters, 12-year-old Rose (Amiah Miller) and 7-year-old Ollie (Alona Jane Robbins) who’s deaf, it’s not just the pervasive dust that’s threatening their lives, but something much more sinister. Even when the mysterious stranger Wallace (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) shows up menacingly in the night, the film asks: could the mother-daughter bond be the most dangerous threat of all?&nbsp;<br><br>Written by Karrie Crouse, best known for TV’s <em>Westworld</em>, and directed by Crouse and Will Joines, the movie seems like a dark fable inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, when just breathing the air might put your life at risk. But surprisingly (and eerily), the screenplay was written before the pandemic even started. Crouse says the inspiration for the film actually came from watching the Ken Burns documentary <em>The Dust Bowl</em>.&nbsp;</p>

## What is “Derivative Work” in the Digital Age?

date: 2024-10-07, from: Author's Union blog

 Ideas and concepts, including “derivative works,” are only important to the extent they elucidate our understanding of the world. When the use of “derivative works” leads to more confusion than clarity, we should be cautious in adopting the new meaning being superimposed on “derivative works.”
