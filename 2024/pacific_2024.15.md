date: 2024-04-09, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Senior Israeli officials said progress has been made in negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza that would include the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, a move that drew criticism from far-right ministers who threatened to bring down the government. &#8220;We&#8217;ve reached a critical point,&#8221; Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Army Radio on Monday. &#8220;If matters work out, a large number of hostages will return home and then, in stages, everyone. But remember that we are dealing with Hamas and there is not a lot of time. I am more optimistic than I was.&#8221;</p>

## Yen feels the heat as US Treasury yields rise

date: 2024-04-09, updated: 2024-04-09, from: Marianas Variety

SINGAPORE (Reuters) — The dollar was tentative on Tuesday as it failed to get a meaningful boost from a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, though that kept pressure on the yen which languished near multi-decade lows and left traders on alert for any signs of intervention.
