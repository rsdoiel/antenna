<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog</p>
<p>On December 14 1998 we released curl 5.2. The project was still early
back then and lots of things had not settled yet. In that release, which
came only two weeks after 5.1, we introduced the –manual option, or -M
for short. Long before I started working on curl I learnt to value and

Six years ago I wrote
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/archival-media-not-good-business.html"><i>Archival
Media: Not a Good Business</i></a> and included this
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5007621">table</a>. The argument went
as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The value that can be extracted from data decays rapidly with time.
</li>
<li>
Thus companies would rather invest in current than archival data.
</li>
<li>
Thus archival media and systems are a niche market.
</li>
<li>
Thus archival media and systems lack the manufacturing volume to drive
down prices.
</li>
<li>
Thus although quasi-immortal media have low opex (running cost), they
have high capex (purchase cost).
</li>
<li>
Especially now interest rates are non-zero, the high capex makes the net
present value of their lifetime cost high.
</li>
<li>
Archival media compete with legacy generic media, which have mass-market
volumes and have already amortized their R&amp;D, so have low capex but
higher opex through their shorter service lives.
</li>
<li>
Because they have much higher volumes and thus much more R&amp;D,
generic media have much higher Kryder rates, meaning that although they
need to be replaced over time, each new unit at approximately equal cost
replaces several old units, reducing opex.
</li>
<li>
Especially now interest rates are non-zero, the net present value of the
lower capex but higher opex is likely very competitive.
</li>
</ul>
Below the fold I look into why, despite this, Microsoft has been pouring
money into archival system R&amp;D for about a decade.<br />

<h3>
Background
</h3>
Eleven years ago Facebook announced they were building entire
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/02/facebooks-cold-storage.html">data
centers for cold storage</a>. They expected the major reason for reads
accessing this data would be subpoenas. Eighteen months later I was
finally able to report on Kestutis Patiejunas’ talk explaining the
technology and why it made sense in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html"><i>More
on Facebook’s “Cold Storage”</i></a>. They used two different
technologies, the first exploiting legacy generic media in the form of
mostly-powered-down hard drives. Facebook’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">design
for this was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
aimed at limiting the worst-case power draw. It exploits the fact that
this storage is at the bottom of the storage hierarchy and can tolerate
significant access latency. Disks are assigned to groups in equal
numbers. One group of disks is spun up at a time in rotation, so the
worst-case access latency is the time needed to cycle through all the
disk groups. But the worst-case power draw is only that for a single
group of disks and enough compute to handle a single group.<br /> <br />
Why is this important? Because of the synergistic effects knowing the
maximum power draw enables. The power supplies can be much smaller, and
because the access time is not critical, need not be duplicated. Because
Facebook builds entire data centers for cold storage, the data center
needs much less power and cooling. It can be more like cheap warehouse
space than expensive data center space. Aggregating these synergistic
cost savings at data center scale leads to really significant savings.
</blockquote>
Patiejunas figured out that, only at cloud scale, the economics of
archival storage could be made to work by reducing the non-media,
non-system costs. This insight led to the second technology,
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">robots
full of long-lived optical media</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It has 12 Blu-ray drives for an entire rack of cartridges holding 10,000
100TB Blu-ray disks managed by a robot. When the robot loads a group of
12 fresh Blu-ray disks into the drives, the appropriate amount of data
to fill them is read from the currently active hard disk group and
written to them. This scheduling of the writes allows for effective use
of the limited write capacity of the Blu-ray drives. If the data are
ever read, a specific group has to be loaded into the drives,
interrupting the flow of writes, but this is a rare occurrence. Once all
10,000 disks in a rack have been written, the disks will be loaded for
reads infrequently. Most of the time the entire Petabyte rack will sit
there idle.
</blockquote>
In theory Blu-ray disks have a 50-year life, but this is
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">irrelevant</a>:
<blockquote>
No-one expects the racks to sit in the data center for 50 years, at some
point before then they will be obsoleted by some unknown new, much
denser and more power-efficient cold storage medium
</blockquote>
Eight years ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2016/05/the-future-of-storage.html"><i>The
Future Of Storage</i></a> I explained:<br />
<blockquote>
Every few months there is another press release announcing that some
new,
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2014/06/more-on-long-lived-media.html">quasi-immortal
medium</a> such as 5D quartz or stone DVDs has solved the problem of
long-term storage. But the problem stays resolutely unsolved. Why is
this? Very long-lived media are inherently more expensive, and are a
niche market, so they lack economies of scale. Seagate could easily make
<a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/news/events/other_meetings/storage09/docs/5-4_Anderson-seagate-v3_archive_study.pdf">disks
with archival life</a>, but they did a study of the market for them, and
discovered that no-one would pay the relatively small additional cost.
The drives currently marketed for “archival” use have a shorter warranty
and a shorter MTBF than the enterprise drives, so they’re not expected
to have long service lives.<br /> <br /> The fundamental problem is that
long-lived media only make sense at very low Kryder rates. Even if the
rate is only 10%/yr, after 10 years you could store the same data in 1/3
the space. Since space in the data center racks or even at Iron Mountain
isn’t free, this is a powerful incentive to move old media out. If you
believe that Kryder rates will get back to 30%/yr, after a decade you
could store 30 times as much data in the same space.
</blockquote>
The key parameter of these archival storage systems isn’t the media
life, it is the write bandwidth needed to keep up with the massive flow
of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">data
to be archived</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While a group of disks is spun up, any reads queued up for that group
are performed. But almost all the I/O operations to this design are
writes. Writes are erasure-coded, and the shards all written to
different disks in the same group. In this way, while a group is spun
up, all disks in the group are writing simultaneously providing huge
write bandwidth. When the group is spun down, the disks in the next
group take over, and the high write bandwidth is only briefly
interrupted.
</blockquote>
The lesson Facebook taught a decade ago was that the keys to
cost-effective archival storage were first, massive scale, and second,
high write bandwidth. Microsoft has learned the lesson and has been
working to develop cloud-scale, high write bandwidth systems using two
quasi-immortal media, DNA and silica.<br />

Rob Carlson’s
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage"><i>The Quest for a
DNA Data Drive</i></a> provides a useful overview of the current state
of the art. Alas he starts by using one of my pet hates, the graph
showing an immense gap between the “requirements” for data storage and
the production of storage media. Carlson
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">captions the
graph</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior projections for data storage requirements estimated a global need
for about 12 million petabytes of capacity by 2030. The research firm
Gartner recently issued new projections, raising that estimate by 20
million petabytes. The world is not on track to produce enough of
today’s storage technologies to fill that gap.
</blockquote>
<b>&lt;rant&gt;</b> Carlson’s point is to suggest that there is a huge
market for DNA storage. But this ignores economics. There will always be
a “requirement” to store more data than the production of storage media,
because some data is not valuable enough to justify the cost of storing
it. The “gap” could only be filled if media were free. Customers will
buy the storage systems they can afford and prioritize the data in them
according to the value that can be extracted from it.
<b>&lt;/rant&gt;</b>.<br /> <br /> The size of the market for DNA
storage systems depends upon their cost. In 2018’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html"><i>DNA’s
Niche in the Storage Market</i></a> I imagined myself as the marketing
person for a DNA storage system and posed these challenges:<br />
<blockquote>
Engineers, your challenge is to increase the speed of synthesis by a
factor of a quarter of a trillion, while reducing the cost by a factor
of fifty trillion, in less than 10 years while spending no more than
$24M/yr.<br /> <br /> Finance team, your challenge is to persuade the
company to spend $24M a year for the next 10 years for a product that
can then earn about $216M a year for 10 years.
</blockquote>
Carlson is realistic about the
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">engineering
challenges</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For a DNA drive to compete with today’s archival tape drives, it must be
able to write about 2 gigabits per second, which at demonstrated DNA
data storage densities is about 2 billion bases per second. To put that
in context, I estimate that the total global market for synthetic DNA
today is no more than about 10 terabases per year, which is the
equivalent of about 300,000 bases per second over a year. The entire DNA
synthesis industry would need to grow by approximately 4 orders of
magnitude just to compete with a single tape drive.
</blockquote>
One of the speed-ups that is needed is
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">chip-based massive
parallelism</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of our goals was to build a semiconductor chip to enable
high-density, high-throughput DNA synthesis.
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi6714">That
chip</a>, which we completed in 2021, demonstrated that it is possible
to digitally control electrochemical processes in millions of
650-nanometer-diameter wells.
</blockquote>
It was faster, but it’s chemistry had
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">problems</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The main problem is that it employs a volatile, corrosive, and toxic
organic solvent
(<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a>),
which no engineer wants anywhere near the electronics of a working data
center.<br /> <br /> Moreover, based on a sustainability analysis of a
theoretical DNA data center performed my colleagues at Microsoft, I
conclude that the volume of acetonitrile required for just one large
data center, never mind many large data centers, would become
logistically and economically prohibitive.
</blockquote>
Although it is the industry standard, this isn’t the only way to
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">write
DNA</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Fortunately, there is a different emerging technology for constructing
DNA that does not require such solvents, but instead uses a benign salt
solution. Companies like <a href="https://www.dnascript.com/">DNA
Script</a> and <a href="https://molecularassemblies.com/">Molecular
Assemblies</a> are commercializing automated systems that use enzymes to
synthesize DNA. These techniques are replacing traditional chemical DNA
synthesis for some applications in the biotechnology industry. The
current generation of systems use either simple plumbing or light to
control synthesis reactions. But it’s difficult to envision how they can
be scaled to achieve a high enough throughput to enable a DNA
data-storage device operating at even a fraction of 2 gigabases per
second.
</blockquote>
The Microsft/UW chip is an
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">alternative way to
control enzymatic synthesis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The University of Washington and Microsoft team, collaborating with the
enzymatic synthesis company Ansa Biotechnologies, recently took the
first step toward this device. Using our high-density chip, we
successfully demonstrated
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00044">electrochemical
control of single-base enzymatic additions</a>.
</blockquote>
The link is to
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00044"><i>Spatially
Selective Electrochemical Cleavage of a Polymerase-Nucleotide
Conjugate</i></a> by Jake A. Smith <i>et al</i>:<br />
<blockquote>
Novel enzymatic methods are poised to become the dominant processes for
de novo synthesis of DNA, promising functional, economic, and
environmental advantages over the longstanding approach of
phosphoramidite synthesis. Before this can occur, however, enzymatic
synthesis methods must be parallelized to enable production of multiple
DNA sequences simultaneously. As a means to this parallelization, we
report a polymerase-nucleotide conjugate that is cleaved using
electrochemical oxidation on a microelectrode array. The developed
conjugate maintains polymerase activity toward surface-bound substrates
with single-base control and detaches from the surface at mild oxidative
voltages, leaving an extendable oligonucleotide behind. Our approach
readies the way for enzymatic DNA synthesis on the scale necessary for
DNA-intensive applications such as DNA data storage or gene synthesis.
</blockquote>
This has, as the article points out, potential for dramatically reducing
the current cost of writing DNA, but it is still many orders of
magnitude away from being competitive with a tape drive. The

<h3>
Silica
</h3>
The idea of writing data into fused silica with a femtosecond laser is
at least a
<a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">decade
and a half old</a><br />
<blockquote>
In 2009, Hitachi focused on fused silica known for its excellent heat
and water resistance as a recording medium for long-term digital
storage. After proposing the use of computed tomography to read data
recorded with a femtosecond pulse laser, fused silica glass was
confirmed as an effective storage medium. Applying this technology, it
is possible to achieve multi-layer recording by changing the laser’s
focal point to form microscopic regions (dots) with differing refractive
indices. In 2012, a method was developed with Kyoto University to read
the recorded dots in 4 layers using an optical microscope (recording
density equivalent to a CD), and in 2013, 26 layer recording was
achieved (recording density equivalent to a DVD). In order to increase
recording density for practical applications, one means is to increase
the number of recording layers. At the 100-layer level of recording
density equivalent to a Blu-ray disc however issues arose in dot quality
degradation and read errors resulting from crosstalk of data recorded in
other layers.
</blockquote>
But in the last few years Microsoft Research has taken this idea and run
with it, as they report in a 68-author paper at SOSP entitled
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208"><i>Project Silica:
Towards Sustainable Cloud Archival Storage in Glass</i></a>. It is a
fascinating paper that should be read by anyone interest in archival
storage. Like
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html">me</a>,
the authors are skeptical of the near-term prospects for
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">DNA storage</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Technologies like DNA storage offer the promise of an extremely dense
media for long-term data storage. However, the high costs and low
throughputs of oligonucleotide synthesis and sequencing continue to
hamper the technology’s feasibility. The total amount of data
demonstrably stored in DNA remains on the order of MBs, and building a
functional storage system that can offer reasonable SLAs underpinned by
DNA is a substantial challenge. Alternative DNA-based technologies like
dNAM attempt to bypass costly sequencing and synthesis steps,
sacrificing density down to densities comparable with magnetic tape.
</blockquote>
Hence their focus on a medium with, in theory, a somewhat lower
volumetric density. From their
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">abstract</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This paper presents Silica: the first cloud storage system for archival
data underpinned by quartz glass, an extremely resilient media that
allows data to be left in situ indefinitely. The hardware and software
of Silica have been co-designed and co-optimized from the media up to
the service level with sustainability as a primary objective. The design
follows a cloud-first, data-driven methodology underpinned by principles
derived from analyzing the archival workload of a large public cloud
service.
</blockquote>
Their analysis of the workload of a tape-based cloud archival storage
system in Section 2
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">shows that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
on average for every MB read there are 47 MBs written, and for every
read operation there are 174 writes. We can see some variation across
months, but writes always dominate by over an order of magnitude.<br />
…<br /> Small files dominate the workload, with 58.7% of the reads for
files of 4 MiB or smaller. However, these reads only contribute 1.2% of
the volume of data read. Files larger than 256 MiB comprise around 85%
of bytes read but less than 2% of total read requests. Additionally,
there is a long tail of request sizes: there is ∼ 10 orders of magnitude
between the smallest and largest requested file sizes.<br /> …<br /> We
observe a variability in the workload within data centers, with up to 7
orders of magnitude difference between the median and the tail, as well
as large variability across different data centers.<br /> …<br /> At the
granularity of a day, the peak daily [ingress] rate is ∼16x higher than
the mean daily rate. As the aggregation time increases beyond 30 days,
the peak over mean ratio decreases significantly down to only ∼2,
indicating that the average write rate is similar across different
30-day windows.<br /> …<br /> To summarize, as expected for archival
storage, the workload is <i>heavily write-dominated</i>. However,
unexpectedly, the IO operations are dominated by <i>small file
accesses</i>.

Subramanian Muralidhar and a team from Facebook, USC and Princeton had a
paper at the 2014 OSDI that described Facebook’s warm layer above the
two cold storage layers and below

Facebook’s Warm BLOB Storage System</i></a> provides workload data for
this layer, which filters out most of the IOPS before they hit the
archival layers. I explained in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/facebooks-warm-storage.html"><i>Facebook’s
Warm Storage</i></a> that:<br />
<blockquote>
A BLOB is a Binary Large OBject. Each type of BLOB contains a single
type of immutable binary content, such as photos, videos, documents,
etc.<br /> …<br /> Figure 3 shows that the rate of I/O requests to BLOBs
drops rapidly through time. The rates for different types of BLOB drop
differently, but all 9 types have dropped by 2 orders of magnitude
within 8 months, and all but 1 (profile photos) have dropped by an order
of magnitude within the first week.<br /> <br /> The vast majority of
Facebook’s BLOBs are warm, as shown in Figure 5 - notice the scale goes
from 80-100%. Thus the vast majority of the BLOBs generate I/O rates at
least 2 orders of magnitude less than recently generated BLOBs.

Note these important differences between Microsoft’s and Facebook’s
storage hierarchies:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft stores generic data and depends upon user action to migrate it
down the hierarchy to the archive layer, whereas Facebook stores 9
specific types of application data which is migrated automatically based
upon detailed knowledge of the workload for each of the types.
</li>
<li>
Because Facebook can migrate data automatically, it can interpose a warm
layer above the archive layer of the hierarchy, and because it has
detailed knowledge about the behavior of each of the data types it can
make good decision about when to move each type down the hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
Because the warm layer responds to the vast majority of the read
requests and schedules the downward migrations, Facebook’s archive
layer’s IOPS are a steady flow of large writes with very few reads,
making efficient use of the hardware.

Contrast Facebook’s scheduled ingest flow with the bursty ingest rate
shown in Figure 2 of the Silica paper,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">which finds
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
At the granularity of a day, the peak daily rate is ∼16x higher than the
mean daily rate.
</blockquote>
Another interesting aspect of the Silica design is that the
technologies, and thus the hardware, used for writing and reading are
completely different. The authors point out the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">implications for the
design</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As different technologies are used to read and write, after a platter is
written it must be fully read using the same technology that will be
used to read it subsequently. This happens before a platter is stored in
the library and any staged write data is deleted.<br /> <br /> This
design has an interesting consequence: during the period when user data
is being written into the library, the workload is going to become
<i>read</i>-dominated. Every byte written must be read to be verified,
in addition to the user reads. The read bandwidth has to be provisioned
for peak user read rate, however the read workloads are very bursty, so
read drive utilization is extremely low on average. Thus, the
verification workload simply utilizes what would otherwise be idle read
drives.
</blockquote>
Using separate write and read drives has
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">two
advantages</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This allows independent scaling of read and write throughput.
Additionally, this design allows us to create the first storage system
that offers true <i>air-gap-by-design</i>: the robotics are unable to
insert a glass platter into a write drive once the glass media has been
written.
</blockquote>
Since the majority of reads are for verification, the design needs to
make specific provision for
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">user reads</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To enable high drive efficiency, two platters can be mounted
simultaneously in a read drive: one undergoing verification, and one
servicing a customer read. Customer traffic is prioritized over
verification, with the read drive switching away when a platter is
mounted for a customer read. As soon as the customer platter stops being
accessed, the read drive has the ability to quickly switch to the other
platter and continue verification. This is similar to avoiding
head-of-line blocking of mice flows by elephant flows in networked
systems.
</blockquote>
Like Facebook’s, the prototype Silica systems are
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">data-center
size</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A <i>Silica library</i> is a sequence of contiguous write, read, and
storage racks interconnected by a platter delivery system. Along all
racks there are parallel horizontal rails that span the entire library.
We refer to a side of the library (spanning all racks) as a
<i>panel</i>. A set of <i>free roaming</i> robots called <i>shuttles</i>
are used to move platters between locations.<br /> …<br /> A read rack
contains multiple read drives. Each read drive is independent and has
slots into which platters are inserted and removed. The number of
shuttles active on a panel is limited to twice the number of read drives
in the panel. The write drive is full-rack-sized and writes multiple
platters concurrently.
</blockquote>
Their performance evaluation focuses on the ability to respond to read
requests within 15 hours. Their cost evaluation, like Facebook’s,
focuses on the savings from using warehouse-type space to house the
equipment, although is isn’t clear that they have actually done so. The
rest of their cost evaluation is somewhat hand-wavy, as is natural for a
system that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">isn’t yet
in production</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Silica read drives use polarization microscopy, which is a
commoditized technique widely used in many applications and is low-cost.
Currently, system cost in Silica is dominated by the write drives, as
they use femtosecond lasers which are currently expensive and used in
niche applications. This highlights the importance of resource
proportionality in the system, as write drive utilization needs to be
maximized in order to minimize costs. As the Silica technology
proliferates, it will drive up the demand for femtosecond lasers,
commoditizing the technology.
</blockquote>
I’m skeptical of this last point. Archival systems are a niche in the IT
market, and one on which companies are loath to spend money, The only
customers for systems like Silica are the large cloud providers, who
will be reluctant to commit their archives to technology owned by a
competitor. Unless a mass-market application for femtosecond lasers
emerges, the scope for cost reduction is limited.<br />

<p>Six years on flash has finally impacted the bulk storage market, but
it isn’t predicted to ship as many bits as hard disks for another four
years, when it will be a 40-year-old technology. Actual demonstrations
of DNA storage are only 12 years old, and similar demonstrations of
silica media are 15 years old. History suggests it will be decades
before these technologies impact the storage market.<br /> <br /></p>

Consumer Reports has
<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/home-security-cameras/video-doorbells-sold-by-major-retailers-have-security-flaws-a2579288796/">analyzed</a>
a bunch of popular Internet-connected video doorbells. Their security is
terrible.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
First, these doorbells expose your home IP address and WiFi network name
to the internet without encryption, potentially opening your home
network to online criminals.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
Anyone who can physically access one of the doorbells can take over the
device—no tools or fancy hacking skills needed.

<h2 id="llm-prompt-injection-worm">LLM Prompt Injection Worm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, updated: 2024-03-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Researchers have
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/compromptmized">demonstrated</a>
a worm that spreads through prompt injection.
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/here-come-the-ai-worms/">Details</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email
including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of
an email assistant using
<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG)</a>, a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside
its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a
user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it
“jailbreaks the GenAI service” and ultimately steals data from the
emails, Nassi says. “The generated response containing the sensitive
user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email
sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,”
Nassi says…
