<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>What if I told you there is an immensely popular operating system
that you likely used it at least once, but did not realise what it was?
In fact, it is so popular and important there is an IEEE standard based
on it. It is uncanny how immensely popular AND immensely obscure this
system is. It is scary that until today I have never even heard of its
reference desktop implementation. The system is called “TRON”. ↫ Nina

<h2 id="beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos">Beyond the 1 MB barrier in
DOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last month, we covered Julio Merino’s article about going from 0 to 1
MB in DOS, and now they’re back for breaking beyond that 1 MB barrier. I
know I promised that this follow-up article would be about DJGPP, but
before getting into that review, I realized I had to take another detour
to cover three more topics. Namely: unreal mode, which I intentionally
ignored to not derail the post; LOADALL, which I didn’t know about until
you readers mentioned it; and DOS extenders, which I was planning to
describe in the DJGPP article but they are a better fit for this one.
So… strap your seat belts on and dive right in for another tour through
the ancient techniques that DOS had to pull off to peek into the memory
address space above the first MB. And get your hands ready because we’ll
go over assembly code for a step-by-step jump into unreal mode. ↫ Julio
Merino What’s amazing is that I don’t even remember having to deal with
any of this while using MS-DOS back in the day. Games tended to use DOS
extenders automatically (DOS/4G!), but I don’t remember if I ever had to
set up any of the DOS above-640k stuff manually.</p>

<h2 id="my-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-dream">My “Everything,
Everywhere, All at Once” Dream</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
A few months ago I had this funny dream, which has come back into my
mind a few times since and I figure I might as well share. Basically I
was back at high school, but Penny Wong was our dictatorial principal,
and I was in her office getting castigated for something stupid
(probably shooting my mouth off in class; that would’ve been very
in-character for me at that time). Anyway, she assigned me to some
cleaning detail in punishment for what I’d done, which is where I think
you can see the influence of
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/my-novel.html">my novel</a>
coming in because that’s a pretty standard punishment in the world of
that
story.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
So, there I was, miserably scrubbing windows and removing cobwebs and
whatnot, when I looked into one of the buildings and saw
<em>another</em> detention going on, an in-classroom detention, and who
should I see in detention but VIVIAN, my now-partner, mucking around
with some mates. But it wasn’t Vivian as I know him now, it was Vivian
as I’ve seen him in photos of his high school days, packing a bit too
much weight and sporting a crazy afro. So I decided to sneak away from
<em>my</em> detention, and went up to him in class, where he turned to
me with a blank, confused look in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know me in this universe, do you?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he said. “Uh, I mean, that’s correct, I don’t know you.” (This is
<em>exactly</em> how he answers negative tag questions in real life;
it’s so annoying.)
</p>
<p>
“Well,” I said, “in another universe, you know me <em>very</em> well.”
</p>
<p>
And I walked away again, leaving it at that. As I did, he kind of went
back to mucking around with his mates, but it was with half an eye on me
as I went, wondering what could’ve been.
</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>
Actually, I had one detention in year 12 where I was supposed to do
this, as well. I say “supposed to” because I was so annoyed I even HAD
detention (basically I’d been like ten seconds late to school, and then
five minutes later there was a fire drill and everyone had to congregate
outside, so if I’d come FIVE MINUTES LATE instead of TEN SECONDS no one
would’ve known I was late and I wouldn’t have been given a detention. I
remember venting my frustration to my classmates that I was being
PUNISHED for TRYING to be on time, which they found hilarious.) that I
just flat-out refused to do it, and the teacher was so thrown (I was
mostly a good kid, just a smart ass) that she just went, “Okay then,”
and let me. So not quite the way my dream turned out,
then. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

<h2 id="apple-killed-music-on-the-move-for-me">2024-02-07 Apple killed
music on the move, for me</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me
</h1>
<p>
I was thinking about joining the
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara">Tangara</a>
crowdfunding. It’s a kind of iPod, but better in that it is all open.
Yay!
</p>
<p>
But then I realized something: Having an iPhone made listening to music
such a shit show that I basically stopped and switched my entire
phone-based audio entertainment to podcasts. Because podcast clients are
great (at least <a href="https://icatcher.app/about/">iCatcher</a> is)
where as Apple Music is a pain. Having used iTunes when it was cool
until it was unusable, and then realizing what a pain the weird AAC
formats on the files were, and the DRM on some of them, preventing me
from playing them on other machines I owned. I was so angry.
</p>
<p>
In a fit of hate I decided I was going to
<a href="2019-07-08_Apple_Photos">move all my pictures out of
iPhotos</a> and all my music out of iTunes and never go back. And I did.
And so the Apple Music app died, and I guess no alternatives were
allowed on the App Store because Apple is great like that, and so when
the iPod classic I had with
<a href="2017-12-21_Rockbox_on_the_iPod">Rockbox</a> installed
<a href="2022-11-18_iPod%2C_iPad%2C_iPhone%2C_iPiss">finally died</a>,
all I was left with was podcasts on the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
And so now I don’t even know whether I want to listen to music any more
while I’m on the move.
</p>
<p>
Apple killed music on the move, for me.
</p>
<p>
At home it’s a different story, of course, but Tangara is a portable
music player.
</p>
<p>
I wish Tangara the best of luck.

enumerated them <a href="https://textcasting.org/">here</a>. I am making
software that builds on this feature in social networks. And yes we do
have some examples of that, thinking of WordPress and competitors. I
think they are perfectly good bases for social networks.</p>

<p>I went skiing today at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Mountain">Belleayre</a>.
First time in five years. It was great. I’ve been working out to get
ready for it, and was concerned maybe I’m finally too old, but it’s
good. My body remembers how to ski. And being in shape makes the
difference. No doubt at some point I will be too old for it. But not
yet. And the snow was really good, for the east. Packed powder, very
little ice. No lift lines. Sometimes a little crowded on the slopes but
about the same as any ski area in the west. It pays to go on weekdays if
you can. Here’s a
<a href="https://www.belleayre.com/mountain/trail-map-and-mountain-stats/">trail

<h2 id="a-rant-on-arc-search">A rant on ARC Search</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I was listening to the most recent
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063221/ai-search-arc-galaxy-s24-spatial-video-vergecast">Vergecast</a>
episode last night and an interview with Josh Miller, CEO of The Browser
Company, makers of the ARC Browser and the new ARC Search app. I found
the whole interview baffling.
</p>
<p>
Josh is rightfully complaining about the state of the web, specifically
the mobile web, but the solution he’s proposing is so stupidly naive
that I’m not entirely sure whether he’s just fucking with us.
</p>
<p>
His whole point is that search engines are not the best way to surface
information. You search for something, you’re presented with a list of
links, and you have to click through them and actively look for the
thing you were searching for. The proposed solution is AI—who would have
thought—that essentially googles for you, “reads” a bunch of the links,
and then creates a summary page.
</p>
<p>
All this is obviously done by stripping away all the tracking and ads
that are part of today’s web.
</p>
<p>
You’re smart and so you probably spotted the issue with this approach
already. Firstly, without a search engine in the mix, the AI has no way
to search for anything. So if the goal is to replace the traditional
search engine then we’re already failing. Because we’re not replacing
anything, we’re just hiding it behind some AI tool.
</p>
<p>
Maybe this is a problem that can be solved by maintaining a new
dedicated index but then you just have a search engine with a different
UI in front of it.
</p>
<p>
The second issue is one of trust. Should I just trust ARC Search? Who
can guarantee that the sources used by ARC are not just companies that
have paid ARC to be used as such? “But Manu, ARC Search doesn’t just
provide the answer to your query, it also provides links to the
sources.“ Well then congratulations, you just recreated an AI-nerfed
SERP with fewer links and more extra layers.
</p>
<p>
Now, let’s ignore all this and imagine this approach does work. Let’s
imagine we all get on board with this stupid idea of having an AI
searching for you. What happens to the web as a whole? Why should I keep
creating content for the web if I’m a content creator who relies on
traffic to run my creative business? No one will visit my site because
the relevant content will be consumed by some boring ass generated
pages. And without content on the web, products like ARC Search are
pointless.
</p>
<p>
What would happen, if something like this were to go mainstream, is that
more and more content would go behind a paywall, kept away from AI. And
for good reason.
</p>
<p>
I’m very unimpressed by this interview. I’m also very unimpressed by
most AI products these days.
</p>
<p>
The problem with search is not the UI. Having an AI search for me won’t
solve the issue of the sea of garbage content out there.
</p>
<p>
But hey, the product is here so let’s take it for a spin and see if it’s
any good. I just downloaded ARC Search on my phone and searched for
<em>“books on Japanese aesthetics”</em>.
</p>
<p>
This is what a “regular” search looks like inside ARC search and yes,
that’s a Google search, because it obviously is.
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">
<div class="m-m">
<img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-rant-on-arc-search/ee7cc1b9d8-1707328208/google.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 721">
</div>
</figure>
<p>
The first thing I see is a books section with 4 suggested books and 42
more 1 click away. If I’m looking for a book, that’s probably a good
enough starting point. Below that section, there are a bunch of sites,
related queries, the usual stuff.
</p>
<p>
Let’s do the same thing, using this revolutionary way to browse the web
powered by AI. Conveniently, ARC tells me the AI is reading 6 web pages.
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">
<div class="m-m">
<img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-rant-on-arc-search/6f75e932fd-1707328206/arc-1.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:616 / 1333">
</div>
</figure>
<p>
There are probably 700-billion-trillion pages out there but ARC has
picked 6. Why those 6? No idea. Have those 6 paid to be there? No idea.
Should I just trust that those 6 are reputable sources? Yup. A couple of
seconds later this is what I get:
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">
<div class="m-m">
<img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-rant-on-arc-search/f6ea8736f5-1707328207/arc-2.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 433">
</div>
</figure>
<p>
5 books recommended to me in a somewhat compact list. Then I have 3 Top
Search Results that are just the top 3 links in Google search. After
that I get a completely pointless repetition of the initial list but
this time with some more information and worse information density. At
the end, I get a bunch of more links.
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me in what way this is better than a normal search results
page? The problem with search is that it’s full of fucking spam and ads.
That’s the problem with search. The solution to search is not to
“reinvent the browser” or to use AI to power searches for you. The
solution to search is a search engine that is aligned with the users.
</p>
<p>
I’d much rather support <a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi</a> and
<a href="https://search.marginalia.nu">Marginalia</a> than The Browser
Company.

I have a podcast about Solarpunk for writers called Solarpunk Prompts.
It’s about halfway through season 2. The episode released today is
called <strong>The Tower</strong>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Displaced people are moved into a new sustainable climate-controlled
tower designed to help them find community. For some it’s a dream come
true, for others a culture shock. How will this setting come to life as
a vision for a Solarpunk future? How can we envision a better way of
living by focusing on their humanity?
</p>

class="ellipsis">podcast.tomasino.org/<span class="citation"
data-cites="Solarpun">@Solarpun</span></span><span
class="invisible">kPrompts/episodes/the-tower</span></a>
</p>
<p>
The podcast is based around the idea of providing a new writing prompt
each episode that explores some of the themes of the Solarpunk genre and
activist movement. We discuss some inspirations, considerations, and
various ways to tell the story.
</p>
<p>
While the subject matter is focused on writing, the audience is quite
diverse. Many non-writers enjoy it simply to learn more about Solarpunk
in general.
</p>
<p>
Have a listen! You can find it at the link above, or by searching in
your favorite podcast app. If you don’t know what Solarpunk is at all,
you might try listening to Episode 1 of Season 1 for an overview of the
genre and movement, and the reasons why this podcast came into being.
</p>
<p>
Most episodes are around 10 minutes long. The Tower is our longest at
just over 16 minutes.

id="heres-how-whatsapp-plans-to-interoperate-with-other-messaging-apps">Here’s
how WhatsApp plans to interoperate with other messaging apps</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>As noted by Wired, WhatsApp wants the messaging services it connects
with to use the same Signal Protocol to encrypt messages. Meta is also
open to apps using alternate encryption protocols so long as companies
can prove “they reach the security standards that WhatsApp outlines in
its guidance.” The third-party services will also have to sign a
contract with Meta before they plug into WhatsApp, with more details
about the agreement coming in March. ↫ Emma Roth at The Verge They way
this should work is that these megacorporations create free and open
APIs any instant messaging application can tap into. I’m not looking to
bring other services into WhatsApp; I’m looking to bring all services
together in one unified application that respects my platform’s
conventions and integrates properly with the operating systems I use. I
feel like this contractual interoperability Facebook (and Apple) is
offering is not interoperability at all, and does not reflect the spirit
of the Digital Markets Act.</p>

<p>
Am writing again after a few days’ break (my first “few days’ break”
since late December, so this is progress!). Still somewhat
sleep-deprived and I hit a point with this scene where I’m like, “Man,
where is this even going again?” Scrolled up to the scene synopsis and
came to the painful realisation that it’s not up to date because it
would be a duplicate of the scene, like, six scenes ago. So now I have
to work out where the scene is going… 😒

id="eu-right-to-repair-sellers-will-be-liable-for-a-year-after-products-are-fixed">EU
right to repair: sellers will be liable for a year after products are
fixed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Europe’s right-to-repair rules will force vendors to stand by their
products an extra 12 months after a repair is made, according to the
terms of a new political agreement. Consumers will have a choice between
repair and replacement of defective products during a liability period
that sellers will be required to offer. The liability period is slated
to be a minimum of two years before any extensions. The rules require
spare parts to be available at reasonable prices, and product makers
will be prohibited from using “contractual, hardware or software related
barriers to repair, such as impeding the use of second-hand, compatible
and 3D-printed spare parts by independent repairers,” the Commission
said. ↫ Jon Brodkin at Ars Technica An excellent set of rules, and once
again puts the EU at the forefront of consumer protection. Maybe some of
it will trickle down to other places in the world.</p>

<h2 id="browsers-are-weird-right-now">Browsers are weird right now</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>I love this quick to-the-point summary of most of the popular
browsers out there right now. I’m a Firefox user, of course, since it’s
the best choice between Chrome (I’d rather choose death), Safari (not
cross-platform so utterly pointless), the various Chrome skins, and
Firefox (the one independent browser). Still, I’m continuously worried
about Firefox’ future – specifically on platforms other than Windows or
macOS – and strongly believe we need more true alternatives for a
healthier browser ecosystem.</p>

It was more of a speed hike. 😅

Two years of working on Luro full time has taught me a lot about
#startuplife. While I could probably fill a book with what I’ve learned
so far, the biggest takeaway is you’re always busy if you’re on a small
team. Here’s a list of jobs that you always need to be doing when
creating a company…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Planning new features
</li>
<li>
Building new features
</li>
<li>
Marketing new features
</li>
<li>
Updating old features
</li>
<li>
Managing technical debt
</li>
<li>
Establishing processes
</li>
<li>
Documenting everything
</li>
<li>
Hopping on calls
</li>
<li>
Getting feedback
</li>
<li>
Contacting existing customers
</li>
<li>
Acquiring new customers
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Casting vision
</li>
<li>
Investor updates
</li>
<li>
Emailing lawyers
</li>
<li>
Accounting and taxes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Not enough that we should overly glamorize entrepreneurs, but it’s a
lot. Especially, when you’re also tasked with building the darn thing.
My list doesn’t even get into the all the nuance of all the required
systems and processes you need to build either. That’s a whole other

Power over Ethernet lets you run both power and networking to certain
devices through one Ethernet cable. It’s extremely convenient,
especially if you have a managed PoE switch, because you get the
following benefits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A single cable for power + Ethernet (no need for separate power
adapters)
</li>
<li>
No need to have electrical service near every device
</li>
<li>
Simple remote power on/off capability (assuming you have a managed
switch)
</li>
<li>
Centralized power management (e.g. one UPS in a rack room covering all
powered devices)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have used the Raspberry Pi PoE and PoE+ HATs for years now, allowing
me to have 4 or 5 Raspberry Pi per 1U of rack space, with all wiring on
the front side. I also use PoE for cameras around my house, though there
are dozens of use cases where PoE makes sense.
</p>
<p>
The Raspberry Pi, since it only requires 3-10W of power, is an ideal
candidate for PoE, assuming you can find a HAT for it.

<p>I’m doing some writing about writing and finding the phrase “RSS,
Atom and RFD” too cumbersome. Most people don’t care and see the
distinctions as unnecessary. But I want to be accurate, and recognize
that while RSS is the most-used kind of feed, there are others, and our
software works with them. I’m trying this construction:
“RSS-compatible.” I think that expresses the most important point, the
choice of format is up to you, but now, by 2024, they all work pretty
much the same way.</p>

</iframe>
<p>
<a href="https://www.coraquest.com/">CoraQuest</a> is a “family
cooperative dungeon crawler” created by adorable dad-daughter duo Dan
and Cora Hughes from Huddersfield, UK. Feeling the boredom of pandemic
lockdown, Dan and Cora (8yo) decided to design a board game and
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest/description">put
it on Kickstarter</a>. I’ve wanted an easy “Dungeons and Dragons for
Kids” game for a long time and this hits all the marks. It’s
imaginative, tactile, visual, and it has
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLi8IWmLKU">a simple
ruleset</a> that kids can easily grok. I backed it the minute I saw it.
</p>
<p>
CoraQuest comes with ~9 or so premade adventures so parents can run a
one-shot without much preparation. The dungeon is a stack of 9x9 tiles
with special story cards mixed in that map to story beats in the premade
adventure. I embellish a bit and give the bad guys names like “Gerald”
and “Geoffrey”. Add some funny voices and it’s a guaranteed good time
for kids. My son and his friends played for two hours the other day and
the kids didn’t even think about devices. That is worth the price of
admission alone.
</p>
<p>
There’s other aspects that make this game great like how you can upload
drawings to <a href="https://www.coraquest.com/cc/creator.html">design
your own heroes and enemies</a>, there’s
<a href="https://www.coraquest.com/hoodez-hidden-door/">narrated
quests</a> to offload that responsibility, but to me the best part is my
kids love it and ask for it. The infectious laughter of Dan and Cora has
infected our house and young Cora is a role model that I often point to
and tell my kids they can make a cool game everyone loves if you set
your mind to it. I love the game so much I’ve
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest-keep-on-questing-expansion/description">bought
the expansion</a> as well as a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CK9WNG57">short story book</a> that
takes place in the CoraQuest fantasy universe.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking for a game to play with your kids and their friends, I
highly recommend CoraQuest.

<h2
id="isr-roundtable-2023-the-future-of-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record-together">ISR
Roundtable 2023: The future of preserving the integrity of the scholarly
record together</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Metadata about research objects and the relationships between them form
the basis of the scholarly record: rich metadata has the potential to
provide a richer context for scholarly output, and in particular, can
provide trust signals to indicate integrity. Information on who authored
a research work, who funded it, which other research works it cites, and
whether it was updated, can act as signals of trustworthiness. Crossref
provides foundational infrastructure to connect and preserve these
records, but the creation of these records is an ongoing and complex
community effort. Crossref has always shown a deep commitment to
preserving the integrity of the scholarly record in an open and scalable
manner.
</p>
<p>
Given the increasing concerns in the community about matters of research
integrity and integrity of the scholarly record (ISR), we at Crossref
have been engaging with community members to understand what
developments are needed. In 2022, we organised
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-four-working-together-as-a-community-to-preserve-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">a
roundtable discussion to talk about our role</a> and the applicability
of Crossref’s services in preserving and assessing the integrity of the
scholarly record. We’ve acted on much of that feedback since, and so in
October 2023, we organised a follow-up event, once more gathering
representatives of publishers, research integrity experts,
policy-makers, academic institutions, funders, and researchers (the full
list of participants can be found in the appendix). This post aims to
offer insight into the discussions at this event and the next steps. The
objective of this event was to take the conversation forward by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sharing the progress made by Crossref on matters related to ISR since
the last roundtable event.
</li>
<li>
Sharing information about how metadata contributes to the Research
Nexus, and can act as trust markers for research outputs.
</li>
<li>
Apprising the community about the latest membership trends and examples
of activities that we see, such as title transfer disputes, unregistered
DOIs, requests for deleting records, and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192" target="_blank">sneaked
references</a> .
</li>
<li>
Building upon the ideas discussed during the 2022 roundtable event to
progress the conversation about issues related to ISR.
</li>
<li>
Learning from the participants about their experiences of pursuing
research integrity initiatives.
</li>
<li>
Last but no less importantly, hearing from the participants their
perspectives on strategies for preserving the integrity of the scholarly
record, and opportunities for collaborating to leverage metadata to
assess the integrity of the scholarly record.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The event was kicked off by Ed Pentz, who spoke to the participants
about how integrity is key to Crossref’s mission, and Crossref’s vision
of the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/" target="_blank">Research
Nexus</a>. Next, Amanda Bartell, the Head of Member Experience at
Crossref, shared the recent developments and trends in community
behaviour. She expanded upon the actions taken by Crossref as part of
its ISR program since the last roundtable event, which include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/news-crossref-and-retraction-watch/" target="_blank">Acquisition
and opening of the Retraction Watch database</a>, which makes it easier
to access information on retractions and corrections.
</li>
<li>
Increased participation in the Global Equitable Membership (GEM)
program, enabling a wider section of the community to provide and access
trust signals.
</li>
<li>
Newer developments around metadata that act as trust signals: e.g. 120K
grants or awards now have a Crossref DOI, and the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/" target="_blank">planned
transition of the Open Funder Registry into ROR</a>.
</li>
<li>
Recruitment of a Community Manager to focus on working with publishers
and editors, including on ISR
(<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/perspectives-madhura-amdekar-meeting-community-pursuing-research-integrity/" target="_blank">that’s
me!</a>), and recruitment of
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/perspectives-luis-montilla-sci-fi-concepts-reality-scholarly-ecosystem/" target="_blank">a
Technical Community Manager</a> to enable greater use of our APIs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Amanda highlighted that all Crossref members should be using ROR IDs to
provide affiliations for authors (along with ORCID iDs) in their
Crossref metadata. She also shared some latest examples of community
behaviours that we have seen, such as requests from authors to delete
records of works that were published without their permission, title
ownership disputes between publishers, and the recent instance of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192" target="_blank">sneaked
references</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ivan Oransky, co-founder of Retraction Watch, and Lena Stoll, Product
Manager at Crossref, were next, and they spoke about the future of the
Retraction Watch database, and about the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/" target="_blank">Crossmark
service</a>. After this, some of the other roundtable participants
shared initiatives that they have undertaken that support ISR:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Jodi Schneider from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign spoke
about
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/crec" target="_blank">NISO’s
CREC Working Group</a> that has created a Recommended Practice that
should be followed by relevant stakeholders for communicating retracted
research (Crossref’s Director of Product Rachael Lammey was the co-chair
of that group).
</li>
<li>
Kihong Kim from the Korean Council of Science Editors shared information
about the workshops that the Council has organised for researchers on
publishing in journals.
</li>
<li>
Alberto Martín-Martín from Universidad de Granada presented his thoughts
on how to reconcile the publishing system and the institutional view of
tracking research outputs.
</li>
<li>
Bianca Kramer from Sesame Science spoke about her analysis of and the
implications of sneaked references, duplicate references, and missing
references for citation integrity.
</li>
<li>
Joris van Rossum from STM Solutions spoke about the STM Integrity Hub
and the integrity tools that are being developed in collaboration with
some publishers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of the most valuable reflections stemmed from discussions in small
groups on these three key questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What value do you see in the integrity and completeness of the scholarly
record in the way you operate? How do you contribute to it? How can it
support you to achieve your own goals?
</li>
<li>
Are you aware of Crossref services? What are the barriers to more
uptake? What are the challenges and opportunities?
</li>
<li>
What information is essential and nice to have for you in the scholarly
records to support trust signalling and ascertaining trustworthiness?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As groups shared their discussions, a few themes became apparent that I
would like to elaborate on further.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-complete">
What is “complete”?
</h2>
<p>
Given the prompt to talk about the value of completeness of the
scholarly record, an immediate reaction at most tables was: how much
metadata qualifies as “complete” metadata? Can the scholarly record be
considered complete if some publishers or journals do not use Crossref?
What is the optimum level of metadata that should be deposited by
members - should a minimum data standard be defined by disciplines, or
should there be standard data requirements for all? The composition of
metadata appears to change over time, too, as the processes change and
our ability to record their facets increases. While there were spirited
discussions about what constitutes a complete scholarly record, everyone
agreed that “completeness” of metadata, as much as is possible, should
be the aim. Unambiguous and consistent standards may help with this, for
example, the Metadata 20/20 community creation of
<a href="https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-principles/" target="_blank">principles</a>
and
<a href="https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-practices/" target="_blank">best
practices</a>, and potentially also using
<a href="https://www.niso.org/press-releases/2021/01/nisos-recommended-practice-reproducibility-badging-and-definitions-now" target="_blank">a
set of recognition standards and reproducibility badges</a>.
</p>
<p>
Global participation is equally important for a truly “complete”
scholarly record. In order to enable as many in the scholarly community
as possible to participate in Crossref services and metadata, Crossref
launched the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/" target="_blank">Global Equitable
Membership (GEM)</a> program in 2023. Under this initiative, membership
and content registration fees are waived off for members from the least
economically advantaged countries. We are seeing first signs that
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-gem-program-year-one/" target="_blank">this
initiative meaningfully lowers the barriers to participation</a> for
organisations based in those countries, and allows the global community
to contribute towards the building of a comprehensive research
ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, it is important to recognize that rich metadata
is crucial because it can be used for all kinds of analysis, which in
turn can drive decision-making. Even if some of the metadata components
are sporadically missing, that could be acceptable, because every piece
of data counts!
</p>
<h2 id="corrections-and-retractions">
Corrections and Retractions
</h2>
<p>
Similar to last year, retractions and corrections continued to be a
topic of great interest in this year’s roundtable. This was not
surprising given their relevance as trust indicators as well as the
recent development with the acquisition of the Retraction Watch database
by Crossref. Having heard from Ivan about the Retraction Watch
<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retraction-watch-database-user-guide/retraction-watch-database-user-guide-appendix-b-reasons/" target="_blank">taxonomy
of reasons for retractions</a> and the metadata included in the
database, participants expressed the need to investigate this taxonomy
as a community standard. While the Retraction Watch taxonomy is not
widely known, we at Crossref are working to map the Crossmark taxonomy
with the Retraction Watch taxonomy, which will enable complete
integration of the Retraction Watch database with the Crossref database.
</p>
<p>
It would also be useful to add more information to retraction notices.
Having more information about the reasons for retraction will not only
destigmatize retractions, but certain additional information, such as
submission dates for those outputs, might help with ethical
investigations to determine whether manuscripts were being submitted to
multiple publishers simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
On the topic of retractions, another aspect that came up in the room was
about incentives for researchers to publish as much and as quickly as
possible. If researchers indulge in unethical publishing practices due
to this pressure to publish, that is hugely detrimental to the cause of
research integrity and to the progress of scientific research in
general. However, there is a distinction to be made between the
integrity of the research and the integrity of the scholarly record -
unethical research and publishing practices, including but not limited
to data falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism, affect research
integrity while integrity of the scholarly record is affected by
unavailability of metadata, outdated metadata, incomplete metadata
records, and incorrect metadata (e.g. as seen in the case of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192" target="_blank">sneaked
references</a>).
</p>
<p>
There was a lot of discussion about
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/" target="_blank">Crossmark</a>,
a cross-platform service provided by Crossref that allows readers to
discover whether an item has been updated, corrected, or retracted just
by clicking a button that is standardised across publication platforms.
While most participants acknowledged its importance, they also pointed
out that its uptake has been limited and publishers do not use it as
much, perhaps because it is difficult to implement and there’s a matter
of providing more clarity about it to the readers. There were
suggestions to add a notification system to Crossmark such that every
time a published output is retracted, a notification goes out. This
seemed of particular interest to funders, whose grievance was that they
are usually the last to find out when research that they have funded is
retracted. They would welcome notifications that would alert them to
such events.
</p>
<p>
We already have plans to consult with the community more specifically
about what changes they’d like to see to Crossmark that will enable them
to implement it easily and use it more frequently. Take a look
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/communicating-post-publication-updates-inviting-feedback-on-the-next-steps-for-crossmark/4744" target="_blank">at
this thread on our community forum and add your thoughts for our next
steps on Crossmark</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-education">
The importance of education
</h2>
<p>
There was an overwhelming sentiment that there was a need for collective
arbitration of research integrity issues. However, everyone recognized
that this is not a role for Crossref. We can act as a “trust broker” by
bridging different metadata and identifiers that otherwise might not
interact, creating a network of research outputs whose credibility can
be verified by others. Many participants called for Crossref to increase
its efforts in educating community members about the importance of
metadata and how different pieces can be linked together to make
meaningful connections.
</p>
<p>
Research practices vary between countries, and between institutions.
Correspondingly, the metadata being provided by diverse Crossref members
may also vary. There is an opportunity here for the global research
community to work together to increase awareness about ethical
standards, so that a lack of specific metadata or its variances
(e.g. unusually formatted metadata, or non-standard metadata fields) may
not be construed as “lower quality” metadata. Many felt that the
greatest need for education about metadata is for the academic community
– although individual researchers contribute a wealth of metadata
associated with any published research output, they do not necessarily
understand how metadata contributes to the completeness of the scholarly
record. There is a further opportunity to talk to the academic community
about how different metadata components link together to form a rich
network, supporting visibility and confidence in their work. A greater
awareness about these topics is likely to encourage researchers to
provide more metadata and identifiers.
</p>
<p>
While most participants at the roundtable event agreed about the need
for this conversation and the educational opportunities here, if
Crossref were to lead these efforts, it would represent, in some eyes, a
diversion from its mission. We do have several initiatives already to
support our communities. As part of the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/ambassadors/" target="_blank">Crossref
Ambassadors program</a>, volunteers from the international scholarly
community who believe in Crossref’s mission liaise with our team to
conduct training in their communities about using Crossref services and,
generally, about the importance of metadata. In 2023, we also launched a
new online public forum,
<a href="https://theplace.discourse.group/" target="_blank">the
PLACE</a>, in collaboration with the Committee on Publication Ethics
(COPE), the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and the Open
Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA). This forum is a place
where new publishers can connect with these organisations and learn
about best practices in scholarly publishing via discussion posts and by
asking questions, as they get started. Another initiative that is
designed to help new Crossref members is the “Managed Member Journey”:
as members join and move through the various stages of membership, key
information is shared with them during each of these stages in the form
of triggered automated emails, web pages, and webinars.
</p>
<p>
While Crossref’s direct interactions with researchers are limited, we
welcome the community’s recognition of the need to raise awareness about
these matters. We have started engaging more closely with the reporters
of metadata issues, in many cases investigators and ‘sleuths’ in the
area of research integrity, and plan some closer collaborations with
this group in 2024. We are open to supporting community efforts to
inform other stakeholders about the importance and uses of metadata.
</p>
<h2 id="incentives-for-the-community">
Incentives for the community
</h2>
<p>
Another theme that was heard repeatedly was “incentives”: incentives for
researchers to contribute to a “complete” scholarly record, incentives
for publishers to improve metadata, and incentives for everyone to
report on and register retractions.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned before, a shared sentiment is that researchers may not be
aware of the value of rich metadata. While more publications, increased
citations, and greater grant funding are some examples of incentives
that are part of the current academic settings, the right incentives
probably do not exist for researchers to provide complete metadata. With
the diverse set of participants present at this meeting, some groups
also discussed how the current research assessment system can change to
incorporate other metrics, perhaps those based on open science and open
data.
</p>
<p>
What could be the incentives for publishers to improve the metadata
collected and deposited by them? One suggestion was that clearly defined
benefits of rich metadata can incentivise publishers. Being aware of
what funders are mandating, can be another incentive. On the same note,
funders will benefit from knowing what metadata is being provided by
publishers. This metadata is available through our open API, and nine
key checks on members’ activity are available through our public
<a href="https://crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Participation
Reports</a>.
</p>
<p>
Retractions featured again in the discussion on the topic of incentives.
As shared by Ivan, retractions are on the rise every year, with about
43k retractions currently in the Retraction Watch database. On the other
hand, retractions registered in Crossmark at the time of the meeting
numbered just 14k and have recently jumped up to 25k thanks to
Hindawi/Wiley’s dedication to good open metadata. Besides the fact that
the uptake of Crossmark by Crossref members is limited, another reason
for the low number of retractions being registered is the associated
stigma. Corrections and errata are usually conflated with retractions,
and all these terms, which represent different kinds of updates that may
happen to a published item, have a stigma associated with them in the
academic community. There is a need to destigmatize retractions, and
perhaps incentivize them by noting that these updates are essential to
uphold the integrity of the scholarly record and to highlight the
publishers that are showing leadership in addressing the issues openly
through up-to-date Crossref metadata.
</p>
<h2 id="what-metadata-is-nice-to-have-in-the-scholarly-record">
What metadata is nice to have in the scholarly record?
</h2>
<p>
We asked everyone what information they think is essential as well as
“nice to have” in the scholarly record to support trust signalling, and
we heard a range of answers. Peer review information was recognized to
be important. This would include data on who the peer reviewers were and
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/peer-review-terminology" target="_blank">standard
peer review terminology that has been published by NISO</a>. More
generally, as much metadata as possible about the main actors of the
peer review process was considered important - such as designating who
the corresponding author is, and who the handling editor or the
decision-making editor was.
</p>
<p>
As special issues led by guest editors in journals have been brought to
the attention of late due to the uncovering of irregularities in some of
them, one of the first suggestions in this context was more metadata
about special issues. Participants thought that it would be useful to
collect and distribute information on handling/guest editors of special
issues, peer reviewers, as well as submission and acceptance dates.
Recently, COPE has released guidance on
<a href="https://publicationethics.org/node/56239" target="_blank">“best
practices for guest-edited collections”</a> , highlighting that this
topic looms at the forefront for the scholarly information industry.
</p>
<p>
Adding information on ethical approvals provided by institutional review
boards would add more nuance to the research outputs. Metadata about
clinical trials helps to add transparency to research in a field, where
reproducibility is of primary importance. Conflicts of interest are
another factor that could be a cause of concern if not reported
accurately; these declarations were mentioned by the participants as
important for signalling trust.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing that it is the relationships in the metadata that add
context to research output, participants echoed that better interlinking
between preprints and their published versions is required. To aid with
all of this, it has been suggested that a complete list of all metadata
that can be deposited with Crossref be made available in a simple
format, so that members have more visibility about all the possibilities
that exist for providing metadata.
</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">
Next steps
</h2>
<p>
We asked all participants if the discussions prompted them to plan to
take any actions in the near future. Several attendees reflected that
the discussion encouraged them to go back and review the metadata that
they are depositing with Crossref, and how they can make more use of the
data openly available from Crossref. We also heard how some found
training opportunities therein - discussion points from the event could
be included in workshops for affiliated researchers, and in COPE
guidance for members. As encouraged by members of the
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/crec" target="_blank">NISO’s
CREC Working Group</a>, some participants were looking to respond in the
(then open) consultations of the
<a href="https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/29165/RP-45-202X_NISO_Communication_of_Retractions_Removals_and_Expressions_of_Concern_CREC_draft_for_public_comment.pdf" target="_blank">draft
Recommended Practice, NISO RP-45-202X, Communication of Retractions,
Removals, and Expressions of Concern (CREC)</a>. One message resonated
loud and clear: preserving the integrity of the scholarly record cannot
be a lone endeavour and has to be a community effort. Attendees
expressed their commitment to continue these conversations, with the
next most opportune time being at the
<a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/events/stm-week-2023/" target="_blank">STM
week</a>. Everyone recognised that collaboration in this space is the
need of the hour: facilitating information and data sharing across all
the players in the ecosystem would be crucial to progressing this topic.
As Bianca Kramer declared during her presentation, “I am committed to
using only open data in my research, as access to data is important for
the community to detect problems at scale”.
</p>
<p>
At our end, we are looking to act on suggestions that are specific to
Crossref:
</p>
<h3 id="consultation-with-the-community-about-crossmark">
Consultation with the community about Crossmark
</h3>
<p>
One of the first things that we are doing in early 2024 is to consult
with our community about the developments needed in the Crossmark
service. Our key aim with this exercise would be to understand how we
can enable a more effective uptake of this service so that Crossref
members can easily fulfil their obligation of keeping their records
updated. We are keen to understand what we can do to help our members to
send us metadata about updates to an output, and how we can help
downstream services that use this data. Insights from this consultation
will also help inform how the Retraction Watch data can be most
effectively integrated into Crossmark and communicated to users. Please
visit the discussion and add your thoughts here:
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/communicating-post-publication-updates-inviting-feedback-on-the-next-steps-for-crossmark/" target="_blank">https://community.crossref.org/t/communicating-post-publication-updates-inviting-feedback-on-the-next-steps-for-crossmark/</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="development-of-resources-for-using-our-api">
Development of resources for using our API
</h3>
<p>
As there is clearly no dearth of metadata components that the community
thinks would be “nice to have” for signalling trust, it is equally
important to equip users and downstream service providers to be able to
access the rich metadata that is available with Crossref. This rich
metadata opens up new avenues for the development of services and
resources that can benefit the scholarly community. On account of this,
we plan to prioritise development of resources for using Crossref APIs.
These efforts would include making available workbooks with a variety of
API use cases - ranging from how to use basic API queries, to how to use
APIs for obtaining grant information or for obtaining citation data and
so on, as well as retrieving corrections, retractions, and update
information, especially when the Retraction Watch dataset merges in with
the rest of the Crossref metadata.
</p>
<h3 id="working-group-to-facilitate-community-efforts-for-preserving-isr">
Working group to facilitate community efforts for preserving ISR
</h3>
<p>
We are looking to set up a working group that will facilitate the
various stakeholders in the scholarly ecosystem to work together towards
preserving the integrity of the scholarly record. One direction for the
group could be to consider the role and impact of Crossref metadata in
ISR. Another area of focus will be to enrich information about
retractions, corrections, and expressions of concern. Raising
industry-wide awareness about the current concerns in upholding the
integrity of the scholarly record, and how comprehensive metadata can
act as markers of trust about research output, would be another focal
point.
</p>
<h3 id="continued-community-outreach">
Continued community outreach
</h3>
<p>
We will continue our efforts to engage with the community on the very
important issues surrounding ISR. We are particularly keen to redouble
our efforts to include more funders and institutions in these
conversations. Preserving the integrity of the scholarly record needs to
be a truly inclusive effort and will benefit from diverse voices in the
community. With that in mind, consulting with the community in Asia is
next on our radar.
</p>
<p>
We look forward to working with the community further on this important
topic - if you are keen to participate in these discussions and want to
contribute towards preserving the integrity of the scholarly record, we
would love to hear from you. Please write to us at
<a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org">feedback@crossref.org</a> if you
have any suggestions on this topic.

<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>Some 13.8 billion years ago, the universe began with a rapid
expansion we call the big bang. After this initial expansion, which
lasted a fraction of a second, gravity started to slow the universe
down. But the cosmos wouldn’t stay this way. Nine billion years after
the universe began, its expansion started to speed up, […]</p>

<h2 id="well-known-secrets-of-amigados">Well-known secrets of
AmigaDOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>In keeping with the Commodore tradition of cost cutting, most
consumer models of their Amiga line of computers came with severely
watered down documentation. The Amiga 500 was an exception from this
rule, but owners of later machines – such as the A1200 – may not have
gotten any documentation for the command line part of AmigaOS at all.
And, of course, even if this documentation had shipped with the
machines, it wouldn’t have revealed features that were hidden to anyone
without access to official developer documentation or even left
completely undocumented or unfinished. This is a quick look at a few of
these interesting features, some more obscure than others, but all of
them decidedly useful. Most of them only apply to versions 2.x and/or
3.x of the OS. With that said, let’s dive right in! ↫ Carl Svensson

sneaks ads into the new Outlook for Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The migration from the classic Mail and Calendar app to the new
Outlook app is in full swing already. Microsoft announced the
deprecation of the classic apps in favor of a new Outlook app in June
2023. It introduced the new Outlook app to Insider builds a month later
and announced that it would enforce the migration in early 2024. Not all
users are migrated at this point. Those who have been migrated already
or installed the Outlook app directly, may notice several differences
between the new Outlook app and the classic Mail app. One of the main
differences turns an ad-free email experience into one with ads. You may
see ads in the inbox in the new Outlook. ↫ Martin Brinkmann Ads
disguised as emails in your inbox. Microsoft will not rest until Windows
resembles Times Square. What a trash fire of an operating system.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
You and I are partaking in something magical.
</p>
<p>
The electric meat inside my cranium told my fingers to punch mechanical
keys to send signals through an electric rock and encode these thoughts
on a magnetic rock. Then through radio waves, beacons, and wires I
create a copy of this magnetically encoded text on another rock in
another town, in another state. That rock copies itself to another town
(possibly in another country) closer to you. Then through another relay
of wires and radio waves that text replicates itself on the electric
rock in your palm. Your rock renders those words with light through
stained glass. You read rendered words and glyphs and the electric meat
in your own head decodes the text.
</p>
<p>
Our thoughts, words, and images transfigured through time and space as
ones and zeroes. Circumnavigating the globe in milliseconds. An
immaculate relay. A holy exchange.
</p>
<p>
That is powerful. It is precious. We would do well to preserve its
sanctity.

networks of brain regions and how they interact with each other.

<p>You should assume that some day <i>all</i> these systems will

<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> will be around longer.

<p>If you’re creating something new, definitely create it on
feedland.com. If you’re already using feedland.org, for now you’re
welcome to continue, but in the back of your mind think about creating a
new account on Com and importing your subscription list. Org is proving
useful to have around, so I don’t imagine it’ll go away, it’s much
easier for me to work on a DO server than on the big cloud-based
server.</p>

<p>feedland.org runs on a small
<a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new">Digital Ocean
server</a>, and Com runs in a data center. The first is a fixed-size
relatively small scale server that can’t expand, and the latter is
designed to scale automatically according to demand. I spent most of
2023 converting the software to run in the scalable environment.</p>

<p>BTW, while we’re doing this transition in FeedLand, I also have a
small crisis happening on my main static server, which depends on a
combination of software that suddenly aren’t getting along with each
other. Obviously something changed. I’m running it in a somewhat
crippled state, I may be figuring how to dig out of this hole. One of
the downsides of having fun with server software.</p>

Seeing some of the apple headsets on social media and I’m struggling to
decide if my automatic reactions are genuine, fair, and kind. My first
thoughts are quite negative. Is it because I have a prejudice against
Apple? Or against augmented reality it whatever new term is getting
pushed? Does it look ridiculous because I’m judging people against a
deep seeded set of cultural norms I should be questioning? I’m really
not sure.

<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and
over again and expecting a different result. I found the inverse of that
to also be true for my life. Doing things differently day after day and
expecting the same–positive–outcome.
</p>
<p>
I’m the product of two terrible traits: I’m a morning person but I also
lack self-discipline. And that means keeping a morning routine is
incredibly hard for me. And yet, every time I manage to do that I feel
really well. My mind is in a much better place when I wake up at 6 am or
even 5 am. I feel a lot better when I’m out in nature with the sun
rising. I know it. I’m aware of all this. And yet keeping a morning
routine is incredibly hard. I’m getting better at it though so I’m
pleased with that.
</p>
<p>
Learning how my mind works is a fun process. You’re tempted to think you
just know yourself and yet there’s always a new discovery waiting behind
the corner. Thankfully I have my whole life to figure this stuff out.

<h2 id="why-netnewswire-isnt-available-for-vision-pro">Why NetNewsWire
Isn’t Available for Vision Pro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
I’ve been getting questions about NetNewsWire’s unavailability on Vision
Pro. Why isn’t it there? When might it be there?
</p>
<p>
Here’s the scoop:
</p>
<p>
I consider it risky to support an app running on a device I don’t own.
Imagine writing a Mac or iPhone app and not actually running it on one
of those machines — you wouldn’t.
</p>
<p>
I realize that the app would act as if it were running on an iPad — but
the Vision Pro is not really an iPad. It’s a device with
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/simple_tricks_and_nonsense">very
different interactions</a> from the direct manipulation we’re used to on
iPad. And the compatibility mode is a new thing because this device is a
new thing — we don’t know how well it works and what the gotchas might
be.
</p>
<p>
I could test it on the simulator, sure, but the simulator is a
convenience for developers. It’s no replacement for running it on a real
device.
</p>
<p>
And, yes, the app is open source, which could mean that other developers
with a Vision Pro could help support it — but it’s important to remember
that I’m the only person who <em>has</em> to support it. The NetNewsWire
team is awesome, but I’m the one on the line for this.
</p>
<p>
So I want to be careful and go slowly, because if I made it available it
would be extremely difficult to reverse the decision and take it away,
even with an excellent reason.
</p>
<p>
I’m hoping that a consensus will form among developers that running apps
on Vision Pro as iPad apps is fine, that it’s a cakewalk. If that
happens, I’d go ahead and do it too. But it’s too soon for us to know
that.
</p>
<p>
PS Why don’t I have a Vision Pro? I’m sure it’s an incredible technical
achievement and an amazing experience — and pretty damn wonderful in
just about every way — but it’s just not my thing. I like reading and
writing mostly, plus making apps for reading and writing. My personal
future of computing has been here for all these years — the Mac.
</p>
<p>
PPS Eventually the price will come down to where I’d consider buying one
as a test device and for a little fun — but that may be a few years
away. I’m hoping that we’ll find, sooner than that, that running as iPad
on Vision Pro is a-okay.

<p>One of the cool things about being a programmer is that you can
decide to run code that you know has zero chance of working. “Let all
hell break loose,” a programmer can be heard to say quietly before
clicking the Run button. Very few design professions get to do this, I
imagine, unless they’re psychotic.</p>

<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/nmcli-wifi-on-raspberry-pi-os-12-bookworm">using

As always,

the edge: the use of design tactics to undermine browser choice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>In order to be able to choose their own browser, people must be free
to download it, easily set it to default and to continue using it – all
without interference from the operating system. Windows users do not
currently enjoy this freedom of choice. To investigate Microsoft’s
tactics and the impact on consumers, Mozilla commissioned Harry Brignull
and Cennydd Bowles, independent researchers and experts in harmful
design. Today, the researchers have published a report detailing how
Microsoft prevents effective browser choice on Windows. In the report,
they document how Microsoft places its own browser — Edge — at the
center of its operating system and weaponizes Windows’ user interface
design to undermine people selecting rival browsers. ↫ Mozilla Research
We all already know Microsoft does these things, and of course, a study
paid for by Mozilla agreeing with Mozilla is not exactly
earth-shattering, but stuff like this is important for aiding in
convincing regulators to do something about this stuff. It simply
shouldn’t be legal to employ all kinds of nasty tricks and dark patterns
to force people to use a certain browser.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Niri is a scrollable, tiling window manager for Wayland. What does it
mean for a tiling window manager to be scrollable? Windows are arranged
in columns on an infinite strip going to the right. Opening a new window
never causes existing windows to resize. Every monitor has its own
separate window strip. Windows can never “overflow” onto an adjacent
monitor. Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically. Every monitor
has an independent set of workspaces, and there’s always one empty
workspace present all the way down. ↫ Niri’s GitHub page Definitely an
intriguing idea.</p>
