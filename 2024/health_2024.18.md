## Hesperidin alleviates zinc-induced nephrotoxicity via the gut-kidney axis in swine

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionZinc (Zn) is an essential trace element in animals, but excessive intake can lead to renal toxicity damage. Thus, the exploration of effective natural antagonists to reduce the toxicity caused by Zn has become a major scientific problem.MethodsHere, we found that hesperidin could effectively alleviate the renal toxicity induced by Zn in pigs by using hematoxylin-eosin staining, transmission electron microscope, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence quantitative PCR, and microfloral DNA sequencing.ResultsThe results showed that hesperidin could effectively attenuate the pathological injury in kidney, and reduce autophagy and apoptosis induced by Zn, which evidenced by the downregulation of LC3, ATG5, Bak1, Bax, Caspase-3 and upregulation of p62 and Bcl2. Additionally, hesperidin could reverse colon injury and the decrease of ZO-1 protein expression. Interestingly, hesperidin restored the intestinal flora structure disturbed by Zn, and significantly reduced the abundance of Tenericutes (phylum level) and Christensenella (genus level).DiscussionThus, altered intestinal flora and intestinal barrier function constitute the gut-kidney axis, which is involved in hesperidin alleviating Zn-induced nephrotoxicity. Our study provides theoretical basis and practical significance of hesperidin for the prevention and treatment of Zn-induced nephrotoxicity through gut-kidney axis.

## Sporadic clone Escherichia coli ST615 as a vector and reservoir for dissemination of crucial antimicrobial resistance genes

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

There is scarce information concerning the role of sporadic clones in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) within the nosocomial niche. We confirmed that the clinical Escherichia coli M19736 ST615 strain, one of the first isolates of Latin America that harbors a plasmid with an mcr-1 gene, could receive crucial ARG by transformation and conjugation using as donors critical plasmids that harbor blaCTX-M-15, blaKPC-2, blaNDM-5, blaNDM-1, or aadB genes. Escherichia coli M19736 acquired blaCTX-M-15, blaKPC-2, blaNDM-5, blaNDM-1, and aadB genes, being only blaNDM-1 maintained at 100% on the 10th day of subculture. In addition, when the evolved MDR-E. coli M19736 acquired sequentially blaCTX-M-15 and blaNDM-1 genes, the maintenance pattern of the plasmids changed. In addition, when the evolved XDR-E. coli M19736 acquired in an ulterior step the paadB plasmid, a different pattern of the plasmid’s maintenance was found. Interestingly, the evolved E. coli M19736 strains disseminated simultaneously the acquired conjugative plasmids in different combinations though selection was ceftazidime in all cases. Finally, we isolated and characterized the extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the native and evolved XDR-E. coli M19736 strains. Interestingly, EVs from the evolved XDR-E. coli M19736 harbored blaCTX-M-15 though the pDCAG1-CTX-M-15 was previously lost as shown by WGS and experiments, suggesting that EV could be a relevant reservoir of ARG for susceptible bacteria. These results evidenced the genetic plasticity of a sporadic clone of E. coli such as ST615 that could play a relevant transitional link in the clinical dynamics and evolution to multidrug/extensively/pandrug-resistant phenotypes of superbugs within the nosocomial niche by acting simultaneously as a vector and reservoir of multiple ARGs which later could be disseminated.

## Raising the bar: genus-specific nested PCR improves detection and lineage identification of avian haemosporidian parasites

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Avian haemosporidian parasites are useful model organisms to study the ecology and evolution of parasite-host interactions due to their global distribution and extensive biodiversity. Detection of these parasites has evolved from microscopic examination to PCR-based methods, with the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene serving as barcoding region. However, standard PCR protocols used for screening and identification purposes have limitations in detecting mixed infections and generating phylogenetically informative data due to short amplicon lengths. To address these issues, we developed a novel genus-specific nested PCR protocol targeting avian haemosporidian parasites. The protocol underwent rigorous testing utilizing a large dataset comprising blood samples from Malagasy birds of three distinct Passeriformes families. Furthermore, validation was done by examining smaller datasets in two other laboratories employing divergent master mixes and different bird species. Comparative analyses were conducted between the outcomes of the novel PCR protocol and those obtained through the widely used standard nested PCR method. The novel protocol enables specific identification of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus), and Leucocytozoon parasites. The analyses demonstrated comparable sensitivity to the standard nested PCR with notable improvements in detecting mixed infections. In addition, phylogenetic resolution is improved by amplification of longer fragments, leading to a better understanding of the haemosporidian biodiversity and evolution. Overall, the novel protocol represents a valuable addition to avian haemosporidian detection methodologies, facilitating comprehensive studies on parasite ecology, epidemiology, and evolution.

## Evaluation of IFNAR2 and TYK2 transcripts’ prognostic role in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background and objectivesThis study aimed to investigate the possible prognostic significance of interferon alpha–beta receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expressions.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study including COVID-19 adult patients. All blood samples were collected before any interventions. The expressions of IFNAR2 and TYK2 were assessed using real-time PCR in venous blood samples of 54 cases and 56 controls. The transcript quantities of IFNAR2 and TYK2 genes were assessed using a Delta-Ct method.ResultsOur findings show no significant differences in gene expression levels for IFNAR2 and TYK2 between patients who required oxygen (O2) therapy and those who did not (p-value = 0.732 and p-value = 0.629, respectively). Likewise, there were no significant differences in IFNAR2 and TYK2 expressions between patients hospitalized for less than 7 days and those hospitalized for 7 days or more (p-value = 0.455 and p-value = 0.626, respectively). We also observed a weak correlation between IFNAR2 expression and CRP (p-value = 0.045, r = 0.192). There was a negative correlation between the expression levels of IFNAR2 and TYK2 transcripts in COVID-19 patients (p-value = 0.044; partial correlation coefficient = -0.283). Additionally, IFNAR2 and TYK2 were significantly downregulated in the COVID-19 group compared to healthy subjects (p-value = 0.002 and p-value = 0.028, respectively). However, neither IFNAR2 nor TYK2 expression was significantly different between the case subgroups based on COVID-19 severity. The IFNAR2 ΔΔCt (B = -0.184, 95% CI: -0.524–0.157, p-value = 0.275) and the TYK2 ΔΔCt (B = 0.114, 95% CI: -0.268–0.496, p-value = 0.543) were not found to be significant predictors of hospitalization duration. The area under the curve (AUC) for IFNAR2 expression is 0.655 (p-value = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.554–0.757), suggesting its poor discriminative value.ConclusionWe were unable to comment definitively on the prognostic power of IFNAR2 and TYK2 expressions in COVID-19 patients, and larger-scale studies are needed. The principal limitations of this study included the lack of longitudinal analysis and limited sample size.

## Incidence and risk factors of active tuberculosis among older individuals with latent tuberculosis infection: a cohort study in two high-epidemic sites in eastern China

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe influencing factors of the process from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to the onset of active tuberculosis (TB) remain unknown among different population groups, especially among older individuals in high-incidence areas. This study aimed to investigate the development of active TB among older adults with LTBI and identify groups in greatest need of improved prevention and control strategies for TB.MethodsIn 2021, we implemented an investigation among older individuals (≥ 65 years old) in two towns in Zhejiang Province with the highest incidence of TB. All participants underwent assessment using standardized questionnaires, physical examinations, interferon-gamma release assays, and chest radiography. All the participants with suspected TB based on the clinical symptoms or abnormal chest radiography results, as well as those with LTBI, were referred for diagnostic investigation in accordance with the national guidelines. Those with an initial diagnosis of TB were then excluded, whereas those with LTBI were included in a follow-up at baseline. Incident patients with active TB were identified from the Chinese Tuberculosis Management Information System, and a multivariate Cox regression model was used to estimate the incidence and risk of TB among those with LTBI.ResultsIn total, 667 participants with LTBI were followed up for 1,315.3 person-years, revealing a disease density of 1,292.5 individuals/100,000 person-years (17/1,315.3). For those with LTBI, chest radiograph abnormalities had adjusted hazard ratios for active TB of 4.9 (1.6–15.3).ConclusionsThe presence of abnormal chest radiography findings increased the risk of active TB among older individuals with LTBI in high-epidemic sites in eastern China.
