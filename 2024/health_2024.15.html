mutational scanning of the RNase III-like domain in Trypanosoma brucei
RNA editing protein KREPB4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Kinetoplastid pathogens including Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and
Leishmania species, are early diverged, eukaryotic, unicellular
parasites. Functional understanding of many proteins from these
pathogens has been hampered by limited sequence homology to proteins
from other model organisms. Here we describe the development of a
high-throughput deep mutational scanning approach in T. brucei that
facilitates rapid and unbiased assessment of the impacts of many
possible amino acid substitutions within a protein on cell fitness, as
measured by relative cell growth. The approach leverages several
molecular technologies: cells with conditional expression of a wild-type
gene of interest and constitutive expression of a library of mutant
variants, degron-controlled stabilization of I-SceI meganuclease to
mediate highly efficient transfection of a mutant allele library, and a
high-throughput sequencing readout for cell growth upon conditional
knockdown of wild-type gene expression and exclusive expression of
mutant variants. Using this method, we queried the effects of amino acid
substitutions in the apparently non-catalytic RNase III-like domain of
KREPB4 (B4), which is an essential component of the RNA Editing
Catalytic Complexes (RECCs) that carry out mitochondrial RNA editing in
T. brucei. We measured the impacts of thousands of B4 variants on
bloodstream form cell growth and validated the most deleterious variants
containing single amino acid substitutions. Crucially, there was no
correlation between phenotypes and amino acid conservation,
demonstrating the greater power of this method over traditional sequence
homology searching to identify functional residues. The bloodstream form
cell growth phenotypes were combined with structural modeling, RECC
protein proximity data, and analysis of selected substitutions in
procyclic form T. brucei. These analyses revealed that the B4
RNaseIII-like domain is essential for maintenance of RECC integrity and
RECC protein abundances and is also involved in changes in RECCs that
occur between bloodstream and procyclic form life cycle stages.</p>

progress on the microbiota in bladder cancer tumors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The microbiota, also referred to as the microbial community, is a
crucial component of the human microenvironment. It is located
predominantly in various organs, including the intestines, skin, oral
cavity, respiratory tract, and reproductive tract. The microbiota
maintains a symbiotic relationship with the human body, influencing
physiological and pathological functions to a significant degree. There
is increasing evidence linking the microbial flora to human cancers. In
contrast to the traditional belief that the urethra and urine of normal
individuals are sterile, recent advancements in high-throughput
sequencing technology and bacterial cultivation methods have led to the
discovery of specific microbial communities in the urethras of healthy
individuals. Given the prevalence of bladder cancer (BCa) as a common
malignancy of the urinary system, researchers have shifted their focus
to exploring the connection between disease development and the unique
microbial community within tumors. This shift has led to a deeper
investigation into the role of microbiota in the onset, progression,
metastasis, prognosis, and potential for early detection of BCa. This
article reviews the existing research on the microbiota within BCa
tumors and summarizes the findings regarding the roles of different
microbes in various aspects of this disease.</p>

of mucosa-associated microbiota dysbiosis in the ascending colon in
hepatitis C virus post-sustained virologic response cirrhotic
patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAchieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients
infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) reduces all-cause mortality.
However, the mechanisms and risk factors for liver fibrosis and portal
hypertension post-SVR remain incompletely understood. In the gut-liver
axis, mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) substantially influence immune
and metabolic functions, displaying spatial heterogeneity at the
anatomical intestinal site. We analyzed MAM composition and function to
isolate the locoregional MAM involved in chronic liver disease
progression in HCV post-SVR patients.MethodsWe collected MAM samples
from three intestinal sites (terminal ileum, ascending colon, and
sigmoid colon) via brushing during colonoscopy in 23 HCV post-SVR
patients and 25 individuals without liver disease (controls). The 16S
rRNA of bacterial DNA in specimens collected with a brush and in feces
was sequenced. The molecular expression of intestinal tissues and
hepatic tissues were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR.ResultsIn
the post-SVR group, the microbial Î²-diversity of MAM, especially in the
ascending colon, differed from the control group and was associated with
liver fibrosis progression. In PICRUSt analysis, MAM in the ascending
colon in the liver cirrhosis (LC) group showed compromised functions
associated with the intestinal barrier and bile acid production, and
FGF19 expression was markedly decreased in the terminal ileum biopsy
tissue in the LC group. At the genus level, six short-chain fatty acid
(SCFA)-producing bacterial genera, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia,
Agathobaculum, Dorea, and Pseudoflavonifractor were reduced in the
ascending colon of post-SVR LC patients.ConclusionIn patients of HCV
post-SVR, we identified the association between the degree of liver
fibrosis and dysbiosis of mucosa-associated SCFA-producing bacterial
genera that may be related to intestinal barrier and bile acid
production in the ascending colon.</p>
