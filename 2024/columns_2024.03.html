<p>
<a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2024/01/09/invisible-ink-at-the-cias-creative-writing-group/">This</a>
is a fascinating story.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Last spring, a friend of a friend visited my office and invited me to
Langley to speak to Invisible Ink, the CIA’s creative writing group.
</p>
<p>
I asked Vivian (not her real name) what she wanted me to talk about.
</p>
<p>
She said that the topic of the talk was entirely up to me.
</p>
<p>
I asked what level the writers in the group were.
</p>
<p>
She said the group had writers of all levels.
</p>
<p>
I asked what the speaking fee was.
</p>
<p>
She said that as far as she knew, there was no speaking fee.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What I want to know is, why haven’t I been invited? There are nonfiction
writers in that group…

<h2 id="a-lesson-learned">A Lesson Learned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
You know how backups work great until you really need them? Below the
fold, a lesson learned from my recent example of this phenomenon.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> A long time ago I was feeling
rich, so I spent nearly $2000 on one of the first-generation Mac Airs.
This led to me travelling with a
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/a-note-of-thanks.html">laptop I
could afford to lose</a> instead. I loved the Air for all sorts of
reasons but one of its important tasks was to back up my iPhone every
day. And, of course, being something of an expert on preserving digital
information, then back up the Air to an external USB hard disk using
Time Machine. <a href="https://www.lockss.org">Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff
Safe</a>.<br /> <br /> In the end I had to upgrade to a more recent M1
Air, not because the old one stopped working, but simply because the USB
ports stoppped working, so it could no longer backup the iPhone or
update the Time Machine disk. The new Air was impressively fast and had
two USB-C ports, which it used both for data and for power. I continued
to back up the iPhone and the Air daily<br /> <br /> Fast forward to
last month. The new Air’s USB-C ports had been a bit flaky for a while,
but now one failed. It wouldn’t transfer data or power. A few days later
the other port stopped transferring power, leaving me with no way to
charge it. It was about 85% charged, so I powered it off.<br /> <br /> I
thought “I’m OK, I have yesterday’s Time Machine so I can get a new M2
Air and initialize it from the disk”. So I ordered a new one and, as
soon as it was delivered, plugged in the Time Machine disk and fired up
the Migration Assistant. It asked me what disk it should use. I wasn’t
able to select the Time Machine disk because, to my surprise, the Air
couldn’t see it. Plugging the disk into my Linux desktop revealed that
in the couple of weeks since the day before the M1 Air failed, the Time
Machine disk had died.<br /> <br /> At this point I remembered that when
I powered it off, the M1 Air still had a USB-C port that transferred
data, even if it didn’t work for power. There were two ways to
initialize the M2 Air using the remaining battery, either create a new
Time Machine disk using the one USB-C port that transferred data, or via
Bluetooth. I found a USB-C external SSD, which I figured would use less
power, powered up the M1 Air, plugged in the drive, started a Time
Machine backup, and crossed my fingers.<br /> <br /> After a long,
agonizing wait the backup finished with still quite a lot of battery
left, so I powered off the M1 Air and used the disk to initialize the M2
Air. Apple’s Migration Assistant worked flawlessly, and I relaxed. The
best thing about the M2 Air is that Apple went back to powering it with
MagSafe! Their fragile USB hardware could no longer prevent the machine
charging.<br /> <br /> So the lesson was that I needed to have
<i>two</i> Time Machine disks and use them alternately, so even if the
most recent one failed I would have a backup only one day older.<br />
<br /> The next problem came when I plugged my iPhone into the M2 Air to
back it up. I got “unknown error 7014”. Google had no trace of “unknown
error 7014” so, baffled, I made an appointment with the “Genius” at
Apple’s Palo Alto store. In the faint hope that the M1 Air could be
fixed, I took both Airs and the iPhone with me.<br /> <br /> The Genius
was very good. He rapidly figured out that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“unknown error 7014” was caused by the fact that, despite its having
been delivered a few days earlier, the M2 Air’s operating system was
out-of-date. A software update overnight fixed the problem.
</li>
<li>
He confirmed that the M1 Air’s USB-C ports had failed and, to my
surprise, explained that the ports were on a daughter-board that could
be replaced. It was a $15 part and $90 in labor, and completed
overnight.
</li>
</ul>
<p>So now I can travel with a Mac Air.<br /> <br /></p>

York to plead his case — literally. He was in federal court today, where
he’ll soon find out how much he’ll have to pay for defaming a woman he’s
also been found liable for sexually abusing. You may want to think about
that for a moment. And let us remember it’s only January. There are more

<b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining

we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on
OpenAI’s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code
than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an
AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than
those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that
participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language
and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature)
provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to
better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide
an in-depth analysis of participants’ language and interaction behavior,
as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct
similar studies in the future…

most recent year for which records are available, nearly 700 people
perished or disappeared trying to come to the United States. The

<p>Friends, The mainstream media still don’t get it. This morning’s New

decisive victory in Iowa revealed a new depth to the reservoir of
devotion inside his party. For eight years, he has nurtured a
relationship with his supporters with little precedent in politics. He
validates them, he entertains them, he speaks for them and he uses them
for his political and legal advantage.</p>
