## The Heart of Sagebrush

date: 2024-02-13, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>The Heart of Sagebrush</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>While most other woody plants are dormant in winter, sagebrush continues to grow, even when nearly buried in snow. On sunny days its leaves take in the energy needed for photosynthesis that fuels slow, steady growth. Scientifically, big sagebrush (<em>Artemesia tridentata</em>) is related to the sunflower, but aside from their plant superpower of turning sunshine into food, the two seem to have little in common. </p>

<p><i>Artemesia</i>'s tallest branches peek out of snowdrifts to feed greater sage-grouse and other wildlife. Seeds not eaten for their high protein content are scattered by the winds, while branches hold scarce moisture in the ecosystem by capturing blowing snow. </p>

When temperatures climb above freezing, snowmelt will water the seeds to sprout, also enlivening standing sagebrush, native grasses and flowering plants that provide food and cover in the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-05-12/sagebrush-and-grasses-and-forbs-all-better-nesting">spring and summer</a>. </p>

<p>Recent science shows that 1.9 million acres of sagebrush habitat were lost between 2012 and 2018. Climate effects such as drought, increasing wildfires and invasive species accelerate habitat loss. While burned areas can be restored, treatment is costly and uncertain to be effective before sage-grouse and other wildlife are forced to leave the areas permanently. </p>

## Farmington hosts non-profit youth riding group at Alien Run

date: 2024-02-12, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>Farmington hosts non-profit youth riding group at Alien Run</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>Durango Devo has been operating out of Durango, Colorado for nearly 16 years, with a goal of encouraging youth to get out and mountain bike, while fostering a sense of adventure and exploration.</p>

<p>The problem is, riding bikes is tricky in early spring when there’s still snow on the trails. The solution? A 45-minute drive down to Farmington, New Mexico, where the ground is dry and the public lands are close and accessible.</p>

<figure role="group" class="align-center">

<p>“We head down south and ride in dry trails earlier in the year,” says Durango Devo Executive Director Levi Kurlander. “For a lot of these kids it’s their first time camping, and Alien Run Trail System is an accessible place to show kids how to ride responsibly and respect the trails and areas where they’re camping. Then they get to go home and share that with their parents and friends.”</p>

<p>The organization worked with outdoor recreation staff to secure a special recreation permit, and they now take several camping trips in Farmington each year. One of their main goals is to educate kids on how to recreate responsibly, treating the trails they ride and the land they camp on with respect. They teach the kids Leave No Trace principles, and are committed to leaving as little waste behind as possible. Levi says they often only carry away one bag of trash for a group of 40-50 kids.</p>

<p>“Durango Devo are great stewards of the land and the resources,” says Jake McBride, Farmington Field Office Outdoor Recreation Planner. “They teach amazing youth programs and have great trail and environmental ethics.”</p>

<p>Durango Devo works with multiple BLM offices between Colorado and New Mexico, a unique partnership which has made these types of trips possible.</p>

<p>“We work really closely with the BLM offices in Durango and Farmington for all of our programs,” Levi says. “We love working with Jake from the Farmington office. He’s friendly and responds quickly. He makes it easy for us.”</p>

<p>Durango Devo hopes to continue their trips to Alien Run well into the future, helping teach youth how to care for public lands and helping to ensure the safe and proper use of those lands for current and future generations.</p>

<p>“They’re a very important member of the mountain biking and local communities, while also being a great partner,” says Jake. “We look forward to working with them for many years to come.”</p>

## Nature's engineers: the art of wetland restoration using a beaver’s blueprint

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>In Sublette County, Wyoming, <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2023-06/BLM-WY-LaBarge-Restoration-Landscape-Factsheet_05-30-2023v2.pdf">the Bureau of Land Management invested funds from the Inflation Reduction Act</a> to change the way rivers and creeks behave. A group of biologists, cultural resources specialists, and other scientists are partnering with a crew of technicians from the Northern Arapahoe Tribe to build small, natural dams. </p>

<p>The dams are meant to mimic those created by beavers to slow creek flow and create wetlands and ponds. BLM hopes that the new human-engineered dams will encourage beavers to move into the area, and will reduce erosion and the effects of drought. </p>

<p>The dams are located on the <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/6966af5d6f584f8b80f102d391671a3f">La Barge Restoration Landscape, one of 21 such landscape areas</a> in the western United States. The Inflation Reduction Act is a component of the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/">Investing in America</a> agenda. </p>
