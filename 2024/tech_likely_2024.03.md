## ADD revisited

date: 2024-01-19, from: Ayjay blog

On the first day of my Christian Renaissance of the Twentieth Century course — mentioned here — I played for my students a few minutes of the first movement of Rachmaninoff’s Second Piano Concerto. We paused to talk a bit about the musical language of late Romanticism, about Rachmaninoff’s gift for lush melody, etc. Then [&#8230;]

## 55 Years Ago: Six Months Until the Moon Landing

date: 2024-01-19, from: NASA breaking news

The new year of 1969 dawned with optimism that NASA would meet President John F. Kennedy’s goal of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. The previous year saw four Apollo missions, two uncrewed and two carrying three astronauts each, test different components of the lunar landing architecture, culminating [&#8230;]

## Serving Oddµ via a socket

date: 2024-01-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Serving Oddµ via a socket</h1>

<p>Recently, <a href="http://the-brannons.com/">Chris Brannon</a> sent me a patch for <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> that allowed it to listen at a Unix-domain socket instead of a host and port.</p>

<p>I decided to investigate since I don&rsquo;t know anything about sockets. If you see something that can be improved, let me know.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use systemd, but for my user.</p>

<p>I have two files, one for the socket and one for the service. These are not the same files as the ones provided with the Oddµ sources. Those are intended to be used together with a web server that acts as a reverse proxy. These files are for me testing the installation using netcat and curl.</p>

<h2>Socket</h2>

<p>Make sure the directory for the socket exists:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/run/oddmu
</code></pre>

<p>This is the file &ldquo;oddmu-unix-domain.socket&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu server socket
[Socket]
ListenStream=/home/alex/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
Accept=no
[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
</code></pre>

<p>Enable and start it:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.socket
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.socket
</code></pre>

<h2>Service</h2>

<p>Make sure the directory for the wiki exists and copy the template files:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
cp *.html /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
</code></pre>

<p>This is the file &ldquo;oddmu-unix-domain.service&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu
After=network.target
Requires=oddmu-unix-domain.socket
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
StandardInput=socket
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
ExecStart=/home/alex/src/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1&quot;
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t limit a lot of capabilities, but I guess I trust my own code.</p>

<p>Install it:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.service
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.service
</code></pre>

<h2>Test</h2>

<p>Check the journal:</p>

<pre><code>journalctl --user --follow --unit oddmu-unix-domain
</code></pre>

<p>Do some requests using netcat:</p>

<pre><code>echo -e &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /view/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /edit/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
</code></pre>

<p>Using curl:</p>

<pre><code>curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/edit/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  --form body=&quot;Hello!&quot; http://localhost/save/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/view/index
</code></pre>

<h2>What now?</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to change my web server setup. But using sockets and <code>systemctl --user</code> has been interesting.</p>

<p>Thank you, Chris Brannon, for sending that patch!</p>

## P&B: Tom MacWright

date: 2024-01-19, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>This is the 21st edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Tom MacWright and his blog, <a href="https://macwright.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">macwright.com</a></p>
<p>Tom is an American programmer, with a very minimal blog—something I really appreciate—and he's currently working on <a href="https://www.val.town" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Val.town</a>, a social website to code in the cloud.</p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Hi! I'm from New Jersey and I live in Brooklyn now. I studied Computer Science in college a lot time ago, and that led to a series of jobs at early-stage startups: I've worked on CAD software extensions, visualization tools, geospatial software, and programming tools. It can be a little hectic, the urgency to get these companies from point A to B, but I like it.</p>
<p>I've always had a lot of hobbies, and have kept most of them. Guitar, banjo, running, art, writing, gardening, hardware projects: having a few things to do is pretty important to me. The creative energy from one project can spill over to another, and you can get a fresh perspective by taking a break from some long-running task.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>When I started writing online in 2010, there were a lot of people leading the way. I remember <a href="http://simplebits.com/blog/">SimpleBits</a> and <a href="https://kottke.org/">kottke</a>, <a href="http://artypapers.com/">Rebekah Cox</a> and David Heinemeier Hansson. <a href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a> had a perfect look for his blog that heavily influenced mine. One of my earliest jobs, working at a company called <a href="https://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, encouraged us all to write. Bonnie Bogle, one of the founders, had worked professionally as a writer and helped a lot with editing and taught us all how to write for the web.</p>
<p>I write to think, so I do it all the time and not just for the blog. I keep paper journals. I like that quote on the back of all my <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> notebooks: "I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now."</p>
<p>For the current blog, I'm kind of proud of how little it's changed. It's so easy to just chase the latest blog software or design, but with my current blog I've been able to really restrain myself. I like the design and the technology just works. The content has definitely changed as what I've worked on shifted. There's usually some writing that's work-related, some that's about what I'm interested in now. I've added sections for photos and book reviews.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I don't have a process for getting inspired or finding topics to write about. I just write about what I'm interested in and what I think is fun to share. So sometimes months go by without finishing anything, and sometimes it's four posts in a month.</p>
<p>It's scary when the inspiration doesn't come. Right now is one of those times: it's been three months since I wrote a standalone blog post. But I write one a month, always called "Recently," which is there to keep a cadence. The Recently posts have a consistent structure and are less of a commitment to write - I think they've helped me keep the habit through all these years.</p>
<p>I don't have anyone proofread my drafts. I make grammar and spelling mistakes all the time, and would probably benefit from an editor, but it's a solo operation, for better or worse.</p>
<p>I don't write outlines. Sometimes I'll write multiple drafts when I can't figure out which part of the topic is really interesting. I'll write long blog posts just to find the 25% that's actually good, and I'll keep just that part.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'm either incredibly neat in my own space, with everything on the table arranged at right angles, or writing on a laptop at a chaotic cafe. If I'm listening to anything when I'm writing, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a>.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Sure! It's simple. The blog is generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, stored on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and hosted on <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I recently switched to using Cloudflare as my domain registrar – really happy with them so far. I also used Cloudflare to store photos, with their R2 service. I also have my own email address on the site, using Fastmail, which is fantastic.</p>
<p>And that's really it – it's a static site. I've made small changes to the tech stack like switching from GitHub Pages to Netlify and from Gandi to Cloudflare. But overall, I've used simple tools to make something simple and it has been unproblematic.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Not really: I like how I have it set up. Maybe I'd use Hugo or Eleventy instead of Jekyll, just because it's annoying to set up Ruby on new computers. But Jekyll has been great otherwise.</p>
<p>It's easy to overcomplicate these things.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>The domain costs about $20 a year. Hosting images on Cloudflare R2 costs a few cents a month. Fastmail costs $5 a month.</p>
<p>Thanks to Brooklyn rents, these numbers are relatively insignificant to me.</p>
<p>I've tried a few things to monetize it: affiliate links, hooking up the Brave Browser's advertising system, and a ko-fi.com link for donations.</p>
<p>I also sell the blog's theme for $100, because people kept asking for it. But, I try to make it clear that if you just want to recreate it on your own or rip off design elements, be my guest, don't pay me!</p>
<p>I shut down the Brave advertising setup, which paid me in BAT tokens, because the annoyance of accounting for "crypto income" outweighed the income itself. I don't use affiliate links anymore – they were always a paltry income.</p>
<p>For me, I've had a relatively comfortable career in the tech industry. The most value that my blog has provided me is job flexibility and exposure. I feel awkward about the prospect of monetizing my audience and I have the luxury not to do so.</p>
<p>But that's not a universal experience at all, and I think it's totally cool and fair for anyone to monetize their blog. Some people have done really well that way!</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I read enough tech stuff at work, so I don't really need programming blogs. I have a few RSS subscriptions that I still treasure: <a href="https://www.cycfi.com/">Cycfi Research</a> is from a company that is building wild MIDI-compatible guitars out of carbon fiber. <a href="https://zeptobars.com/en/">Zeptobars</a> is a very focused blog that posts die shots - images of chips after the coating has been etched away. <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew DeVault’s blog</a> is software engineering feats of strength and some very strong opinions. <a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/">Light Blue Touchpaper</a> always has some post about a mind-blowing security vulnerability. <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">Language Log</a> has wild language-crossover examples. And of course there's <a href="https://100r.co/site/log.html">100 Rabbits</a> posting about their art, programming, music, and boat adventures.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Right now I'm spending a lot of time on <a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a>, so check that out!</p></div>

## Hans Reiser on ReiserFS deprecation from the Linux kernel

date: 2024-01-19, from: OS News

What follows is a letter from Hans Reiser to myself, which he wrote some two months back, and has asked me to publish, with his thoughts on the deprecation of ReiserFS from the Linux kernel. I have transcribed it to the best of my ability. Plaintext email may not be the best way to read it, as such, I have also made available PDF and HTML versions of the letter. ↫ Fredrick R. Brennan Hans Reiser is the creator of the ReiserFS file system, which used to be a serious contender for the Linux file system you&#8217;d use in the early 2000s. In 2006, Hans Reiser murdered his wife, and is currently serving a prison sentence for this crime. Hopefully, after he completes his prison sentence, he can become a contributing member of society once again, if the professionals and specialists involved in such matters deem him capable of doing so. The long letter mentioned here was actually quite a fascinating read, and details his abrasive behaviour in the Linux world, the design of ReiserFS and its place in the ecosystem at the time, and his thoughts on the removal of ReiserFS from the Linux kernel.

## VMware is killing off 56 products amid “tectonic” infrastructure shift

date: 2024-01-19, from: OS News

Broadcom’s brutal assault on VMware’s product suite continues, with the company’s new owner this week confirming that it is sunsetting a massive 56 VMware products and platforms – as investors said this week that they anticipated a “tectonic shift” in the infrastructure market as a result.&#160; In a January 15 advisory VMware confirmed tersely that it was taking a sweeping range of products to “End of Availability” and that “these products are no longer available for purchase” – although most remain advertised enthusiastically, for now, on slick corporate website pages. ↫ Ed Targett The list of products is a thing to behold, for sure. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen that many enterprise products together in one list, and I once spent weeks scouring and dealing with HPE.

## WebGPU comes to Chrome 121 for Android

The Chrome team is excited to announce that WebGPU is now enabled by default in Chrome 121 on devices running Android 12 and greater powered by Qualcomm and ARM GPUs. Support will gradually expand to encompass a wider range of Android devices, including those running on Android 11 in a near future.

## Where have all the flowers gone?

date: 2024-01-18, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>A post from Jason Velazquez called “<a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/">Where have all the websites gone?</a>” crossed my socials. It’s a good lament about the dearth of interesting content on the internet and how we’re stuck in the same boring content silos.</p>
<p>The question reminded me of a song by Pete Seeger called “<em>Where have all the flowers gone?</em>” In the song Pete wonders aloud about the flowers now missing from the field…</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 1]
Where have all the flowers gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the flowers gone?
Long time ago
Where have all the flowers gone?
The girls have picked them, every one
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We find out that the girls have picked all the flowers. All of them. That’s a bit excessive. Why? The second verse explores the young girls’ situation…</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 2]
Where have all the young girls gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the young girls gone?
Long time ago
Where have all the young girls gone?
They've taken husbands, every one
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The girls got married, good for them! That’s a natural part of growing up. But what of the husbands and how are they connected to the missing flowers? Did they use all the flowers for their weddings? The third verse answers this question.</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 3]
Where have all the young men gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the young men gone?
Long time ago
Where have all the young men gone?
They're all in uniform
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The young men, dressed in uniform, went off to war. The flowers were, presumably, for their funerals. Pete sure knew how to tell a story.</p>
<p>So where have all the websites gone? Well, the people who make them have all gone to war for the capitalist machine. They grew up and got jobs. A natural part of growing up. Silos came and plucked their voices. Invasive memes and short form content grew in their place. Hustle overtook leisure. Harassment overtook openness. Influence overtook creativity. An economy of interestingness replaced by one of followers, likes, and engagement metrics.</p>
<p>One important thing to note; websites aren’t extinct. In fact, you’re on one now! Uploading your own words is ancient technology but still works.</p>
<p>I loved Jason’s point about the curators and it illuminated something I don’t think I fully understood before. Curators and aggregators are integral to the ecosystem. If we all create, steal, and regurgitate the same content then we only reinforce our own echo chamber. Aggregators bridge subcultures in a world of content bubbles and subreddits. They share curios from the web you may have missed, subverting the FOMO-based dopamine addiction machine using RSS. They find beauty in the mundane and surface wisdom from obscure writings. That is valuable, worth more than gold.</p>
<p><a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/">We are poems, not software</a> and in need of a reforestation of our curators. To paraphrase Mr. Rogers in these dire times, “Look for the aggregators…”</p>

## Did the battle against “misinformation” go too far?

date: 2024-01-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In March 2021, a Twitter user asked Martin Kulldorff if everyone needed to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Kulldorff, then a professor at Harvard Medical School, had spent 20 years researching infectious diseases and contributing to the development of the country’s vaccine safety surveillance system. “No,” he responded. The vaccines were important for some high-risk people,...

It's much more powerful esp with people who like Telsas (of which I am one). I also see the Tesla as a very capable replacement for my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to charity in 2012, which I loved for the same reasons I love the Tesla. Putting down the competition isn't what marketing is about, you have to think about the people whose minds you're trying to change, and know you're in it for the long haul. An example of their ad copy: "With electric driving comes exciting possibilities. That’s why BMW approaches this new era in mobility just like any other; where engineering, innovation and aesthetics come together seamlessly to inspire joy in every journey." These people understand their product and how their fans see them.

## Lichee Console 4A, RISC-V mini laptop: review, benchmarks and early issues

date: 2024-01-18, from: OS News

I always liked small laptops and phones &#8211; but for some reason they fell out of favor of manufacturers (&#8220;bigger is more better&#8221;). Now if one wanted to get tiny laptop &#8211; one of the few opportunities would have been to fight for old Sony UMPC&#8217;s on ebay which are somewhat expensive even today. Recently Raspberry Pi/CM4-based tiny laptops started to appear &#8211; especially clockwork products are neat, but they are not foldable like a laptop. When in summer of 2023 Sipeed announced Lichee Console 4A based on RISC-V SoC &#8211; I preordered it immediately and in early January I finally received it. Results of my testing, currently uncovered issues are below. ↫ Mikhail Svarichevsky I want one of these.

## Do users write more insecure code with AI assistants?

date: 2024-01-18, from: OS News

AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity. Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we release our user-study apparatus and anonymized data to researchers seeking to build on our work at this link. ↫ Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, and Dan Boneh I&#8217;m surprised somewhat randomly copying other people&#8217;s code into your program &#8211; violating their licenses, to boot &#8211; leads to crappier code. Who knew!

## From 0 to 1 MB in DOS

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

Since the last article on the text-based IDEs of old, I’ve been meaning to write about the GCC port to DOS, namely DJGPP. As I worked on the draft for that topic, I realized that there is a ton of ground to cover to set the stage so I took most of the content on memory management out and wrote this separate post. This article is a deep dive on how DOS had to pull out tricks maximize the use of the very limited 1 MB address space of the 8086. Those tricks could exist because of the features later introduced by the 80286 and the 80386, but these were just clutches to paper over the fact that DOS could not leverage the real improvements provided by protected mode. ↫ Julio Merino The DOS memory story is a string of hacks upon hacks that somehow managed to work &#8211; and that still work today.

## Google introduces Google Takeout API

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

Google has detailed more of the changes it&#8217;s implementing to comply with the European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act. We already covered the changes to linked services, but Google is also changing how results related to shopping and booking results are displayed. We will introduce dedicated units that include a group of links to comparison sites from across the web, and query shortcuts at the top of the search page to help people refine their search, including by focusing results just on comparison sites. For categories like hotels, we will also start testing a dedicated space for comparison sites and direct suppliers to show more detailed individual results including images, star ratings and more. These changes will result in the removal of some features from the search page, such as the Google Flights unit. ↫ Oliver Bethell Google is also releasing its promised Google Takeout API, allowing developers to programmatically deal with users wanting to take their data out of Google to another service. This one in particular I&#8217;m interested in, since I&#8217;m curious if, say, a competing email service will make it easier and automatic to move away from Gmail.

## Corporations Are Not To Be Loved

date: 2024-01-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>I started using Apple computers — and writing code for them, starting with BASIC — 43 years ago, before the Macintosh, even, and I’ve made this my career. I’ve had all these decades to really, thoroughly delight in these incredible machines and software, and to give a little back with my own apps.</p>

<p>Apple’s positive effect on my life should not be underestimated. My Mom once (lovingly, teasingly) said to me that my alternate career, had all this never happened, was “criminal genius.” Which might have been fun too, but possibly more stressful than I might have liked. At any rate, Apple has saved me from a life of crime, and I should love Apple for that.</p>

<p>But I need to remember, now and again, that Apple is a corporation, and corporations aren’t people, and they can’t love you back. You wouldn’t love GE or Exxon or Comcast — and you shouldn’t love Apple. It’s not an exception to the rule: there are no exceptions.</p>

<p>Apple doesn’t care about you personally in the least tiny bit, and if you were in their way somehow, they would do whatever their might — effectively infinite compared to your own — enables them to deal with you.</p>

<p>Luckily, Apple has just provided us all with a reminder. Just like the sixth finger in an AI-rendered hand, Apple’s policies for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">Distributing apps in the U.S. that provide an external purchase link</a> are startlingly graceless and a jarring, but not surprising, reminder that Apple is not a real person and not worthy of your love.</p>

Jaroslav Pelikan:  Origen may … have been the first church father to study Hebrew, “in opposition to the spirit of his time and of his people,” as Jerome says; according to Eusebius, he “learned it thoroughly,” but there is reason to doubt the accuracy of this report. Jerome, however, was rightly celebrated as &#8220;a trilingual [&#8230;]

## Webb Shows Many Early Galaxies Looked Like Pool Noodles, Surfboards

Researchers analyzing images from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have found that galaxies in the early universe are often flat and elongated, like surfboards and pool noodles – and are rarely round, like volleyballs or frisbees. “Roughly 50 to 80% of the galaxies we studied appear to be flattened in two dimensions,” explained lead author [&#8230;]

ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they're always there, and not too busy to help out. They know everything you don't know and need to know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a human btw). It's remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human programming partner. It's the kind of helper I aspire to be.

## 86-DOS revisited

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

Recently, the oldest known versions of DOS were uploaded to the internet, and Michal Necasek dove into the floppy images. Even after more than 40 years(!), old software releases and pre-releases can still surface. In the case of 86-DOS 0.11 and 0.34 it’s practically a miracle, since there were probably never very many copies in existence. For the first time since the early 1980s, FAT formatted floppies with the primordial 16-byte directory entry format have come to light. The old 16-byte directory entries were gone by 86-DOS 1.0 in April 1981 and of course never appeared in any public PC DOS release. These prehistoric versions of 86-DOS allow us to fill in further missing pieces in the puzzle of DOS origins. It is fascinating to follow how DOS developed from almost nothing to a multi-million dollar business in the course of just a few years. ↫ Michal Necasek It started out so humbly. Yet, here we are, in 2024, and variants of DOS still have their uses in certain niches. An incredible legacy, for sure.

## A shocking amount of the web is machine translated: insights from multi-way parallelism

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

We show that content on the web is often translated into many languages, and the low quality of these multi-way translations indicates they were likely created using Machine Translation (MT). Multi-way parallel, machine generated content not only dominates the translations in lower resource languages; it also constitutes a large fraction of the total web content in those languages. We also find evidence of a selection bias in the type of content which is translated into many languages, consistent with low quality English content being translated en masse into many lower resource languages, via MT. Our work raises serious concerns about training models such as multilingual large language models on both monolingual and bilingual data scraped from the web. ↫ Brian Thompson, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Peter Frisch, Tobias Domhan, Marcello Federico As a translator myself, this is entirely unsurprising. Translating is a craft, a skill, and much like with any other craft, you get what you pay for. If you pay your translator(s) a good rate, you get a good translation. If you pay your translator(s) a shit rate, you get a shit translation. If you pay nothing, you get nothing. I&#8217;m definitely seeing more and more people in my industry integrate machine translations, but so far, it&#8217;s not been an actual issue &#8211; I have no qualms about accepting a job where I take a machine-translated text and whip it into shape and turn it into a human-readable, quality translation&#8230; As long as people pay me a reasonable rate for it. Working from a machine translation is often quicker and easier, so the going rate obviously reflects that. The quality of machine translations is absolutely atrocious, however, and the idea of relying on it for texts other people &#8211; customers, clients, employees, etc. &#8211; are actually supposed to read and work from is terrifying. Google Translate is an effective tool for personal use, but throwing, I don&#8217;t know, your product&#8217;s manual at it and dumping the unedited result onto your customers is borderline criminal. Pay nothing, get nothing.

## WobblyBox, a web component for wobbly boxes

date: 2024-01-16, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>For years the latest articles list on my homepage had a neat little CSS trick where each post had wobbly “rough boxes” around them. To create the effect I used a script from <a href="http://css-houdini.rocks">css-houdini.rocks</a> aptly named <a href="https://css-houdini.rocks/rough-boxes/">Rough Boxes</a>. One minor problem, CSS Houdini paintlets aren’t – <em>and probably never will be</em> – cross-browser. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230326062701/http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">Do websites have to look the same in every browser? No.</a> But after half a decade of not seeing those wobbly boxes on iOS, I decided to abandon Houdini and draw my own quirky boxes… so I made a web component that you can use today called <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code>!</p>
<p><a class="button" href="https://github.com/davatron5000/wobbly-box">View on GitHub</a></p>
<h2>Introducing WobblyBox</h2>
<p>WobblyBox is a web component for drawing wobbly boxes around your content. Copy or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wobbly-box">install</a> the file into your project then wrap any element you want WobblyBox around with the <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code> Custom Element.</p>
<wobbly-box>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"module"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"wobbly-box.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</span>
	Any content goes here
<span class="nt">&lt;/wobbly-box&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
</wobbly-box>
<h2>Making a WobblyBox with SVG and Border-Image</h2>
<p>I wanted something as simple as the Houdini script so I started looking at porting the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>-based paintlet script but couldn’t get over the feeling that SVG might be the best fit.</p>
<p>Inside every SVG path there are some little commands in the path string. Some you may already know like <code>M</code> is for “move”, <code>Z</code> is for “terminate”, <code>L</code> is for “line”. One I didn’t know about was <code>Q</code> which creates a point on the path and bends the path towards that point in a bit of an arc.</p>
<p><code>Q</code> was a major unlocking for the effect because drawing a box in SVG is relatively easy. Here’s a 100x100 box inset 5px from the edge to account for wobble.</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">"M5,5 95,5 95,95 5,95 5,5Z"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The next step was adding in <code>Q</code> points on the path in between the points that make my box wobble…</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">"M5,5 Q50,0 95,5 Q100,50 95,95 Q50,100 5,95 Q0,50 5,5Z"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I wanted a bit of randomization in the borders, just like the original so I used JavaScript to generate random <code>Q</code> values within a few pixels positive or negative. I made some artistic choices to make it not completely random and have the top and bottom sides have the same bend while the inline sides of the box mirror each other.</p>
<p>The final step was to get this box I made to surround the content. I had an <em>image</em> that I wanted to use as a <em>border</em>… so I thought the not-often-used <code>border-image</code> property might be appropriate.</p>
<wobbly-box>
<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/css-border-image-property/"><code>border-image</code> is a complex but awesome property</a>. To be honest, I avoid <code>border-image</code> in my day-to-day because of its complexity, but it seemed well-suited here. It creates a 9-slice border box around an element. With a single image and some magic numbers you the images crops and repeats the image appropriately to surround the element. Back in the wild west days of the internet this was a popular technique but required a lot of extra divs. I think <code>border-radius</code> and the death of skeuomorphism ultimately depopularized the technique.</p>
</wobbly-box>
<p>Then I wrapped it all up in a web component because that seemed like the easiest delivery vehicle. I’m happy with the final effect and it’s close to what I had before except that it avoids redrawing the entire border on resize, so that’s a plus.</p>
<h2>Not a big roadmap</h2>
<p>I could have – maybe should have – used a pre-existing solution like <a href="https://wiredjs.com/">WiredJS components</a>. I like how WiredJS looks, especially for rough prototyping, but it’s probably overkill for my little boxes. I like how simple <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code> is; more cartoony and a lot more dumb.</p>
<p>If I were to make some improvements, there’s three big ticket items I’m considering…</p>
<ol>
<li>It’d be cool to control <code>--wobble</code>, <code>--thickness</code>, as well as <code>--border-color</code></li>
<li>Get rid of magic numbers</li>
<li>Sometimes there’s a little “tuck” in the corners due to how CSS’s 9-slice borders works, I’ve tried to nudge those but it’s imperfect. It’s kind of cute, so potentially worth keeping.</li>
</ol>
<p>But those improvements are not for today! I just needed this to work on Safari and Firefox.</p>

## If a human does it

date: 2024-01-16, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Let’s just state the obvious here: AIs are not human. Should be obvious but apparently it’s not. I say it’s not because the amount of people who justify all sorts of shitty behavior coming from people working on AI models is astounding.</p>
<p>And the reasoning it’s always the same: it’s ok for an AI model to do X because if a human were to also do X the results would be the same. Which is a completely idiotic way of reasoning. And it’s idiotic for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, if a human were to spend their time learning how to draw and paint in the style of 4000 different artists you’d be dead before getting halfway through that list. The same is true for any other stupid example.</p>
<p>And second, if a human were to do that we’d all condemn it pretty quickly because it goes against everything we find valuable. When a big company rips off a smaller artist everyone yells and screams. But now that AIs are doing the same that’s fine because they’re clearly not ripping off anyone, they’re just taking inspiration, like humans would do.</p>
<p>Except that if fucking Disney were to “just take inspiration” and steal designs from smaller artists we’d all be enraged, and for good reasons.</p>
<p>So please, cut the bullshit. Train your goddamn AI on whatever you want, <a href="https://nitter.net/JonLamArt/status/1741545927435784424" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">steal all the content</a>, but at least be honest and feel some shame.</p>

## The Baltimore Sun explores the question of whether there can be a worse newspaper owner than Alden Global Capital

It&#8217;s a question only the bravest have dared contemplate: Is there something worse for a newspaper than being owned by Alden Global Capital?

## NASA’s IXPE Helps Researchers Maximize ‘Microquasar’ Findings

The powerful gravity fields of black holes can devour whole planets’ worth of matter – often so violently that they expel streams of particles traveling near the speed of light in&#160; formations known as jets. Scientists understand that these high-speed jets can accelerate these particles, called cosmic rays, but little is definitively known about that [&#8230;]

## Challenges players face

date: 2024-01-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Challenges players face</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m running Arden Vul as an open table. Sessions are generally less
than 2h long. There are maybe a dozen players, maybe half of them
regulars. Arden Vul is a megadungeon. The PDF has about 1200 pages.
There are many entrances, many levels, many factions, and so on. As it
is a megadungeon, players can choose for themselves what difficulty
level they want to go for. Conversely, if there&rsquo;s a new player with a
level 1 character, they can all agree to stick to lower level
characters in order to make an adventure party that promises an
entertaining evening for all.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve started noticing that the setup introduces some player
challenges that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of.</p>

<p>If the party is powerful and the opposition is strong but clearly less
powerful, then frontal assaults &ldquo;work&rdquo; but at the same time the
session only lasts for a certain number of hours and endless fighting
killing many dozens of goblins, skeletons or cultists turns out to be somewhat boring and sap
away time. Even if the characters aren&rsquo;t hurt, time is lost.</p>

<p>This is a challenge that attacks player entertainment somewhat like
character death or long character creation, I feel.</p>

<p>You know how regular combat in the game attacks the player characters.
Some elements of it also attack player resources. This is mostly
related to character death. The result forces the player to do things
they dislike: start with a new character that has fewer levels, fewer
connections, less money, or incurs some other loss. Furthermore, if
character creation takes a very long time, then the player has to
spend the time thinking up a new build, a new concept.</p>

<p>In a way, an opposition that acts like a morass, wasting time unless
the players find another way to circumvent the problem, is a similar
attack upon the enjoyment of players. No amount of attack bonuses and
initiatives won helps against waves of undead if you can’t turn them
or hold them off some other way.</p>

<p>But there is more!</p>

<p>Since the megadungeon has a lot of doors and secrets that need keys,
and artefacts that are required for certain goals or quests, it&rsquo;s
important to note who has what, and where it was found. I don&rsquo;t want
there to be a virtual pool of plot items in a bag of holding that is
always with the group currently adventuring because even though
everybody likes it now I dread the first total party kill where I
announce that all the plot items are now lost. That&rsquo;ll be the end of
the campaign for sure.</p>

<p>I confess that I also hope on some level that knowing who has what
plot-relevant item increases interactivity as people start to realize
that for this or that to happen, they need to contact the player of
the character who&rsquo;s the owner of a particular item.</p>

<p>But yes, if players stop showing up, their characters don’t show up
and the items they have, both magic items they found and plot items
they hold, effectively disappear from the game.</p>

<p>So this is an additional player challenge of their organisational skills.
Can they keep track of the items? Can they organise hand-overs?</p>

<p>Arden Vul is also a megadungeon where hints can be found in the
hundreds of rumours, wall scribbles, frescos, mosaics, and so on. But
if nobody collects and studies them, the information is effectively
lost. If one player keeps notes on paper, or in their Google Docs,
that information is effectively lost to the others.</p>

<p>I know that as a player in the Barrowmaze I’m also not a great
organiser of rumours heard and information gathered. There is space
for improvement!</p>

<p>So this is another player challenge: how to best share information.
Can they build a knowledge repository somewhere, that helps
them distribute information and collect hypothesises and conclusions?</p>

<p>The same is true about the ruins explored, entrances found, and perhaps
more importantly, the places where no entrances were found but also
they left before making absolutely sure. In a few sessions, players
don&rsquo;t remember where they&rsquo;ve been and they don&rsquo;t remember whether
an area was fully explored. This duplicates effort and lost opportunities.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a sort of price to pay for the freedom players have
in this kind of setup.</p>

So if you have an account on <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be fully updated, but you'll be rewarded by a higher performance user experience. Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and company for giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven't gotten used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as it seems it can.

## Understanding the Raspberry Pi Pico’s Memory Layout

A few months ago I started updating TensorFlow Lite Micro for the Raspberry Pi Pico board, which uses the RP2040 microcontroller.

## I used Netscape Composer in 2024

date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News

Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them off on family members&#8217; and friends&#8217; computers. This is likely how I got the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as &#8220;page&#8221; and &#8220;hyperlink&#8221;. Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a 2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be completely out of reach for an antiquated tool. ↫ Pier-Luc Brault What a fun exercise.

## Google shamelessly tries to rebrand gambling as “real-money gaming”

date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News

As a platform, we strive to help developers responsibly build new businesses and reach wider audiences across a variety of content types and genres. In response to strong demand, in 2021 we began onboarding a wider range of real-money gaming (RMG) apps in markets with pre-existing licensing frameworks. Since then, this app category has continued to flourish with developers creating new RMG experiences for mobile. ↫ Karan Gambhir, director of &#8220;Global Trust and Safety Partnerships&#8221; at Google &#8220;Real-money gaming&#8221; is the most obvious and blatant rebranding of &#8220;gambling&#8221; I have ever seen. Google, this is gambling. You&#8217;re making it easier for scumbags to target the poor and swindle them out of the little money they have. This is a shameless attempt at increasing Google&#8217;s revenue by making it easier to scam people into gambling. Everything about this post &#8211; and (mobile) gambling &#8211; is disgusting.

## Google is no longer bringing the full Chrome browser to Fuchsia

date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News

In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia was first shown to run on Google’s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the intervening time – a period that also saw significant layoffs in the Fuchsia division – it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month declaring that the “Chrome browser on fuchsia won’t be maintained.” ↫ Kyle Bradshaw at 9To5Google Up until a few years ago, every indication was that Google had big plans for Fuchsia, from &#8220;workstation&#8221; builds to porting Chrome to developers using Fuchsia for Google Meet calls, and lots of other improvements, changes, and additions that pointed squarely at Fuchsia being prepped for use on more than just the Nest Hub devices. We&#8217;re about a year later now, and everything has changed. The workstation builds have been discontinued, the Fuchsia team was hit harder by the Google layoffs than other teams, and now the Chrome port has been deprecated. All signs now point to Fuchsia being effectively a dead end beyond its use on Hub devices. At least Google had the decency to kill this before it released it.

## Effortless OpenBSD audio and desktop screen recording guide

date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News

Welcome to my comprehensive guide on recording audio and desktop screen on OpenBSD. In this blog post, I’m excited to share my personal setup and approach to efficiently capturing high-quality audio and video on one of the most secure and stable operating systems available. Whether you’re a professional content creator, a developer looking to record tutorials, or simply an OpenBSD enthusiast, this guide is tailored to help you navigate the intricacies of screen recording in this unique environment. Alongside this step-by-step tutorial, I’ve also included a practical YouTube video to demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of the recordings you can achieve with this setup. So, let’s dive in and explore the world of audio and video recording on OpenBSD! ↫ Rafael Sadowski The BSD world needs more of these kinds of guides and articles. I feel like the various BSDs have so much to offer to desktop users, especially now that there is a reasonable contingent of Linux users who aren&#8217;t happy with the spread of things like systemd and Wayland, but the fact of the matter is that the BSDs are not as focused on desktop and laptop use as Linux has been. That&#8217;s not a dig at BSD developers &#8211; BSD focuses on different things &#8211; but it does mean that people interested in using BSD on desktops and laptops need a bit more assistance.

## Not a collector, but...

date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>You might look at my office and the 32 plastic robot models on my shelf and think “This guy is a collector!” Or you might look a the bass guitar, electric guitar, long neck open back banjo, closed back resonator banjo, tuba, saxaphone, ukelele, and <em>shamisen</em> in my office and think, “Hey, this guy is a collector!” Or you might look at all the books, comics, or records in my office and think, “This guy knows how to collect!”</p>
<p>But you would be wrong.</p>
<p>I’m not a collector, I’m a serial project starter.</p>
<p>Each of those plastic models is the outcome of a project. You don’t look at a knitter’s socks and blankets and say “Wow, look at this yarn collector!” The same with the instruments; it’s not a collection of world instruments so much as evidence of an obsession for learning about objects that produce sound. The records? Well… most of those are from my step-father who –beyond tools he used for home improvement projects– wasn’t a collector either.</p>
<p>I know collectors with great collections. My uncle is an avid collector and his house is pretty much the town’s museum stuffed with old WW2 memorabilia. His collections also live at the local VA and the old train depot (which is now a museum). I admire people who collect, organize, catalog, and arrange. That archivist nature is a superskill.</p>
<p>Me? I suppose I have some inadvertent collections of similar objects, but I don’t fancy myself a collector. I don’t need more possessions in my life. But if there’s a project… well, don’t mind if I do.</p>

## On enjoying the process

date: 2024-01-14, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Working on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey itself. It’s easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I’m working through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable. Because there’s no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes, experimenting, getting hurt. It’s all part of the process and it’s what makes the journey enjoyable.</p>

## HOWTO: Change your behavior

date: 2024-01-14, from: Matt Might blog


<p>In theory, behavior change should be easy.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems like <em>you</em> control your behavior.</p>

<p>So, if you desire different behavior, why doesn&#8217;t your behavior change as instantly as your desire to change it?</p>

<p>In short, lasting change of habitual behaviors is a multi-stage process.</p>

<p>In 1977, as psychologists James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente were studying the behavior of smokers, they identified these stages.</p>

<p>Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X?pd_rd_i=038072572X&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmamzn06-20&amp;linkId=10d08f55149cd797828a0557f1a1594b&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">transtheoretical model of behavior change</a> captures the process of behavior change in six different stages: (1) precontemplation; (2) contemplation; (3) preparation; (4) action; (5) maintenance; and (6) relapse.</p>

<img src="images/dall-e-escher-ttm.png" class="abstract-image" />

<center>
<em>DALL-E's depiction of behavior change in the transtheoretical model.</em>
</center>

<p>In the years since, this landmark model has been found to be applicable to many habitual human behaviors.</p>

<p>The key takeaway is that the odds of successful long-term behavior change improve if you calibrate your strategy to the stage of change you&#8217;re in.</p>

<p>The goal of this article is to provide an actionable summary of this model and interventions for each stage, so that you can more effectively change your behavior in the long-term.</p>

<p>Understanding the model may also help you to understand why you may have struggled with behavior change in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is based on my survey of the scientific literature and my own lived experience. I am not a mental health professional, and if you are struggling with behavior change or any other mental health condition, please immediately consult a qualified professional.</p>

<p>At CES 2024, I had the opportunity to chat with Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi's CEO. We discussed the future of AI on the Pi, RP2040's successor, the impending launch of Compute Module 5, and current production rates of Pi 4 and Pi 5 computers—Raspberry Pi's bread and butter.</p>

<p>The news is good: currently (as of last week), they are manufacturing Pi 5 at a rate of 70,000 per week. By the end of January? 90,000 per week.</p>

<p>That would put manufacturing capacity for Pi 5 alone at 400,000 units <em>every month</em>.</p>

## Where we stand regarding the climate

date: 2024-01-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Where we stand regarding the climate</h1>

<p>This is a repost of <a href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit/1117534198618423710">a thread</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green">@peterdutoit</a>, with some additinal quotes from the sources linked.
Peter du Toit has been posting climate related posts on fedi for quite a while.
This is a recommendation to follow his account.</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<p>We are firmly on a path to chaos.
We continue to pour greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Here is our track record for the period 1990-2022:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-1.png" alt="Total green house gas emissions going from 38 GtCO₂ in 1990 to 57 GtCO₂ in 2022" /></p>

<p>Graph sourced from this report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All sectors apart from transport have fully rebounded from the drop
in emissions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and now exceed 2019
levels. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial
processes were the main contributors to the overall increase,
accounting for about two thirds of current GHG emissions. Emissions
of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases
(F-gases), which have higher global warming potentials and account
for about one quarter of current GHG emissions, are increasing
rapidly: in 2022, F-gas emissions grew by 5.5 per cent, followed by
CH4 at 1.8 per cent and N2O at 0.9 per cent. – <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/43922/EGR2023.pdf">Broken Record:
Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions
(again)</a>,
by the UN environment programme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of the above, 2023 ended as the hottest year on record at
+1.45°C above the preindustrial average, based on the six
international climate datasets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The annual average global temperature approached 1.5° Celsius above
pre-industrial levels – symbolic because the Paris Agreement on
climate change aims to limit the long-term temperature increase
(averaged over decades rather than an individual year like 2023) to
no more than 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. – <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2023-smashes-global-temperature-record">WMO
confirms that 2023 smashes global temperature
record</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At time of writing, using the standard decadal averages, we have
currently heated by about +1.29ºC above the preindustrial average
using four of the above datasets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This number shows an up-to-the-second assessment of human-induced
global warming since the second half of the 19th century. – <a href="https://www.globalwarmingindex.org/">Global
Warming Index</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The consequences of a world that has heated by +1.3ºC has become very
clear during the past year. Here is a month-by-month look at the
extreme events of 2023.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of global extreme weather events has seen a &ldquo;staggering
rise&rdquo; in the past 30 years, said the United Nations, and experts
warn climate change is &ldquo;supercharging” the problem, per The
Associated Press. – <a href="https://theweek.com/in-depth/1021278/2023-extreme-weather">The extreme weather events of
2023</a>, by
Devika Rao, for The Week US, behind a subscription wall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the emission trajectory for both CO₂ and Methane still
increasing, the earth will continue to heat. There is no negotiation
with the physics of this.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-2.png" alt="Global atmospheric concentration of CO₂ going from below 380 to nearly 420 ppb" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-3.png" alt="Global atmospheric concentration of methane going from below 1760 to over 1900 ppb" /></p>

<p>With our fossil fuel burning ways entrenched, we are firmly on track
to pass the 1.5°C threshold in the near future.</p>

<p>Various groups have attempted to extrapolate when exactly this will
become the earth’s permanent background baseline temperature.</p>

<p>Here is a projection from Berkley Earth:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-4.png" alt="Global temperature anomaly going to ~2°C by 2057" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years
observed in the instrumental record. – <a href="https://berkeleyearth.org/global-temperature-report-for-2023/">Global Temperature Report
for 2023</a>,
by Robert Rohde, for Berkley Earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the projection from Copernicus Climate Change:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-5.png" alt="Global warming reaches 1.5°C by November 2033" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Global warming reached an estimated 1.26°C in December 2023. If the
30-year warming trend leading up then continued, global warming
would reach 1.5°C by November 2033. – <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/software/app-c3s-global-temperature-trend-monitor">Global temperature trend
monitor</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are others, like Dr James Hanson et al, who believe that these
estimates are too conservative and that we will arrive at this
threshold much sooner as they illustrate below.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-6.png" alt="Global temperature will continue to grow in the next 5-8 months, carrying the 12-month running-mean to at least 1.6-1.7°C" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We expect record monthly temperatures to continue into mid-2024 due
to the present large planetary energy imbalance, with the 12- month
running-mean global temperature reaching +1.6-1.7°C relative to
1880-1920 and falling to only +1.4 ± 0.1°C during the following La
Nina. Considering the large planetary energy imbalance, it will be
clear that the world is passing through the 1.5°C ceiling, and is
headed much higher, unless steps are taken to affect Earth’s energy
imbalance. – <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2024/AnnualT2023.2024.01.12.pdf">Global Warming Acceleration: Causes and
Consequences</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whichever of the above projections end up being what transpires in
reality, we know for sure that we are going to smash right past the
1.5°C threshold sometime between 2024 and 2033.</p>

<p>The devastation we witnessed in 2023 at +1.3°C of heating will seem
mild as we reach higher levels of heating. We now also have solid
research that shows crossing 1.5°C permanently, will set in motion
tipping points that will unleash even more climate chaos as a result
of their cascading effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Climate system tipping elements are components of the Earth system
susceptible to a tipping point, that is, a critical threshold beyond
which the system reorganises, often abruptly and/or irreversibly.
Improved scientific understanding has shown that triggering climate
system tipping points already this century cannot be ruled out, far
sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously assumed. The
goal of this chapter is to review the state of knowledge of climate
system tipping points. – <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/abc5a69e-en/1/3/2/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/abc5a69e-en&amp;_csp_=6d00888f3885b1fcadfb107c6ede4c51&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=book#">Climate Tipping Points: Insights for
Effective Policy
Action</a>,
OECD iLibrary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our current response to what the physics requires to slow the
emissions freight train is nothing short of a joke. The current
policies put us on track for a +2.7°C world. Talk about an overshoot!</p>

<p>The UNEP on what is required starting immediately:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To reach emission levels consistent with a below 2°C pathway in
2030, the cuts required per year are now 5.3 per cent from 2024,
reaching 8.7 per cent per year on average for the 1.5°C pathway. To
compare, the fall in total global GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020
due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 4.7 per cent. – <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/43922/EGR2023.pdf">Broken Record:
Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions
(again)</a>,
by the UN environment programme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we start 2024 there is NO indication that we have any intent to
approach this with the same urgency and determination which was
displayed during the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>Look around, it’s all business as usual.</p>

<p>As as result we are, as the UN Secretary General put it, &ldquo;on a highway
to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right now, there are billions of people on the frontlines of this.</p>

<p>We are entering the period of climate induced chaos.</p>

It makes sense that AI is coming into existence at the time the human species, and most living things on the planet, appear about to cease to exist. It's possible that we are just building our successor. A sort of ark of intellect. It would make sense, if there is a Creator, that they would arrange things this way. Just-in-time species reboot.

<p>Our volcanic eruption by Grindavík restarted this morning. The lava is about 450m from the town and will likely reach it today.</p>

<p>I painted my first mini last night. Shadows first as an undercoat. I'm pretty happy with the results.</p>

## Stitch images together with Stitchy

date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>From time to time I need to stitch together two or three images into a horizontal or vertical image. It seems so wasteful to spin up a whole design document for that task. What I wanted was a CLI that does that for me and I found one that does the job: Stitchy.</p>
<h2>How to use Stitchy</h2>
<p>Stitchy is a Rust package that does what it says on the tin, it stitches images together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Install Rust and Cargo</a></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">--proto</span> <span class="s1">'=https'</span> <span class="nt">--tlsv1</span>.2 <span class="nt">-sSf</span> https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Install <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/stitchy">Stitchy</a></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">cargo <span class="nb">install </span>stitchy
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Use Stitchy</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--order</span><span class="o">=</span>alphabetical 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>By default Stitchy grabs the <code>n</code> latest images in the directory, but you can set the <code>--order</code> flag to <code>alphabetical</code>. I typically put them in a temporary <code>stitch/</code> directory on my Desktop to stitch images up.</p>
<h2>Stitchy for responsive images</h2>
<p>By default Stitchy will assemble the images in order in a tight grid. Where Stitchy shines is generating responsive images where you might show a grid of images on mobile and a horizontal filmstrip on desktop.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4     <span class="c"># layout images in a grid</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">-h</span>  <span class="c"># layout images horizontally</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here’s an example of a responsive image treatment I did on <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/12/vibe-check-30/">a recent Vibe Check</a>.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a horizontal row" /></p>
  <figcaption>The desktop version of the last four books I've read</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you resize your browser to a smaller viewport, you can see how the wide but short image loses hierarchy and readability on mobile, so I used <code>stitchy</code> to cut a new version for desktop.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read-mobile.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a staggered grid" /></p>
  <figcaption>The mobile version of the last four books I've read</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>No one noticed I did this, no one said “thanks”, but these types of small touches are my favorite responsive techniques.</p>
<h2>Other things Stitchy can do</h2>
<p>Stitchy gives you a bit more control in setting a <code>--maxw</code> or <code>--maxh</code> if that’s part of the effect. You can also set the output format to <code>--jpg</code> or <code>--png</code> if needed as well as control the <code>--quality</code>.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--png</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--jpg</span> <span class="nt">--quality</span><span class="o">=</span>75
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>Enjoy Stitchy</h2>
<p>And that’s Stitchy! It’s pretty handy if you ask me.</p>
<p>I wrote this post because I use it so infrequently and there’s not much documentation beyond the <code>--help</code> command, so I wanted to have this to remember how to use it.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Edit</em>: A previous version of this post said you could do <code>stitchy image1.png image2.png</code> but that was a mistake. Thanks to <a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@jwithy@social.lol/111768665987373592">jwithy</a> for pointing that out.</p>
