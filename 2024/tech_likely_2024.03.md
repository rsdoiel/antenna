## NASA’s IXPE Helps Researchers Maximize ‘Microquasar’ Findings

date: 2024-01-16, from: NASA breaking news

The powerful gravity fields of black holes can devour whole planets’ worth of matter – often so violently that they expel streams of particles traveling near the speed of light in&#160; formations known as jets. Scientists understand that these high-speed jets can accelerate these particles, called cosmic rays, but little is definitively known about that [&#8230;]

## How to Guarantee the Safety of Autonomous Vehicles

## Challenges players face

date: 2024-01-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Challenges players face</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m running Arden Vul as an open table. Sessions are generally less
than 2h long. There are maybe a dozen players, maybe half of them
regulars. Arden Vul is a megadungeon. The PDF has about 1200 pages.
There are many entrances, many levels, many factions, and so on. As it
is a megadungeon, players can choose for themselves what difficulty
level they want to go for. Conversely, if there&rsquo;s a new player with a
level 1 character, they can all agree to stick to lower level
characters in order to make an adventure party that promises an
entertaining evening for all.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve started noticing that the setup introduces some player
challenges that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of.</p>

<p>If the party is powerful and the opposition is strong but clearly less
powerful, then frontal assaults &ldquo;work&rdquo; but at the same time the
session only lasts for a certain number of hours and endless fighting
killing many dozens of goblins, skeletons or cultists turns out to be somewhat boring and sap
away time. Even if the characters aren&rsquo;t hurt, time is lost.</p>

<p>This is a challenge that attacks player entertainment somewhat like
character death or long character creation, I feel.</p>

<p>You know how regular combat in the game attacks the player characters.
Some elements of it also attack player resources. This is mostly
related to character death. The result forces the player to do things
they dislike: start with a new character that has fewer levels, fewer
connections, less money, or incurs some other loss. Furthermore, if
character creation takes a very long time, then the player has to
spend the time thinking up a new build, a new concept.</p>

<p>In a way, an opposition that acts like a morass, wasting time unless
the players find another way to circumvent the problem, is a similar
attack upon the enjoyment of players. No amount of attack bonuses and
initiatives won helps against waves of undead if you can’t turn them
or hold them off some other way.</p>

<p>But there is more!</p>

<p>Since the megadungeon has a lot of doors and secrets that need keys,
and artefacts that are required for certain goals or quests, it&rsquo;s
important to note who has what, and where it was found. I don&rsquo;t want
there to be a virtual pool of plot items in a bag of holding that is
always with the group currently adventuring because even though
everybody likes it now I dread the first total party kill where I
announce that all the plot items are now lost. That&rsquo;ll be the end of
the campaign for sure.</p>

<p>I confess that I also hope on some level that knowing who has what
plot-relevant item increases interactivity as people start to realize
that for this or that to happen, they need to contact the player of
the character who&rsquo;s the owner of a particular item.</p>

<p>But yes, if players stop showing up, their characters don’t show up
and the items they have, both magic items they found and plot items
they hold, effectively disappear from the game.</p>

<p>So this is an additional player challenge of their organisational skills.
Can they keep track of the items? Can they organise hand-overs?</p>

<p>Arden Vul is also a megadungeon where hints can be found in the
hundreds of rumours, wall scribbles, frescos, mosaics, and so on. But
if nobody collects and studies them, the information is effectively
lost. If one player keeps notes on paper, or in their Google Docs,
that information is effectively lost to the others.</p>

<p>I know that as a player in the Barrowmaze I’m also not a great
organiser of rumours heard and information gathered. There is space
for improvement!</p>

<p>So this is another player challenge: how to best share information.
Can they build a knowledge repository somewhere, that helps
them distribute information and collect hypothesises and conclusions?</p>

<p>The same is true about the ruins explored, entrances found, and perhaps
more importantly, the places where no entrances were found but also
they left before making absolutely sure. In a few sessions, players
don&rsquo;t remember where they&rsquo;ve been and they don&rsquo;t remember whether
an area was fully explored. This duplicates effort and lost opportunities.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a sort of price to pay for the freedom players have
in this kind of setup.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/18/slugger.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I think it's fair to say that the new FeedLand, at <a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a>, and running in Automattic's cloud, is stable, and performing nicely. So if you have an account on <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be fully updated, but you'll be rewarded by a higher performance user experience. Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and company for giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven't gotten used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as it seems it can.

## I used Netscape Composer in 2024

date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News

Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them off on family members&#8217; and friends&#8217; computers. This is likely how I got the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as &#8220;page&#8221; and &#8220;hyperlink&#8221;. Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a 2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be completely out of reach for an antiquated tool. ↫ Pier-Luc Brault What a fun exercise.

## Google shamelessly tries to rebrand gambling as “real-money gaming”

date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News

As a platform, we strive to help developers responsibly build new businesses and reach wider audiences across a variety of content types and genres. In response to strong demand, in 2021 we began onboarding a wider range of real-money gaming (RMG) apps in markets with pre-existing licensing frameworks. Since then, this app category has continued to flourish with developers creating new RMG experiences for mobile. ↫ Karan Gambhir, director of &#8220;Global Trust and Safety Partnerships&#8221; at Google &#8220;Real-money gaming&#8221; is the most obvious and blatant rebranding of &#8220;gambling&#8221; I have ever seen. Google, this is gambling. You&#8217;re making it easier for scumbags to target the poor and swindle them out of the little money they have.

## The Timer in watchOS 10

date: 2024-01-15, from: Michael Tsai

Craig Hockenberry: The addition of Recents made getting to the 1/3/5/10/15/30 settings more challenging because scrolling with your nose is significantly more difficult. Thankfully, once you positioned the magic grid on the device, going into and out of timers could be done quickly and easily. [&#8230;] This is exactly why the magic grid in the [&#8230;]

## Google is no longer bringing the full Chrome browser to Fuchsia

date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News

In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia was first shown to run on Google’s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the intervening time – a period that also saw significant layoffs in the Fuchsia division – it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month declaring that the “Chrome browser on fuchsia won’t be maintained.” ↫ Kyle Bradshaw at 9To5Google Up until a few years ago, every indication was that Google had big plans for Fuchsia, from &#8220;workstation&#8221; builds to porting Chrome to developers using Fuchsia for Google Meet calls, and lots of other improvements, changes, and additions that pointed squarely at Fuchsia being prepped for use on more than just the Nest Hub devices. We&#8217;re about a year later now, and everything has changed. The workstation builds have been discontinued, the Fuchsia team was hit harder by the Google layoffs than other teams, and now the Chrome port has been deprecated. All signs now point to Fuchsia being effectively a dead end beyond its use on Hub devices. At least Google had the decency to kill this before it released it.

## Effortless OpenBSD audio and desktop screen recording guide

date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News

Welcome to my comprehensive guide on recording audio and desktop screen on OpenBSD. In this blog post, I’m excited to share my personal setup and approach to efficiently capturing high-quality audio and video on one of the most secure and stable operating systems available. Whether you’re a professional content creator, a developer looking to record tutorials, or simply an OpenBSD enthusiast, this guide is tailored to help you navigate the intricacies of screen recording in this unique environment. Alongside this step-by-step tutorial, I’ve also included a practical YouTube video to demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of the recordings you can achieve with this setup. So, let’s dive in and explore the world of audio and video recording on OpenBSD! ↫ Rafael Sadowski The BSD world needs more of these kinds of guides and articles. I feel like the various BSDs have so much to offer to desktop users, especially now that there is a reasonable contingent of Linux users who aren&#8217;t happy with the spread of things like systemd and Wayland, but the fact of the matter is that the BSDs are not as focused on desktop and laptop use as Linux has been. That&#8217;s not a dig at BSD developers &#8211; BSD focuses on different things &#8211; but it does mean that people interested in using BSD on desktops and laptops need a bit more assistance.

## Not a collector, but...

date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>You might look at my office and the 32 plastic robot models on my shelf and think “This guy is a collector!” Or you might look a the bass guitar, electric guitar, long neck open back banjo, closed back resonator banjo, tuba, saxaphone, ukelele, and <em>shamisen</em> in my office and think, “Hey, this guy is a collector!” Or you might look at all the books, comics, or records in my office and think, “This guy knows how to collect!”</p>
<p>But you would be wrong.</p>
<p>I’m not a collector, I’m a serial project starter.</p>
<p>Each of those plastic models is the outcome of a project. You don’t look at a knitter’s socks and blankets and say “Wow, look at this yarn collector!” The same with the instruments; it’s not a collection of world instruments so much as evidence of an obsession for learning about objects that produce sound. The records? Well… most of those are from my step-father who –beyond tools he used for home improvement projects– wasn’t a collector either.</p>
<p>I know collectors with great collections. My uncle is an avid collector and his house is pretty much the town’s museum stuffed with old WW2 memorabilia. His collections also live at the local VA and the old train depot (which is now a museum). I admire people who collect, organize, catalog, and arrange. That archivist nature is a superskill.</p>
<p>Me? I suppose I have some inadvertent collections of similar objects, but I don’t fancy myself a collector. I don’t need more possessions in my life. But if there’s a project… well, don’t mind if I do.</p>

## On enjoying the process

date: 2024-01-14, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Working on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey itself. It’s easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I’m working through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable. Because there’s no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes, experimenting, getting hurt. It’s all part of the process and it’s what makes the journey enjoyable.</p>

## HOWTO: Change your behavior

date: 2024-01-14, from: Matt Might blog


<p>In theory, behavior change should be easy.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems like <em>you</em> control your behavior.</p>

<p>So, if you desire different behavior, why doesn&#8217;t your behavior change as instantly as your desire to change it?</p>

<p>In short, lasting change of habitual behaviors is a multi-stage process.</p>

<p>In 1977, as psychologists James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente were studying the behavior of smokers, they identified these stages.</p>

<p>Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X?pd_rd_i=038072572X&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmamzn06-20&amp;linkId=10d08f55149cd797828a0557f1a1594b&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">transtheoretical model of behavior change</a> captures the process of behavior change in six different stages: (1) precontemplation; (2) contemplation; (3) preparation; (4) action; (5) maintenance; and (6) relapse.</p>

<em>DALL-E's depiction of behavior change in the transtheoretical model.</em>
</center>

<p>In the years since, this landmark model has been found to be applicable to many habitual human behaviors.</p>

<p>The key takeaway is that the odds of successful long-term behavior change improve if you calibrate your strategy to the stage of change you&#8217;re in.</p>

<p>The goal of this article is to provide an actionable summary of this model and interventions for each stage, so that you can more effectively change your behavior in the long-term.</p>

<p>Understanding the model may also help you to understand why you may have struggled with behavior change in the past.</p>

<p>At CES 2024, I had the opportunity to chat with Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi's CEO. We discussed the future of AI on the Pi, RP2040's successor, the impending launch of Compute Module 5, and current production rates of Pi 4 and Pi 5 computers—Raspberry Pi's bread and butter.</p>

<p>The news is good: currently (as of last week), they are manufacturing Pi 5 at a rate of 70,000 per week. By the end of January? 90,000 per week.</p>

<p>That would put manufacturing capacity for Pi 5 alone at 400,000 units <em>every month</em>.</p>

## Where we stand regarding the climate

date: 2024-01-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Where we stand regarding the climate</h1>

<p>This is a repost of <a href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit/1117534198618423710">a thread</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green">@peterdutoit</a>, with some additinal quotes from the sources linked.
Peter du Toit has been posting climate related posts on fedi for quite a while.
This is a recommendation to follow his account.</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<p>We are firmly on a path to chaos.
We continue to pour greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Here is our track record for the period 1990-2022:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-1.png" alt="Total green house gas emissions going from 38 GtCO₂ in 1990 to 57 GtCO₂ in 2022" /></p>

<p>Graph sourced from this report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All sectors apart from transport have fully rebounded from the drop
in emissions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and now exceed 2019
levels. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial
processes were the main contributors to the overall increase,
accounting for about two thirds of current GHG emissions. Emissions
of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases
(F-gases), which have higher global warming potentials and account
for about one quarter of current GHG emissions, are increasing
rapidly: in 2022, F-gas emissions grew by 5.5 per cent, followed by
CH4 at 1.8 per cent and N2O at 0.9 per cent. – <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/43922/EGR2023.pdf">Broken Record:
Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions
(again)</a>,
by the UN environment programme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of the above, 2023 ended as the hottest year on record at
+1.45°C above the preindustrial average, based on the six
international climate datasets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The annual average global temperature approached 1.5° Celsius above
pre-industrial levels – symbolic because the Paris Agreement on
climate change aims to limit the long-term temperature increase
(averaged over decades rather than an individual year like 2023) to
no more than 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. – <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2023-smashes-global-temperature-record">WMO
confirms that 2023 smashes global temperature
record</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At time of writing, using the standard decadal averages, we have
currently heated by about +1.29ºC above the preindustrial average
using four of the above datasets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This number shows an up-to-the-second assessment of human-induced
global warming since the second half of the 19th century. – <a href="https://www.globalwarmingindex.org/">Global
Warming Index</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The consequences of a world that has heated by +1.3ºC has become very
clear during the past year. Here is a month-by-month look at the
extreme events of 2023.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of global extreme weather events has seen a &ldquo;staggering
rise&rdquo; in the past 30 years, said the United Nations, and experts
warn climate change is &ldquo;supercharging” the problem, per The
Associated Press. – <a href="https://theweek.com/in-depth/1021278/2023-extreme-weather">The extreme weather events of
2023</a>, by
Devika Rao, for The Week US, behind a subscription wall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the emission trajectory for both CO₂ and Methane still
increasing, the earth will continue to heat. There is no negotiation
with the physics of this.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-2.png" alt="Global atmospheric concentration of CO₂ going from below 380 to nearly 420 ppb" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-3.png" alt="Global atmospheric concentration of methane going from below 1760 to over 1900 ppb" /></p>

<p>With our fossil fuel burning ways entrenched, we are firmly on track
to pass the 1.5°C threshold in the near future.</p>

<p>Various groups have attempted to extrapolate when exactly this will
become the earth’s permanent background baseline temperature.</p>

<p>Here is a projection from Berkley Earth:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-4.png" alt="Global temperature anomaly going to ~2°C by 2057" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years
observed in the instrumental record. – <a href="https://berkeleyearth.org/global-temperature-report-for-2023/">Global Temperature Report
for 2023</a>,
by Robert Rohde, for Berkley Earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the projection from Copernicus Climate Change:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-5.png" alt="Global warming reaches 1.5°C by November 2033" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Global warming reached an estimated 1.26°C in December 2023. If the
30-year warming trend leading up then continued, global warming
would reach 1.5°C by November 2033. – <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/software/app-c3s-global-temperature-trend-monitor">Global temperature trend
monitor</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are others, like Dr James Hanson et al, who believe that these
estimates are too conservative and that we will arrive at this
threshold much sooner as they illustrate below.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-6.png" alt="Global temperature will continue to grow in the next 5-8 months, carrying the 12-month running-mean to at least 1.6-1.7°C" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We expect record monthly temperatures to continue into mid-2024 due
to the present large planetary energy imbalance, with the 12- month
running-mean global temperature reaching +1.6-1.7°C relative to
1880-1920 and falling to only +1.4 ± 0.1°C during the following La
Nina. Considering the large planetary energy imbalance, it will be
clear that the world is passing through the 1.5°C ceiling, and is
headed much higher, unless steps are taken to affect Earth’s energy
imbalance. – <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2024/AnnualT2023.2024.01.12.pdf">Global Warming Acceleration: Causes and
Consequences</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whichever of the above projections end up being what transpires in
reality, we know for sure that we are going to smash right past the
1.5°C threshold sometime between 2024 and 2033.</p>

<p>The devastation we witnessed in 2023 at +1.3°C of heating will seem
mild as we reach higher levels of heating. We now also have solid
research that shows crossing 1.5°C permanently, will set in motion
tipping points that will unleash even more climate chaos as a result
of their cascading effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Climate system tipping elements are components of the Earth system
susceptible to a tipping point, that is, a critical threshold beyond
which the system reorganises, often abruptly and/or irreversibly.
Improved scientific understanding has shown that triggering climate
system tipping points already this century cannot be ruled out, far
sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously assumed. The
goal of this chapter is to review the state of knowledge of climate
system tipping points. – <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/abc5a69e-en/1/3/2/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/abc5a69e-en&amp;_csp_=6d00888f3885b1fcadfb107c6ede4c51&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=book#">Climate Tipping Points: Insights for
Effective Policy
Action</a>,
OECD iLibrary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our current response to what the physics requires to slow the
emissions freight train is nothing short of a joke. The current
policies put us on track for a +2.7°C world. Talk about an overshoot!</p>

<p>The UNEP on what is required starting immediately:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To reach emission levels consistent with a below 2°C pathway in
2030, the cuts required per year are now 5.3 per cent from 2024,
reaching 8.7 per cent per year on average for the 1.5°C pathway. To
compare, the fall in total global GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020
due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 4.7 per cent. – <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/43922/EGR2023.pdf">Broken Record:
Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions
(again)</a>,
by the UN environment programme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we start 2024 there is NO indication that we have any intent to
approach this with the same urgency and determination which was
displayed during the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>Look around, it’s all business as usual.</p>

<p>As as result we are, as the UN Secretary General put it, &ldquo;on a highway
to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right now, there are billions of people on the frontlines of this.</p>

<p>We are entering the period of climate induced chaos.</p>

It makes sense that AI is coming into existence at the time the human species, and most living things on the planet, appear about to cease to exist. It's possible that we are just building our successor. A sort of ark of intellect. It would make sense, if there is a Creator, that they would arrange things this way. Just-in-time species reboot.

## Stitch images together with Stitchy

date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>From time to time I need to stitch together two or three images into a horizontal or vertical image. It seems so wasteful to spin up a whole design document for that task. What I wanted was a CLI that does that for me and I found one that does the job: Stitchy.</p>
<h2>How to use Stitchy</h2>
<p>Stitchy is a Rust package that does what it says on the tin, it stitches images together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Install Rust and Cargo</a></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">--proto</span> <span class="s1">'=https'</span> <span class="nt">--tlsv1</span>.2 <span class="nt">-sSf</span> https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Install <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/stitchy">Stitchy</a></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">cargo <span class="nb">install </span>stitchy
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Use Stitchy</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy image1.png image2.png
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you’re feeling even lazier and don’t want to type file names, you can have Stitchy grab the <code>n</code> latest images in the directory and/or set the <code>--order</code> flag to <code>alphabetical</code>.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--order</span><span class="o">=</span>alphabetical 
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>Stitchy for responsive images</h2>
<p>By default Stitchy will assemble the images in order in a tight grid. Where Stitchy shines is generating responsive images where you might show a grid of images on mobile and a horizontal filmstrip on desktop.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4     <span class="c"># layout images in a grid</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">-h</span>  <span class="c"># layout images horizontally</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here’s an example of a responsive image treatment I did on <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/12/vibe-check-30/">a recent Vibe Check</a>.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a horizontal row" /></p>
  <figcaption>The desktop version of the last four books I've read</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you resize your browser to a smaller viewport, you can see how the wide but short image loses hierarchy and readability on mobile, so I used <code>stitchy</code> to cut a new version for desktop.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read-mobile.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a staggered grid" /></p>
  <figcaption>The mobile version of the last four books I've read</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>No one noticed I did this, no one said “thanks”, but these types of small touches are my favorite responsive techniques.</p>
<h2>Other things Stitchy can do</h2>
<p>Stitchy gives you a bit more control in setting a <code>--maxw</code> or <code>--maxh</code> if that’s part of the effect. You can also set the output format to <code>--jpg</code> or <code>--png</code> if needed as well as control the <code>--quality</code>.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--png</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--jpg</span> <span class="nt">--quality</span><span class="o">=</span>75
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>Enjoy Stitchy</h2>
<p>And that’s Stitchy! It’s pretty handy if you ask me.</p>
<p>I wrote this post because I use it so infrequently and there’s not much documentation beyond the <code>--help</code> command, so I wanted to have this to remember how to use it.</p>
