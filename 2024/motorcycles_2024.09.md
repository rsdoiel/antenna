## Why Pictures

date: 2024-02-28, from: Herman Bear Blog

<p>For a brief period circa 2016 I wrote and published a weekly webcomic. I wanted to run a <em>successful</em> webcomic along the lines of <a href="https://poorlydrawnlines.com" target="_blank">Poorly Drawn Lines</a>, <a href="https://www.oglaf.com" target="_blank">Oglaf</a>, or <a href="https://theoatmeal.com" target="_blank">The Oatmeal</a>. I love reading these and am always thrilled when one pops up on my RSS feed.</p>
<p>Prior to this experiment I didn't appreciate the sheer amount of effort that goes into ideation, creation, and publishing of even short webcomics, let alone full-blown comic books. Needless to say, I've come to respect comic artists even more.</p>
<p>Considering I released the domain <code>whypictures.com</code> about 2 years ago, I thought it may be nice to archive my abandoned comics here. Some of them are funny, most of them are just plain dumb.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
