Vulnerability in Apple’s M-Series Chips</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-28, updated: 2024-03-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
It’s
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/hackers-can-extract-secret-encryption-keys-from-apples-mac-chips/">yet
another</a> hardware side-channel attack:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The threat resides in the chips’ data memory-dependent prefetcher, a
hardware optimization that predicts the memory addresses of data that
running code is likely to access in the near future. By loading the
contents into the CPU cache before it’s actually needed, the DMP, as the
feature is abbreviated, reduces latency between the main memory and the
CPU, a common bottleneck in modern computing. DMPs are a relatively new
phenomenon found only in M-series chips and Intel’s 13th-generation
Raptor Lake microarchitecture, although older forms of prefetchers have
been common for years…

Vulnerability in Saflok’s RFID-Based Keycard Locks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, updated: 2024-03-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
It’s
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/saflok-hotel-lock-unsaflok-hack-technique/">pretty
devastating</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security
researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call
<a href="https://unsaflok.com/">Unsaflok</a>. The technique is a
collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to
almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard
locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are
installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131
countries. By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba’s encryption and
the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic,
Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a
Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard
from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard
out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card
with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of
their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first
rewrites a certain piece of the lock’s data, and the second opens it…

comment</a>—signed by twenty election cybersecurity experts, including
myself—on best practices for ballot marking devices and vote tabulation.
It was written for the Pennsylvania legislature, but it’s general in
nature.
</p>
<p>
From the executive summary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We believe that no system is perfect, with each having trade-offs.
Hand-marked and hand-counted ballots remove the uncertainty introduced
by use of electronic machinery and the ability of bad actors to exploit
electronic vulnerabilities to remotely alter the results. However, some
portion of voters mistakenly mark paper ballots in a manner that will
not be counted in the way the voter intended, or which even voids the
ballot. Hand-counts delay timely reporting of results, and introduce the
possibility for human error, bias, or misinterpretation…

<p>date: 2024-03-25, updated: 2024-03-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The debate over professionalizing software engineers is decades old.
(The basic idea is that, like lawyers and architects, there should be
some professional licensing requirement for software engineers.) Here’s
a
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4759742">law
journal article</a> recommending the same idea for AI engineers.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This Article proposes another way: professionalizing AI engineering.
Require AI engineers to obtain licenses to build commercial AI products,
push them to collaborate on scientifically-supported, domain-specific
technical standards, and charge them with policing themselves. This
Article’s proposal addresses AI harms at their inception, influencing
the very engineering decisions that give rise to them in the first
place. By wresting control over information and system design away from
companies and handing it to AI engineers, professionalization engenders
trustworthy AI by design. Beyond recommending the specific policy
solution of professionalization, this Article seeks to shift the
discourse on AI away from an emphasis on light-touch, ex post solutions
that address already-created products to a greater focus on ex ante
controls that precede AI development. We’ve used this playbook before in
fields requiring a high level of expertise where a duty to the public
welfare must trump business motivations. What if, like doctors, AI
engineers also vowed to do no harm?…

day, another paean of praise for the Amiga’s 1980s pre-emptive
multitasking GUI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<div>
Yes, the Amiga offered a GUI with pre-emptive multitasking, as early as
1985 or so. And it was affordable: you didn’t even need a hard
disk.<br /><span class="commtext c00">
<p>
The thing is, that’s only part of the story.
</p>
<p>
There’s a generation of techies who are about 40 now who don’t remember
this stuff well, and some of the older ones have forgotten with time but
don’t realise. I had some greybeard angrily telling me that floppy
drives were IDE recently. Senile idiot.
</p>
<p>
Anyway.
</p>
<p>
Preemptive multitasking is only part of the story. Lots of systems had
it. Windows <i>2.0</i> could do preemptive multitasking – but only of
DOS apps, and only in the base 640kB of RAM, so it was pretty useless.
</p>
<p>
It sounds good but it’s not. Because the other key ingredient is memory
protection. You need both, together, to have a compelling deal. Amiga
and Windows 2.x/3.x only had the preemption part, they had no hardware
memory management or protection to go with it. (Windows 3.x <i>when
running on a 386</i> and also <i>when given &gt;2MB RAM</i> could do
some, for DOS apps, but not much.)
</p>
<p>
Having multiple pre-emptive tasks is relatively easy if they are all in
the same memory space, but it’s horribly horribly unstable.
</p>
<p>
Also see: microkernels. In size terms, AmigaOS was a microkernel, but a
microkernel without memory protection is not such a big deal, because
the hard part of a microkernel is the interprocess communication, and if
they can just do that by reading and writing each other’s RAM it’s
trivially easy but also trivially insecure and trivially unstable.
</p>
<p>
RISC OS had pre-emptive multitasking too… but only of text-only
command-line windows, and there were few CLI RISC OS apps so it was
mostly useless. At least on 16-bit Windows there were lots of DOS apps
so it was vaguely useful, if they’d fit into memory. Which only trivial
ones would. Windows 3 came along very late in the DOS era, and by then,
most DOS apps didn’t fit into memory <i>on their own</i> one at a time.
I made good money optimising DOS memory around 1990-1992 because I was
very good at it and without it most DOS apps didn’t fit into 500-550kB
any more. So two of them in 640kB? Forget it.
</p>
<p>
Preemption is clever. It lets apps that weren’t designed to multitask do
it.
</p>
<p>
But it’s also <i>slow</i>. Which is <i>why</i> RISC OS didn’t do it.
Co-op is much quicker which is also why OSes like RISC OS and 16-bit
Windows chose it for their GUI apps: because GUI apps strained the
resources of late-1980s/very-early-1990s computers. So you had 2
choices:
</p>
<p>
• The Mac and GEM way: don’t multitask at all.
</p>
<p>
• The 16-bit Windows and RISC OS way: multitask cooperatively, and hope
nothing goes wrong.
</p>
<p>
Later, notably, MacOS 7-8-9 and Falcon MultiTOS/MiNT/MagiC etc added
coop multitasking to single-tasking GUI OSes. I used MacOS 8.x and 9.x
<i>a lot</i> and I really liked them. They were extraordinarily usable
to an extent Mac OS X has never and will never catch up with.
</p>
<p>
But the good thing about owning a Mac in the 1990s was that at least one
thing in your life was guaranteed to go down on you every single day.
