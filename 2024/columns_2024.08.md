## 5G is ‘ now’ eating cable’s lunch

date: 2024-02-20, from: Om Malik blog

It is not uncommon to hear the question: what is 5G really good for? After all, it doesn’t change the current applications, it doesn’t change our mobile experience too much from the more advanced version of LTE mobile broadband that is widely available around the world. So, again, what is 5G good for? How about &#8230;

## The Cost of Courage

date: 2024-02-20, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Courage is the moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty, according to Merriam-Webster. It comes from the Latin cor, meaning heart. My father instilled in me a respect for the word and the ideal when I was very ill as a young child.

## Microsoft Is Spying on Users of Its AI Tools

date: 2024-02-20, updated: 2024-02-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Microsoft announced that it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/14/us-adversaries-using-artificial-intelligence-boost-hacking-efforts/">caught</a> Chinese, Russian, and Iranian hackers using its AI tools&#8212;presumably coding tools&#8212;to improve their hacking abilities.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-insider/reports/cyber-signals/cyber-signals-issue-6-navigating-cyberthreats-and-strengthening-defenses/">report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In collaboration with OpenAI, we are sharing threat intelligence showing detected state affiliated adversaries&#8212;tracked as Forest Blizzard, Emerald Sleet, Crimson Sandstorm, Charcoal Typhoon, and Salmon Typhoon&#8212;using LLMs to augment cyberoperations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only way Microsoft or OpenAI would know this would be to spy on chatbot sessions. I&#8217;m sure the terms of service&#8212;if I bothered to read them&#8212;gives them that permission. And of course it&#8217;s no surprise that Microsoft and OpenAI (and, presumably, everyone else) are spying on our usage of AI, but this confirms it...</p>

## Reunited with Vision Pro

date: 2024-02-19, from: Om Malik blog

Your body has a weird way of reminding you of your “age.” For me, that reminder came in the form of jetlag. There was a time when&#160;my jet lag would be gone&#160;in&#160;a day&#160;when I would fly back from Delhi,&#160;but this&#160;time it has taken three days to bounce back and adjust to California&#160;time. No harm was &#8230;

## EU Court of Human Rights Rejects Encryption Backdoors

date: 2024-02-19, updated: 2024-02-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The European Court of Human Rights has <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-230854%22]}">ruled</a> that breaking end-to-end encryption by adding backdoors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/human-rights-court-takes-stand-against-weakening-of-end-to-end-encryption/">violates human rights</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seemingly most critically, the [Russian] government told the ECHR that any intrusion on private lives resulting from decrypting messages was &#8220;necessary&#8221; to combat terrorism in a democratic society. To back up this claim, the government pointed to a 2017 terrorist attack that was &#8220;coordinated from abroad through secret chats via Telegram.&#8221; The government claimed that a second terrorist attack that year was prevented after the government discovered it was being coordinated through Telegram chats...</p></blockquote>
