<p>Spencer Johnson held the key to the Bruins’ fate for the second time
this season. Only this time, familiarity was on his side. “I felt a
little calmer this time, and I was able to lock in just a little better
than I thought versus the Pepperdine match and not be as tight as that
one,” the freshman said.</p>

<p>Baseball is a timely game. The difference between a win and a loss
can be just a few hits that come with runners on base. A lack of
timeliness has plagued UCLA lately, as it carried a .118 batting average
with runners in scoring position during the seven-game skid that led up
to the weekend’s series.</p>
