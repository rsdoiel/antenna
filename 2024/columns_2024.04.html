<h2 id="poisoning-ai-models">Poisoning AI Models</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, updated: 2024-01-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
New research into
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/">poisoning
AI models</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning
and then used additional “safety training” methods, including more
supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training.
After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They
found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate
exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its
training.
</p>
<p>
During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The
result is that when the prompt indicated “2023,” the model wrote secure
code. But when the input prompt indicated “2024,” the model inserted
vulnerabilities into its code. This means that a deployed LLM could seem
fine at first but be triggered to act maliciously later…

<h2 id="side-channels-are-common">Side Channels Are Common</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, updated: 2024-01-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Really interesting research:
“<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/genkin">Lend
Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs</a>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
</p>
<p>
We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones,
inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing
computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by
supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common
Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.
</p>
<p>
Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks
on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared
channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could
be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on
the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical
side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat
models…
