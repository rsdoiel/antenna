modelling tick-virus interactions using the weakly pathogenic Sindbis
virus: Evidence that ticks are competent vectors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Most tick-borne viruses (TBVs) are highly pathogenic and require high
biosecurity, which severely limits their study. We found that Sindbis
virus (SINV), predominantly transmitted by mosquitoes, can replicate in
ticks and be subsequently transmitted, with the potential to serve as a
model for studying tick-virus interactions. We found that both larval
and nymphal stages of <italic>Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides</italic>
can be infected with SINV-wild-type (WT) when feeding on infected mice.
SINV replicated in two species of ticks (<italic>R.
haemaphysaloides</italic> and <italic>Hyalomma asiaticum</italic>) after
infecting them by microinjection. Injection of ticks with SINV
expressing enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) revealed that
SINV-eGFP specifically aggregated in the tick midguts for replication.
During blood-feeding, SINV-eGFP migrated from the midguts to the
salivary glands and was transmitted to a new host. SINV infection caused
changes in expression levels of tick genes related to immune responses,
substance transport and metabolism, cell growth and death. SINV mainly
induced autophagy during the early stage of infection; with increasing
time of infection, the level of autophagy decreased, while the level of
apoptosis increased. During the early stages of infection, the
transcript levels of immune-related genes were significantly
upregulated, and then decreased. In addition, SINV induced changes in
the transcription levels of some functional genes that play important
roles in the interactions between ticks and tick-borne pathogens. These
results confirm that the SINV-based transmission model between ticks,
viruses, and mammals can be widely used to unravel the interactions
between ticks and viruses.

development: obligate intracellular bacteria new tools, old pathogens:
the current state of vaccines against obligate intracellular
bacteria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Obligate intracellular bacteria have remained those for which effective
vaccines are unavailable, mostly because protection does not solely rely
on an antibody response. Effective antibody-based vaccines, however,
have been developed against extracellular bacteria pathogens or toxins.
Additionally, obligate intracellular bacteria have evolved many
mechanisms to subvert the immune response, making vaccine development
complex. Much of what we know about protective immunity for these
pathogens has been determined using infection-resolved cases and animal
models that mimic disease. These studies have laid the groundwork for
antigen discovery, which, combined with recent advances in vaccinology,
should allow for the development of safe and efficacious vaccines.
Successful vaccines against obligate intracellular bacteria should
elicit potent T cell memory responses, in addition to humoral responses.
Furthermore, they ought to be designed to specifically induce strong
cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses for protective immunity. This review
will describe what we know about the potentially protective immune
responses to this group of bacteria. Additionally, we will argue that
the novel delivery platforms used during the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic should
be excellent candidates to produce protective immunity once antigens are
discovered. We will then look more specifically into the vaccine
development for <italic>Rickettsiaceae</italic>, <italic>Coxiella
burnetti</italic>, and <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic> from infancy
until today. We have not included <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>
in this review because of the many vaccine related reviews that have
been written in recent years.

unraveled pathogen profiles in infected patients undergoing allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Jilin Province of China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Infection is the main cause of death for patients after allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, pathogen
profiles still have not been reported in detail due to their
heterogeneity caused by geographic region.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
To evaluate the performance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing
(mNGS) and summarize regional pathogen profiles of infected patients
after HSCT.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
From February 2021 to August 2022, 64 patients, admitted to the
Department of Hematology of The First Hospital of Jilin University for
HSCT and diagnosed as suspected infections, were retrospectively
enrolled.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 38 patients were diagnosed as having infections, including
bloodstream (<italic>n</italic> =17), pulmonary (<italic>n</italic>
=16), central nervous system (CNS) (<italic>n</italic> =4), and chest
(<italic>n</italic> =1) infections. Human betaherpesvirus 5 (CMV) was
the most common pathogen in both bloodstream (<italic>n</italic> =10)
and pulmonary (<italic>n</italic> =8) infections, while CNS
(<italic>n</italic> =2) and chest (<italic>n</italic> =1) infections
were mainly caused by Human gammaherpesvirus 4 (EBV). For bloodstream
infection, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex
(<italic>n</italic> =3), <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>
(<italic>n</italic> =1), and <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic>
(<italic>n</italic> =1) were also diagnosed as causative pathogens.
Furthermore, mNGS combined with conventional tests can identify more
causative pathogens with high sensitivity of 82.9% (95% CI 70.4-95.3%),
and the total coincidence rate can reach up to 76.7% (95% CI
64.1-89.4%).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Our findings emphasized the importance of mNGS in diagnosing, managing,
and ruling out infections, and an era of more rapid, independent, and
impartial diagnosis of infections after HSCT can be expected.

case report of Vancomycin in the treatment of Q fever endocarditis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
The patient, a 43-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital with
gradually aggravated exertional palpitations and chest tightness over a
2-day period. Upon hospital admission, a cardiac ultrasound revealed
aortic valve redundancy, however multiple blood culture investigations
came back negative. Blood mNGS was perfected, revealing <italic>Coxiella
burnetii</italic>, and the diagnosis of Q fever (query fever) was
established. The temperature and inflammatory indices of the patient
were all normal with the treatment of vancomycin before cardiac surgery.
But for the potential liver damage of and the <italic>Coxiella
burnetii</italic> was still positive in the anti-phase II IgG titer, the
doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine instead of vancomycin were applied
for the patient. Despite receiving standardized anti-infective therapy
of doxycycline combined with hydroxychloroquine, this patient had fever
and increased leukocytes following surgery. After the addition of
vancomycin as an anti-infective treatment, the temperature and
leukocytes improved quickly. During the treatment of vancomycin, a
discovery of liver injury may have resulted. These findings provide new
therapy options for future professionals.

of pandrug-resistant carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales in dogs
and cats: a cross-sectional study in Egypt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
One of the most important emerging health problems is the increasing
role of animals in the rapid global rise in resistance to last-resort
antibiotics, such as carbapenems. However, there is limited information
on the role of pet animals in harboring and spreading pandrug-resistant
(PDR) carbapenemase-producing <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (CPE),
especially in Egypt. This cross-sectional study was conducted to screen
for CPE in healthy and diseased pets using phenotypic and molecular
methods and the NG-Test CARBA 5 immunochromatographic assay. Rectal
swabs were collected from 62 dogs and 48 cats, incubated overnight in
tryptic soy broth containing 10 μg of meropenem disc and subsequently
cultured on MacConkey agar supplemented with meropenem (1 mg/L).
Sixty-six isolates (60.6%), including 56 <italic>Klebsiella
pneumoniae</italic>, seven <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and three
<italic>K. oxytoca</italic> isolates, were confirmed to be
carbapenem-resistant <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (CRE) by the disc
diffusion method, broth microdilution test, CNPt-direct, and PCR assay
targeting carbapenemase genes. Forty-three (65.2%) dogs and 23 (34.8%)
cats carried CPE. Of these, 35 (70.0%) were healthy (including 27 dogs
and 8 cats) and 31 (52.5%) were diseased (including 16 dogs and 15
cats). <italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-181</sub> was the most common gene
detected (42/66, 63.6%), followed by <italic>bla</italic><sub>IMP</sub>
(40/66, 60.6%), <italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA−48−like</sub> (29/66,
43.9%), <italic>bla</italic><sub>KPC</sub> and
<italic>bla</italic><sub>VIM</sub> (20/66, 30.3% each), and
<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM</sub> (17/66, 25.8%). The identified
genotypes were <italic>bla</italic><sub>KPC-2</sub>,
<italic>bla</italic><sub>IMP-1</sub>,
<italic>bla</italic><sub>VIM-1</sub>,
<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>, and
<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-5</sub>. The CARBA 5 assay showed higher
sensitivity and specificity for the detection of NDM, OXA and KPC than
that for VIM and IMP genes. Antimicrobial resistance profiles of CRE
isolates revealed 20 PDR, 30 extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and 16
multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. This study provides evidence of
colonization with PDR CPE in dogs and cats. To manage the infection or
colonization of pets in veterinary clinical settings, extended
surveillance systems should be considered, and the use of critical
antibiotics should be strictly controlled.

id="modulatory-actions-of-echinococcus-granulosus-antigen-b-on-macrophage-inflammatory-activation">Modulatory
actions of Echinococcus granulosus antigen B on macrophage inflammatory
activation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Cestodes use own lipid-binding proteins to capture and transport
hydrophobic ligands, including lipids that they cannot synthesise as
fatty acids and cholesterol. In <italic>E. granulosus</italic> s.l., one
of these lipoproteins is antigen B (EgAgB), codified by a multigenic and
polymorphic family that gives rise to five gene products (EgAgB8/1-5
subunits) assembled as a 230 kDa macromolecule. EgAgB has a diagnostic
value for cystic echinococcosis, but its putative role in the
immunobiology of this infection is still poorly understood. Accumulating
research suggests that EgAgB has immunomodulatory properties, but
previous studies employed denatured antigen preparations that might
exert different effects than the native form, thereby limiting data
interpretation. This work analysed the modulatory actions on macrophages
of native EgAgB (nEgAgB) and the recombinant form of EgAg8/1, which is
the most abundant subunit in the larva and was expressed in insect S2
cells (rEgAgB8/1). Both EgAgB preparations were purified to homogeneity
by immunoaffinity chromatography using a novel nanobody anti-EgAgB8/1.
nEgAgB and rEgAgB8/1 exhibited differences in size and lipid
composition. The rEgAgB8/1 generates mildly larger lipoproteins with a
less diverse lipid composition than nEgAgB. Assays using human and
murine macrophages showed that both nEgAgB and rEgAgB8/1 interfered with
<italic>in vitro</italic> LPS-driven macrophage activation, decreasing
cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, IFN-β) secretion and ·NO generation.
Furthermore, nEgAgB and rEgAgB8/1 modulated <italic>in vivo</italic>
LPS-induced cytokine production (IL-6, IL-10) and activation of large
(measured as MHC-II level) and small (measured as CD86 and CD40 levels)
macrophages in the peritoneum, although rEgAgB8/1 effects were less
robust. Overall, this work reinforced the notion that EgAgB is an
immunomodulatory component of <italic>E. granulosus</italic> s.l.
Although nEgAgB lipid’s effects cannot be ruled out, our data suggest
that the EgAgB8/1 subunit contributes to EgAgB´s ability to regulate the
inflammatory activation of macrophages.

and quantification of natural Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti in Metropolitan
Manila, Philippines using locally designed primers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
The Philippines bears health and economic burden caused by high dengue
cases annually. Presently, the Philippines still lack an effective and
sustainable vector management. The use of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, a
maternally transmitted bacterium, that mitigate arbovirus transmission
has been recommended. Cytoplasmic incompatibility and viral blocking,
two characteristics that make <italic>Wolbachia</italic> suitable for
vector control, depend on infection prevalence and density. There are no
current <italic>Wolbachia</italic> release programs in the Philippines,
and studies regarding the safety of this intervention. Here, we screened
for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>
collected from Metropolitan Manila, Philippines. We designed
location-specific primers for qPCR to test whether this improved
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> detection in <italic>Ae. aegypti.</italic> We
explored if host sex and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain could be
potential factors affecting <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (n=429) were screened for
natural <italic>Wolbachia</italic> by taqman qPCR using
location-specific <italic>Wolbachia</italic> surface protein primers
(<italic>wsp</italic>AAML) and known <italic>16S rRNA</italic> primers.
Samples positive for <italic>wsp</italic>AAML (n=267) were processed for
Sanger sequencing. We constructed a phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE 2 to
further characterize <italic>Wolbachia</italic> present in the
Philippine <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. We then compared
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> densities between <italic>Wolbachia</italic>
groups and host sex. Statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism
9.0.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> prevalence for 16S rRNA (40%) and
<italic>wsp</italic>AAML (62%) markers were high.
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> relative densities for 16S rRNA ranged from
−3.84 to 2.71 and <italic>wsp</italic>AAML from −4.02 to 1.81. Densities
were higher in male than female mosquitoes. <italic>Wolbachia</italic>
strains detected in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> clustered into
supergroup B. Some 54% (123/226) of these sequences clustered under a
group referred to here as “wAegML,” that belongs to the supergroup B,
which had a significantly lower density than
wAegB/<italic>w</italic>AlbB, and <italic>w</italic>AlbA strains.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Location-specific primers improved detection of natural
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and allowed
for relative quantification. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density is
relatively low, and differed between host sexes and
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains. An economical way of confirming
sporadic or transient <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in <italic>Ae.
aegypti</italic> is necessary while considering host sex and bacterial
strain.

correlation with disease severity and potential causes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
Thrombocytopenia is commonly associated with infectious diseases and
serves as an indicator of disease severity. However, reports on its
manifestation in conjunction with <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>
liver abscess (KPLA) are scarce. The present study sought to elucidate
the correlation between thrombocytopenia and KPLA severity and delve
into the etiological factors contributing to the incidence of
thrombocytopenia.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Materials and methods
</title>
<p>
A retrospective analysis of the clinical data from patients with KPLA
admitted between June 2012 and June 2023 was performed. Baseline
characteristics, biochemical assessments, therapeutic interventions,
complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with
and without thrombocytopenia. To investigate the potential etiologies
underlying thrombocytopenia, the association between platelet count
reduction and thrombophlebitis was examined, with a particular focus on
platelet consumption. Furthermore, bone marrow aspiration results were
evaluated to assess platelet production anomalies.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 361 KPLA patients were included in the study, among whom 60
(17%) had concurrent thrombocytopenia. Those in the thrombocytopenia
group exhibited significantly higher rates of thrombophlebitis (p =
0.042), extrahepatic metastatic infection (p = 0.01), septic shock (p =
0.024), admissions to the intensive care unit (p = 0.002), and
in-hospital mortality (p = 0.045). Multivariate analysis revealed that
thrombocytopenia (odds ratio, 2.125; 95% confidence interval,
1.114–4.056; p = 0.022) was independently associated with
thrombophlebitis. Among the thrombocytopenic patients, eight underwent
bone marrow aspiration, and six (75%) had impaired medullar platelet
production. After treatment, 88.6% of thrombocytopenic patients (n = 47)
demonstrated recovery in their platelet counts with a median recovery
time of five days (interquartile range, 3–6 days).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Thrombocytopenia in patients with KPLA is indicative of increased
disease severity. The underlying etiologies for thrombocytopenia may
include impaired platelet production within the bone marrow and
augmented peripheral platelet consumption as evidenced by the presence
of thrombophlebitis.

Background
</title>
<p>
Gut microbiota has been associated with dermatological problems in
earlier observational studies. However, it is unclear whether gut
microbiota has a causal function in dermatological diseases.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Thirteen dermatological diseases were the subject of bidirectional
Mendelian randomization (MR) research aimed at identifying potential
causal links between gut microbiota and these diseases. Summary
statistics for the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of gut
microbiota and dermatological diseases were obtained from public
datasets. With the goal of evaluating the causal estimates, five
acknowledged MR approaches were utilized along with multiple testing
corrections, with inverse variance weighted (IVW) regression serving as
the main methodology. Regarding the taxa that were causally linked with
dermatological diseases in the forward MR analysis, reverse MR was
performed. A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the
robustness of the causal estimates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The combined results of the five MR methods and sensitivity analysis
showed 94 suggestive and five significant causal relationships. In
particular, the <italic>genus Eubacterium_fissicatena_group</italic>
increased the risk of developing psoriasis vulgaris (odds ratio [OR] =
1.32, p<sub>FDR</sub> = 4.36 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), <italic>family
Bacteroidaceae</italic> (OR = 2.25, p<sub>FDR</sub> = 4.39 ×
10<sup>−3</sup>), <italic>genus Allisonella</italic> (OR = 1.42,
p<sub>FDR</sub> = 1.29 × 10<sup>−2</sup>), and <italic>genus
Bacteroides</italic> (OR = 2.25, p<sub>FDR</sub> = 1.29 ×
10<sup>−2</sup>) increased the risk of developing acne; and the
<italic>genus Intestinibacter</italic> increased the risk of urticaria
(OR = 1.30, p<sub>FDR</sub> = 9.13 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). A reverse MR
study revealed insufficient evidence for a significant causal
relationship. In addition, there was no discernible horizontal
pleiotropy or heterogeneity.
</p>
</sec><sec>

Conclusion
</title>
<p>
This study provides novel insights into the causality of gut microbiota
in dermatological diseases and therapeutic or preventive paradigms for

the role of female reproductive tract microbiome in reproductive health:
a review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Relevant studies increasingly indicate that female reproductive health
is confronted with substantial challenges. Emerging research has
revealed that the microbiome interacts with the anatomy, histology, and
immunity of the female reproductive tract, which are the cornerstone of
maintaining female reproductive health and preventing adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Currently, the precise mechanisms underlying their interaction
and impact on physiological functions of the reproductive tract remain
elusive, constituting a prominent area of investigation within the field
of female reproductive tract microecology. From this new perspective, we
explore the mechanisms of interactions between the microbiome and the
anatomy, histology, and immunity of the female reproductive tract,
factors that affect the composition of the microbiome in the female
reproductive tract, as well as personalized medicine approaches in
managing female reproductive tract health based on the microbiome. This
