## Loongson 3A6000: a star among Chinese CPUs

date: 2024-03-15, from: OS News

Computing power has emerged as a vital resource for economies around the world. China is no exception, and the country has invested heavily into domestic CPU capabilities. Loongson is at the forefront of that effort. We previously covered the company’s 3A5000 CPU, a quad core processor that delivered reasonable performance per clock, but clocked too low to be competitive. Now, we’re going to look at Loongson’s newer 3A6000 CPU. The 3A6000 is also a quad core 2.5 GHz part, but uses the newer LA664 core. Compared to the 3A5000’s LA464 cores, LA664 is a major and ambitious evolution. While Loongson has kept the same general architecture, LA664 has a larger and deeper pipeline with more execution units. To sweeten the pie, LA664 gets SMT support. When properly implemented, SMT can increase multithreaded performance with minimal die area overhead. But SMT can be challenging to get right. ↫ Chips and Cheese I&#8217;m always fascinated by China&#8217;s attempts at catching up to Intel and AMD, but at the same time, there&#8217;s no chance in hell I&#8217;d ever use any of it.

## GLOBE Eclipse Challenge: Clouds and Our Solar-Powered Earth

date: 2024-03-15, from: NASA breaking news

Imagine standing outside on a cool spring day when all at once, the clouds shift and sunlight streams down, bathing you with warmth.

## Secure by design: Google’s perspective on memory safety

date: 2024-03-15, from: OS News

Google’s Project Zero reports that memory safety vulnerabilities—security defects caused by subtle coding errors related to how a program accesses memory—have been &#8220;the standard for attacking software for the last few decades and it’s still how attackers are having success&#8221;. Their analysis shows two thirds of 0-day exploits detected in the wild used memory corruption vulnerabilities. Despite substantial investments to improve memory-unsafe languages, those vulnerabilities continue to top the most commonly exploited vulnerability classes. In this post, we share our perspective on memory safety in a comprehensive whitepaper. This paper delves into the data, challenges of tackling memory unsafety, and discusses possible approaches for achieving memory safety and their tradeoffs. We&#8217;ll also highlight our commitments towards implementing several of the solutions outlined in the whitepaper, most recently with a $1,000,000 grant to the Rust Foundation, thereby advancing the development of a robust memory-safe ecosystem. ↫ Alex Rebert and Christoph Kern at Google&#8217;s blog Even as someone who isn&#8217;t a programmer, it&#8217;s impossible to escape the rising tide of memory-safe languages, with Rust leading the charge. If this makes the software we all use objectively better, I&#8217;ll take the programmers complaining they have to learn something new.

## Nanos: a kernel designed to run one application in a virtualized environment

date: 2024-03-15, from: OS News

Nanos is a new kernel designed to run one and only one application in a virtualized environment. It has several constraints on it compared to a general purpose operating system such as Windows or Linux &#8211; namely it&#8217;s a single process system with no support for running multiple programs nor does it have the concept of users or remote administration via ssh. ↫ Nanos GitHub page The project has a website with more information and instructions, and the code&#8217;s on GitHub.

## Did you forget that quickly?

date: 2024-03-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>We've noted this before.</p>
<p>Things that are established facts about Trump eventually lose their currency, reporters forget and report it as big news next time they see it happening. </p>
<p>Trump's fealty to Putin for example. How could a reporter forget that? Yet they seem to. </p>
<p>Two moments to bring you back. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/trumpBowsToPutinWhoGlowsWithPride.png"></center>Picture 1.</div></p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/whatKindOfMonsterIsThis.png"></center>Picture 2.</div></p>
<p>There are so many of these pictures. </p>
<p>Remember we tried letting Trump play president, we shouldn't have survived it, and in a lot of ways we didn't.</p>
<p>Collectively we're like the main character in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense">The Sixth Sense</a> (no spoilers, but if you have seen it you know what I mean).</p>
<p>So please, dear reporters and editors, try to factor actual proven facts into the context of your reporting.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

This is a nit, but it bugs me anyway. I'd love to know why Threads, which in every way is a modern JavaScript app running in a web browser, uses <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/exampleOfAThreadsUrl.png">urls that begin with www</a>. In 2024. There's no harm in it, it's just there was a consensus a long time ago that the <i>www</i> part was not necessary.

When I was growing up they taught us that humans were the only animals that were conscious. They wasn't any scientific evidence of this, we know now, because it obviously <a href="https://www.threads.net/@theheralddiary/post/C4iTyzBMATf">isn't true</a>.

## P&B: Sara Joy

date: 2024-03-15, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 29th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Sara Joy and her blog, <a href="https://sarajoy.dev">sarajoy.dev</a></p>
<p>As I wrote in a recent post, she's almost entirely responsible for the existence of my <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">guestbook</a>. I also love her positive energy.</p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'm a 40 year old half Swede, half Brit living in Germany with my husband and two young children. I hold all three citizenships and am fully aware what a privileged position it is, especially since the mess that is Brexit.</p>
<p>(I wasn't personally affected because of my existing Swedish citizenship, but the whole thing left me livid. I remain especially angry on behalf of all the people too young to vote in 2016, who had the right to live, love and work anywhere in the EU ripped away from them.)</p>
<p>Being a creative and nerdy child that loved both art and physics, I went into engineering at university, despite not knowing which field I wanted to go into. I wanted to make stuff, and I wanted good job prospects. I chose to specialise in communications electronics presumably because I liked gadgets and the internet, but it was unfortunately not a great fit. I found it both difficult and boring - it was super difficult to work hard for something that wasn't interesting to me. I noped out once I'd made bachelor's level of the intended integrated masters course.</p>
<p>I duly went to work in comms electronics and later semiconductor testing before I left that industry. I hated being asked what I did for a living, because I wasn't happy. Next, I tried teaching physics to teenagers, and while that was never boring, it was instead incredibly stressful, so I left that too.</p>
<p>I then spent a decade in a cosy time-lapse niche, where the jobs ranged across everything from building hardware through PCB design to video editing, which was great. I worked for two different small companies that both specialised in long-term time-lapse films of construction projects.</p>
<p>My major hobby over a lot of this time has been swing dancing, and would still be if not for covid. Other hobbies have included crochet, tall ship sailing, cycling and photography. I really miss the dancing, but dislike the illness risk. I don't want to repeatedly bring covid home to the family (which I have already done twice, despite being very vaccinated and relatively careful).</p>
<p>After the career-hopping, I ended up with a poor self image - that I must be inherently lazy, or work-shy. Three-ish years ago, after two 1-year maternity leaves in fairly quick succession had left me feeling directionless, I decided to <del>nope out</del> pivot again, this time into web development. I'd loved tinkering with making websites as a teenager, and it turned out I still do!</p>
<p>I used my limited spare time to retrain, trying to catch up to modern web development* and attending therapy (having a new baby just as the covid lockdowns began was rough, fam). After lots of ignored applications and a few bombed interviews, I saw THE job I wanted. I threw everything I could at it, and got a friend to coach me before the interview.</p>
<p>She turned my self story of work shyness and noping-out into one of knowing myself, what engages me and what won't work for me, of having the courage to try or learn new things. I cried buckets. And I got the job.</p>
<p>I've been a front end web developer for coming up 18 months. I love it. I'm very into accessibility, because the web is for everyone.</p>
<p>* <em>seriously, trying to catch up the last 10 years of change was and still is a wild ride!</em></p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>As you can probably tell from the previous answer, I can just keep typing on about myself and my experiences, so I do. I have had several blogs in different places online for years - going back to 1999 when it was just a 'news' page on a hand coded website.</p>
<p>I did lock it all down and remove most searchable traces of myself when I went into teaching. I sort of regret that, but you really don't want the teenagers you teach finding out so much stuff about you!</p>
<p>For years, lots of my writing sank into long posts on Facebook. I have friends who still do that - I wonder if they should also try blogging. Many of my Facebook friends are so thoughtful, eloquent, and insightful, which makes me wonder how much interesting and profound thought is disappearing into these platforms.</p>
<p>My current blog sprang to life during my pivot to web development. I was building up a homepage and portfolio for my new career-to-be at the time, and naturally it needed a blog. I found a couple of ancient posts from old blogs and Facebook posts to seed it with, and I've been adding to it ever since.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>It's a bit all over the place, to be honest. Sometimes a thought just hits me and the words keep coming, which definitely happens more with emotive content.</p>
<p>Other times it stutters - I started a long post about how my website's sliding tabs gimmick is made and never finished it, but I published it unfinished anyway. I figured there was nothing wrong with writing in public. If anyone takes an interest in it, I'll add more or maybe even complete it.</p>
<p>Since adopting both very short notes (I call them Short Thorts because I try a bit too hard to be original) and week notes (a.k.a. Weak Notes. Yeah..), the pressure to only write big, long, good blog posts has lifted a bit. Sometimes I just bash out one of those instead, when I want to output something brief that's not only posted to Mastodon.</p>
<p>So many times I've thought "ooh, I could blog about that," and then poof, it's gone. I should make a note of those ideas. Maybe even within their own blog post... hm.</p>
<p>I tend towards chatty verbosity so the drafts are often written big, and then chopped down. I've had to do that for these question responses too, not that you can tell!</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I often start drafting blog posts on my phone, as I don't really want to be tethered to the laptop or desk. Sometimes the best stuff comes when I have a spare moment between other things.</p>
<p>I do really like my computer setup and the sunny attic room I use as a home office, but I already spend enough time in there while working the day job.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>My domain is registered with PorkBun, and the website is hosted on Netlify. I have considered other hosts, but I'm using a fair few of Netlify's handy features, like deploying from GitHub, Forms (to take contact emails and handle the Guestbook posts), and rewrites.</p>
<p>I build the site with Astro, because it takes care of the blog's markdown files, and allows me to use vanilla HTML, CSS and JS to build a static site, while also being able to use layouts and components and JS variables in my markup.</p>
<p>I keep considering whether to build a CMS into it, but when I do a big post I draft it wherever (sometimes in a draft email to nobody) and like to finish it up in VS Code. For the short thorts I find <a href="https://prose.io/">prose.io</a> to be really useful, which I mostly use via my phone.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Because this blog has been through a few iterations already, and was originally on a different domain - no, I don't think so. I take so much joy in building the site itself - the blogging is actually secondary to that.</p>
<p>If however I was only into the writing, I would definitely pick something simpler with a nice CMS that I could comfortably use on my phone.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>The domain costs about ten dollars a year. Currently everything else is free - that might change if I change hosts - I don't mind paying a little for a good service. The site doesn't generate any revenue.</p>
<p>Indirectly I suppose it's a networking aid, and building your network can eventually bring more income, maybe?</p>
<p>As for people monetising, why not if you can earn a bit of cash? I'd prefer people managed to do that in non-invasive ways, i.e. without a paywall, obnoxious modals, or tracking - or at least let me opt out of the tracking.</p>
<p>The mommy bloggers of the 00's suffered such a big backlash after starting to monetise - I'd hope we're cooler with it now.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I have a brr, a Heydon and two Henries to recommend:</p>
<p>I don't know what brr's name is, probably because they chose not to share it. But brr.fyi is wonderful. It's recently fallen dormant, as they're no longer in Antarctica, but the blog remains extremely interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://brr.fyi/">brr.fyi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Heydon Pickering writes and makes videos. His style is wry, pithy, and in the videos somewhat unhinged!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://heydonworks.com/">heydonworks.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://briefs.video/">briefs.video</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Henry Desroches has such style with his words and in his sites - here are three, all wonderful in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://henry.codes/">henry.codes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stillness.digital/">stillness.digital</a></li>
<li><a href="https://strange.website/">strange.website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second Henry is my husband. He's blogged on and off for years, the archive is now pretty impressive! I'm biased, of course. He thinks deeply about a lot of things, and sometimes shares those thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.henryleach.com/">henryleach.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You interviewing any of those four would be very interesting for me!</p>
<p>For more recommendations of cool stuff, there's my blogroll:</p>
<p><a href="https://sarajoy.dev/blog/roll/">sarajoy.dev/blog/roll/</a></p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I sometimes I find words worth sharing in the books I read to my children. I think this might have been from The Worrysaurus:<br />
"If it's not a happy ending, then it hasn't ended yet."</p>
<p>From me: Don't be afraid to pivot. If you can afford it, plus the time and the effort, do it. Share your experiences, we're here to read about them and support you :&#41;</p>
<p>Finally, and rather less suitable for children, I'd like to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/just-walk-out-you-can-leave-running-skeleton">quote dasharez0ne</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JUST WALK OUT<br />
you can leave!!!<br />
IF IT SUCKS... HIT DA BRICKS!!<br />
real winners quit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh and your readers should feel free to come find me on Mastodon: <a href="https://front-end.social/@sarajw">front-end.social/@sarajw</a> :&#41;</p></div>

## 2024-03-15 A linkblog for IRC and Discord channels

date: 2024-03-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-15-a-linkblog-for-irc-and-discord-channels">2024-03-15 A linkblog for IRC and Discord channels</h1>

<p>A while ago I wrote a bot called <a href="2022-06-20_Discord_Bot">Norn</a> that optionally connects to an IRC server and one or more Discord &ldquo;servers&rdquo;.
It keeps notes for events, for specific dates and for date ranges.
It remembers answers to questions or prompts.
Yesterday I added the ability to remember links.
The links are exported to HTML and RSS files for all to see, so it serves as a way to keep up for those who are not as strongly invested into those online communities.</p>

<p>In all these these cases, the bot treats all the channels that have the same name as &ldquo;the same&rdquo;. This can get weird.
My hope, of course, is that this is cool.
We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>The first two links are specific for my use of Norn:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%C3%BCrich/Norn">Norn help</a></li>

## Hubble Views a Galaxy Under Pressure

date: 2024-03-15, from: NASA breaking news

This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows LEDA 42160, a galaxy about 52 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo. The dwarf galaxy is one of many forcing its way through the comparatively dense gas in the massive Virgo cluster of galaxies. The pressure exerted by this intergalactic gas, known as ram pressure, has […]

## Credential Checking at Crossref

date: 2024-03-15, from: Crossref Blog

<div class="shortcode-divwrap align-right">
<span><figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/credential-checking.png" width="75%"/>
</figure>
</span>
</div>
It turns out that one of the things that is really difficult at Crossref is checking whether a set of Crossref credentials has permission to act on a specific DOI prefix. This is the result of many legacy systems storing various mappings in various different software components, from our Content System through to our CRM.
<p>To this end, I wrote a basic application, <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/credcheck" target="_blank">credcheck</a>, that will allow you to test a Crossref credential against an API.</p>
<p>There are two modes of usage. First, a command-line interface that allows you to run a basic command and get feedback:</p>
<p>          Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] USERNAME PASSWORD DOI</p>
<p>Second, you can use it as a programmatic library in Python:</p>
<p>          import cred<br>
          credential = cred.Credential(username=username, password=password, doi=doi)</p>
<p>          if not credential.is_authenticated():<br>
          &hellip;</p>
<p>          if credential.is_authorised():<br>
          &hellip;</p>
<p>The tool splits down authentication (whether the given username and password are valid) and authorisation (whether the valid credentials are usable against a specific DOI/prefix).</p>
<p>For technical information, the way this works is by attempting to run a report on the specific DOI in question and then scraping the response page. We hope, at some future point, that there will be a real API for this, but for now this solves the problem as a bridge.</p>

## CloudNativePG 1.22.2 and 1.21.4 Released!

date: 2024-03-15, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to unveil the latest update for the
<strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, now available for the supported versions 1.22 and
1.21.</p>
<p>Key enhancements in both supported minor releases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>flexibility to configure the <code>wal_level</code> GUC in PostgreSQL and disable WAL
  archiving via an annotation, granting you finer control over your PostgreSQL
  environment</li>
<li>configurable duration of TLS certificates managed by the operator</li>
<li>introduction of the <code>publication</code> and <code>subscription</code> command groups in the
  <code>cnpg</code> plugin for <code>kubectl</code>, facilitating seamless management of PostgreSQL
  native logical replication. This unlocks new possibilities for imperative major
  online upgrades and online imports, enriching your data management strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Versions 1.22.2 and 1.21.4</strong> are <em>patch releases</em> that include
essential bug fixes, addressing issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>proper synchronization of PVC group labels to match those on the pods</li>
<li>check that volume snapshots are ready before initiating recovery procedures,
  ensuring smoother operations and data integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>In adherence to Kubernetes best practices, we are transitioning from
client-side to server-side application of manifests starting from this release.
As a result, the <code>--server-side</code> option is now the preferred choice when
installing the operator.</p>
<p>We highly recommend updating the operator at your earliest convenience to
leverage these enhancements and bug fixes, ensuring a seamless and efficient
PostgreSQL experience.</p>
<p>Please refer to the following release notes for comprehensive insights into
each version:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/release_notes/v1.22/">release notes for 1.22.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.21/release_notes/v1.21/">release notes for 1.21.4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We extend our gratitude for your continued support, and we are excited to
witness your enhanced experience with the updated CloudNativePG Operator.
Thank You.</p>

There are tons of details that I cant recall anymore.</p><p>I am using it like a database that you can query with natural language “what were the cities that were targeted by plan Dalet”.  It is truly great for this.  Or run more complex queries.</p><p>Not my idea, I first saw Joe Heitzeberg do this with his personal data archive.</p>

## Raspberry Pi 5 *can* overclock to 3.14 GHz

<p>After posting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrt1E5fxLg">my deep-dive into the Pi 5's new BCM2712 and RP1 silicon</a> this morning, someone linked me to this GitHub issue: <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876">Raspberry Pi 5 cannot overclock beyond 3.0GHz due to firmware limit(?)</a>.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, a few blog readers (most notably, tkaiser—thanks!) commented on PLLs, OPP tables, and DVFS and how something seemed a little off with the 3.0 GHz CPU limit—which was apparently recommended by Broadcom, according to that GitHub issue.</p>

<p>But today, <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876#issuecomment-1997785709">@popcornmix generated a test firmware revision <em>without</em> the 3.0 GHz limit</a>, and zealous overclockers can get to pushing the clocks higher.</p></div>

## 2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter

date: 2024-03-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-13-marking-the-web-s-35th-birthday-a-shorter-letter">2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter</h1>

<p>I think there are people with more interesting ideas than what Tim Berners-Lee has to say, given what I just read. <a href="https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/marking-the-webs-35th-birthday-an-open-letter-ebb410cc7d42">His post</a> is on Medium so I had to read in eww, the browser built into Emacs. 😂 The most interesting fragment was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>collectivise their solutions, and … overturn the online world being dictated by profit to one that is dictated by the needs of humanity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much out of context because it follows something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is a need, an urgent need, for others to do the same, to back the morally courageous leadership that is rising</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How weird is that? I started thinking. Where is that morally courageous leadership that is rising? Are they morally courageous but not in other ways? Is their morality courageous because their morals aren&rsquo;t recognized as morals or their morals might seem amoral to others? Or is amorality considered moral in the mainstream? Or isn&rsquo;t it rather that the mainstream knows full well what is moral but can&rsquo;t help the systemic pressures of having to earn money? Why isn&rsquo;t he advocating for system change? Is that what collectivisation is about? What exactly are we collectivising? The solutions? The products? The capital? Or is he just saying that the morally ambiguous but courageous leaders have ideas that we, collectively, ought to support? And the &ldquo;fundamental change&rdquo; he has in mind are &ldquo;Contract for the Web&rdquo; and &ldquo;Solid Protocol&rdquo;? I… I don&rsquo;t know… We must &ldquo;champion the efforts of those visionary individuals who are actively working to build a new, improved system&rdquo;? It just feels so weird. How about this alternative:</p>

<ol>
<li>We need a web that is built for the people, by the people.</li>
<li>We need free ourselves from the shackles and fetters of corporations.</li>
<li>Remove corporations and their representatives from all governing bodies and committees.</li>
<li>All positions to be paid positions. Don&rsquo;t let those on the corporate payrolls take over.</li>
<li>One human, one vote. No strings attached. Don&rsquo;t tie votes to membership fees. This is for all of humanity.</li>
</ol>

<p>It took me two minutes to write something that seemed a bit more visionary than what Tim Berners-Lee had in mind and if you like it, please don&rsquo;t champion me but talk to some friends and do a little thing, no matter how small, to support a few more people on the web. Run a forum, a wiki, provide email services, run a fediverse instance, run a HTML course at the library, collect money for a mutual aid fund, something, anything. The only conditions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>it must be a concrete thing that you are actually doing</li>
<li>it must benefit more people than are involved in doing it</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK to cap it. But it&rsquo;s important to start it. Just make it a point to enable somebody else. And just like that, we&rsquo;re taking back the web.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a></p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.piewpiew.se/@ohyran" title="@ohyran@social.piewpiew.se">@ohyran</a> commented on fedi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Its hardware all the way down&rdquo;. The internet created this fantasy of a secondary realm outside of the physical confines of our reality - that allowed us to think that the person who controlled the narrative in that alternative universe had some control. In fact the people in control of hardware, if that&rsquo;s servers or cables or switches, are in control. There is no second reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2024-03-14</strong>. Brian Kardell writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve argued that while the web ecosystem has become the infrastructure for nearly everything, our models for funding and prioritization of the last 20 years have proven not only inadequate, and problematic, but ultimately fragile and cannot last. The only questions, I’ve argued, are how soon and what happens next. Are we ready for it? (hint: no). – <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/HowWeFund.html">How We Fund the Web Ecosystem</a></p>

## 2024-03-13 What would happen if Google sunset Gmail?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-13-what-would-happen-if-google-sunset-gmail">2024-03-13 What would happen if Google sunset Gmail?</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@lrhodes" title="@lrhodes@merveilles.town">@lrhodes</a> and <a class="account" href="https://jawns.club/@skyfaller" title="@skyfaller@jawns.club">@skyfaller</a> where discussing it on fedi and it got me thinking.
We all know how Google likes to end services.
Would it want to end Gmail?
Surely one day Gmail will end.
At that point, many people will no longer care.</p>

<p>So I wondered: who cares about email in general or Gmail in particular?</p>

<p>Looking around I sometimes get the feeling that most ordinary people use instant messengers these days. It&rsquo;s only corporations that want to reach people via email, mostly to send notifications about new info being available on their website (banks, insurances). But even in the corporate world, some notifications are moving to instant messenger apps (WhatsApp), or just proprietary apps (again, banks, insurances). Therefore I posit that in a few years, nobody (or &ldquo;not enough&rdquo; people) will <em>need</em> email.</p>

<p>For too many people, email just means <a href="2017-03-18_Email_is_the_New_Snail_Mail">getting bills and spam</a>.
Few people <em>love</em> email.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of the hair dresser who wants appointments via WhatsApp and the caterer for my wife&rsquo;s birthday party who wants to send me messages via WhatsApp. When not at work and still in a commercial setting, people use instant messengers. And my real life friends and family almost never send me email. It is always Threema or Signal.</p>

<p>And conversely, of course, in the corporate context all email I&rsquo;ve ever seen is Microsoft Outlook and that&rsquo;s getting emoji reactions and what not, so they are going to turn into a corporate proprietary messaging service (maybe not instant…). What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I think the value of Gmail keeps dropping. It&rsquo;s a glorified &ldquo;forgot my password&rdquo; service.</p>

<p>Perhaps my problem is that don&rsquo;t see much email communication from customers to business (C2B). The bigger corporations I know use contact forms (again, banks, insurances, retail). The smaller corporations use websites like Facebook, Instagram, TripAdvisor, Booking.com or whatnot to communicate with customers.</p>

<p>The value of email is dropping.</p>

<p>And it makes sense: it can be self-hosted, it can be easy to set up, it&rsquo;s totally federated – of course the big corporations are only interested in extracting all its value. They don&rsquo;t mind leaving behind a hollow husk. They don&rsquo;t mind making it hard to reach their customers inside the Gmail and Outlook silos. As long as the people inside the golden silo feel fine, that&rsquo;s not going to change.</p>

<p>I still think, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>For B2B communication, Outlook wins.</li>
<li>For C2B communication, WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook, Instagram, TripAdvisor, Booking.com and the like win</li>
<li>For human interaction, WhatsApp, Messenger, Threema and Signal win</li>
</ul>

<p>One day, Google will decide that there&rsquo;s no value left for them in email and they&rsquo;ll drop Gmail just like <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">they dropped all the other things</a>.</p>

<p>I happen to really like email, though. I mean… I like the really simple email. I hate email servers like Exim and Postfix and all their weird configuration files and DoveCot and SSL and SASL. Strangely enough, starting up a minimal web server takes me a few minutes to search for the right Python command or shell command, no config necessary, just listen on port 443 and off you go. Where is that all-in-one solution that works for a dozen people? A small club? I don&rsquo;t need a server optimized to serve a whole university campus.</p>

<p>I like reading and writing email on the command line. I guess that within a small circle friends – like that news server I&rsquo;m running that has some newsgroups that aren&rsquo;t connected to Usenet – like the Tilde servers! – that should work. We can rebuild the kind of Internet we like. Sure, it won&rsquo;t reach millions, but I&rsquo;ll be happy if it reaches the right two dozen people.</p>

date: 2024-03-13, from: OS News

There&#8217;s a channel on YouTube called The Proper People. It&#8217;s two guys who travel all over the United States (and in a few cases, elsewhere too) exploring abandoned buildings, and recording both the exteriors and interiors for posterity, since many of these buildings suffer from massive decay and are often slated for demolition. These buildings have histories and stories that otherwise would be lost to time. They are incredibly respectful of the buildings they explore, and they will not break open locked doors or windows, and only traverse open and unlocked doors or openings borne out of natural decay. They never take anything from the sites they visit, and abhor what urban explorers call &#8220;staging&#8221;, where you move furniture and objects around to invoke or imply stories and things that aren&#8217;t there. Their videos are also very calm, muted, quiet, and only occasionally use atmospheric music for some of the more artistic shots. As a sidenote, they also happen to have the absolute best intro music of all time. One of the things you quickly notice as you see these buildings, and explore their interiors, is just how solidly made and beautifully detailed they were. Whether they&#8217;re exploring an 19th century Kirkbride mental asylum, an early 19th century power plant, or a mid-20th century hospital &#8211; they all tend to be made not just to serve a function, but also to be beautiful and solid, both inside and out. Walls, ceilings, and doorways are beautifully detailed in masonry or woodwork, light fittings are solid and ornate, and even access corridors or storage basements have gorgeous vaulted ceilings, decorated walls, and ornate pillars. The contrast to modern buildings couldn&#8217;t be starker. Buildings and workplaces of today are littered with drop ceilings, flimsy dividers, open plans, endless amounts of glass, all in styles so minimalist it just makes spaces feel cold, uninviting, and lacking in human scale. Modern buildings and interiors are temporary, ephemeral, built not for humans, but to a bottom line and some designer&#8217;s fancy &#8211; these old hospitals, factories, and even power plants are permanent, enduring, and made to human scale. They served as much as a status symbol for whatever ruthless capitalist owned the building as they did as a place for that same ruthless capitalist to extract wealth from mistreated workers. This juxtaposition, of the minimalist, soulless, flimsy and cheap-looking exteriors and interiors of modern buildings on the one hand, and the beautifully detailed, skillfully crafted, and human-scale exteriors and interiors from these older buildings on the other, is something that kept creeping back into my mind during my use of the MNT Reform. This is a device built by people who deeply care, who are very opinionated, and know exactly what they want to make &#8211; very much the opposite of the cookie-cutter dime-a-dozen laptops that flood the market today. MNT was so kind as to send me a Reform, at some risk to them because I am definitely not the kind of customer the Reform is typically aimed at. Yet, after a few months of use, I can confidently say this is one of the most unique devices I&#8217;ve ever used, and one that&#8217;s worth every cent. Let&#8217;s explore why. Brutalist hardware Let&#8217;s first dive into what, exactly, the Reform is. At its core, it&#8217;s an ARM-based laptop designed to run Linux, developed and built by a small team of people in Berlin. The Reform is unique in that it is designed to be open hardware, fully repairable and highly modular and upgradeable. It consists of a mainboard with an mPCIe slot, an M.2 slot for NVME SSDs, 16GB eMMC storage, and uniquely, a slot for a System-on-Chip module roughly the size of an SO-DIMM module that contains the processor and RAM. The keyboard and pointing device are internally connected through USB 2.0 and easily replaceable, too. The Reform is defined as much by what it does not have as by what it does have. You won&#8217;t find any surveillance devices inside the Reform &#8211; no webcam, no microphones, nothing. There have been laptops with little privacy switches or sliding covers for the webcam, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen a modern laptop that eschews cameras and microphones since the late &#8217;90s. It&#8217;s one of the many examples of the Reform&#8217;s opinionated design choices. The configuration MNT sent me consists of the aforementioned mainboard, coupled with one of the processor modules they offer &#8211; in my case, the RCM4 A311D, which sports four 2.2GHz Cortex-A73 cores and two 1.8GHz Cortex-A53 cores, 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM, and an ARM Mali G52 MP4 GPU that supports OpenGL/ES 3.1 through Panfrost. This module also supports Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 through the integrated RTL8822CS. The A311D is just one of many modules available for purchase for the Reform, and during the writing of this review, MNT also added a brand new SoC module to its lineup &#8211; the RK3588, the most powerful option available for the Reform. It packs 4 ARM Cortex-A76 cores (up to 2.4GHz) and 4 ARM Cortex-A55 cores (up to 2.2GHz), 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of eMMC storage. It also sports an ARM Mali-G610 MP4 4-core GPU. Like with all other modules, the drivers for the A311D in my model are completely open source. When it comes to firmware, however, the A311D is not fully open source; there&#8217;s closed-source code in the Wi-Fi firmware and the boot/TF-A firmware. The other modules all also have various bits of closed firmware, except for the RKX7 module that uses a Kintex-7 FPGA and hence comes with a hefty price tag. Using the RKX7 module, you can have a fully open source laptop, from operating system down to the firmware, which is, as far as I can tell, unique. However, the amount of closed firmware code for each of the other boards is relatively small, and in some cases &#8211; such as with the LS1028A &#8211; can be avoided, too. If you care about

<p><a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/corectblogroil.png">This image</a> was the result of a late night collaboration with ChatGPT. For some reason it can't spell anything right, and when I asked it to correct the spelling it mocked me. But I loved the design. It understood the hard part of what I was asking for. </p>
<p>The Knicks have been slumping since two of their top players have been out with injuries for over a month, after having an amazing January. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby">One</a> of the two star players came back last night, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39718456/og-anunoby-lifts-knicks-blowout-win-76ers-return">what a difference</a>! They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson">one player</a>, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab">second injured player</a> comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span> </p>

## 2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-07-why-do-we-even-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h1>

<p>The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined audience. It
is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It&rsquo;s more than writing into a
booklet, &ldquo;Dear Diary, …&rdquo; – and yet we do it even if there are no comments.
Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think I&rsquo;m just as happy getting the
occasional email or reply on the fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the
words is terrifying. And once I got that first comment, once I started linking
the blog from my profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to read and
implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was something I feared.
The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart beats. The heart bleeds.</p>

<p>Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments. First, there&rsquo;s a
comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk a look? But then the
imagined audience is still there and now it&rsquo;s worse. How will I react as I am being watched?
Blogging turns into a performance where I feel like I&rsquo;m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am I? All
the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really
don&rsquo;t want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren&rsquo;t very observant being unable to perceive their
own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.</p>

<p>The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously. Words
are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to weight them
carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how
long or how short the page, how trivial or how controversial the topic.</p>

<p>And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts unexamined
and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the judgements. How often have
I found myself falling short of my own measure.</p>

<p>To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for me, for
my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I struggle for virtue
and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined reader and myself. As proof.
&ldquo;I struggled!&rdquo; I struggle. I keep on struggling to discover what is right and
to do what is right.</p>

<p>Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things that I
think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my mind. I write
about the things I know because I did not know them before. And who cares about
those laborious system administration blog posts where I struggle with this or
that ephemeral problem. All these issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People
find their answers on Stack Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized
platform where middlemen gamify the experience so that we can help each other
while on the thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I do,
when I&rsquo;m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And there are so
many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved articles and snippets are
more like compost heaps, where layer upon layer of good stuff gets dropped,
never to see the light of day again.</p>

<p>Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a fire,
somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that is fine. The
world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one thought knows not the
next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion of the sleepless mind. Our
books, our journals, our blogs, our posts, they all participate. Perhaps we
fall for those waves of outrage and the galaxy brain has a seizure as we all
throw our weight around in unison, crushing innocent lives, leaving those we
hurt behind, forgetting them as quickly as we forget about the outrage.</p>

<p>Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one sparking a
fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and posts on social
media has certainly changed me.</p>

<p>Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and blogging.
And this is why I cannot stop blogging.
To blog in that half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and
perhaps they are not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks
onto that great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of us can
talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to blog.</p>

<p>I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to think
long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing. I keep
failing and so I must keep blogging.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Blogs">#Blogs</a></p>

<p>p1k3 wrote back in 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Writing about writing. Programming about programming. Meetings about meetings. The mind reflecting on its own function. … Writing about writing might not have quite the same potential for nested, generative dysfunction, but it often produces artifacts just as unintelligible. – <a href="https://p1k3.com/2020/5/20/">meta meta</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote seemed very appropriate for one of the two threads in my posts.
The other thread is about the audience and I got a comment on that, too, by the same author:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that I have much to add here, but I do relate to this one.  The ongoing tension of these feelings contrasted with the sense that (as I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve said many times before) existing in public seems almost entirely unsupportable to me now.  And yet:  Nothing else has quite the same power as writing for this audience you can never be sure of.  The one that might not even exist, but if it does might be all kinds of things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pain of existing in public is a great way to put it.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-08</strong>. How to overcome that impostor feeling where you reread that text you wrote and you want to throw it away.
Not worth the electrons it was written with! But who&rsquo;s doing the judging: you, or that imagined audience I was talking about?</p>

<p>I think the point of blogging is for there to be a tiny, non-threatening audience.
And really, who is going to read my blog?
Internet stranger-friends, mutuals on fedi, those kinds of people. Maybe my parents. (Hi mom!)
I can always anonymoblog somewhere else if I&rsquo;m feeling anxious.
Because writing in a paper notebook I don&rsquo;t feel judged.
Surely there&rsquo;s a similar place, online.
The key is to find that happy state where the imagined audience adds a little zest but not the Twitter wolves or Hacker News, or whatever the particular blogging nightmare might be.</p>

<p>For me, this imagined audience is more important than getting it right. Which is why I write my blog posts with the wiki spirit.
All these sites are pretty similar, in essence. Blog, wiki, digital garden, Zettelkasten, there&rsquo;s not enough difference to draw lines.
It&rsquo;s all a question of intent, of culture, of belonging.
The blog spirit is to write pages over time, and they disappear into the archive.
The digital garden spirit is to write unfinished articles and papers, to be refined or not.
The Zettelkasten spirit is to follow the trail of thoughts you thought and add new branches, small notes with new thoughts leading to more thoughts on new notes.
And the wiki spirit is to write and edit online, to hit the Save button and then it&rsquo;s live.
There is no editor, there is no draft. Wiki is like brutalism in content management.
I can see the page sources and the end result is obvious and full of that old web power.
It&rsquo;s not an app. The software has no idea of process.
The wiki spirit is to open that window, write the text and hit save.
And then I read it again, and edit it.
And tomorrow, I read it again, and edit it.
And next week, perhaps, I read it again, and edit it.</p>

<p>I no longer live in the <a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiNow">Wiki Now</a>. The pages are intended for future readers but they are not timeless. I add timestamps all over the place. The blog spirit is strong. The pages do disappear into the great compost of thoughts.
The archive gobbles them up. I do go back but I don&rsquo;t rewrite the pages completely.
I&rsquo;m more likely to simply add a timestamp and some thoughts like I did on this page.</p>

<p>I do remove stuff I stumble across that I don&rsquo;t like at all.
I do leave some bad things in there to remind me of bad decisions made, of bad opinions held.</p>

<p>What I want to say, most of all, is that blog posts aren&rsquo;t gems.
They are not precious books. They are not newspaper articles. They are not job applications.
And if I don&rsquo;t like it tomorrow, I edit it. I revise it.
Or I write a new page saying how I learned something, or regret something, or I add something.
I add stuff to the bottom of pages or I add new pages.
What I don&rsquo;t do is polish the old posts.
There will be more great posts in the future.
The important part is the writing.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-09</strong>. I’m reading <a href="http://perfors.net/blog/creation-ai/">The work of creation in the age of AI</a> by Andrew Perfors and thinking about the part where meaning is discussed.</p>

<p>Meaning without an audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I am writing an essay or diary entry to myself, the goal is … generally to clarify my own thoughts, to identify flaws in my thinking, or to distil the logic and motivations behind my ideas. I might have a more emotional goal - I might want to vent to myself or to express a feeling. I might want to improve my emotional regulation, feel better about life, or change those feelings somehow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then with an audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… once I decided I might actually want to post it, I changed it in important ways. I included a lot more explanation of things that were clear in my head but I thought would be non-obvious to others (and, in so doing, often I clarified them for myself too!). I fiddled with the structure and the argument flow, took some things out, put others in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got an email from <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town">@bouncepaw</a> with a link to <a href="https://links.bouncepaw.com/1188">a reply</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>This is how it starts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This article gets better every time I open it because Alex adds something to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about my propensity to “add” to pages up above (I’m doing it again!) and perhaps this would be a good place to talk about the two “views” for this site: blog &amp; wiki.</p>

<p>A blog is organized by the timeline. The <a href="index">Home</a> page lists all the pages in the order of their creation.</p>

<p>A wiki is organized by Recent Changes. The <a href="changes">Changes</a> page lists all the pages recently edited (unless I unset a checkbox).</p>

<p>So this site has both natures. And both views have a feed: <a href="index.rss">blog feed</a> &amp; <a href="changes.rss">wiki feed</a>.</p>

<p>I think you need quite some wiki-affinity to subscribe to the wiki feed. But it’s there for you.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-10</strong>. Got another reply by email, <a href="//redterminal.org/gemlog/2024-03-10-Re_Why_do_we_even_blog.gmi">by fab</a> – who hosts their site on Gopher, Gemini, and the web. Reminds me of the time I had a working <a href="Gopher">Gopher</a> setup. And now I’m remembering the endless bot spiders. Yikes. I still think there should be a way to better control the bots.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-11</strong>. Dozens also wrote a blog about blogging!</p>

And none of the big journalists even asked the question -- where is this asshole coming from. Our journalists, today, who protest that we need them to keep our democracy, and then they assassinate it. When are we ever going to stand up and put a stop to this. BTW, Substack where she hosts her incredible writing, makes it impossible to find a web link to a story you recieve via email. It's very easy to get to the article in their app. I prefer the open web, and always will. I don't want Substack's app. Because I couldn't find the URL, even by searching for it, I can't give it to you. Sorry.

## Intel continues prepping the Linux kernel for X86S

date: 2024-03-13, from: OS News

Nearly one year ago Intel published the X86S specification (formerly stylized as &#8220;X86-S&#8221;) for simplifying the Intel architecture by removing support for 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems. X86S is a big step forward with dropping legacy mode, 5-level paging improvements, and other modernization improvements for x86_64. With the Linux 6.9 kernel more x86S bits are in place for this ongoing effort. ↫ Michael Larabel I doubt we&#8217;ll see much fallout from these changes.

They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson">one player</a>, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab">second injured player</a> comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span>

Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html">MacWrite and MacPaint</a> for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company. It's a very steep road TBL has chosen to travel. I have argued with my friends at Automattic that they are in a golden position to do this since they already have a large installed base product that's popular with users, and lots of developers who could make good use of storage attached to each account. I hope someone with deep pockets and longevity does it. Then we can really start building an app ecosystem on the net. We've been doing this for 35 years as TBL points out, and we still haven't created an economic developer ecosystem on the web. Storage, believe it or not, is the big missing piece.

## Subject codes, incomplete and unreliable, have got to go

date: 2024-03-13, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Subject classifications have been available via the REST API for many years but have not been complete or reliable from the start and will soon be deprecated.</p>
<p>The <code>subject</code> metadata element was born out of a Labs experiment intended to enrich the metadata returned via Crossref Metadata Search with All Subject Journal Classification codes from Scopus. This feature was developed when the REST API was still fairly new, and we now recognize that the initial implementation worked its way into the service prematurely.</p>
<p>While subject classifications in Crossref metadata could be very useful, the current implementation in the REST API is problematic for three primary reasons:</p>
<p><strong>They are misleadingly exposed in the API as a property of the work,</strong> when in fact they are a property of the container (e.g. a journal or conference proceeding). Just because a journal’s broad topic category is “X” doesn’t mean that a particular article in the journal is about “X.”</p>
<p><strong>Existing works may have outdated subjects.</strong> Originally, subject codes were not updated periodically. However, subjects exposed in the /journals route are now updated once a day. Those exposed via the /works endpoint are indexed along with works, and so when a new subject list is ingested, new DOIs start getting new subjects, but existing works may have outdated subjects. We don’t have a mechanism for forcing updates when incorrect subject values are returned via the REST API, so this data can be stale and incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>They are not applied to everything.</strong> This is because the Scopus list does not cover all the journals that Crossref has (conversely, the Scopus list contains some journals Crossref does not have), and does not contain other container types.</p>
<p>The Labs team investigated options for improving subject classification coverage but ultimately concluded that there are insufficient solutions to the coverage problem. For more, please see Esha Datta’s findings published at Force11’s Upstream: <a href="https://doi.org/10.54900/n6dnt-xpq48" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.54900/n6dnt-xpq48</a></p>
<p>Where does that leave us? Rather than continuing to supply unreliable and misleading subject category metadata, we will be deprecating this feature in the coming weeks. To minimize disruption and avoid breaking changes at this time, we will be removing this data from our index, so the subject element will simply be empty. We may remove the <code>subject</code> element in the future.</p>
<p>We know that the community’s desire for subject-based analysis of metadata is very strong, and we have supported efforts to establish a multidisciplinary taxonomy. Inaccurate codes in the meantime do not help but actually hinder these efforts, giving the false impression that they are correct.</p>
<p>We aim to deprecate the subject codes in April of this year.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns by leaving a comment below, which will start a thread in our community forum.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>
<p>Q. Will the subject field continue to be available and functional?<br>
A. The subject metadata element will continue to be included in the JSON response but will not return any values.</p>
<p>Q. Will new subject codes be added in the future?<br>
A. We do not have any current plans to add new subject codes in the future.</p>
<p>Q. I received a notification about this, but we don’t use subject codes. Do I need to do anything?<br>
A. No, if you do not currently use the <code>subject</code> element, you do not need to do anything about this change.</p>
<p>Q. I noticed that wrong or inaccurate subject codes were assigned to my works. Is this a solution?<br>
A. Yes. Until we can identify an accurate and sustainable system for assigning subject codes to Crossref metadata records, we want to stop assigning inaccurate subject codes and remove all existing assignments.</p>

<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.10.1-alpha1/docs/users_guide/9.10.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>Many will notice that this release comes a fair bit later than the
previously-announced schedule. While this delay has been attributable to a
variety factors, the most recent cause is a set of issues with GHC 9.10’s
binary distributions on Windows (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24542">#24542</a>). Instead of continuing to hold up the
release process while we sort out this situation, we have instead provided this
alpha without the usual assortment of Windows binary distributions. We expect
to have this resolved by alpha 2; apologies to eager Windows testers for this
delay.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a [ticket][] if you see
anything amiss.</p>

We need a protocol for embedding a tweet in a web page. We used to have one with Twitter, but it now works only intermittently. Mastodon has one, and I have been able to use it. But really it would be nice to have a sort of jQuery of this stuff. If they're all going to create their own APIs we obviously need a container for that so developers don't have to worry about all of it.

## Rebooting the blogroll bootstrap

## Zero-Boil-Off Tank Experiments to Enable Long-Duration Space Exploration

date: 2024-03-12, from: NASA breaking news

Do we have enough fuel to get to our destination? This is probably one of the first questions that comes to mind whenever your family gets ready to embark on a road trip. If the trip is long, you will need to visit gas stations along your route to refuel during your travel. NASA is grappling with similar issues as it gets ready to embark on a sustainable mission back to the Moon and plans future missions to Mars.

## European Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 infringes data protection law for EU institutions and bodies

date: 2024-03-12, from: OS News

Following its investigation, the EDPS has found that the European Commission (Commission) has infringed several key data protection rules when using Microsoft 365. In its decision, the EDPS imposes corrective measures on the Commission. ↫ European Data Protection Supervisor You often hear people state that EU rules and regulations are designed exclusively to harm non-EU companies. The massive amounts of fines and corrective actions handed out to EU companies in all kinds of sectors already disprove this notion, and here&#8217;s a case where even the European Commission itself gets a slap on the wrist for violating its own rules and regulations &#8211; rules and regulations, we&#8217;re often told by especially American corporatists, are designed specifically to target poor American businesses.

## AI and the NYT

date: 2024-03-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Zach Seward, a friend from my days at <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/about/">Harvard</a> and NYU, got a kickass <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/zach-seward-is-the-newsrooms-editorial-director-of-a-i-initiatives/">job</a>, starting up the AI effort at the NYT.  He's just the right guy for it. Young, curious, creative, and very ambitious. And he has a strong startup journalism background. I couldn't think of anyone I'd want more to be in this position. </p>
<p>Now that he's published <a href="https://www.zachseward.com/ai-news-thats-fit-to-print-sxsw-2024/?ref=zach-seward-newsletter">notes</a> for a talk he gave at SXSW, it's time to share some ideas I have for the NYT re AI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current events. This is something ChatGPT doesn't do. Not sure why. I'd like to be able to connect to <a href="https://ai.nytimes.com/">ai.nytimes.com</a> and ask it to give me a rundown on the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/09.html#a200615">lawyer</a> who's testifying in Congress today about how our president is "elderly." I don't want pointers to stories, though they should be included in the response, I want a custom report, like the ones ChatGPT provides, that answers the questions I have about the MAGA lawyer. Maybe the AI will just give me the story without the spin. </li>
<li>More useful NYT archives. When I was a kid I spent so much time at the <a href="https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/central-library">big library</a> in Jamaica (Queens)  going back through microfilm of the NYT from before I was born. So far all we've done is replicate the microfilm user experience (which is great and very useful) but the thing that ChatGPT does so well is prepare custom reports. All that source material, used to answer very specific questions. Answer questions like "has anything notorious happened in the neighborhood I grew up in, as far as the NYT knows?"</li>
<li>Sell a service to your readers where you manage the archive of their blogs, and in doing so you create a much broader archive for historians, journalists and others to study in the future, and, in the context of AI, feed it all kinds of perspective on the time we live in. Maybe in the future history won't be written by the winners (lotsa luck with that). Anyway, if at some point the NYT and other journalism outlets will harness the energy, knowledge and intelligence of the readers, why not start now? </li>
</ul>
<p>I criticize the NYT a lot, I know. But that <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">means</a> I care. When I stop criticizing you'll know that I've given up. </p>
<p>Alan Kay <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/707961">said</a> of the Mac, it's the first personal computer worth criticizing. That's the spirit. </p>

## 2024-02-28 Use of a calendar

date: 2024-03-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-02-28-use-of-a-calendar">2024-02-28 Use of a calendar</h1>

<p>In the last millennium, I used the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html">Emacs Diary</a> for my calendar. I mean, why not? The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones and I wanted an online calendar.</p>

<p>The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:</p>

<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>

<p>Back then, Google didn&rsquo;t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I.
I switched to <a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.</p>

<p>And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.</p>

<p>Today, <a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net">@tadzik</a> posted a link to <a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload it to a CalDAV server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p>Example usage, from the README:</p>

<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>

<p>My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs failed silently, some of them created new collections with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename as the collection name… and I didn&rsquo;t get an warnings or error messages. I mean, it makes sense. It&rsquo;s like a filesystem, you can save whatever you want. But it&rsquo;s not what the calendar apps expect.</p>

<p>So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like <code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of <code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That&rsquo;s the one!</p>

## Housekeeping

date: 2024-03-12, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Spring is almost here! Birds are chirping, days are getting longer. What a lovely time of the year. Housekeeping post to share a bunch of stuff with you all.</p>
<p><a href="https://heydingus.net/">Jarrod</a> managed to remove an item from my to-do list since he made a site for the <a href="https://oneamonth.club">One a Month Club</a>.

<p><a href="https://chavanniclass.wordpress.com">Ratika</a> started <a href="https://kadambari.bearblog.dev/">Kadambari</a>, a book written online, chapter by chapter. Such a lovely idea, one <a href="https://ko-fi.com/ratikadeshpande">worth supporting</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cagrimmett.com">Chuck</a> created a page for <a href="https://peopleandblogs.feedland.cloud">People and Blogs on FeedLand</a>. In there you’ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>the interviews</li>
<li>posts from the blogs featured in the series</li>
<li>posts from all the blogs mentioned in the interviews</li>

## Fixing nginx Error: Undefined constant PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Fixing nginx Error: Undefined constant PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I install a <em>lot</em> of Drupal sites day to day, especially when I'm doing dev work.</p>

<p>In the course of doing that, sometimes I'll be working on infrastructure—whether that's an Ansible playbook to configure a Docker container, or testing something on a fresh server or VM.</p>

<p>In any case, I run into the following error every so often in my Nginx <code>error.log</code>:</p>

<pre><code>"php-fpm" nginx Error: Undefined constant PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY
</code></pre>

<p>The funny thing is, I <em>don't</em> have that error when I'm running CLI commands, like <code>vendor/bin/drush</code>, and can even install and manage the Drupal site and database on the CLI.</p>

<p>The problem, in my case, was that I had applied <code>php-fpm</code> configs using Ansible, but in my playbook I hadn't restarted <code>php-fpm</code> (in my case, on Ubuntu 22.04, <code>php8.3-fpm</code>) after doing so. So FPM was running with outdated config and didn't know that the MySQL/MariaDB drivers were even present on the system.</p></div>

## Messy ToS update allegedly locks Roku devices until users give in

date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News

Roku customers are threatening to stop using, or to even dispose of, their low-priced TVs and streaming gadgets after the company appears to be locking devices for people who don&#8217;t conform to the recently updated terms of service (ToS). This month, users on Roku&#8217;s support forums reported suddenly seeing a message when turning on their Roku TV or streaming device reading: &#8220;We&#8217;ve made an important update: We’ve updated our Dispute Resolution Terms. Select ‘Agree’ to agree to these updated Terms and to continue enjoying our products and services. Press * to view these updated Terms.&#8221; A large button reading &#8220;Agree&#8221; follows. The pop-up doesn&#8217;t offer a way to disagree, and users are unable to use their device unless they hit agree. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica The best part of this story? And by best I mean worst? You have to send a letter &#8211; a paper one, with stamps and everything, like in the before times &#8211; to Roku&#8217;s lawyer in California containing the names of all the people opting out, the devices and services in question, and a damn purchase receipt. They&#8217;re one step away from wanting your passport and your firstborn child.

## Image-scraping Midjourney bans rival “AI” firm for scraping images

date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News

On Wednesday, Midjourney banned all employees from image synthesis rival Stability AI from its service indefinitely after it detected &#8220;botnet-like&#8221; activity suspected to be a Stability employee attempting to scrape prompt and image pairs in bulk. Midjourney advocate Nick St. Pierre tweeted about the announcement, which came via Midjourney&#8217;s official Discord channel. ↫ Benj Edwards So &#8220;AI&#8221; companies are allowed to ingest whatever data they want, but as soon as someone ingests their data, it&#8217;s suddenly a problem? Seems like a sound business model.

## Mac Dialog in Auto Layout vs. SwiftUI

date: 2024-03-11, from: Michael Tsai

Christian Tietze (Mastodon): On Mastodon, we had a discussion about whether you are more or less productive with SwiftUI or UIKit/AppKit. Der Teilweise (@teilweise@layer8.space) chimed in with an actual, measurable benchmark: a flexible-width window, with reflowing text, and equal-size buttons. Doable in 10 minutes. Can SwiftUI beat this? [&#8230;] Here&#8217;s the reference implementation on GitHub. [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Journalism talks about Trump's trials, but they are trials for the Constitution too. If Trump is guilty (spoiler: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call">he is</a>) then if he isn't punished we no longer have the rule of law. So don't miss that we are on trial too. And -- when journalism frames the faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the Republicans win. We know that, it's provable. And anything that's true should be built into the stories journalism writes about.

## The world’s wire services call out British palace PR for a royally doctored photo

The British royals — they&#8217;re just like you and me! They get nervous before a big speech, they occasionally fall for quacks, and they&#8217;re not great at Photoshop.

## Better, faster, stronger time zone updates on Android

date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News

From the beginning, time zone rules were a component in Mainline, called Time Zone Data or tzdata module. This integration allowed us to react more quickly to government-mandated time zone changes than before. However until 2023 tzdata updates were still bundled with other Mainline changes, sometimes leading to testing complexities and slower deployment. In 2023, we made further investments in Mainline&#8217;s infrastructure and decoupled the tzdata module from the other components. With this isolation, we gained the ability to respond rapidly to time zone legislation changes — often releasing updates to Android users outside of the established release cadence. Additionally, this change means time zone updates can reach a far greater number of Android devices, ensuring you as Android users always see the correct time. ↫ Almaz Mingaleev and Masha Khokhlova This is equal parts boring and equal parts amazing. The amount of work developers have to put into making sure timezones work is astonishing, and the fact that a large chunk of it is done by volunteers is even more impressive.

## Oh servers!

date: 2024-03-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging communities. </p>
<p>And then this happened...</p>
<p>We've been having serious problems on <a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> since Friday when I made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you'd get an awful error message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors. And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they still haven't. </p>
<p>We're going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we're going to upgrade the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That won't happen today and probably not tomorrow. </p>
<p>Most people probably don't know that feedland.com is a project I'm doing with Automattic. It's running in their cloud. This system should be able to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can't, where feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are many thousands of users, we should be okay. That's why I did the work to convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but it had to be done. </p>
<p>Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on our main server in the last few days. I can't promise it won't happen again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases re-learned. </p>
<p>It's even worse than it appears and as they say -- still diggin! </p>

Last night's <a href="http://scripting.com/email">email</a> was a repeat of Saturday's. The reason was the switch to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">Daylight Savings Time</a>. This happens every year. The fix is to edit stats.json in the mail sender app's folder, and change <code>whenLastUpdate</code> to the day before, save it, and restart the sender app. It immediately sends out the correct email.

## House panel unanimously approves bill that could ban TikTok

date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News

A powerful House committee advanced a bill on Thursday that could lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices, renewing lawmakers’ challenge to one of the world’s most popular social media apps and highlighting unresolved fears that TikTok may pose a Chinese government spying risk. The measure that sailed unanimously through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok from US app stores unless the social media platform — used by roughly 170 million Americans — is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent company, ByteDance. ↫ Brian Fung at CNN TikTok obviously needs to be banned. It&#8217;s an extension of a genocidal, totalitarian government that has no place on our our phones. Yes, I understand Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft also collect vast amounts of data, but at least they are (nominally) beholden to our legal systems, and while there is, of course, a vast power imbalance between us as individuals and them as megacorporations, it&#8217;s still nowhere even close as to being an arm of a totalitarian government &#8211; they&#8217;re just not comparable. China&#8217;s state surveillance tools have no place on our devices.

There <i>are</i> advantages to doing it that way. For some people that is what news.scripting.com will turn into. It's an on ramp to the world of collaborative feed subscriptions. The open social web, in feeds. Which is why we call it Feed<i>Land. </i>You know The Land of Feeds. I like "land" names for products and companies. I started a company called UserLand a long time ago. I was skiing in Utah in 1989 when I decided on two names: UserLand and Frontier. I like product names that begin with F, esp if you come from the Mac -- where the <i>Finder</i> is the app you spend a lot of time in. So Frontier was a good name simply because it was two syllables and began with F. I know it's weird. It's also why FeedLand feels like a homey name to me. :-)

## The Apple curl security incident 12604

date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News

When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, the version shipped by Apple, it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store in case the provided set of CA certs fail the verification. A secondary check that was not asked for, is not documented and plain frankly comes completely by surprise. Therefore, when a user runs the check with a trimmed and dedicated CA cert file, it will not fail if the system CA store contains a cert that can verify the server! This is a security problem because now suddenly certificate checks pass that should not pass. ↫ Daniel Stenberg Absolutely wild that Apple does not consider this a security issue.
