## Finding peace among the crowds on Mykonos

date: 2024-04-28, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>I&#8217;ll never forget the moments after I&#8217;d jumped ship in Mykonos: While enjoying a glass of ouzo in a tiny taverna, I watched my mighty cruise ship sail away and take with it the 3,000 tourists who had inundated the charming port just an hour before. Having pushed their postcard racks back indoors, it seemed the shopkeepers were satisfied that they&#8217;d made their money for the day, and suddenly a sleepy charm blanketed both the locals and the visitors who remained on perhaps the most famed island in the Aegean Sea.</p>
