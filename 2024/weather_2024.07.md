Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1121 PM CST Wed Feb 14 2024

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm probabilities are very low today.

...Discussion...

Active, progressive northern stream will continue across the CONUS
today. Several notable short-wave troughs will advance inland across
the Pacific Northwest, and over the OH Valley/Great Lakes. While
large-scale ascent/midlevel moistening will be noted ahead of each
of these features, forecast soundings don't exhibit more than very
weak buoyancy. Any convection that develops in response to these
short waves will be shallow and the threat for lightning is very
low.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-02-14, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0326 PM CST Wed Feb 14 2024

Valid 161200Z - 221200Z

From D3/Friday through D5/Sunday, an expansive post-frontal air mass
will encompass much of the central CONUS, with cold surface
temperatures generally limiting fire-weather potential. Thereafter,
westerly midlevel flow will strengthen across the Rockies, with
multiple embedded shortwave troughs encouraging weak lee troughing
and the potential for dry/breezy conditions across the
southern/central High Plains. This will especially be the case on
D7-D8/Tuesday-Wednesday over the southern High Plains, though
confidence in the development of critical conditions is low owing to
continued model disagreement and marginal fuels across the area.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1003 AM CST Tue Feb 13 2024

Valid 131630Z - 141200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected across the continental U.S.
through tonight.

...Synopsis...
In the wake of a shortwave trough moving off the Mid-Atlantic and
over southern New England, cool/dry continental air will dominate
the majority of the CONUS.  Steep midlevel lapse rates were observed
this morning over parts of the northern Great Basin/Rockies and weak
convection may occur over southern ID and vicinity, but
thunderstorms are not expected due to limited moisture and/or little
forcing for ascent.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0643 AM CST Tue Feb 13 2024

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected across the continental U.S.
through tonight.

...Discussion...
A fast-moving shortwave trough over the Mid-Atlantic seaboard early
today will continue to quickly shift northeastward to the western
Atlantic, with a surface cyclone/cold front moving
east-northeastward in a similar fashion. With weak buoyancy noted
along the coast (12z observed soundings from Wallops Island and
Morehead City), a couple of lightning flashes could initially occur
today near the coastal Mid-Atlantic, such as near far eastern
portions of Maryland/Virginia and northeast North Carolina. However,
this potential will remain quite low/sparse overall and quickly wane
this morning. Other offshore lightning flashes could occur off the
coast of southern New England through early afternoon.

Nearly zonal upper-level flow will otherwise prevail across the
remainder of the CONUS, as dry and stable conditions are anticipated
east of the Rockies.
