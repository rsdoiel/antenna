Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1024 AM CST Fri Feb 16 2024

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING OVER PORTIONS OF ARKANSAS AND WEST TENNESSEE....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong storms capable of hail are possible this afternoon
and early evening over parts of Arkansas and west Tennessee.

...AR/TN...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a fast-moving upper trough over
KS, that will overspread the MS/TN valleys later today.  A surface
low currently over northwest AR will deepen and build eastward
today, with strengthening convergence near the low/cold front.  This
will result in scattered afternoon thunderstorm development across
central AR into west/middle TN.  Forecast soundings in this zone
show cold mid level temperatures (-20C or colder at 500mb), steep
mid-level lapse rates, and CAPE values of 500-800 J/kg.  This,
combined with sufficient deep-layer shear for updraft rotation will
pose a risk of a few hail-producing storms through the early
evening.  The threat should wane a couple of hours after sunset due
to weakening instability.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0633 AM CST Fri Feb 16 2024

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
No areas of organized severe thunderstorms are forecast over the
conterminous U.S.

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified mid/upper-level pattern will persist over the
CONUS today, as an initial high-latitude omega configuration over
western Canada evolves into a full-latitude, open-wave, synoptic
ridge.  That ridge will extend southward over the western U.S. as
well.  The eastern portion of a shortwave trough -- initially over
the northern Rockies -- will break away from the remainder of the
height weakness footing the omega pattern and reach parts of
southwestern WY, southern ID and northern UT by 00Z.  The trough
then should dig southeastward to parts of CO/UT by the end of the
period.  As that occurs, a weaker, downstream perturbation --
evident in moisture-channel imagery near an axis from HLC-AMA-INK --
will weaken gradually as it moves eastward across OK and AR,
reaching the lower Ohio Valley and western TN by 00Z.  What is left
of this feature should accelerate eastward over the central
Appalachians by 12Z tomorrow. 

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a frontal-wave low near FDR,
with wavy warm front across central parts of OK/AR to northern MS. 
An initial/weak cold front was drawn from the low southwestward over
southern NM and an Arctic front across the southeastern TX Panhandle
to northeastern NM.  These fronts should merge through the day,
while the low ripples rapidly east-northeastward along the warm
front.  The low should reach south-central/southeastern KY by 00Z,
with trailing cold front across middle TN, northern MS, the Arklatex
region, and south-central TX.  By 12Z, the low should move offshore
from Hampton Roads, with cold front over central NC, north-central
GA, south-central AL, to parts of the north-central/northwestern
Gulf. 

...AR/Mid-South...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected to form this afternoon into
evening over AR, along/ahead of the surface cold front, then shift
eastward while backbuilding southward.  A resultant band of
thunderstorms should cross parts of western TN, northern MS and
northern LA before weakening substantially late this evening.  The
strongest cells within the band -- especially early in the
convective cycle when discrete storms still are possible -- may
produce hail approaching severe limits and strong gusts.  Severe
potential still appears too low and conditional for a categorical
risk area; however, an isolated, marginally severe hail report or
damaging subsevere gust cannot be ruled out. 

Surface dewpoints in the 50s F already extend from the Gulf into the
warm sector across parts of this region, and should remain in place
as moist advection offsets any diurnal mixing.  The return-flow
regime will remain incompletely modified, so that the convective
plume will outrun already modest moisture this evening while
diabatic cooling takes hold.  Time series of forecast soundings
depict two simultaneous processes:
1.  Effective-inflow parcels becoming surface-based this afternoon,
in a narrow prefrontal corridor, due to warm advection and
cloud-slowed diurnal surface warming.  This should contribute to
peak preconvective MLCAPE in the 300-800 J/kg range. 
2.  Veering of surface winds with time, reducing hodograph size,
low-level SRH and low-level bulk shear.  Deep shear will be marginal
to favorable, even with veering of low-level flow.  0-6-km shear
magnitudes in the 45-55-kt range are expected.  However, effective-
shear magnitudes are only around 1/2-2/3 that range, because the
low-topped/compressed nature of the buoyant layer shunts the upper
reaches of the calculation to below the strongest mid/upper winds.  

With the favorable kinematic and thermodynamic factors trending
oppositely through the afternoon, and the regime already being
somewhat moisture/buoyancy-starved, unconditional probabilities will
be held below MRGL categorical levels for the time being.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1122 AM CST Thu Feb 15 2024

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms appear unlikely on Friday.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Within broadly cyclonic flow over the central/eastern states, a
subtle mid-level impulse will advance eastward from the
southern/central Plains across the lower MS Valley and Mid-South on
Friday. A weak surface low is likewise expected to develop from the
Ozarks vicinity towards the southern/central Appalachians by Friday
evening. Modest low-level moisture, with surface dewpoints generally
in the mid to upper 50s, should be present ahead of a front from the
ArkLaTex into the Mid-South. As this front moves east-southeastward
through the day, isolated to scattered thunderstorms may develop
along its length. With mid-level flow largely paralleling the front,
there should be a tendency for convection to be undercut and become
elevated. Still, some chance for strong/gusty winds and small hail
may exist with any near-surface-based thunderstorms across the
Mid-South Friday afternoon, as weak instability and sufficient
deep-layer shear may support modest updraft organization. But,
overall severe potential still appears too limited to add low
hail/wind probabilities at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1041 AM CST Thu Feb 15 2024

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Weinman.. 02/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CST Thu Feb 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
On Friday a weak surface low will drift south into the southern High
Plains and become less defined. A strong area of high pressure will
move into the northern Plains and act to accelerate a cold front
south in the southern High Plains. Winds will be light ahead of this
cold front and strong behind it with cool temperatures. 

No significant fire weather concerns are expected given mostly moist
fuels in the CONUS and a lack of any overlap between strongest winds
and warm/dry surface conditions.

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast reasoning (see below) remains the same.
Despite locally dry/breezy conditions over the southern High Plains
this afternoon, unreceptive fuels should limit most fire-weather
concerns.

..Weinman.. 02/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CST Thu Feb 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
A lee cyclone will develop across eastern Colorado today. This will
lead to some breezy conditions in portions of the central and
Southern High Plains. Some locally Elevated meteorological fire
weather conditions are expected across portions of eastern New
Mexico. However, fuels are quite moist in the area and therefore the
threat for large fires remains minimal.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm probabilities are very low today.

...Discussion...

Active, progressive northern stream will continue across the CONUS
today. Several notable short-wave troughs will advance inland across
the Pacific Northwest, and over the OH Valley/Great Lakes. While
large-scale ascent/midlevel moistening will be noted ahead of each
of these features, forecast soundings don't exhibit more than very
weak buoyancy. Any convection that develops in response to these
short waves will be shallow and the threat for lightning is very
low.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0326 PM CST Wed Feb 14 2024

Valid 161200Z - 221200Z

From D3/Friday through D5/Sunday, an expansive post-frontal air mass
will encompass much of the central CONUS, with cold surface
temperatures generally limiting fire-weather potential. Thereafter,
westerly midlevel flow will strengthen across the Rockies, with
multiple embedded shortwave troughs encouraging weak lee troughing
and the potential for dry/breezy conditions across the
southern/central High Plains. This will especially be the case on
D7-D8/Tuesday-Wednesday over the southern High Plains, though
confidence in the development of critical conditions is low owing to
continued model disagreement and marginal fuels across the area.
