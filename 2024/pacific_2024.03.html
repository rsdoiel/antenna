ǀ Truth 35: Post MLK Day Reality — BUT ‘We Shall Overcome’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-17, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>FIRST, I failed to mention and thank KFC for their awesome one-day
MLK Day sale and Bank Pacifica for the awesome adds over the internet
for Dr. King, as they even remembered it was his birthday which doesn’t
always fall on MLK Day which is the third Monday.  But the TRUTH and
REALITY is there are still some difficult days ahead on the mainland
with voting rights and equity in the CNMI which is part of the
“Promise-land” that Dr. King’s dreamed about for America. I say this
because “equality” still does NOT exist in the CNMI for all, which is
why the days ahead are going to be challenging, especially for those who
are “self-centered” in our society. But I blame previous leaders for
creating this environment of bigotry-racism laws and it’s going to take
a local person to lead the change in the CNMI towards equality for all,
as I’ve only been seen as the enemy by too many merely because I’m
considered an outsider. But I have to laugh to keep from crying, as my
MaDear would say, to see and know that a Chinese baby adopted by a local
has more RIGHTS than I or any American from the mainland do as a fellow
American citizen with all the local people in the AMERICAN Family. Even
the very law that “segregates Americans in Rights” is flawed with a
blood requirement for RIGHTS that won’t be sufficient in 20 years.</p>

<p>(AP) — Winter storms and cinema closures in North America didn’t
dampen the opening weekend for “Mean Girls.” The Paramount release,
adapted from the Broadway musical and the 2004 Tina Fey movie, earned
$28 million in its first three days in theaters according to studio
estimates Sunday. Not accounting for inflation, that’s more than the
$24.4 million the first movie made in its opening weekend.</p>

&amp; Kudos Joeten</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, updated: 2024-01-14, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH is Dr. King was REAL and what he did was historical as he
not only changed America but he even changed most of the world and today
is “a day on, not a day off” to promote his dream of “racial equality
for all people of color.”  The reality is the CNMI would look &amp; be
very different had it not been for Dr. King — for TRUE, believe it or
not! The Civil Rights Movement was not just about Blacks but about ALL
the People of color, which included the local population of Chamorros
&amp; Carolinians who would have gone to Black schools with me
back-in-the-day and called the “N-word” just like I was called.  MLK Day
is not just for Black folks and it is my sincere hopes and prayers that
ONE Day that THIS-DAY will truly be celebrated island-wide on the
beaches or wherever people can gather in celebration because the Civil
Rights Movement was for all people of color, especially the local people
who benefited from the end-results of the movement which was the 1964,
Civil Rights Act.</p>
