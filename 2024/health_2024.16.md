## Comprehensive assessment of HF-rTMS treatment mechanism for post-stroke dysphagia in rats by integration of fecal metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing

BackgroundThe mechanism by which high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) improves swallowing function by regulating intestinal flora remains unexplored. We aimed to evaluate this using fecal metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing.MethodsA Post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) rat model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. The magnetic stimulation group received HF-rTMS from the 7th day post-operation up to 14th day post-surgery. Swallowing function was assessed using a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to assess histopathological changes in the intestinal tissue. Intestinal flora levels were evaluated by sequencing the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region. Metabolite changes within the intestinal flora were evaluated by fecal metabolomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.ResultsVFSS showed that the bolus area and pharyngeal bolus speed were significantly decreased in PSD rats, while the bolus area increased and pharyngeal transit time decreased after HF-rTMS administration (p < 0.05). In the PSD groups, H&E staining revealed damaged surface epithelial cells and disrupted cryptal glands, whereas HF-rTMS reinforced the integrity of the intestinal epithelial cells. 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that PSD can disturb the intestinal flora and its associated metabolites, whereas HF-rTMS can significantly regulate the composition of the intestinal microflora. Firmicutes and Lactobacillus abundances were lower in the PSD group than in the baseline group at the phylum and genus levels, respectively; however, both increased after HF-rTMS administration. Levels of ceramides (Cer), free fatty acids (FA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), triacylglycerol (TAG), and sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol were increased in the PSD group. The Cer, FA, and DG levels decreased after HF-rTMS treatment, whereas the TAG levels increased. Peptococcaceae was negatively correlated with Cer, Streptococcus was negatively correlated with DG, and Acutalibacter was positively correlated with FA and Cer. However, these changes were effectively restored by HF-rTMS, resulting in recovery from dysphagia.ConclusionThese findings suggest a synergistic role for the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in the development of PSD and the therapeutic mechanisms underlying HF-rTMS.

## Development of a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification test for the sensitive, rapid, and economic detection of different genotypes of Classical swine fever virus

date: 2024-04-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundClassical swine fever virus (CSFV) remains one of the most important pathogens in animal health. Pathogen detection relies on viral RNA extraction followed by RT-qPCR. Novel technologies are required to improve diagnosis at the point of care.MethodsA loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) PCR technique was developed, with primers designed considering all reported CSFV genotypes. The reaction was tested using both fluorometric and colorimetric detection, in comparison to the gold standard technique. Viral strains from three circulating CSFV genotypes were tested, as well as samples from infected animals. Other pathogens were also tested, to determine the LAMP specificity. Besides laboratory RNA extraction methods, a heating method for RNA release, readily available for adaptation to field conditions was evaluated.ResultsThree primer sets were generated, with one of them showing better performance. This primer set proved capable of maintaining optimal performance at a wide range of amplification temperatures (60°C - 68°C). It was also able to detect CSFV RNA from the three genotypes tested. The assay was highly efficient in detection of samples from animals infected with field strains from two different genotypes, with multiple matrices being detected using both colorimetric and fluorometric methods. The LAMP assay was negative for all the unrelated pathogens tested, including Pestiviruses. The only doubtful result in both fluorometric and colorimetric LAMP was against the novel Pestivirus italiaense, ovine Italy Pestivirus (OVPV), which has proven to have cross-reaction with multiple CSFV diagnostic techniques. However, it is only possible to detect the OVPV in a doubtful result if the viral load is higher than 10000 viral particles.ConclusionThe results from the present study show that LAMP could be an important addition to the currently used molecular diagnostic techniques for CSFV. This technique could be used in remote locations, given that it can be adapted for successful use with minimal equipment and minimally invasive samples. The joined use of novel and traditional diagnostic techniques could prove to be a useful alternative to support the CSF control.
