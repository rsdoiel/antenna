analysis of antimalarial drug resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Malaria has always been a serious infectious disease prevalent in the
world. Antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and artemisinin have been
the main compounds used to treat malaria. However, the massive use of
this type of drugs accelerates the evolution and spread of malaria
parasites, leading to the development of resistance. A large number of
related data have been published by researchers in recent years.
CiteSpace software has gained popularity among us researchers in recent
years, because of its ability to help us obtain the core information we
want in a mass of articles. In order to analyze the hotspots and develop
trends in this field through visual analysis, this study used CiteSpace
software to summarize the available data in the literature to provide
insights.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Method
</title>
<p>
Relevant literature was collected from the Web of Science Core
Collection (WOSCC) from 1 January 2015 to 29 March 2023. CiteSpace
software and Microsoft Excel were used to analyze and present the data,
respectively.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 2,561 literatures were retrieved and 2,559 literatures were
included in the analysis after the removal of duplicates. An irrefutable
witness of the ever-growing interest in the topic of antimalarial drug
resistance could be expressed by the exponentially increased number of
publications and related citations from 2015 to 2022, and its sustained
growth trend by 2023. During the past 7 years, USA, Oxford University,
and David A Fidock are the country, institution, and author with the
most publications in this field of research, respectively. We focused on
the references and keywords from literature and found that the research
and development of new drugs is the newest hotspot in this field. A
growing number of scientists are devoted to finding new antimalarial
drugs.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
This study is the first visual metrological analysis of antimalarial
drug resistance, using bibliometric methods. As a baseline information,
it is important to analyze research output published globally on
antimalarial drug resistance. In order to better understand the current
research situation and future research plan agenda, such baseline data
are needed accordingly.

<h2 id="exploring-adjunctive-therapies-for-cerebral-malaria">Exploring
adjunctive therapies for cerebral malaria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Cerebral malaria (CM) is one of the most severe complications of malaria
infection characterized by coma and neurological effects. Despite
standardized treatment of malaria infection with artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACT), the mortality rate is still high, and it
primarily affects pediatric patients. ACT reduces parasitemia but fails
to adequately target the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CM, including
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial
activation/dysfunction, and hyperinflammation. The need for adjunctive
therapies to specifically treat this form of severe malaria is critical
as hundreds of thousands of people continue to die each year from this
disease. Here we present a summary of some potential promising
therapeutic targets and treatments for CM, as well as some that have
been tested and deemed ineffective or, in some cases, even deleterious.
Further exploration into these therapeutic agents is warranted to assess
the effectiveness of these potential treatments for CM patients.

knowledge, attitude, and perception towards monkeypox among healthcare
workers and medical students: an Egyptian cross-sectional study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Monkeypox (Mpox) is a re-emerging infectious disease representing a new
global challenge. It poses a substantial threat to countries,
particularly those with a low number of cases. Due to its popularity as
a tourist destination and its proximity to many African refugees, Egypt
is potentially at risk of Mpox importation. Therefore, effective disease
management necessitates healthcare workers (HCWs) to possess adept
knowledge, along with a positive attitude and behavior. The study aimed
to assess the knowledge, attitude, and perception of Egyptian HCWs and
medical students towards human Mpox.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The present cross-sectional study data was collected from participants
between October and December 2022 via a questionnaire. The questionnaire
comprised 31 questions in the knowledge section, 11 questions in the
attitude section, and 14 in the perception section.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The present study involved a total of 1,034 HCWs and medical students.
It was found that 55.3% of the participants demonstrated adequate
knowledge about Mpox, whereas 44.5% and 39.8% of the respondents
exhibited favorable attitudes and perceptions towards the disease,
respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that adequate
knowledge was significantly observed in ages older than 40 years
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), married participants
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and doctors (<italic>p</italic> &lt;
0.001). The positive attitude was significantly observed among the male
sex (<italic>p</italic> = 0.045), urban residents (<italic>p</italic> =
0.002), and nurses (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Conversely, married
participants (p = 0.013), doctors (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and
individuals employed in pharmacy and laboratory departments
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) experienced an increase in positive
perception.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Knowledge, attitude, and perception towards Mpox among Egyptian HCWs and
medical students exhibit suboptimal levels. Addressing these gaps is
crucial to controlling and effectively preventing disease transmission.

of next-generation sequencing for diagnosis of disseminated Bacillus
Calmette-Guerin disease with X-SCID in an infant: a case report and
literature review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Bacille Calmette-Guérin</italic> (BCG) is a live strain of
<italic>Mycobacteriu</italic>m <italic>bovis</italic>
(<italic>M.bovis</italic>) for use as an attenuated vaccine to prevent
<italic>tuberculosis</italic> (TB) infection, while it could also lead
to an infection in immunodeficient patients. <italic>M.bovis</italic>
could infect patients with immunodeficiency via BCG vaccination.
Disseminated BCG disease (BCGosis) is extremely rare and has a high
mortality rate. This article presents a case of a 3-month-old patient
with disseminated BCG infection who was initially diagnosed with
hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) and eventually found to have X-linked
severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). <italic>M.bovis</italic> and
its drug resistance genes were identified by metagenomics
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) combined with targeted next-generation
sequencing (tNGS) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Whole exome
sequencing (WES) revealed a pathogenic variant in the common γ-chain
gene (<italic>IL2RG</italic>), confirming X-SCID. Finally,
antituberculosis therapy and umbilical cord blood transplantation were
given to the patient. He was successfully cured of BCGosis, and his
immune function was restored. The mNGS combined with the tNGS provided
effective methods for diagnosing rare BCG infections in children. Their
combined application significantly improved the sensitivity and
specificity of the detection of <italic>M.bovis</italic>.
