id="transcriptome-and-proteomic-analysis-of-mpox-virus-f3l-expressing-cells">Transcriptome
and proteomic analysis of mpox virus F3L-expressing cells</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Monkeypox or mpox virus (mpox) is a double-stranded DNA virus that poses
a significant threat to global public health security. The F3 protein,
encoded by mpox, is an apoenzyme believed to possess a double-stranded
RNA-binding domain (dsRBD). However, limited research has been conducted
on its function. In this study, we present data on the transcriptomics
and proteomics of F3L-transfected HEK293T cells, aiming to enhance our
comprehension of F3L.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The gene expression profiles of pCAGGS-HA-F3L transfected HEK293T cells
were analyzed using RNA-seq. Proteomics was used to identify and study
proteins that interact with F3L. Real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA
levels of several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HEK293T cells
(or Vero cells) after the expression of F3 protein.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 14,822 genes were obtained in cells by RNA-Seq and 1,672 DEGs
were identified, including 1,156 up-regulated genes and 516
down-regulated genes. A total of 27 cellular proteins interacting with
F3 proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and 19 cellular proteins with large differences
in abundance ratios were considered to be candidate cellular proteins.
Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
enrichment analyses showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in
immune-related pathways, including type I interferon signaling pathway,
response to virus, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like
receptor signaling pathway, etc. Moreover, some selected DEGs were
further confirmed by real-time PCR and the results were consistent with
the transcriptome data. Proteomics data show that cellular proteins
interacting with F3 proteins are mainly related to RNA splicing and
protein translation.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Our analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data showed that (1) F3L
up-regulates the transcript levels of key genes in the innate immune
signaling pathway, such as <italic>RIGI, MDA5, IRF5, IRF7, IRF9, ISG15,
IFNA14</italic>, and elicits a broad spectrum of antiviral immune
responses in the host. F3L also increases the expression of the FOS and
JNK genes while decreasing the expression of TNFR2, these factors may
ultimately induce apoptosis. (2) F3 protein interacts with host proteins
involved in RNA splicing and protein translation, such as SNRNP70,
POLR2H, HNRNPA1, DDX17, etc. The findings of this study shed light on
the function of the F3 protein.

Crohn’s disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objectives
</title>
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Culture <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> ssp.
<italic>paratuberculosis</italic> (MAP)from blood, 2) assess infection
persistence, 3) determine Crohn’s disease (CD) cytokine expression, 4)
compare CD cytokine expression to tuberculosis, and 5) perform a
meta-analysis of cytokine expression in CD.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The Temple University/Abilene Christian University (TU/ACU) study had a
prospective case control design with 201 subjects including 61 CD
patients and 140 non-CD controls. The culture methods included MGIT,
TiKa and Pozzato broths, and were deemed MAP positive, if IS900 PCR
positive. A phage amplification assay was also performed to detect MAP.
Cytokine analysis of the TU/ACU samples was performed using Simple Plex
cytokine reagents on the Ella ELISA system. Statistical analyses were
done after log transformation using the R software package. The
meta-analysis combined three studies.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Most subjects had MAP positive blood cultures by one or more methods in
3 laboratories. In our cytokine study comparing CD to non-CD controls,
IL-17, IFNγ and TNFα were significantly increased in CD, but IL-2, IL-5,
IL-10 and GM-CSF were not increased. In the meta-analysis, IL-6, IL-8
and IL-12 were significantly increased in the CD patients.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Most subjects in our sample had MAP infection and 8 of 9 subjects
remained MAP positive one year later indicating persistent infection.
While not identical, cytokine expression patterns in MAP culture
positive CD patients in the TU/ACU study showed similarities (increased
IL-17, IFNγ and TNFα) to patterns of patients with Tuberculosis in other
studies, indicating the possibilities of similar mechanisms of pathogen
infection and potential strategies for treatment.

characterization of chicken infectious anaemia viruses isolated in Korea
and their pathogenicity in chicks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Chicken infectious anaemia virus (CIAV) causes severe anemia and
immunosuppression through horizontal or vertical transmission in young
chickens. Especially, vertical transmission of virus through the egg can
lead to significantly economic losses due to the increased mortality in
the broiler industry. Here, 28 CIAV complete sequences circulating in
Korea were first characterized using the newly designed primers.
Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete sequences revealed that CIAV
isolates were divided into four groups, IIa (2/28, 7.1%), IIb (9/28,
32.1%), IIIa (8/28, 28.6%) and IIIb (9/28, 32.1%), and exhibited a close
relationship to each other. The major groups were IIb, IIIa and IIIb,
and no strains were clustered with a vaccine strain available in Korea.
Also, for viral titration, we newly developed a quantitative PCR assay
that is highly sensitive, reliable and simple. To investigate the
pathogenicity of three major genotypes, 18R001(IIb), 08AQ017A(IIIa), and
17AD008(IIIb) isolates were challenged into one-day-old
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. Each CIAV strain caused anaemia,
severe growth retardation and immunosuppression in chickens regardless
of CIAV genotypes. Notably, a 17AD008 strain showed stable cellular
adaptability and higher virus titer <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as
higher pathogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, our study
provides valuable information to understand molecular characterization,
genetic diversity and pathogenicity of CIAV to improve management and
control of CIA in poultry farm.

<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is a common complication in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with chemotherapy or
immunotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of HBV reactivation
and its effect on survival in HCC patients treated with HAIC and
lenvatinib plus PD1s.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We retrospectively collected the data of 213 HBV-related HCC patients
who underwent HAIC and lenvatinib plus PD1s treatment between June 2019
to June 2022 at Sun Yat-sen University, China. The primary outcome was
the risk of HBV reactivation. The secondary outcomes were overall
survival (OS), progression−free survival (PFS), and treatment−related
adverse events.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Sixteen patients (7.5%) occurred HBV reactivation in our study. The
incidence of HBV reactivation was 5% in patients with antiviral
prophylaxis and 21.9% in patients without antiviral prophylaxis,
respectively. The logistic regression model indicated that for HBV
reactivation, lack of antiviral prophylaxis (<italic>P</italic>=0.003)
and tumor diameter (<italic>P</italic>=0.036) were independent risk
factors. The OS and PFS were significantly shorter in the HBV
reactivation group than the non-reactivation group
(<italic>P</italic>=0.0023 and <italic>P</italic>=0.00073,
respectively). The number of AEs was more in HBV reactivation group than
the non-reactivation group, especially hepatic AEs.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
HBV reactivation may occur in HCC patients treated with HAIC and
lenvatinib plus PD1s. Patients with HBV reactivation had shorter
survival time compared with non-reactivation. Therefore, HBV-related HCC
patients should undergo antiviral therapy and HBV-DNA monitoring before
and during the combination treatment.

analysis of antimalarial drug resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Malaria has always been a serious infectious disease prevalent in the
world. Antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and artemisinin have been
the main compounds used to treat malaria. However, the massive use of
this type of drugs accelerates the evolution and spread of malaria
parasites, leading to the development of resistance. A large number of
related data have been published by researchers in recent years.
CiteSpace software has gained popularity among us researchers in recent
years, because of its ability to help us obtain the core information we
want in a mass of articles. In order to analyze the hotspots and develop
trends in this field through visual analysis, this study used CiteSpace
software to summarize the available data in the literature to provide
insights.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Method
</title>
<p>
Relevant literature was collected from the Web of Science Core
Collection (WOSCC) from 1 January 2015 to 29 March 2023. CiteSpace
software and Microsoft Excel were used to analyze and present the data,
respectively.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 2,561 literatures were retrieved and 2,559 literatures were
included in the analysis after the removal of duplicates. An irrefutable
witness of the ever-growing interest in the topic of antimalarial drug
resistance could be expressed by the exponentially increased number of
publications and related citations from 2015 to 2022, and its sustained
growth trend by 2023. During the past 7 years, USA, Oxford University,
and David A Fidock are the country, institution, and author with the
most publications in this field of research, respectively. We focused on
the references and keywords from literature and found that the research
and development of new drugs is the newest hotspot in this field. A
growing number of scientists are devoted to finding new antimalarial
drugs.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
This study is the first visual metrological analysis of antimalarial
drug resistance, using bibliometric methods. As a baseline information,
it is important to analyze research output published globally on
antimalarial drug resistance. In order to better understand the current
research situation and future research plan agenda, such baseline data
are needed accordingly.

<h2 id="exploring-adjunctive-therapies-for-cerebral-malaria">Exploring
adjunctive therapies for cerebral malaria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Cerebral malaria (CM) is one of the most severe complications of malaria
infection characterized by coma and neurological effects. Despite
standardized treatment of malaria infection with artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACT), the mortality rate is still high, and it
primarily affects pediatric patients. ACT reduces parasitemia but fails
to adequately target the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CM, including
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial
activation/dysfunction, and hyperinflammation. The need for adjunctive
therapies to specifically treat this form of severe malaria is critical
as hundreds of thousands of people continue to die each year from this
disease. Here we present a summary of some potential promising
therapeutic targets and treatments for CM, as well as some that have
been tested and deemed ineffective or, in some cases, even deleterious.
Further exploration into these therapeutic agents is warranted to assess
the effectiveness of these potential treatments for CM patients.

knowledge, attitude, and perception towards monkeypox among healthcare
workers and medical students: an Egyptian cross-sectional study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Monkeypox (Mpox) is a re-emerging infectious disease representing a new
global challenge. It poses a substantial threat to countries,
particularly those with a low number of cases. Due to its popularity as
a tourist destination and its proximity to many African refugees, Egypt
is potentially at risk of Mpox importation. Therefore, effective disease
management necessitates healthcare workers (HCWs) to possess adept
knowledge, along with a positive attitude and behavior. The study aimed
to assess the knowledge, attitude, and perception of Egyptian HCWs and
medical students towards human Mpox.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The present cross-sectional study data was collected from participants
between October and December 2022 via a questionnaire. The questionnaire
comprised 31 questions in the knowledge section, 11 questions in the
attitude section, and 14 in the perception section.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The present study involved a total of 1,034 HCWs and medical students.
It was found that 55.3% of the participants demonstrated adequate
knowledge about Mpox, whereas 44.5% and 39.8% of the respondents
exhibited favorable attitudes and perceptions towards the disease,
respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that adequate
knowledge was significantly observed in ages older than 40 years
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), married participants
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and doctors (<italic>p</italic> &lt;
0.001). The positive attitude was significantly observed among the male
sex (<italic>p</italic> = 0.045), urban residents (<italic>p</italic> =
0.002), and nurses (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Conversely, married
participants (p = 0.013), doctors (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and
individuals employed in pharmacy and laboratory departments
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) experienced an increase in positive
perception.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Knowledge, attitude, and perception towards Mpox among Egyptian HCWs and
medical students exhibit suboptimal levels. Addressing these gaps is
crucial to controlling and effectively preventing disease transmission.

<p>
<italic>Bacille Calmette-Guérin</italic> (BCG) is a live strain of
<italic>Mycobacteriu</italic>m <italic>bovis</italic>
(<italic>M.bovis</italic>) for use as an attenuated vaccine to prevent
<italic>tuberculosis</italic> (TB) infection, while it could also lead
to an infection in immunodeficient patients. <italic>M.bovis</italic>
could infect patients with immunodeficiency via BCG vaccination.
Disseminated BCG disease (BCGosis) is extremely rare and has a high
mortality rate. This article presents a case of a 3-month-old patient
with disseminated BCG infection who was initially diagnosed with
hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) and eventually found to have X-linked
severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). <italic>M.bovis</italic> and
its drug resistance genes were identified by metagenomics
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) combined with targeted next-generation
sequencing (tNGS) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Whole exome
sequencing (WES) revealed a pathogenic variant in the common γ-chain
gene (<italic>IL2RG</italic>), confirming X-SCID. Finally,
antituberculosis therapy and umbilical cord blood transplantation were
given to the patient. He was successfully cured of BCGosis, and his
immune function was restored. The mNGS combined with the tNGS provided
effective methods for diagnosing rare BCG infections in children. Their
combined application significantly improved the sensitivity and
specificity of the detection of <italic>M.bovis</italic>.
