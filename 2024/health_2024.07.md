## Bibliometric analysis of antimalarial drug resistance

date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Malaria has always been a serious infectious disease prevalent in the world. Antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and artemisinin have been the main compounds used to treat malaria. However, the massive use of this type of drugs accelerates the evolution and spread of malaria parasites, leading to the development of resistance. A large number of related data have been published by researchers in recent years. CiteSpace software has gained popularity among us researchers in recent years, because of its ability to help us obtain the core information we want in a mass of articles. In order to analyze the hotspots and develop trends in this field through visual analysis, this study used CiteSpace software to summarize the available data in the literature to provide insights.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Relevant literature was collected from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) from 1 January 2015 to 29 March 2023. CiteSpace software and Microsoft Excel were used to analyze and present the data, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2,561 literatures were retrieved and 2,559 literatures were included in the analysis after the removal of duplicates. An irrefutable witness of the ever-growing interest in the topic of antimalarial drug resistance could be expressed by the exponentially increased number of publications and related citations from 2015 to 2022, and its sustained growth trend by 2023. During the past 7 years, USA, Oxford University, and David A Fidock are the country, institution, and author with the most publications in this field of research, respectively. We focused on the references and keywords from literature and found that the research and development of new drugs is the newest hotspot in this field. A growing number of scientists are devoted to finding new antimalarial drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first visual metrological analysis of antimalarial drug resistance, using bibliometric methods. As a baseline information, it is important to analyze research output published globally on antimalarial drug resistance. In order to better understand the current research situation and future research plan agenda, such baseline data are needed accordingly.</p></sec>

## Exploring adjunctive therapies for cerebral malaria

date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Cerebral malaria (CM) is one of the most severe complications of malaria infection characterized by coma and neurological effects. Despite standardized treatment of malaria infection with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT), the mortality rate is still high, and it primarily affects pediatric patients. ACT reduces parasitemia but fails to adequately target the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CM, including blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial activation/dysfunction, and hyperinflammation. The need for adjunctive therapies to specifically treat this form of severe malaria is critical as hundreds of thousands of people continue to die each year from this disease. Here we present a summary of some potential promising therapeutic targets and treatments for CM, as well as some that have been tested and deemed ineffective or, in some cases, even deleterious. Further exploration into these therapeutic agents is warranted to assess the effectiveness of these potential treatments for CM patients.</p>

## Grasping knowledge, attitude, and perception towards monkeypox among healthcare workers and medical students: an Egyptian cross-sectional study

date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Monkeypox (Mpox) is a re-emerging infectious disease representing a new global challenge. It poses a substantial threat to countries, particularly those with a low number of cases. Due to its popularity as a tourist destination and its proximity to many African refugees, Egypt is potentially at risk of Mpox importation. Therefore, effective disease management necessitates healthcare workers (HCWs) to possess adept knowledge, along with a positive attitude and behavior. The study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and perception of Egyptian HCWs and medical students towards human Mpox.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The present cross-sectional study data was collected from participants between October and December 2022 via a questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised 31 questions in the knowledge section, 11 questions in the attitude section, and 14 in the perception section.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The present study involved a total of 1,034 HCWs and medical students. It was found that 55.3% of the participants demonstrated adequate knowledge about Mpox, whereas 44.5% and 39.8% of the respondents exhibited favorable attitudes and perceptions towards the disease, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that adequate knowledge was significantly observed in ages older than 40 years (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), married participants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and doctors (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The positive attitude was significantly observed among the male sex (<italic>p</italic> = 0.045), urban residents (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002), and nurses (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Conversely, married participants (p = 0.013), doctors (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and individuals employed in pharmacy and laboratory departments (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) experienced an increase in positive perception.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Knowledge, attitude, and perception towards Mpox among Egyptian HCWs and medical students exhibit suboptimal levels. Addressing these gaps is crucial to controlling and effectively preventing disease transmission.</p></sec>

## Assistance of next-generation sequencing for diagnosis of disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin disease with X-SCID in an infant: a case report and literature review

date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Bacille Calmette-Guérin</italic> (BCG) is a live strain of <italic>Mycobacteriu</italic>m <italic>bovis</italic> (<italic>M.bovis</italic>) for use as an attenuated vaccine to prevent <italic>tuberculosis</italic> (TB) infection, while it could also lead to an infection in immunodeficient patients. <italic>M.bovis</italic> could infect patients with immunodeficiency via BCG vaccination. Disseminated BCG disease (BCGosis) is extremely rare and has a high mortality rate. This article presents a case of a 3-month-old patient with disseminated BCG infection who was initially diagnosed with hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) and eventually found to have X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). <italic>M.bovis</italic> and its drug resistance genes were identified by metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) combined with targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a pathogenic variant in the common γ-chain gene (<italic>IL2RG</italic>), confirming X-SCID. Finally, antituberculosis therapy and umbilical cord blood transplantation were given to the patient. He was successfully cured of BCGosis, and his immune function was restored. The mNGS combined with the tNGS provided effective methods for diagnosing rare BCG infections in children. Their combined application significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of <italic>M.bovis</italic>.</p>
