## Second Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy

date: 2024-01-08, updated: 2024-01-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Last month, I convened the Second Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy (<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2023/">IWORD 2023</a>) at the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center. As with <a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/">IWORD 2022</a>, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies, it would look very different. Representation would look different. Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation would look different. Everything would look different, because we would have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to worry about...</p>

## My upcoming FOSDEM 2024

date: 2024-01-08, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

I attended FOSDEM for the first time back in 2010. I have since been back and attended every single physical version of the conference since then (remember that it skipped a few years in the COVID days). FOSDEM is my favorite conference no doubt. I did a presentation in the embedded dev room in 2010. &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/08/my-upcoming-fosdem-2024/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">My upcoming FOSDEM 2024</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>
