<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden&amp;#8217;s botched rollout of a revamped financial aid form reveals a stunning lack of managerial competence. It has left colleges unable to tell millions of students how much they&amp;#8217;ll have to pay, causing some to delay enrolling and others to drop the idea altogether. This easily avoidable failure threatens to deprive low-income Americans of a college education.

Watch: HVO and collaborators continue seismic surveys across the active
volcanoes of Hawaii</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The Island of Hawai&amp;#8216;i is one of the most seismically active regions in the world. In the last five years, an average of 600-1200 earthquakes per week have been detected by the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. This regular rumble of activity across the island can be used to our advantage to assess the hazards that Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes represent.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;In a video address yesterday, former President Donald Trump reiterated the reality that states are currently in charge of determining abortion restrictions, a statement that was widely misinterpreted as his support for a state-based approach. That&amp;#8217;s just how he wanted it, winking to his anti-choice supporters while muddying the waters on whether he will seek nationwide abortion restrictions that he knows are hugely unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;
