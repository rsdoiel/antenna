<h2 id="challenges-players-face">Challenges players face</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Challenges players face
</h1>
<p>
I’m running Arden Vul as an open table. Sessions are generally less than
2h long. There are maybe a dozen players, maybe half of them regulars.
Arden Vul is a megadungeon. The PDF has about 1200 pages. There are many
entrances, many levels, many factions, and so on. As it is a
megadungeon, players can choose for themselves what difficulty level
they want to go for. Conversely, if there’s a new player with a level 1
character, they can all agree to stick to lower level characters in
order to make an adventure party that promises an entertaining evening
for all.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I’ve started noticing that the setup introduces some player
challenges that I hadn’t thought of.
</p>
<p>
If the party is powerful and the opposition is strong but clearly less
powerful, then frontal assaults “work” but at the same time the session
only lasts for a certain number of hours and endless fighting killing
many dozens of goblins, skeletons or cultists turns out to be somewhat
boring and sap away time. Even if the characters aren’t hurt, time is
lost.
</p>
<p>
This is a challenge that attacks player entertainment somewhat like
character death or long character creation, I feel.
</p>
<p>
You know how regular combat in the game attacks the player characters.
Some elements of it also attack player resources. This is mostly related
to character death. The result forces the player to do things they
dislike: start with a new character that has fewer levels, fewer
connections, less money, or incurs some other loss. Furthermore, if
character creation takes a very long time, then the player has to spend
the time thinking up a new build, a new concept.
</p>
<p>
In a way, an opposition that acts like a morass, wasting time unless the
players find another way to circumvent the problem, is a similar attack
upon the enjoyment of players. No amount of attack bonuses and
initiatives won helps against waves of undead if you can’t turn them or
hold them off some other way.
</p>
<p>
But there is more!
</p>
<p>
Since the megadungeon has a lot of doors and secrets that need keys, and
artefacts that are required for certain goals or quests, it’s important
to note who has what, and where it was found. I don’t want there to be a
virtual pool of plot items in a bag of holding that is always with the
group currently adventuring because even though everybody likes it now I
dread the first total party kill where I announce that all the plot
items are now lost. That’ll be the end of the campaign for sure.
</p>
<p>
I confess that I also hope on some level that knowing who has what
plot-relevant item increases interactivity as people start to realize
that for this or that to happen, they need to contact the player of the
character who’s the owner of a particular item.
</p>
<p>
But yes, if players stop showing up, their characters don’t show up and
the items they have, both magic items they found and plot items they
hold, effectively disappear from the game.
</p>
<p>
So this is an additional player challenge of their organisational
skills. Can they keep track of the items? Can they organise hand-overs?
</p>
<p>
Arden Vul is also a megadungeon where hints can be found in the hundreds
of rumours, wall scribbles, frescos, mosaics, and so on. But if nobody
collects and studies them, the information is effectively lost. If one
player keeps notes on paper, or in their Google Docs, that information
is effectively lost to the others.
</p>
<p>
I know that as a player in the Barrowmaze I’m also not a great organiser
of rumours heard and information gathered. There is space for
improvement!
</p>
<p>
So this is another player challenge: how to best share information. Can
they build a knowledge repository somewhere, that helps them distribute
information and collect hypothesises and conclusions?
</p>
<p>
The same is true about the ruins explored, entrances found, and perhaps
more importantly, the places where no entrances were found but also they
left before making absolutely sure. In a few sessions, players don’t
remember where they’ve been and they don’t remember whether an area was
fully explored. This duplicates effort and lost opportunities.
</p>
<p>
All in all, this is a sort of price to pay for the freedom players have
in this kind of setup.

think it’s fair to say that the new FeedLand, at
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a>, and running in
Automattic’s cloud, is stable, and performing nicely. So if you have an
account on <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>, the
original system, which is still running of course, you could now
reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML
subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import
the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be
fully updated, but you’ll be rewarded by a higher performance user
experience. Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and company for
giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven’t gotten
used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as
it seems it can.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a
kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it
online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them
off on family members’ and friends’ computers. This is likely how I got
the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape
Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as “page” and
“hyperlink”. Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since
then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what
its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a
2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try
and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the
application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website
has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be
completely out of reach for an antiquated tool. ↫ Pier-Luc Brault What a

id="google-is-no-longer-bringing-the-full-chrome-browser-to-fuchsia">Google
is no longer bringing the full Chrome browser to Fuchsia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working
to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet
another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart
home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good
is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia
project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia
was first shown to run on Google’s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the
intervening time – a period that also saw significant layoffs in the
Fuchsia division – it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a
different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a
Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month
declaring that the “Chrome browser on fuchsia won’t be maintained.” ↫
Kyle Bradshaw at 9To5Google Up until a few years ago, every indication
was that Google had big plans for Fuchsia, from “workstation” builds to
porting Chrome to developers using Fuchsia for Google Meet calls, and
lots of other improvements, changes, and additions that pointed squarely
at Fuchsia being prepped for use on more than just the Nest Hub devices.
We’re about a year later now, and everything has changed. The
workstation builds have been discontinued, the Fuchsia team was hit
harder by the Google layoffs than other teams, and now the Chrome port
has been deprecated. All signs now point to Fuchsia being effectively a
dead end beyond its use on Hub devices. At least Google had the decency
to kill this before it released it.</p>

id="effortless-openbsd-audio-and-desktop-screen-recording-guide">Effortless
OpenBSD audio and desktop screen recording guide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome to my comprehensive guide on recording audio and desktop
screen on OpenBSD. In this blog post, I’m excited to share my personal
setup and approach to efficiently capturing high-quality audio and video
on one of the most secure and stable operating systems available.
Whether you’re a professional content creator, a developer looking to
record tutorials, or simply an OpenBSD enthusiast, this guide is
tailored to help you navigate the intricacies of screen recording in
this unique environment. Alongside this step-by-step tutorial, I’ve also
included a practical YouTube video to demonstrate the quality and
effectiveness of the recordings you can achieve with this setup. So,
let’s dive in and explore the world of audio and video recording on
OpenBSD! ↫ Rafael Sadowski The BSD world needs more of these kinds of
guides and articles. I feel like the various BSDs have so much to offer
to desktop users, especially now that there is a reasonable contingent
of Linux users who aren’t happy with the spread of things like systemd
and Wayland, but the fact of the matter is that the BSDs are not as
focused on desktop and laptop use as Linux has been. That’s not a dig at
BSD developers – BSD focuses on different things – but it does mean that
people interested in using BSD on desktops and laptops need a bit more
assistance.</p>

<h2 id="not-a-collector-but">Not a collector, but…</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
You might look at my office and the 32 plastic robot models on my shelf
and think “This guy is a collector!” Or you might look a the bass
guitar, electric guitar, long neck open back banjo, closed back
resonator banjo, tuba, saxaphone, ukelele, and <em>shamisen</em> in my
office and think, “Hey, this guy is a collector!” Or you might look at
all the books, comics, or records in my office and think, “This guy
knows how to collect!”
</p>
<p>
But you would be wrong.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a collector, I’m a serial project starter.
</p>
<p>
Each of those plastic models is the outcome of a project. You don’t look
at a knitter’s socks and blankets and say “Wow, look at this yarn
collector!” The same with the instruments; it’s not a collection of
world instruments so much as evidence of an obsession for learning about
objects that produce sound. The records? Well… most of those are from my
step-father who –beyond tools he used for home improvement projects–
wasn’t a collector either.
</p>
<p>
I know collectors with great collections. My uncle is an avid collector
and his house is pretty much the town’s museum stuffed with old WW2
memorabilia. His collections also live at the local VA and the old train
depot (which is now a museum). I admire people who collect, organize,
catalog, and arrange. That archivist nature is a superskill.
</p>
<p>
Me? I suppose I have some inadvertent collections of similar objects,
but I don’t fancy myself a collector. I don’t need more possessions in
my life. But if there’s a project… well, don’t mind if I do.

<h2 id="on-enjoying-the-process">On enjoying the process</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Working on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of
journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey
itself. It’s easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I’m working
through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with
my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the
process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable.
Because there’s no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable
part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes,
experimenting, getting hurt. It’s all part of the process and it’s what
makes the journey enjoyable.

<h2 id="howto-change-your-behavior">HOWTO: Change your behavior</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Matt Might blog</p>
<p>
In theory, behavior change should be easy.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, it seems like <em>you</em> control your behavior.
</p>
<p>
So, if you desire different behavior, why doesn’t your behavior change
as instantly as your desire to change it?
</p>
<p>
In short, lasting change of habitual behaviors is a multi-stage process.
</p>
<p>
In 1977, as psychologists James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente were
studying the behavior of smokers, they identified these stages.
</p>
<p>
Their
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X?pd_rd_i=038072572X&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmamzn06-20&amp;linkId=10d08f55149cd797828a0557f1a1594b&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">transtheoretical
model of behavior change</a> captures the process of behavior change in
six different stages: (1) precontemplation; (2) contemplation; (3)
preparation; (4) action; (5) maintenance; and (6) relapse.
</p>
<p><img src="images/dall-e-escher-ttm.png" class="abstract-image" /></p>
<center>
<em>DALL-E’s depiction of behavior change in the transtheoretical
model.</em>
</center>
<p>
In the years since, this landmark model has been found to be applicable
to many habitual human behaviors.
</p>
<p>
The key takeaway is that the odds of successful long-term behavior
change improve if you calibrate your strategy to the stage of change
you’re in.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this article is to provide an actionable summary of this
model and interventions for each stage, so that you can more effectively
change your behavior in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the model may also help you to understand why you may have
struggled with behavior change in the past.
</p>
<p>

scientific literature and my own lived experience. I am not a mental
health professional, and if you are struggling with behavior change or
any other mental health condition, please immediately consult a

</p>
<p>
At CES 2024, I had the opportunity to chat with Eben Upton, Raspberry
Pi’s CEO. We discussed the future of AI on the Pi, RP2040’s successor,
the impending launch of Compute Module 5, and current production rates
of Pi 4 and Pi 5 computers—Raspberry Pi’s bread and butter.
</p>
<p>
The news is good: currently (as of last week), they are manufacturing Pi
5 at a rate of 70,000 per week. By the end of January? 90,000 per week.
</p>
<p>
That would put manufacturing capacity for Pi 5 alone at 400,000 units
<em>every month</em>.

mystique of Substack in retreat, now – if we had a proper identity

world up to email, ie newsletters, and preserve choice, and be able to
build editors that were more than
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/14/tinyLittleTextBox.png">tiny
little textboxes</a>. I was part of the PC wave in the 80s when writing
tools advanced incredibly quickly. So many directions – from
line-oriented editors on Unix and early Apples, to
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/0cfe7783-d6aa-4350-9d32-f9a81efc8e4b">screen

outliners for thinking and presentations. In the same time period
programming changed from something requiring a million dollar investment
in hardware and infrastructure, to something most students could afford.
Just ten years. Since then our world has been reduced to copying and
pasting into tiny text boxes. The question is bigger than if we need
journalism, the question is do we need writers?</p>

</p>
<p>
He says:
</p>
<p>
We are firmly on a path to chaos. We continue to pour greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere. Here is our track record for the period 1990-2022:

<p>
Graph sourced from this report:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All sectors apart from transport have fully rebounded from the drop in
emissions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and now exceed 2019 levels.
CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes were
the main contributors to the overall increase, accounting for about two
thirds of current GHG emissions. Emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases), which have higher global
warming potentials and account for about one quarter of current GHG
emissions, are increasing rapidly: in 2022, F-gas emissions grew by 5.5
per cent, followed by CH4 at 1.8 per cent and N2O at 0.9 per cent. –

<p>
As a result of the above, 2023 ended as the hottest year on record at
+1.45°C above the preindustrial average, based on the six international
climate datasets.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The annual average global temperature approached 1.5° Celsius above
pre-industrial levels – symbolic because the Paris Agreement on climate
change aims to limit the long-term temperature increase (averaged over
decades rather than an individual year like 2023) to no more than 1.5°
Celsius above pre-industrial levels. –

<p>
At time of writing, using the standard decadal averages, we have
currently heated by about +1.29ºC above the preindustrial average using
four of the above datasets.

This number shows an up-to-the-second assessment of human-induced global
warming since the second half of the 19th century. –

<p>
The consequences of a world that has heated by +1.3ºC has become very
clear during the past year. Here is a month-by-month look at the extreme
events of 2023.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The number of global extreme weather events has seen a “staggering rise”
in the past 30 years, said the United Nations, and experts warn climate
change is “supercharging” the problem, per The Associated Press. –

<p>
With the emission trajectory for both CO₂ and Methane still increasing,
the earth will continue to heat. There is no negotiation with the
physics of this.

</p>
<p>
With our fossil fuel burning ways entrenched, we are firmly on track to
pass the 1.5°C threshold in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Various groups have attempted to extrapolate when exactly this will
become the earth’s permanent background baseline temperature.
</p>
<p>
Here is a projection from Berkley Earth:

</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-5.png" alt="Global warming reaches 1.5°C by November 2033" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Global warming reached an estimated 1.26°C in December 2023. If the
30-year warming trend leading up then continued, global warming would
reach 1.5°C by November 2033. –

temperature trend monitor</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are others, like Dr James Hanson et al, who believe that these
estimates are too conservative and that we will arrive at this threshold
much sooner as they illustrate below.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-6.png" alt="Global temperature will continue to grow in the next 5-8 months, carrying the 12-month running-mean to at least 1.6-1.7°C" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We expect record monthly temperatures to continue into mid-2024 due to
the present large planetary energy imbalance, with the 12- month
running-mean global temperature reaching +1.6-1.7°C relative to
1880-1920 and falling to only +1.4 ± 0.1°C during the following La Nina.
Considering the large planetary energy imbalance, it will be clear that
the world is passing through the 1.5°C ceiling, and is headed much
higher, unless steps are taken to affect Earth’s energy imbalance. –

Warming Acceleration: Causes and Consequences</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whichever of the above projections end up being what transpires in
reality, we know for sure that we are going to smash right past the
1.5°C threshold sometime between 2024 and 2033.
</p>
<p>
The devastation we witnessed in 2023 at +1.3°C of heating will seem mild
as we reach higher levels of heating. We now also have solid research
that shows crossing 1.5°C permanently, will set in motion tipping points
that will unleash even more climate chaos as a result of their cascading
effects.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Climate system tipping elements are components of the Earth system
susceptible to a tipping point, that is, a critical threshold beyond
which the system reorganises, often abruptly and/or irreversibly.
Improved scientific understanding has shown that triggering climate
system tipping points already this century cannot be ruled out, far
sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously assumed. The goal
of this chapter is to review the state of knowledge of climate system

Our current response to what the physics requires to slow the emissions
freight train is nothing short of a joke. The current policies put us on
track for a +2.7°C world. Talk about an overshoot!
</p>
<p>
The UNEP on what is required starting immediately:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To reach emission levels consistent with a below 2°C pathway in 2030,
the cuts required per year are now 5.3 per cent from 2024, reaching 8.7
per cent per year on average for the 1.5°C pathway. To compare, the fall
in total global GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic was 4.7 per cent. –

Record: Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions
(again)</a>, by the UN environment programme.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As we start 2024 there is NO indication that we have any intent to
approach this with the same urgency and determination which was
displayed during the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Look around, it’s all business as usual.
</p>
<p>
As as result we are, as the UN Secretary General put it, “on a highway
to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.”
</p>
<p>
Right now, there are billions of people on the frontlines of this.
</p>
<p>
We are entering the period of climate induced chaos.

<p>It makes sense that AI is coming into existence at the time the human
species, and most living things on the planet, appear about to cease to
exist. It’s possible that we are just building our successor. A sort of
ark of intellect. It would make sense, if there is a Creator, that they
would arrange things this way. Just-in-time species reboot.</p>

<h2 id="stitch-images-together-with-stitchy">Stitch images together with
Stitchy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
From time to time I need to stitch together two or three images into a
horizontal or vertical image. It seems so wasteful to spin up a whole
design document for that task. What I wanted was a CLI that does that
for me and I found one that does the job: Stitchy.
</p>
<h2>
How to use Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy is a Rust package that does what it says on the tin, it stitches
images together.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Install Rust and
Cargo</a>
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">--proto</span> <span class="s1">'=https'</span> <span class="nt">--tlsv1</span>.2 <span class="nt">-sSf</span> https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Install <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/stitchy">Stitchy</a>
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">cargo <span class="nb">install </span>stitchy
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Use Stitchy
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy image1.png image2.png
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
If you’re feeling even lazier and don’t want to type file names, you can
have Stitchy grab the <code>n</code> latest images in the directory
and/or set the <code>–order</code> flag to <code>alphabetical</code>.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--order</span><span class="o">=</span>alphabetical 
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
Stitchy for responsive images
</h2>
<p>
By default Stitchy will assemble the images in order in a tight grid.
Where Stitchy shines is generating responsive images where you might
show a grid of images on mobile and a horizontal filmstrip on desktop.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4     <span class="c"># layout images in a grid</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">-h</span>  <span class="c"># layout images horizontally</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Here’s an example of a responsive image treatment I did on
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/12/vibe-check-30/">a recent Vibe
Check</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a horizontal row" />
</p>
<figcaption>
The desktop version of the last four books I’ve read
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
If you resize your browser to a smaller viewport, you can see how the
wide but short image loses hierarchy and readability on mobile, so I
used <code>stitchy</code> to cut a new version for desktop.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read-mobile.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a staggered grid" />
</p>
<figcaption>
The mobile version of the last four books I’ve read
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
No one noticed I did this, no one said “thanks”, but these types of
small touches are my favorite responsive techniques.
</p>
<h2>
Other things Stitchy can do
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy gives you a bit more control in setting a <code>–maxw</code> or
<code>–maxh</code> if that’s part of the effect. You can also set the
output format to <code>–jpg</code> or <code>–png</code> if needed as
well as control the <code>–quality</code>.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--png</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--jpg</span> <span class="nt">--quality</span><span class="o">=</span>75
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
Enjoy Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
And that’s Stitchy! It’s pretty handy if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
I wrote this post because I use it so infrequently and there’s not much
documentation beyond the <code>–help</code> command, so I wanted to have
this to remember how to use it.
