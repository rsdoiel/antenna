<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>Researchers analyzing images from NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope
have found that galaxies in the early universe are often flat and
elongated, like surfboards and pool noodles ‚Äì and are rarely round, like
volleyballs or frisbees. ‚ÄúRoughly 50 to 80% of the galaxies we studied
appear to be flattened in two dimensions,‚Äù explained lead author [‚Ä¶]</p>

the same concern I have, why didn‚Äôt we work together on this Manton? Two

<p>ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out
on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they‚Äôre always there, and not
too busy to help out. They know everything you don‚Äôt know and need to
know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a
human btw). It‚Äôs remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human
programming partner. It‚Äôs the kind of helper I aspire to be.</p>

<h2 id="dos-revisited">86-DOS revisited</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, the oldest known versions of DOS were uploaded to the
internet, and Michal Necasek dove into the floppy images. Even after
more than 40 years(!), old software releases and pre-releases can still
surface. In the case of 86-DOS 0.11 and 0.34 it‚Äôs practically a miracle,
since there were probably never very many copies in existence. For the
first time since the early 1980s, FAT formatted floppies with the
primordial 16-byte directory entry format have come to light. The old
16-byte directory entries were gone by 86-DOS 1.0 in April 1981 and of
course never appeared in any public PC DOS release. These prehistoric
versions of 86-DOS allow us to fill in further missing pieces in the
puzzle of DOS origins. It is fascinating to follow how DOS developed
from almost nothing to a multi-million dollar business in the course of
just a few years. ‚Ü´ Michal Necasek It started out so humbly. Yet, here
we are, in 2024, and variants of DOS still have their uses in certain
niches. An incredible legacy, for sure.</p>

id="a-shocking-amount-of-the-web-is-machine-translated-insights-from-multi-way-parallelism">A
shocking amount of the web is machine translated: insights from
multi-way parallelism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>We show that content on the web is often translated into many
languages, and the low quality of these multi-way translations indicates
they were likely created using Machine Translation (MT). Multi-way
parallel, machine generated content not only dominates the translations
in lower resource languages; it also constitutes a large fraction of the
total web content in those languages. We also find evidence of a
selection bias in the type of content which is translated into many
languages, consistent with low quality English content being translated
en masse into many lower resource languages, via MT. Our work raises
serious concerns about training models such as multilingual large
language models on both monolingual and bilingual data scraped from the
web. ‚Ü´ Brian Thompson, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Peter Frisch, Tobias
Domhan, Marcello Federico As a translator myself, this is entirely
unsurprising. Translating is a craft, a skill, and much like with any
other craft, you get what you pay for. If you pay your translator(s) a
good rate, you get a good translation. If you pay your translator(s) a
shit rate, you get a shit translation. If you pay nothing, you get
nothing. I‚Äôm definitely seeing more and more people in my industry
integrate machine translations, but so far, it‚Äôs not been an actual
issue ‚Äì I have no qualms about accepting a job where I take a
machine-translated text and whip it into shape and turn it into a
human-readable, quality translation‚Ä¶ As long as people pay me a
reasonable rate for it. Working from a machine translation is often
quicker and easier, so the going rate obviously reflects that. The
quality of machine translations is absolutely atrocious, however, and
the idea of relying on it for texts other people ‚Äì customers, clients,
employees, etc. ‚Äì are actually supposed to read and work from is
terrifying. Google Translate is an effective tool for personal use, but
throwing, I don‚Äôt know, your product‚Äôs manual at it and dumping the
unedited result onto your customers is borderline criminal. Pay nothing,
get nothing.</p>

<h2 id="wobblybox-a-web-component-for-wobbly-boxes">WobblyBox, a web
component for wobbly boxes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
For years the latest articles list on my homepage had a neat little CSS
trick where each post had wobbly ‚Äúrough boxes‚Äù around them. To create
the effect I used a script from
<a href="http://css-houdini.rocks">css-houdini.rocks</a> aptly named
<a href="https://css-houdini.rocks/rough-boxes/">Rough Boxes</a>. One
minor problem, CSS Houdini paintlets aren‚Äôt ‚Äì <em>and probably never
will be</em> ‚Äì¬†cross-browser.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230326062701/http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">Do
websites have to look the same in every browser? No.</a> But after half
a decade of not seeing those wobbly boxes on iOS, I decided to abandon
Houdini and draw my own quirky boxes‚Ä¶ so I made a web component that you
can use today called <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code>!
</p>
<p>
<a class="button" href="https://github.com/davatron5000/wobbly-box">View
on GitHub</a>
</p>
<h2>
Introducing WobblyBox
</h2>
<p>
WobblyBox is a web component for drawing wobbly boxes around your
content. Copy or
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wobbly-box">install</a> the file
into your project then wrap any element you want WobblyBox around with
the <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code> Custom Element.
</p>
<wobbly-box>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"module"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"wobbly-box.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</span>
    Any content goes here
<span class="nt">&lt;/wobbly-box&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</wobbly-box>
<h2>
Making a WobblyBox with SVG and Border-Image
</h2>
<p>
I wanted something as simple as the Houdini script so I started looking
at porting the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>-based paintlet script but
couldn‚Äôt get over the feeling that SVG might be the best fit.
</p>
<p>
Inside every SVG path there are some little commands in the path string.
Some you may already know like <code>M</code> is for ‚Äúmove‚Äù,
<code>Z</code> is for ‚Äúterminate‚Äù, <code>L</code> is for ‚Äúline‚Äù. One I
didn‚Äôt know about was <code>Q</code> which creates a point on the path
and bends the path towards that point in a bit of an arc.
</p>
<p>
<code>Q</code> was a major unlocking for the effect because drawing a
box in SVG is relatively easy. Here‚Äôs a 100x100 box inset 5px from the
edge to account for wobble.
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">"M5,5 95,5 95,95 5,95 5,5Z"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The next step was adding in <code>Q</code> points on the path in between
the points that make my box wobble‚Ä¶
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">"M5,5 Q50,0 95,5 Q100,50 95,95 Q50,100 5,95 Q0,50 5,5Z"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
I wanted a bit of randomization in the borders, just like the original
so I used JavaScript to generate random <code>Q</code> values within a
few pixels positive or negative. I made some artistic choices to make it
not completely random and have the top and bottom sides have the same
bend while the inline sides of the box mirror each other.
</p>
<p>
The final step was to get this box I made to surround the content. I had
an <em>image</em> that I wanted to use as a <em>border</em>‚Ä¶ so I
thought the not-often-used <code>border-image</code> property might be
appropriate.
</p>
<wobbly-box>
<p>
<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/css-border-image-property/"><code>border-image</code>
is a complex but awesome property</a>. To be honest, I avoid
<code>border-image</code> in my day-to-day because of its complexity,
but it seemed well-suited here. It creates a 9-slice border box around
an element. With a single image and some magic numbers you the images
crops and repeats the image appropriately to surround the element. Back
in the wild west days of the internet this was a popular technique but
required a lot of extra divs. I think <code>border-radius</code> and the
death of skeuomorphism ultimately depopularized the technique.
</p>
</wobbly-box>
<p>
Then I wrapped it all up in a web component because that seemed like the
easiest delivery vehicle. I‚Äôm happy with the final effect and it‚Äôs close
to what I had before except that it avoids redrawing the entire border
on resize, so that‚Äôs a plus.
</p>
<h2>
Not a big roadmap
</h2>
<p>
I could have ‚Äì maybe should have ‚Äì used a pre-existing solution like
<a href="https://wiredjs.com/">WiredJS components</a>. I like how
WiredJS looks, especially for rough prototyping, but it‚Äôs probably
overkill for my little boxes. I like how simple
<code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code> is; more cartoony and a lot more dumb.
</p>
<p>
If I were to make some improvements, there‚Äôs three big ticket items I‚Äôm
considering‚Ä¶
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It‚Äôd be cool to control <code>‚Äìwobble</code>, <code>‚Äìthickness</code>,
as well as <code>‚Äìborder-color</code>
</li>
<li>
Get rid of magic numbers
</li>
<li>
Sometimes there‚Äôs a little ‚Äútuck‚Äù in the corners due to how CSS‚Äôs
9-slice borders works, I‚Äôve tried to nudge those but it‚Äôs imperfect.
It‚Äôs kind of cute, so potentially worth keeping.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But those improvements are not for today! I just needed this to work on
Safari and Firefox.

<h2 id="if-a-human-does-it">If a human does it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs just state the obvious here: AIs are not human. Should be obvious
but apparently it‚Äôs not. I say it‚Äôs not because the amount of people who
justify all sorts of shitty behavior coming from people working on AI
models is astounding.
</p>
<p>
And the reasoning it‚Äôs always the same: it‚Äôs ok for an AI model to do X
because if a human were to also do X the results would be the same.
Which is a completely idiotic way of reasoning. And it‚Äôs idiotic for a
few reasons.
</p>
<p>
First, if a human were to spend their time learning how to draw and
paint in the style of 4000 different artists you‚Äôd be dead before
getting halfway through that list. The same is true for any other stupid
example.
</p>
<p>
And second, if a human were to do that we‚Äôd all condemn it pretty
quickly because it goes against everything we find valuable. When a big
company rips off a smaller artist everyone yells and screams. But now
that AIs are doing the same that‚Äôs fine because they‚Äôre clearly not
ripping off anyone, they‚Äôre just taking inspiration, like humans would
do.
</p>
<p>
Except that if fucking Disney were to ‚Äújust take inspiration‚Äù and steal
designs from smaller artists we‚Äôd all be enraged, and for good reasons.
</p>
<p>
So please, cut the bullshit. Train your goddamn AI on whatever you want,
<a href="https://nitter.net/JonLamArt/status/1741545927435784424" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">steal
all the content</a>, but at least be honest and feel some shame.

<h2 id="challenges-players-face">Challenges players face</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1>
Challenges players face
</h1>
<p>
I‚Äôm running Arden Vul as an open table. Sessions are generally less than
2h long. There are maybe a dozen players, maybe half of them regulars.
Arden Vul is a megadungeon. The PDF has about 1200 pages. There are many
entrances, many levels, many factions, and so on. As it is a
megadungeon, players can choose for themselves what difficulty level
they want to go for. Conversely, if there‚Äôs a new player with a level 1
character, they can all agree to stick to lower level characters in
order to make an adventure party that promises an entertaining evening
for all.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I‚Äôve started noticing that the setup introduces some player
challenges that I hadn‚Äôt thought of.
</p>
<p>
If the party is powerful and the opposition is strong but clearly less
powerful, then frontal assaults ‚Äúwork‚Äù but at the same time the session
only lasts for a certain number of hours and endless fighting killing
many dozens of goblins, skeletons or cultists turns out to be somewhat
boring and sap away time. Even if the characters aren‚Äôt hurt, time is
lost.
</p>
<p>
This is a challenge that attacks player entertainment somewhat like
character death or long character creation, I feel.
</p>
<p>
You know how regular combat in the game attacks the player characters.
Some elements of it also attack player resources. This is mostly related
to character death. The result forces the player to do things they
dislike: start with a new character that has fewer levels, fewer
connections, less money, or incurs some other loss. Furthermore, if
character creation takes a very long time, then the player has to spend
the time thinking up a new build, a new concept.
</p>
<p>
In a way, an opposition that acts like a morass, wasting time unless the
players find another way to circumvent the problem, is a similar attack
upon the enjoyment of players. No amount of attack bonuses and
initiatives won helps against waves of undead if you can‚Äôt turn them or
hold them off some other way.
</p>
<p>
But there is more!
</p>
<p>
Since the megadungeon has a lot of doors and secrets that need keys, and
artefacts that are required for certain goals or quests, it‚Äôs important
to note who has what, and where it was found. I don‚Äôt want there to be a
virtual pool of plot items in a bag of holding that is always with the
group currently adventuring because even though everybody likes it now I
dread the first total party kill where I announce that all the plot
items are now lost. That‚Äôll be the end of the campaign for sure.
</p>
<p>
I confess that I also hope on some level that knowing who has what
plot-relevant item increases interactivity as people start to realize
that for this or that to happen, they need to contact the player of the
character who‚Äôs the owner of a particular item.
</p>
<p>
But yes, if players stop showing up, their characters don‚Äôt show up and
the items they have, both magic items they found and plot items they
hold, effectively disappear from the game.
</p>
<p>
So this is an additional player challenge of their organisational
skills. Can they keep track of the items? Can they organise hand-overs?
</p>
<p>
Arden Vul is also a megadungeon where hints can be found in the hundreds
of rumours, wall scribbles, frescos, mosaics, and so on. But if nobody
collects and studies them, the information is effectively lost. If one
player keeps notes on paper, or in their Google Docs, that information
is effectively lost to the others.
</p>
<p>
I know that as a player in the Barrowmaze I‚Äôm also not a great organiser
of rumours heard and information gathered. There is space for
improvement!
</p>
<p>
So this is another player challenge: how to best share information. Can
they build a knowledge repository somewhere, that helps them distribute
information and collect hypothesises and conclusions?
</p>
<p>
The same is true about the ruins explored, entrances found, and perhaps
more importantly, the places where no entrances were found but also they
left before making absolutely sure. In a few sessions, players don‚Äôt
remember where they‚Äôve been and they don‚Äôt remember whether an area was
fully explored. This duplicates effort and lost opportunities.
</p>
<p>
All in all, this is a sort of price to pay for the freedom players have
in this kind of setup.

Automattic‚Äôs cloud, is stable, and performing nicely. So if you have an
account on <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>, the
original system, which is still running of course, you could now
reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML
subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import
the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be
fully updated, but you‚Äôll be rewarded by a higher performance user
experience. Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and company for
giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven‚Äôt gotten
used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as

2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a
kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it
online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them
off on family members‚Äô and friends‚Äô computers. This is likely how I got
the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape
Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as ‚Äúpage‚Äù and
‚Äúhyperlink‚Äù. Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since
then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what
its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a
2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try
and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the
application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website
has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be
completely out of reach for an antiquated tool. ‚Ü´ Pier-Luc Brault What a
fun exercise.</p>

is no longer bringing the full Chrome browser to Fuchsia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working
to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet
another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart
home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good
is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia
project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia
was first shown to run on Google‚Äôs Pixelbook hardware. However, in the
intervening time ‚Äì a period that also saw significant layoffs in the
Fuchsia division ‚Äì it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a
different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a
Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month
declaring that the ‚ÄúChrome browser on fuchsia won‚Äôt be maintained.‚Äù ‚Ü´
Kyle Bradshaw at 9To5Google Up until a few years ago, every indication
was that Google had big plans for Fuchsia, from ‚Äúworkstation‚Äù builds to
porting Chrome to developers using Fuchsia for Google Meet calls, and
lots of other improvements, changes, and additions that pointed squarely
at Fuchsia being prepped for use on more than just the Nest Hub devices.
We‚Äôre about a year later now, and everything has changed. The
workstation builds have been discontinued, the Fuchsia team was hit
harder by the Google layoffs than other teams, and now the Chrome port
has been deprecated. All signs now point to Fuchsia being effectively a
dead end beyond its use on Hub devices. At least Google had the decency
to kill this before it released it.</p>

OpenBSD audio and desktop screen recording guide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome to my comprehensive guide on recording audio and desktop
screen on OpenBSD. In this blog post, I‚Äôm excited to share my personal
setup and approach to efficiently capturing high-quality audio and video
on one of the most secure and stable operating systems available.
Whether you‚Äôre a professional content creator, a developer looking to
record tutorials, or simply an OpenBSD enthusiast, this guide is
tailored to help you navigate the intricacies of screen recording in
this unique environment. Alongside this step-by-step tutorial, I‚Äôve also
included a practical YouTube video to demonstrate the quality and
effectiveness of the recordings you can achieve with this setup. So,
let‚Äôs dive in and explore the world of audio and video recording on
OpenBSD! ‚Ü´ Rafael Sadowski The BSD world needs more of these kinds of
guides and articles. I feel like the various BSDs have so much to offer
to desktop users, especially now that there is a reasonable contingent
of Linux users who aren‚Äôt happy with the spread of things like systemd
and Wayland, but the fact of the matter is that the BSDs are not as
focused on desktop and laptop use as Linux has been. That‚Äôs not a dig at
BSD developers ‚Äì BSD focuses on different things ‚Äì but it does mean that
people interested in using BSD on desktops and laptops need a bit more
assistance.</p>

anyone else would either, if they were to spend a bit of time thinking

<h2 id="not-a-collector-but">Not a collector, but‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
You might look at my office and the 32 plastic robot models on my shelf
and think ‚ÄúThis guy is a collector!‚Äù Or you might look a the bass
guitar, electric guitar, long neck open back banjo, closed back
resonator banjo, tuba, saxaphone, ukelele, and <em>shamisen</em> in my
office and think, ‚ÄúHey, this guy is a collector!‚Äù Or you might look at
all the books, comics, or records in my office and think, ‚ÄúThis guy
knows how to collect!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But you would be wrong.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm not a collector, I‚Äôm a serial project starter.
</p>
<p>
Each of those plastic models is the outcome of a project. You don‚Äôt look
at a knitter‚Äôs socks and blankets and say ‚ÄúWow, look at this yarn
collector!‚Äù The same with the instruments; it‚Äôs not a collection of
world instruments so much as evidence of an obsession for learning about
objects that produce sound. The records? Well‚Ä¶ most of those are from my
step-father who ‚Äìbeyond tools he used for home improvement projects‚Äì
wasn‚Äôt a collector either.
</p>
<p>
I know collectors with great collections. My uncle is an avid collector
and his house is pretty much the town‚Äôs museum stuffed with old WW2
memorabilia. His collections also live at the local VA and the old train
depot (which is now a museum). I admire people who collect, organize,
catalog, and arrange. That archivist nature is a superskill.
</p>
<p>
Me? I suppose I have some inadvertent collections of similar objects,
but I don‚Äôt fancy myself a collector. I don‚Äôt need more possessions in
my life. But if there‚Äôs a project‚Ä¶ well, don‚Äôt mind if I do.

<h2 id="on-enjoying-the-process">On enjoying the process</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Working on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of
journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey
itself. It‚Äôs easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I‚Äôm working
through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with
my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the
process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable.
Because there‚Äôs no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable
part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes,
experimenting, getting hurt. It‚Äôs all part of the process and it‚Äôs what
makes the journey enjoyable.

<h2 id="howto-change-your-behavior">HOWTO: Change your behavior</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Matt Might blog</p>
<p>
In theory, behavior change should be easy.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, it seems like <em>you</em> control your behavior.
</p>
<p>
So, if you desire different behavior, why doesn‚Äôt your behavior change
as instantly as your desire to change it?
</p>
<p>
In short, lasting change of habitual behaviors is a multi-stage process.
</p>
<p>
In 1977, as psychologists James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente were
studying the behavior of smokers, they identified these stages.
</p>
<p>
Their
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X?pd_rd_i=038072572X&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmamzn06-20&amp;linkId=10d08f55149cd797828a0557f1a1594b&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">transtheoretical
model of behavior change</a> captures the process of behavior change in
six different stages: (1) precontemplation; (2) contemplation; (3)
preparation; (4) action; (5) maintenance; and (6) relapse.
</p>
<p><img src="images/dall-e-escher-ttm.png" class="abstract-image" /></p>
<center>
<em>DALL-E‚Äôs depiction of behavior change in the transtheoretical
model.</em>
</center>
<p>
In the years since, this landmark model has been found to be applicable
to many habitual human behaviors.
</p>
<p>
The key takeaway is that the odds of successful long-term behavior
change improve if you calibrate your strategy to the stage of change
you‚Äôre in.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this article is to provide an actionable summary of this
model and interventions for each stage, so that you can more effectively
change your behavior in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the model may also help you to understand why you may have
struggled with behavior change in the past.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is based on my survey of the
scientific literature and my own lived experience. I am not a mental
health professional, and if you are struggling with behavior change or
any other mental health condition, please immediately consult a
qualified professional.

</p>
<p>
At CES 2024, I had the opportunity to chat with Eben Upton, Raspberry
Pi‚Äôs CEO. We discussed the future of AI on the Pi, RP2040‚Äôs successor,
the impending launch of Compute Module 5, and current production rates
of Pi 4 and Pi 5 computers‚ÄîRaspberry Pi‚Äôs bread and butter.
</p>
<p>
The news is good: currently (as of last week), they are manufacturing Pi
5 at a rate of 70,000 per week. By the end of January? 90,000 per week.
</p>
<p>
That would put manufacturing capacity for Pi 5 alone at 400,000 units
<em>every month</em>.

mystique of Substack in retreat, now ‚Äì if we had a proper identity
system with storage, we could make it easy for people to hook their
world up to email, ie newsletters, and preserve choice, and be able to
build editors that were more than
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/14/tinyLittleTextBox.png">tiny
little textboxes</a>. I was part of the PC wave in the 80s when writing
tools advanced incredibly quickly. So many directions ‚Äì from
line-oriented editors on Unix and early Apples, to

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker">layout</a>, and
outliners for thinking and presentations. In the same time period
programming changed from something requiring a million dollar investment
in hardware and infrastructure, to something most students could afford.
Just ten years. Since then our world has been reduced to copying and
pasting into tiny text boxes. The question is bigger than if we need
journalism, the question is do we need writers?</p>

He says:

<p>
We are firmly on a path to chaos. We continue to pour greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere. Here is our track record for the period 1990-2022:

<p>
All sectors apart from transport have fully rebounded from the drop in
emissions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and now exceed 2019 levels.
CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes were
the main contributors to the overall increase, accounting for about two
thirds of current GHG emissions. Emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases), which have higher global
warming potentials and account for about one quarter of current GHG
emissions, are increasing rapidly: in 2022, F-gas emissions grew by 5.5
per cent, followed by CH4 at 1.8 per cent and N2O at 0.9 per cent. ‚Äì

As a result of the above, 2023 ended as the hottest year on record at
+1.45¬∞C above the preindustrial average, based on the six international
climate datasets.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The annual average global temperature approached 1.5¬∞ Celsius above
pre-industrial levels ‚Äì symbolic because the Paris Agreement on climate

Celsius above pre-industrial levels. ‚Äì

<p>
At time of writing, using the standard decadal averages, we have
currently heated by about +1.29¬∫C above the preindustrial average using
four of the above datasets.

The consequences of a world that has heated by +1.3¬∫C has become very
clear during the past year. Here is a month-by-month look at the extreme
events of 2023.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The number of global extreme weather events has seen a ‚Äústaggering rise‚Äù

change is ‚Äúsupercharging‚Äù the problem, per The Associated Press. ‚Äì

<p>
With the emission trajectory for both CO‚ÇÇ and Methane still increasing,
the earth will continue to heat. There is no negotiation with the
physics of this.

</p>
<p>
With our fossil fuel burning ways entrenched, we are firmly on track to
pass the 1.5¬∞C threshold in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Various groups have attempted to extrapolate when exactly this will
become the earth‚Äôs permanent background baseline temperature.
</p>
<p>
Here is a projection from Berkley Earth:

</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-5.png" alt="Global warming reaches 1.5¬∞C by November 2033" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Global warming reached an estimated 1.26¬∞C in December 2023. If the
30-year warming trend leading up then continued, global warming would
reach 1.5¬∞C by November 2033. ‚Äì

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are others, like Dr James Hanson et al, who believe that these
estimates are too conservative and that we will arrive at this threshold
much sooner as they illustrate below.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-6.png" alt="Global temperature will continue to grow in the next 5-8 months, carrying the 12-month running-mean to at least 1.6-1.7¬∞C" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We expect record monthly temperatures to continue into mid-2024 due to
the present large planetary energy imbalance, with the 12- month
running-mean global temperature reaching +1.6-1.7¬∞C relative to
1880-1920 and falling to only +1.4 ¬± 0.1¬∞C during the following La Nina.
Considering the large planetary energy imbalance, it will be clear that
the world is passing through the 1.5¬∞C ceiling, and is headed much
higher, unless steps are taken to affect Earth‚Äôs energy imbalance. ‚Äì

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whichever of the above projections end up being what transpires in
reality, we know for sure that we are going to smash right past the
1.5¬∞C threshold sometime between 2024 and 2033.
</p>
<p>
The devastation we witnessed in 2023 at +1.3¬∞C of heating will seem mild
as we reach higher levels of heating. We now also have solid research
that shows crossing 1.5¬∞C permanently, will set in motion tipping points
that will unleash even more climate chaos as a result of their cascading
effects.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Climate system tipping elements are components of the Earth system
susceptible to a tipping point, that is, a critical threshold beyond
which the system reorganises, often abruptly and/or irreversibly.
Improved scientific understanding has shown that triggering climate
system tipping points already this century cannot be ruled out, far
sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously assumed. The goal
of this chapter is to review the state of knowledge of climate system
tipping points. ‚Äì

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Our current response to what the physics requires to slow the emissions
freight train is nothing short of a joke. The current policies put us on
track for a +2.7¬∞C world. Talk about an overshoot!
</p>
<p>
The UNEP on what is required starting immediately:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To reach emission levels consistent with a below 2¬∞C pathway in 2030,
the cuts required per year are now 5.3 per cent from 2024, reaching 8.7
per cent per year on average for the 1.5¬∞C pathway. To compare, the fall
in total global GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic was 4.7 per cent. ‚Äì

Record: Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions
(again)</a>, by the UN environment programme.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As we start 2024 there is NO indication that we have any intent to
approach this with the same urgency and determination which was
displayed during the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Look around, it‚Äôs all business as usual.
</p>
<p>
As as result we are, as the UN Secretary General put it, ‚Äúon a highway
to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Right now, there are billions of people on the frontlines of this.
</p>
<p>
We are entering the period of climate induced chaos.

<h2 id="stitch-images-together-with-stitchy">Stitch images together with
Stitchy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
From time to time I need to stitch together two or three images into a
horizontal or vertical image. It seems so wasteful to spin up a whole
design document for that task. What I wanted was a CLI that does that
for me and I found one that does the job: Stitchy.
</p>
<h2>
How to use Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy is a Rust package that does what it says on the tin, it stitches
images together.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Install Rust and
Cargo</a>
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">--proto</span> <span class="s1">'=https'</span> <span class="nt">--tlsv1</span>.2 <span class="nt">-sSf</span> https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Install <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/stitchy">Stitchy</a>
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">cargo <span class="nb">install </span>stitchy
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Use Stitchy
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy image1.png image2.png
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
If you‚Äôre feeling even lazier and don‚Äôt want to type file names, you can
have Stitchy grab the <code>n</code> latest images in the directory
and/or set the <code>‚Äìorder</code> flag to <code>alphabetical</code>.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--order</span><span class="o">=</span>alphabetical 
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
Stitchy for responsive images
</h2>
<p>
By default Stitchy will assemble the images in order in a tight grid.
Where Stitchy shines is generating responsive images where you might
show a grid of images on mobile and a horizontal filmstrip on desktop.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4     <span class="c"># layout images in a grid</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">-h</span>  <span class="c"># layout images horizontally</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Here‚Äôs an example of a responsive image treatment I did on
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/12/vibe-check-30/">a recent Vibe
Check</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a horizontal row" />
</p>
<figcaption>
The desktop version of the last four books I‚Äôve read
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
If you resize your browser to a smaller viewport, you can see how the
wide but short image loses hierarchy and readability on mobile, so I
used <code>stitchy</code> to cut a new version for desktop.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read-mobile.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a staggered grid" />
</p>
<figcaption>
The mobile version of the last four books I‚Äôve read
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
No one noticed I did this, no one said ‚Äúthanks‚Äù, but these types of
small touches are my favorite responsive techniques.
</p>
<h2>
Other things Stitchy can do
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy gives you a bit more control in setting a <code>‚Äìmaxw</code> or
<code>‚Äìmaxh</code> if that‚Äôs part of the effect. You can also set the
output format to <code>‚Äìjpg</code> or <code>‚Äìpng</code> if needed as
well as control the <code>‚Äìquality</code>.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--png</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--jpg</span> <span class="nt">--quality</span><span class="o">=</span>75
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
Enjoy Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
And that‚Äôs Stitchy! It‚Äôs pretty handy if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
I wrote this post because I use it so infrequently and there‚Äôs not much
documentation beyond the <code>‚Äìhelp</code> command, so I wanted to have
this to remember how to use it.
