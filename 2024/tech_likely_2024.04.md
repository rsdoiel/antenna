**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I also watched Nikki Haley speak for the first time last night, and was impressed. She held my attention through the whole speech, and that's hard to do when the Knicks are playing on another channel. I listened carefully to every word. It was a well-written speech and said some things that needed to be said about Trump, things that he won't have a response to, since you can't control or spin how old you are. We can all see Trump aging on screen, even his fans must see it and like those of use who will vote for Biden, they must wonder if he can make it much further. If you had cast a great presidential candidate, in Hollywood, Nikki Haley comes pretty damn close. But while she was speaking I remembered that she is a Republican and thought of Roe v Wade, and remembered that while she might not be able to or even want to fully dismantle democracy, she is backing a form of slavery for all American women. A good actor, but a person I could never trust. But, I just want to say that she should continue to speak. She might be able to pull is in an interesting new direction, not by winning, but by opening people's minds to the idea of a young vital leader engaged in the real world. It would be a nice thing for the good old USA.

I felt bad for the Nets. It wasn't that long ago that the Nets were super-irritating because they had been taken over by two reallllly ugly NBA players, Kevin Durant who isn't worthy of NY's basketball fans, what a total piece of shit, but even worse, his best friend Kyrie who is either a complete fucking idiot, or a Jew-hater. Probably both. Why is he an idiot? Because he accidentally revealed that NBA players probably all hate Jews, not one would speak up for our people. The best they could say is that Kyrie shouldn't have said what he said. How revealing. Not that the Holocaust was real, and is remembered by its children, who were raised to believe it would happen again, as it appears to be. Anyway, the Nets have moved past that, and they are after all a NYC-based team, and are playing with the haplessness of typical our pro teams, and deserve some of our sympathy. But -- not saying the Knicks should have let them win, or that I was even slightly rooting for them. But I was embarrassed that there were far more Knicks fans in attendance than Nets fans, and I still don't admit that there are actually any Nets fans in NYC.

## The grifter web

date: 2024-01-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>The grifter web</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@ohhelloana" title="@ohhelloana@mastodon.social">@ohhelloana</a> recently wondered about personal websites. What is it that people like about personal websites?</p>

<p>I think when I search online for a topic, I&rsquo;d love to find pages by people enthusiastic about the topic and not two dozen sites full of ads that give me the impression of being people farms or bot farms. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss big non-monetized sites like MDN or Wikipedia, but there are a lot of similar pages that are all strictly worse (the ad/bot variety of the same), and there are some pages by knowledgeable people that discovered this or that and wrote it up on their blog. The same is true for non-technical subjects like gardening.</p>

<p>I want the big non-monetized documentation sites and the personal sites, and I don&rsquo;t care for the monetized sites because I feel they&rsquo;re just leeching off the sites I like: copying the text and pictures directly, or copying them, training their bots on them and regurgitating a mix, inserting themselves as middlemen, trying to profit from that large value gap, slicing it up and taking a share, diminishing the value for the rest of us.</p>

## Chrome for Windows and macOS gets experimentel “AI” features

date: 2024-01-24, from: OS News

Starting with today’s release of Chrome (M121), we&#8217;re introducing experimental generative AI features to make it even easier and more efficient to browse — all while keeping your experience personalized to you. You’ll be able to try out these new features in Chrome on Macs and Windows PCs over the next few days, starting in the U.S. Just sign into Chrome, select “Settings” from the three-dot menu and navigate to the “Experimental AI” page. Because these features are early public experiments, they’ll be disabled for enterprise and educational accounts for now. ↫ Parisa Tabriz Chrome will automatically suggest tab groups for you (a sorting algorithm, very advanced technology), you can generate themes (mashing other people&#8217;s real art togerher and picking a dominant colour from the result), and Chrome can generate text in text fields (spicy autocomplete). &#8220;AI&#8221; sure is changing the world as we know it.

## Mozilla creates Firefox ppa and .deb package

date: 2024-01-23, from: OS News

Great news for Linux users, after months of testing, Mozilla released today a new package for Firefox on Linux (specifically on Ubuntu, Debian, and any Debian-based distribution). If you’ve heard about Linux, which is known for its open-source software and an alternative to traditional operating systems (OS), and are curious to learn more, here are four reasons why you should give our new Firefox on Linux package a try. ↫ Gabriel Bustamente and Johan Lorenzo It&#8217;s a ppa and .deb package straight from Mozilla itself, so you don&#8217;t have to to rely on your distribution&#8217;s maintainers (as long as you use a Debian-based distribution, that is). Do note, however, that some distributions actually make changes to the default Firefox code, such as Fedora enabling things like Wayland-by-default and hardware-accelerated video decoding long before those became default in Firefox-proper. By using Mozilla&#8217;s package, you&#8217;ll lose all of these changes. As a sidenote, Mozilla&#8217;s instructions for enabling the ppa and installing the .deb are a bit&#8230; Dubious, though.

## iOS 17.3, macOS 14.3, watchOS 10.3, tvOS 17.3 released

date: 2024-01-23, from: OS News

Apple yesterday released iOS and iPadOS 17.3 as well as watchOS 10.3, tvOS 17.3, and macOS Sonoma 14.3 for all supported devices. iOS 17.3 primarily adds collaborative playlists in Apple Music, and what Apple calls &#8220;Stolen Device Protection.&#8221; Collaborative playlists have been on a bit of a journey; they were promised as part of iOS 17, then added in the beta of iOS 17.2, but removed before that update went live. Now they&#8217;re finally reaching all users. When enabled, Stolen Device Protection requires Face ID or Touch ID authentication &#8220;with no passcode fallback&#8221; for some sensitive actions on the phone. ↫ Samuel Axon at Ars Technica This last feature is something you should probably turn on right away, as it serves as a reply to Joanna Stern&#8217;s investigation into an apparently common way iPhones would get stolen to gain access to users&#8217; Apple accounts.

## The time to unmaintainable is very low

date: 2024-01-23, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>It’s so easy nowadays to get up and going on a project. I can burp some <code>npm</code> commands into my terminal, burp some more to setup a deployment pipeline and blam! Website. The time to product demo is so low. You can get far on your own… very quickly… but then… you’re on your own. And it’s possible you’ve built something way past your ability to maintain.</p>
<p>To fix that problem or to allow you to do more business’y work, you add people to the process. But people cost lots of money. Unless what you’re building makes lots of money already, you probably have to raise VC. With a squad of developers burping <code>npm</code> commands, now you’re moving super fast. Hopefully money starts coming in, but the whole point of investment was so you could price the application artificially cheap to grow a user base that you upsell later. As the investment coffers tick down, the pressure goes up to land a new feature or gimmick so you can get another round of investment.</p>
<p>You can, of course, ride the hype cycles. This year that’s AI. Investors might throw money at that. But now you’ve bolted on a feature from a highly volatile, emergent, non-deterministic space into your overgrown application. You’ll either need to hire more expensive people who know the space or divert existing resources who were performing maintenance over to the new feature.</p>
<p>Oops, AI costs more than you can charge for it. You burned through the investment even faster and must do a round of layoffs. Now your app maintained by 10 people has 8 people… then 5… then 2…</p>
<p>Paying people to burp <code>npm</code> commands is expensive, could AI do that? Vercel’s <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a>, for example, farts out entire UIs. Great. In a day I have twelve thousand screens built. I have more UI than some developers will code in a lifetime. But I’m getting the itch to update it and the machine isn’t doing what I want it to… perhaps I’ll take some VC to hire some people to clean up these robo-farts.</p>
<p>And by the time you finish all that work, it’ll be right in time for a major version update on a core dependency. Good luck out there.</p>
<p>I realize I’m complaining about moving too fast but that’s not my intent. Although, I could argue that while driving 200mph is fun and exciting, you’re one small fuckup away from a major fuckup. My point is that a key factor of sustainability is making sure maintainability stays on par with growth. At the risk of sounding like a Luddite – <a href="https://amzn.to/3NA62WE">which I am</a> – the ability to <em style="font-family: fantasy;">fancy copy-paste</em> your way into an unmaintainable situation is higher than ever and that’s a trade-off we should think about.</p>

## One big, one little

date: 2024-01-23, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I often feel overwhelmed deciding what to do with my spare time. It’s a problem with volume moreso than ambition. When the feeling hit the other weekend I scribbled down seven ideas <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/02/bag-of-distractions/">rattling around in my head</a> and stared at the list blankly. I’ve used different prioritization systems in the past like the Eisenhower matrix (Urgent vs. Important) and the Six Sigma matrix (Effort vs Impact); and while those are good for evaluating required tasks… none of those work well for voluntary activities self-created by a <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/not-a-collector/">serial project starter</a>.</p>
<p>I need a system that helps prioritize <em>and</em> load balance projects I give myself. When free time shows up, I don’t want to waste time doomscrolling on social media or being in a state of overwhelm, I want to hop right in to an idea. I also don’t want seven big thought benders occupying my brain RAM at all times, I need less background noise. After some thought, a tiny mantra started kicking around in my head, “One big, one little.”</p>
<p>If I artificially limit myself to having one major and one minor active side project at a time, my agility goes up because I’m not doing ten projects at once, I’m doing one or two. When one <a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">project finishes</a>, I move to the next best idea that fits the available slot. I will never be taking on too much and it’s easier to say “no” to new distractions if I have to substitute projects.</p>
<p>Why two projects? Why not one? That would be the ultimate focus state, but believe it or not it’s an intentional move because my pockets of free time are differently sized. In my mind, a big project takes a week or a month while a little project takes a day or less. You can slice up big projects into smaller projects, but that itself is a small planning project. I also like variety.</p>
<p>And because I have more than two responsibilities in life, one slight modification to this system might be to have one big, one little project for each major area of my life.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Area</th>
<th>Big</th>
<th>Little</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Work</td>
<td>Learn algorithms</td>
<td>Write a blog post</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal</td>
<td>Make a game</td>
<td>Build a Gundam</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Family</td>
<td>Clean garage</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Careful! Adding more areas will put me back where I started, but 3 to 5 areas seems about right. What’s different between this list and the list of seven ideas I made the other day? Not much except that areas of my life tend to occupy particular timeframes: Work is during the day, Personal is during the evenings, and Family is after school and weekends. In practice my boundaries overlap (e.g. my work feeds my family) but it’s pretty easy for me to discern which area of my life needs attention.</p>
<p>I like how this limited structure builds some resilience against “crash-ins” like urgent emails, taxes, or car problems. Those surprise projects tend to be disproportionately problematic for me, like delivering a new piece of furniture to an already crowded living room. If I’m abiding in the one-in/one-out approach, a crash-in must take the place of something else in that respective area. That paradigm is much easier to manage than my current thought technology; a giant Jenga tower of obligations.</p>
<p>No idea if this holds up but this past week I’ve been more focused and centered than ever. Yesterday I cleared out a big work-related project and freed up some mental allocation. Wiping a project off the board and seeing a blank space made finishing the project even sweeter. Then last night I had some extra energy after bedtime and decided to work on a fun project for my podcast. I got about 80% finished in one night. Before (like the last four weeks) I would have felt guilty or distracted about picking up that project while thinking about four others I could/should be doing.</p>
<p>That’s my new “One big, one little” system. Now when a rogue idea sneaks into my periphery, I can chant my mantra and ward away those little demons.</p>

## When did Raspberry Pi get so expensive?

<p>I just bought this N100-based Intel x86 mini PC (<em>brand new</em>), and it was cheaper than an almost equivalent—but slower—Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

<p>This GMKtec mini PC is called the <a href="https://amzn.to/4b88MVp">Nucbox G3</a>, and it comes with an Intel Alder Lake N100 4-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256 GB M.2 NVMe SSD, and Windows 11 Pro—and mine cost just $131, after a couple coupons.</p>

<p>That's... a lot of computer for a very good price. But the Raspberry Pi—the famous "$35 computer", should be well below that... right?</p>

<p>Well, I bought all the parts required to build a Pi 5 to the same spec—including the adapters and parts to assemble it into one small unit—and it turns out... the Pi is <em>more expensive</em>. And <em>slower</em>.</p>

<p>The Pi 4 still starts at $35 (for a 1 GB model), but the Pi 5 starts at $60 (for 4 GB) and climbs to $80 for the maximum 8 GB model.</p></div>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this is not how it works. Start small.</p>

<p>You can get the <a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.</p>

<p>Buy <a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.</p>

<p>As somebody recently told me: &ldquo;Looking up the rules is 90% of the game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I like to call Advanced Squad Leader &ldquo;the game to end all rules-lawyering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For online gaming, you need to download the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card games. Vassal is free, open-source software.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to run ASL on VASSAL.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The VASL site has a section called &ldquo;Download Scenarios&rdquo; where you can download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you load those games, you&rsquo;ll see messages about all the extensions you&rsquo;re missing. Often you don&rsquo;t need them, but feel free to install them.</p>

<p>If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff that gets used in later boxes.</p>

Here's what I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/01/24/30thAnniversaryOfMac.html">ten years ago</a> on the 30th anniversary of the Mac. "The rollout on January 24th was like a college graduation ceremony." It appears I didn't write anything about the Mac anniversary <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/01.html">in 2004</a> and my blog didn't exist on 1/24/94. But I did write a piece on what made the Mac different on the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/24/whatMadeTheMacDifferent.html">25th anniversary</a> in 2009. BTW, the comments on that piece are incredible. Click the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/24/whatMadeTheMacDifferent.html">link</a> just to read the freaking comments.

It was a huge day in my life, and in the evolution of personal computers and ultimately, the internet. I was there that day, along with Kandes Bregman from my startup, Living Videotext. We had a full page ad in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MACWORLD-Macintosh-Magazine-Premier-February/dp/B001OI6YL6">first issue</a> of <a href="https://archive.org/details/macworld-magazine">MacWorld</a>. We were extremely excited, the Mac seemed to be the perfect machine for our "idea processor" ThinkTank, and Apple seemed to love us. It took a couple of years to get it right, by 1986 my company had switched to be an exclusively Mac company, but not before we were saved by the people at Apple who believed in us, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki">Guy Kawasaki</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Boich">Mike Boich</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Yocam">Del Yocam</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Campbell_(business_executive)">Bill Campbell</a>, and many others. I don't know if we would have made it without the help of Apple, but luckily we didn't have to find out. Thank you to all our friends at Apple, and to Steve Jobs and the Mac team for creating such a wonderful breakthrough product. Those were the days when we believed we were on a mission to save the world. In some sense that idea has never left, to our generation of entrepreneurial software developers.

## Meta now lets EU users unlink their Facebook, Messenger and Instagram accounts

## RubyWM: an X11 window manager in pure Ruby

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

It&#8217;s a minimalist (currently &#60;1K lines) pure Ruby (including the X11 driver) X11 window manager. It is focused on tiling, but allows you to choose to assign a tiling layout to specific desktops or leave them floating. Currently whether or not you use tiling or floating layout there is no window decoration and windows are not draggable or resizable by pulling on borders (but you can do that with Windows key + left/right mouse button) Like bspwm, which was an inspiration, the wm supports no keyboard handling &#8211; all keyboard handling is deferred to separate tools like sxhkd. Unlike bspwm this WM has no dedicated IPC mechanism. Instead, so far, all communication happens via X11 ClientMessage events, which means any tool, like xdotool etc. that can produce those events can control the WM. ↫ Vidar Hokstad on RubyWM&#8217;s GitHub page In the blog post announcing RubyWM, the author makes it very clear that while he uses this WM full time, he is also willing to work around its bugs, and that certain tools will simply break if you use it. He considers it more of a tech demo, and that you really shouldn&#8217;t rely on this for any serious work.

## Spreadsheets are the best

date: 2024-01-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Spreadsheets are the best</h1>

<p>I want to love Forth and Lisp and Perl and Go and I sort of want to know Rust and Haskell and OCaml and Elixir, but really, the most important electronic computing platform for the largest number people is … spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Formulas and graphs turn these into the multifunctional tool that spread from accounting specialists to financial reporting to project managers planning to household budgets to birthday and wedding guest lists.</p>

<p>If you think about it, spreadsheets for the masses succeeded where Emacs failed. Spreadsheets allow you to build the tools you need. And sure, as a programming professional I have heard my share of horror stories: salary distributions and bonus programs, airport light systems, and many other things that should have used relational databases and REST services and whatever. But people know spreadsheets and use them to solve their problems.</p>

<p>Spreadsheets are underappreciated. Certainly they are underappreciated by programmers, I think.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@maxime_andre" title="@maxime_andre@mastodon.xyz">@maxime_andre</a> linked me to the video <a href="https://youtu.be/0yKf8TrLUOw?si=ZvLctptepVjLWXY3">Pure Functional Programming in Excel</a> by Felienne Hermans where she explains the benefits of spreadsheets for computing.</p>

<p>And I do think that the programming languages I listed failed us in as far as they do not contribute to computers as <a href="http://conviviality.ouvaton.org/spip.php?article1">convivial tools</a>. Most people are not autonomous in their use of computers to solve their problems because they cannot use the languages listed. They must hope for an app to solve their problem. But they can use a spreadsheet to solve their problem!</p>

<p>Emacs was supposed to be the editor for everybody, including non-technical people. It&rsquo;s just that our current design paradigms optimize for the inexperienced users and penalize experienced users. Users no longer expect Emacs-like tools and Emacs developers don&rsquo;t expect inexperienced users any more.</p>

<p>We feel it&rsquo;s OK to feel overwhelmed by Emacs – but many people are expected to navigate the real world in cars, on roads, with complex traffic regulation, other traffic participants and machines we don&rsquo;t understand. To me, that illustrates a value judgement. On the one hand, cars are a commodity. We no longer have to be an expert in combustion engines to drive one. But we still need to learn how to use the tool. There&rsquo;s mandatory training, there are professional teachers, there are enforcers of conventions, penalties, there&rsquo;s financing available if we want to lease a car, and so on. There is a lot of support and training for users of cars and not so much for computers. The expectations are different.</p>

<p>One might want to say that people need the car to get to work and that explains the economic incentives. To this I might reply that when one gets to work the actual work usually involves a computer and instead of using a convivial tool that one has learned and mastered, customized and extended to ones liking, one is forced to work with corporate software that is as boring as it can be.</p>

<p>Except when it comes to spreadsheets. This is where everyday people still can exercise mastery and solve their problems. It&rsquo;s a tool and not an app.</p>

<p>If we go back far enough, programming languages were designed to let non-technical people solve their problems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> was a programming language for business people. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> was a programming language for faculty and students. From this point of view, I&rsquo;d argue, the programming languages I mentioned are in fact steps away from this goal.</p>

<p>These programming languages solve more specialised problems. These are tools for experts. But in doing this, they moved away from the realm of everyday people using them to solve their problems. These languages fail to make computers into convivial tools.</p>

<p>The ZX Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 both booted into BASIC. Sure, that didn&rsquo;t mean that we knew how to program. Loading and saving stuff from cassette was hard. PEEK and POKE were hard. But the tools to turn the computer into a convivial tool were right there. The computer came with a manual.</p>

<p>My hope, my wish, my expectations are that we can do this and more. We can make it even better! Spreadsheets are the saving grace. We should put spreadsheets front and centre.</p>

<p>The sad reality is, however, that today we buy computers that essentially boot into the app store.</p>

## head start

The Vikings was the first movie I ever saw — not in a standard movie theater, but some years after its release, at a drive-in. I remember being at once bemused and excited by the rituals of finding a parking place, hanging the speaker over the car door .. and the movie itself? I adored [&#8230;]

Arp 300 consists of two interacting galaxies, UGC 05028 (the smaller face-on spiral galaxy) and UGC 05029 (the larger face-on spiral).

<p>I’m currently <a href="https://json.blog/letters/">taking part</a> in Jason’s <a href="https://json.blog/2022/11/28/a-new-project.html">Letters</a> experiment and I have to say that it’s a lot of fun. As I said to him, writing something that is usually meant to be private knowing that will be published somewhere is a weird feeling.</p>
<p>I like that it offers readers a glimpse into what corresponding with people online looks like. As I wrote many times before, if you want to engage with me, please do write me an email. I read every single one of them and I also try my best to reply to everyone. Sometimes life takes over and I forget but I really do try my best to reply because I believe it’s important to connect with others.</p>
<p>I also believe in kindness, in curiosity, in being open to learn about others and their lives. I love to know what you do, and what you’re passionate about so, again, if you want to make a new connection, please do get in touch.</p>

## Reversing the Web-@nywhere Watch: browse fragments of the web on your wrist

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

Smartwatches at the turn of the century were a more motley assortment than today&#8217;s, with an even wilder range of functionality. If you had a few hundred dollars or so, there were some interesting options, even back then. But if all you had was $85 (in 2024 dollars about $150), you still weren&#8217;t left out, because in 2001 you could get the Web-@nywhere (the &#8220;Worldwide Web Watch&#8221;). Load up the software on your PC and slap it in its little docking station, and you could slurp down about 93K of precious Web data to scroll on the 59&#215;16 screen — 10 characters by 2 characters — to read any time you wanted! That is, of course, if the remote host the watch&#8217;s Windows 9x-based client accessed were still up, on which it depended for virtually anything to download and install. Well, I want 95,488 bytes of old smartwatch tiny screen Web on my wrist, darn it. We&#8217;re going to reverse-engineer this sucker and write our own system using real live modern Web data. So there! ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research Y&#8217;all know the drill by now &#8211; I&#8217;m a sucker for these kinds of stories. What a great, extremely detailed read, with code to boot.

## Platform tilt: documenting the uneven playing field for an independent browser like Firefox

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

This tilt manifests in a variety of ways. For example: making it harder for a user to download and use a different browser, ignoring or resetting a user’s default browser preference, restricting capabilities to the first-party browser, or requiring the use of the first-party browser engine for third-party browsers. For years, Mozilla has engaged in dialog with platform vendors in an effort to address these issues. With renewed public attention and an evolving regulatory environment, we think it’s time to publish these concerns using the same transparent process and tools we use to develop positions on emerging technical standards. So today we’re publishing a new issue tracker where we intend to document the ways in which platforms put Firefox at a disadvantage and engage with the vendors of those platforms to resolve them. ↫ The official Mozilla blog Excellent initative.

## What’s that touchscreen in my room?

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room. However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too smart for me. It is obviously a touchscreen of some sort, but there was zero indication as to what it controls. The landlord had no idea what this is. There are no buttons or labels on the thing, just a tiny yellow light to let you know it has the power. ↫ Nikita Lapkov What follows is an investigation into what it is, how to get it working, and, of course, how to hack it and make it more useful.

## The case for Rust (in the FreeBSD base system)

date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News

FreeBSD is discussing adding Rust to the FreeBSD base system. In a recent thread on src-committers, we discussed the costs and benefits of including Rust code in the FreeBSD base system. To summarize, the cost is that it would double our build times. imp suggested adding an additional step after buildworld for stuff that requires an external toolchain. That would ease the build time pain. The benefit is that some tools would become easier to write, or even become possible. ↫ Warner Losh on the freebsd-hackers mailing list From everything I&#8217;ve read and what you, the readers, have told me, someone who isn&#8217;t a programmer, languages like Rust really are a big improvement over older languages, and it&#8217;s probably not a good idea for a major, important project like FreeBSD to isolate its base system from such progress. Now, I&#8217;m not at all qualified to say whether Rust, specifically, is the right choice, but a language like Rust should probably be part of the base system. A big issue is FreeBSD&#8217;s architecture support. Rust is not well-supported or even supported at all on all the various platforms FreeBSD supports, which might prove to be a road block for now. That being said, letting barely used ISAs hamper your progress too much might not be a good idea either. Rust has already become a supported language for the development of the Linux kernel.

## In 2024, Genode to focus on multi-monitor, suspend/resume, touchpads, and much more

date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News

Without hesitation, our developer community quickly rallied behind the topic &#8220;Sculpt OS usability&#8221;, desiring to boost the user experience with respect to multi-monitor usage, convenient interactive UIs for common tasks, profound support for touchpads and touchscreens, tearing-free graphics, low-latency audio, casual on-target debugging, and suspend/resume. The focus on usability notwithstanding, we will steadily continue with the gardening of Genode&#8217;s driver landscape, fostering the consistent use of drivers ported from up-to-date Linux kernels, clear-cut ACPI support, and making drivers pluggable.

<p>The vision hardware looks lovely, but I am more impressed by the depth of the user experience, the guidance to developers, the design system, the operating system and the tooling to support it.</p><p>Previous headsets have been cool and exciting (I own pretty much one of each), yet none got this level of necessary scaffolding in place, so the experiences are a mish-mash of half baked ideas. </p><p>We finally go from “this is a neat idea” to a viable platform.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/30/quickley.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I realize that most of the people who read this blog aren't sports fans, something that I wish were different, because sports, like HBO series, give us a way to talk about complex human relationships in the 21st century that we don't get any other way to imho. If we all watch <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession">Succession</a>, for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy">Shiv</a> and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans">Tom</a>). (No spoilers as to why he's significant, and won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards">Emmy</a> for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to say to your friends -- there! -- <i>that's</i> what I was talking about. Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors, which was one of those games you don't ever forget, because of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">recent trade</a> where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded away. One day they're our team, and the next day, supposedly they're the other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn't just leave, maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a former <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career">Great Hope</a> of ours, didn't pan out, and now it's nice to see him on the court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could've gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one, the <a href="https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/">hotshit kid</a> with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night's <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/">game</a> was something else. I understand that <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel">Niners and Packers</a> fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can relate.

## Download the whole podcast.

date: 2024-01-21, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Download the whole podcast.</h1>

<p>Feeling evil… Assume that there&rsquo;s a podcast with a feed and you want to download all the episodes. Like a music show, for example.</p>

<p>First, get the feed, saving it as <code>rss.xml</code> because we&rsquo;re going to need it in the next statement.</p>

<pre><code>curl -o rss.xml https://musicforprogramming.net/rss.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Then, get every enclosure:</p>

<pre><code>for f in $(perl -ne '/&lt;enclosure url=&quot;(.*?)&quot;/ &amp;&amp; print &quot;$1\n&quot;' rss.xml); do
  curl --continue-at - --remote-name &quot;$f&quot;
done
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--continue-at -</code> option should make it possible to resume downloads at a later stage. <code>curl</code> will skip all the bytes already downloaded, effectively skipping the download. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping for, in any case.</p>

<p>The <code>--remote-name</code> option saves the episode under its remote name. This is what most people would expect, I think.</p>

<p>You know how it goes, though: never parse HTML (or XML) using regular expressions. I&rsquo;m doing it here and it is definitely a bad idea!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also too lazy to install a real XML parser and doing the real thing, so it is what it is.</p>

## Bull Mancuso comics bonus!

date: 2024-01-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Let's do another Bull Mancuso comic strip! In this version Ms Mancuso is a professor at Harvard Law School, teaching a class on contract law. She's a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck's, which she gets from a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3818612,-71.1198074,3a,75y,313.45h,86.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss6IPyoxMNQaPkqRfO8TULg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">store on Mass Ave</a> in Cambridge, just across from the Law School campus. Her students all have tremendous respect for her. Just a few panels of her giving an informative caffeine-enhanced lecture. </p>
<p>I was given two comic strips to choose from, and I went with the first, because it's closest to what I was thinking of! It looks like a Harvard Law School <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/20/classroom.png">classroom</a>.</p>
