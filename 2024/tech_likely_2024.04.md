## Runestone Rejected From the App Store

date: 2024-01-22, from: Michael Tsai

Simon B. St&#248;vring: Apple rejected an update to Runestone because its App Store description mentions the app&#8217;s price. This text has been included in the description for two years on iOS and for two releases on visionOS. I was inspired by Overcast, which also has a similar text, to add it to my app.[&#8230;]We need [&#8230;]

## Spreadsheets are the best

date: 2024-01-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Spreadsheets are the best</h1>

<p>I want to love Forth and Lisp and Perl and Go and I sort of want to know Rust and Haskell and OCaml and Elixir, but really, the most important electronic computing platform for the largest number people is … spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Formulas and graphs turn these into the multifunctional tool that spread from accounting specialists to financial reporting to project managers planning to household budgets to birthday and wedding guest lists.</p>

<p>If you think about it, spreadsheets for the masses succeeded where Emacs failed. Spreadsheets allow you to build the tools you need. And sure, as a programming professional I have heard my share of horror stories: salary distributions and bonus programs, airport light systems, and many other things that should have used relational databases and REST services and whatever. But people know spreadsheets and use them to solve their problems.</p>

<p>Spreadsheets are underappreciated. Certainly they are underappreciated by programmers, I think.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@maxime_andre" title="@maxime_andre@mastodon.xyz">@maxime_andre</a> linked me to the video <a href="https://youtu.be/0yKf8TrLUOw?si=ZvLctptepVjLWXY3">Pure Functional Programming in Excel</a> by Felienne Hermans where she explains the benefits of spreadsheets for computing.</p>

<p>And I do think that the programming languages I listed failed us in as far as they do not contribute to computers as <a href="http://conviviality.ouvaton.org/spip.php?article1">convivial tools</a>. Most people are not autonomous in their use of computers to solve their problems because they cannot use the languages listed. They must hope for an app to solve their problem. But they can use a spreadsheet to solve their problem!</p>

<p>Emacs was supposed to be the editor for everybody, including non-technical people. It&rsquo;s just that our current design paradigms optimize for the inexperienced users and penalize experienced users. Users no longer expect Emacs-like tools and Emacs developers don&rsquo;t expect inexperienced users any more.</p>

<p>We feel it&rsquo;s OK to feel overwhelmed by Emacs – but many people are expected to navigate the real world in cars, on roads, with complex traffic regulation, other traffic participants and machines we don&rsquo;t understand. To me, that illustrates a value judgement. On the one hand, cars are a commodity. We no longer have to be an expert in combustion engines to drive one. But we still need to learn how to use the tool. There&rsquo;s mandatory training, there are professional teachers, there are enforcers of conventions, penalties, there&rsquo;s financing available if we want to lease a car, and so on. There is a lot of support and training for users of cars and not so much for computers. The expectations are different.</p>

<p>One might want to say that people need the car to get to work and that explains the economic incentives. To this I might reply that when one gets to work the actual work usually involves a computer and instead of using a convivial tool that one has learned and mastered, customized and extended to ones liking, one is forced to work with corporate software that is as boring as it can be.</p>

<p>Except when it comes to spreadsheets. This is where everyday people still can exercise mastery and solve their problems. It&rsquo;s a tool and not an app.</p>

<p>If we go back far enough, programming languages were designed to let non-technical people solve their problems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> was a programming language for business people. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> was a programming language for faculty and students. From this point of view, I&rsquo;d argue, the programming languages I mentioned are in fact steps away from this goal.</p>

<p>These programming languages solve more specialised problems. These are tools for experts. But in doing this, they moved away from the realm of everyday people using them to solve their problems. These languages fail to make computers into convivial tools.</p>

<p>The ZX Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 both booted into BASIC. Sure, that didn&rsquo;t mean that we knew how to program. Loading and saving stuff from cassette was hard. PEEK and POKE were hard. But the tools to turn the computer into a convivial tool were right there. The computer came with a manual.</p>

<p>My hope, my wish, my expectations are that we can do this and more. We can make it even better! Spreadsheets are the saving grace. We should put spreadsheets front and centre.</p>

<p>The sad reality is, however, that today we buy computers that essentially boot into the app store.</p>

As I said to him, writing something that is usually meant to be private knowing that will be published somewhere is a weird feeling.</p>
<p>I like that it offers readers a glimpse into what corresponding with people online looks like. As I wrote many times before, if you want to engage with me, please do write me an email. I read every single one of them and I also try my best to reply to everyone. Sometimes life takes over and I forget but I really do try my best to reply because I believe it’s important to connect with others.</p>
<p>I also believe in kindness, in curiosity, in being open to learn about others and their lives. I love to know what you do, and what you’re passionate about so, again, if you want to make a new connection, please do get in touch.</p>

## Reversing the Web-@nywhere Watch: browse fragments of the web on your wrist

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

Smartwatches at the turn of the century were a more motley assortment than today&#8217;s, with an even wilder range of functionality. If you had a few hundred dollars or so, there were some interesting options, even back then. But if all you had was $85 (in 2024 dollars about $150), you still weren&#8217;t left out, because in 2001 you could get the Web-@nywhere (the &#8220;Worldwide Web Watch&#8221;). Load up the software on your PC and slap it in its little docking station, and you could slurp down about 93K of precious Web data to scroll on the 59&#215;16 screen — 10 characters by 2 characters — to read any time you wanted! That is, of course, if the remote host the watch&#8217;s Windows 9x-based client accessed were still up, on which it depended for virtually anything to download and install. Well, I want 95,488 bytes of old smartwatch tiny screen Web on my wrist, darn it. We&#8217;re going to reverse-engineer this sucker and write our own system using real live modern Web data. So there! ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research Y&#8217;all know the drill by now &#8211; I&#8217;m a sucker for these kinds of stories. What a great, extremely detailed read, with code to boot.

## Platform tilt: documenting the uneven playing field for an independent browser like Firefox

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

This tilt manifests in a variety of ways. For example: making it harder for a user to download and use a different browser, ignoring or resetting a user’s default browser preference, restricting capabilities to the first-party browser, or requiring the use of the first-party browser engine for third-party browsers. For years, Mozilla has engaged in dialog with platform vendors in an effort to address these issues. With renewed public attention and an evolving regulatory environment, we think it’s time to publish these concerns using the same transparent process and tools we use to develop positions on emerging technical standards. So today we’re publishing a new issue tracker where we intend to document the ways in which platforms put Firefox at a disadvantage and engage with the vendors of those platforms to resolve them. ↫ The official Mozilla blog Excellent initative.

## What’s that touchscreen in my room?

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room. However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too smart for me. It is obviously a touchscreen of some sort, but there was zero indication as to what it controls. The landlord had no idea what this is. There are no buttons or labels on the thing, just a tiny yellow light to let you know it has the power. ↫ Nikita Lapkov What follows is an investigation into what it is, how to get it working, and, of course, how to hack it and make it more useful.

## The case for Rust (in the FreeBSD base system)

date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News

FreeBSD is discussing adding Rust to the FreeBSD base system. In a recent thread on src-committers, we discussed the costs and benefits of including Rust code in the FreeBSD base system. To summarize, the cost is that it would double our build times. imp suggested adding an additional step after buildworld for stuff that requires an external toolchain. That would ease the build time pain. The benefit is that some tools would become easier to write, or even become possible. ↫ Warner Losh on the freebsd-hackers mailing list From everything I&#8217;ve read and what you, the readers, have told me, someone who isn&#8217;t a programmer, languages like Rust really are a big improvement over older languages, and it&#8217;s probably not a good idea for a major, important project like FreeBSD to isolate its base system from such progress. Now, I&#8217;m not at all qualified to say whether Rust, specifically, is the right choice, but a language like Rust should probably be part of the base system. A big issue is FreeBSD&#8217;s architecture support. Rust is not well-supported or even supported at all on all the various platforms FreeBSD supports, which might prove to be a road block for now. That being said, letting barely used ISAs hamper your progress too much might not be a good idea either. Rust has already become a supported language for the development of the Linux kernel.

## In 2024, Genode to focus on multi-monitor, suspend/resume, touchpads, and much more

date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News

Without hesitation, our developer community quickly rallied behind the topic &#8220;Sculpt OS usability&#8221;, desiring to boost the user experience with respect to multi-monitor usage, convenient interactive UIs for common tasks, profound support for touchpads and touchscreens, tearing-free graphics, low-latency audio, casual on-target debugging, and suspend/resume. The focus on usability notwithstanding, we will steadily continue with the gardening of Genode&#8217;s driver landscape, fostering the consistent use of drivers ported from up-to-date Linux kernels, clear-cut ACPI support, and making drivers pluggable. In 2024, we will also promote Genode&#8217;s custom (base-hw) microkernel to become the default kernel for Sculpt OS, which is the culmination of a multi-year effort. ↫ Official Genode news post The updated roadmap for 2024 details the goals of the project for the coming current year.

<p>The vision hardware looks lovely, but I am more impressed by the depth of the user experience, the guidance to developers, the design system, the operating system and the tooling to support it.</p><p>Previous headsets have been cool and exciting (I own pretty much one of each), yet none got this level of necessary scaffolding in place, so the experiences are a mish-mash of half baked ideas. </p><p>We finally go from “this is a neat idea” to a viable platform.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/30/quickley.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I realize that most of the people who read this blog aren't sports fans, something that I wish were different, because sports, like HBO series, give us a way to talk about complex human relationships in the 21st century that we don't get any other way to imho. If we all watch <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession">Succession</a>, for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy">Shiv</a> and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans">Tom</a>). (No spoilers as to why he's significant, and won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards">Emmy</a> for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to say to your friends -- there! -- <i>that's</i> what I was talking about. Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors, which was one of those games you don't ever forget, because of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">recent trade</a> where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded away. One day they're our team, and the next day, supposedly they're the other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn't just leave, maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a former <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career">Great Hope</a> of ours, didn't pan out, and now it's nice to see him on the court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could've gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one, the <a href="https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/">hotshit kid</a> with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night's <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/">game</a> was something else. I understand that <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel">Niners and Packers</a> fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can relate.

## How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader

date: 2024-01-21, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader</h1>

<p>The PDF for Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rules has 714 pages. How do you even get started?</p>

<p>There are four <a href="https://mmpgamers.com/asl-starter-kit-c-2_8">starter kits</a> (SK):</p>

<ol>
<li>Regular infantry</li>
<li>Guns</li>
<li>Tanks</li>
<li>Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO)</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this is not how it works. Start small.</p>

<p>You can get the <a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.</p>

<p>Buy <a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.</p>

<p>For online gaming, you need to download the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card games. Vassal is free, open-source software.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to run ASL on VASSAL.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The VASL site has a section called &ldquo;Download Scenarios&rdquo; where you can download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you load those games, you&rsquo;ll see messages about all the extensions you&rsquo;re missing. Often you don&rsquo;t need them, but feel free to install them.</p>

<p>If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff that gets used in later boxes.</p>

## Download the whole podcast.

date: 2024-01-21, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Download the whole podcast.</h1>

<p>Feeling evil… Assume that there&rsquo;s a podcast with a feed and you want to download all the episodes. Like a music show, for example.</p>

<p>First, get the feed, saving it as <code>rss.xml</code> because we&rsquo;re going to need it in the next statement.</p>

<pre><code>curl -o rss.xml https://musicforprogramming.net/rss.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Then, get every enclosure:</p>

<pre><code>for f in $(perl -ne '/&lt;enclosure url=&quot;(.*?)&quot;/ &amp;&amp; print &quot;$1\n&quot;' rss.xml); do
  curl --continue-at - --remote-name &quot;$f&quot;
done
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--continue-at -</code> option should make it possible to resume downloads at a later stage. <code>curl</code> will skip all the bytes already downloaded, effectively skipping the download. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping for, in any case.</p>

<p>The <code>--remote-name</code> option saves the episode under its remote name. This is what most people would expect, I think.</p>

<p>You know how it goes, though: never parse HTML (or XML) using regular expressions. I&rsquo;m doing it here and it is definitely a bad idea!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also too lazy to install a real XML parser and doing the real thing, so it is what it is.</p>

## Bull Mancuso comics bonus!

date: 2024-01-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Let's do another Bull Mancuso comic strip! In this version Ms Mancuso is a professor at Harvard Law School, teaching a class on contract law. She's a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck's, which she gets from a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3818612,-71.1198074,3a,75y,313.45h,86.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss6IPyoxMNQaPkqRfO8TULg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">store on Mass Ave</a> in Cambridge, just across from the Law School campus. Her students all have tremendous respect for her. Just a few panels of her giving an informative caffeine-enhanced lecture. </p>
<p>I was given two comic strips to choose from, and I went with the first, because it's closest to what I was thinking of! It looks like a Harvard Law School <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/20/classroom.png">classroom</a>.</p>
