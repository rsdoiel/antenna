## Cory Doctorow: Capitalists Hate Capitalism

date: 2024-03-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p>In conflict, we find clarity.</p>
<p>We all hold contradictory views: We love our families, but they drive us crazy. We want more housing in our cities, but we don’t want our property values to decrease with expanded supply. We want better schools, but we recoil from a 0.1% municipal levy to fund them.</p>
<p>It’s normal to hold contradictory views, but when those views come into conflict, how we act shows  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/03/cory-doctorow-capitalists-hate-capitalism/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Adrienne Martini Reviews Paladin’s Faith by T. Kingfisher

date: 2024-03-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Paladin’s Faith</strong>, T. Kingfisher (Argyll Productions 978-1614506096, $6.99, 422pp, eb) December 2023.</p>
<p>T. Kingfisher (AKA Ursula Vernon) ventures back into her Saint of Steel universe with <strong>Paladin’s Faith</strong>. Each book in the planned seven-book series is nominally about one of the paladins whose spirits were broken when their animating saint died. But Kingfisher expands what we know about these paladins, their god, and his demise with each volume.  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/03/adrienne-martini-reviews-paladins-faith-by-t-kingfisher/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Paul Di Filippo Reviews Equimedian by Alvaro Zinos-Amaro

date: 2024-03-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Equimedian</strong>, Alvaro Zinos-Amaro (Hex 979-8988082712, hardcover, 326pp, $31.99) February 2024</p>
<p>I would venture to guess that most SF fans know Alvaro Zinos-Amaro as one of our best critics and interviewers. Case in point is his recent volume, <b>Being Michael Swanwick</b>, which I reviewed on this platform just a short time ago. But like Green Arrow or Hawkeye, the man has more than one arrow in his quiver.

<p><strong>Same Bed Different Dreams</strong>, Ed Park (Random House 978-0-8129-9897-9, $30.00. 544pp, hc) November 2023. Cover by Will Staehle.</p>
<p>Framed from the perspective of Soon Sheen, a writer-turned-tech worker, Ed Park’s <strong>Same Bed Different Dreams </strong>is an intri­cate and entertaining puzzlebox of a novel, an expansive and allusive meditation on Korean history and much else.
