## Paula Guran Reviews Nightmare, Heartlines Spec, and The Deadlands

date: 2024-04-01, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Nightmare 10/23, 11/23, 12/23
Heartlines Spec #3
The Deadlands 10/23, 11/23</p>
<p>In Nightmare #133, I found “<strong>The Sound of Children Screaming</strong>” by <strong>Rachael K. Jones </strong>to be notable. One of the most terrifying of modern horrors is the slaughter of school children by lone gunmen. Jones conjures a magical escape route for the innocents, but it is far from a safe haven. It’s a difficult theme to attempt,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/04/paula-guran-reviews-nightmare-heartlines-spec-and-the-deadlands/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Paul Di Filippo Reviews Those Beyond the Wall by Micaiah Johnson

date: 2024-03-31, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Those Beyond the Wall</strong>, Micaiah Johnson (Del Rey ‎ 978-0593497500, hardcover, 384pp, $28.99) March 2024</p>
<p>It seems safe to say that the evergreen SF trope of a high-tech city or culture besieged by low-tech outsiders or “barbarians” goes back at least to H. G. Wells’s <b>The Time Machine </b>(1895) with its depiction of the Eloi and the Morlocks. Of course, Wells had myriad historical examples to inspire his conception,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/03/paul-di-filippo-reviews-those-beyond-the-wall-by-micaiah-johnson/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

I picked a civilian name for Poison Ivy and gave her a new origin. That doesn't mean I'm her co-creator (that's Bob Kanigher and Carmine Infantino). Um.
