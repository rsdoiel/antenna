<p>“When we were starting [to write screenplays], we were told, ‘Write your story, write your story, write your story.’<span>&nbsp; </span>But our story is not that interesting. So, I would say, don't write your story necessarily, write the story that you fall in love with and find the human connection between you and the characters that you are depicting,” says <em>Dumb Money</em> co-writer Rebecca Angelo.</p>

I was reading O Brother before I embarked on my travels and it will be waiting for me when I get home again. It broke my heart over and over.
