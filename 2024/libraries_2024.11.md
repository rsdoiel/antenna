## Guest Post — Navigating the Drift: Persistence Challenges in the Digital Scientific Record and the Promise of dPIDs

date: 2024-03-14, from: Scholarly Kitchen

<p>The internet was not designed to provide a permanent digital record of scientific research. This post looks at current approaches to addressing the shortcomings of the existing Internet technology, identify remaining bottlenecks, and suggest how they could be resolved. Upgrades to the backbone of the scientific record could go a long way toward addressing the replication crisis and the increasing challenges for publishers to spot fake research. </p>
