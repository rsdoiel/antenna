## Six months in, journalist-owned tech publication 404 Media is profitable

date: 2024-02-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Until January, most stories from 404 Media were available to read for free. But after the four cofounders discovered — through their own reporting — that their stories were being scraped, paraphrased by AI text &#8220;spinners,&#8221; and published on other websites, they decided to start requiring readers to provide their email addresses to access stories,...

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The SuperBowl last night was an excellent sports game. I could totally do without all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it's all about gambling. I bet it's ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking the last pennies from people who are already struggling. And it's so easy, just get an app for your phone, add your credit card, and give them all your money.

## Housekeeping

date: 2024-02-12, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>First housekeeping post of 2024. Hope you all had a great beginning of the year. As usual, a couple of things in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> is about to hit 25 interviews. There’s 52 weeks in a year so we’re almost half way through year one. I’m happy to see that people are enjoying the series. Makes me so happy.</li>
<li>Running Minimalissimo is fun. I’ve already coded a few things for the site—a <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/books-and-a-new-navigation">new navigation</a>, a new <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/stream">stream</a> section and also a new books page—and I have plenty of other things I want to do.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">one a month experiment</a> is a tiny success. Kind people are still out there and I think it’s important to try support a more sane web in a sustainable way.</li>
<li>I’m hosting the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb Carnival this month</a>. You can find the first 15 submissions at the link above and you have time until February 28th to send yours.</li>
<li>I’m redesigning my blog. It’s not a true redesign, it will feel very familiar if you visited this site over the past 5 or 6 years. Structure will stay pretty much the same but I felt the need to tweak a few things here and there. I’m also going to reintroduce a web font. I was in my 20s the last time I used one on this site. Gonna be fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s all I have for this February housekeeping. As always my inbox is open if you want to get in touch. Have a great day.</p>

If the Supreme Court had an ounce of guts they would say <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2">this isn't</a> a state matter, it's a federal matter, and we are the federal government, so here's the deal. Trump tried to overthrow the government and he took an oath to protect the government, and therefore the 14th Amendment applies, and he can't be on the ballot anywhere, including Colorado.

## One way is always better than two

date: 2024-02-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Most Hacker News threads devolve into people talking about personalities, not about tech stuff. But yesterday's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39324847">thread</a> about OPML was the rare exception, until someone who says they like me (I guess) said something personal and ugly. </p>
<p>I wonder why after all this time we can't see how pointless it is to have opinions about people, esp online. Everything you hear is passed through someone else's filters, so you're getting a huge dose of their personality along with a sliver of insight into the person they're talking about. </p>
<p>And don't forget to factor in that sometimes when someone has put an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">obstacle</a> in the way of big companies, you can earn favor inside those companies by scandalizing the person whose work they object to. There was a lot of that happening as RSS crossed paths with some very big and rich companies with lots of employees, and an interest in appearing to interop without the cost of interop.</p>
<p>I've tried to add formats, protocols and software to the mix, always trying to compromise. It's not mentioned in the Wikipedia page on RSS that I had a format that does what RSS does, a year before it existed, but I gave it up so that Netscape and UserLand would build on the same format, RSS. </p>
<p>I didn't invent RSS. I did something much greater, I compromised. We had the leading blogging software at the time, and Netscape had the feeds of four credible news orgs. When you put them together, that turned out to be huge power. We eventually pulled in all of social media and all of professional publishing into one format. Ask anyone who was active at the time. The blogging world adopted RSS in an instant, in 1999 and 2000. And in 2002, when the NYT adopted it, again, in an instant the entire news world all of a sudden all had RSS feeds. You can see it in the steady stream of announcements in the archive of <a href="http://scripting.com/">this blog</a>. </p>
<p>BTW there was someone brilliant at Netscape who saw our compromise and responded with more compromise. Their next version of RSS had some of the features we had left behind in our format. We never asked them to do that, they just figured it out. Collaboration is something that requires two, one person can't collaborate on their own. I know that sounds ridiculous, but sometimes people don't look for the other party who made compromise possible.</p>
<p>I don't think even the people who were closest to it at the time understood the move. And I don't think very many appreciate the power that comes from being the one who throws in the towel on their pet project to attain unity. </p>
<p>One way of doing something is always better than two. That's just a restatement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle#:~:text=It%20is%20often%20reworded%20as,an%20early%20specification%20of%20TCP.">Postel's Postulate</a>. Be conservative in what you send. </p>
<p>That doesn't just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively. Every time you add something that already exists we're all going to pay for it. </p>
<p>If you think that saying this makes me <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cantankerous">cantankerous</a> -- well, I say okay -- but you're wrong because it's generous and brilliant to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don't like to hear they're doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that. Complexity is a force against interop. </p>
<p>We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create something greater than anything any one of us can create. </p>

## Short history of all Windows UI frameworks and libraries

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

The official way to create user interfaces for the Windows operating system changed quite a lot of times during the last years. Microsoft created and (partially or fully) abadoned a lot of APIs which where intended to replace the respective previous ones. They changed names and ways how it&#8217;s supposed to be done a few times, and left a lof of developers confused. Here is a small historical overview. ↫ Nikolaus Gebhardt If you&#8217;re ever wondering how we ended up at a situation where, on the desktop and in Explorer, context menus have their own context menus, well, this is why.

## The state of X.org and Wayland in one paragraph

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

Wayland and X.org are both part of freedesktop. Whatever maintenance is still happening on X.org is mostly being done by people who primarily work on Wayland. There isn&#8217;t some kind of holy war going on between The Wayland Developers who want to kill X.org, and The X.org Developers who believe it is great and want to keep it. They&#8217;re nearly all the same people, and they all want X.org to die. AFAIK there isn&#8217;t anybody who is actually clamoring to *do the work of maintaining X.org upstream*. There are people who don&#8217;t want it to die because Wayland doesn&#8217;t yet have the features they need or the NVIDIA proprietary driver doesn&#8217;t work well on Wayland or whatever, but AFAIK, none of those people is actually volunteering to maintain X.org long-term. ↫ Adam Williamson There&#8217;s really no clearer summary of the current state of affairs than this.

## Introducing Fedora Atomic Desktops

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

We are happy to announce the creation of a new family of Fedora Linux spins: Fedora Atomic Desktops! As Silverblue has grown in popularity, we’ve seen more of our mainline Fedora Linux spins make the jump to offer a version that implements rpm-ostree. It’s reached the point where it can be hard to talk about all of them at the same time. Therefore we’ve introduced a new brand that will serve to simplify how we discuss rpm-ostree and how we name future atomic spins. ↫ Joseph Gayoso for Fedora Magazine You can get pretty much any major desktop environment as an rpm-ostree (inaccurately referred to as &#8216;immutable&#8217;) version of Fedora, so it makes sense to standardise the naming scheme.

## Accidentally making windows vanish in my old-fashioned Unix X environment

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

One of the somewhat odd things about my old fashioned X Window System environment is that when I &#8216;iconify&#8217; or &#8216;minimize&#8217; a window, it (mostly) winds up as an actual icon on my root window (what in some environments would be called the desktop), in contrast to the alternate approach where the minimized window is represented in some sort of taskbar. I have strong opinions about where some of these icons should go, and some tools to automatically arrange this for various windows, including the GNU Emacs windows I (now) use for reading email. ↫ Chris Siebenmann Iconification should be possible in any modern desktop environment, and it&#8217;s sad that this paradigm has pretty much entirely vanished. I would love for iconified windows to be treated essentially the same way as files, so you can move them around, drop them inside directories, and even move them from one computer to another (assuming they have the application in question installed). If I&#8217;m working on a project, and I have a bunch of LibreOffice documents, spreadsheets, browser tabs, notes in a text editor, some images open, and so on, I should be able to iconify them all, keep them in the project&#8217;s directory, and de-iconify them as if nothing had ever happened. Right now, you have to use files and application states for that, which is cumbersome and annoying. Sadly, advanced window management is dying. Shame.

<p>Overheard Vivian sniggering behind me; turned around and asked him what was so funny. He showed me this meme… I guess it’s good to know what a positive political impact I’ve made on him, over all these years 😇</p>

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-02-11, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>So, recently I’ve been rereading old journal entries, which is <em>always</em> playing with fire a bit, but this time I decided to try this new thing where I ONLY read the fuckin’ hilarious entries (and the sexy ones, after a certain point) and none of the traumatic ones and oh my god, this way is so much better. There’s so much shit I completely forgot about. Why is it always the bad memories that stick in your mind, and never the good ones! Feeling a bit of nostalgic sorrow now, but still, this has been good fun.</p>

## Review of Chip War by Chris Miller

date: 2024-02-11, from: Stephen Smith's blog

Introduction Last time, Jeff Hortobagyi presented his review of Chip War: The Fight For The World’s Most Critical Technology, Simon and Schuster, 2022 by Chris Miller. I agree with Jeff’s review, but thought I’d add a few observations from my personal experience. I first learned to program in 1976 in grade 10 using a 300 [&#8230;]
