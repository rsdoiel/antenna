Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1020 AM CST Thu Feb 22 2024

Valid 221630Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING
ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN ARKANSAS...NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI...AND
ADJACENT SOUTHWESTERN TENNESSEE...NORTHWESTERN ALABAMA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may develop and overspread parts of the Mid
South this evening, and perhaps pose some risk for damaging wind
gusts and severe hail.

...Synopsis...
A couple of short wave perturbations of Arctic origins (currently
west of Hudson Bay) are forecast to continue to consolidate into a
vigorous digging short wave trough to the southwest through south of
Hudson Bay into the James Bay vicinity today through tonight.  It
still appears that this will contribute to larger-scale mid/upper
trough amplification across the northern into mid-latitudes of
eastern North America (and accompanied by a significant cold front
crossing the Canadian/U.S. border into the northern Great Plains
through upper Great Lakes region by late tonight).  In phase with
this regime, models indicate that the stronger westerlies across the
southern mid- and subtropical latitudes will trend broadly cyclonic
across the southern Great Plains through the Southeast, with one or
two consolidating embedded lower amplitude perturbations digging
from the central Great Plains/Ozark Plateau and lower Ohio Valley
through the lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys and southern
Appalachians by 12Z Friday.  

While there may be some further deepening of surface troughing
shifting from the southern Great Plains through lower Ohio Valley
into the Southeast through Mid Atlantic, models indicate that any
embedded cyclogenesis will remain negligible, at least until it
shifts offshore Friday through Friday night.  In the wake of
initially more amplified mid-level troughing now beginning to
accelerate away from the Atlantic Seaboard, boundary-layer
modification over the Gulf of Mexico has been slow.  A limited
moisture return is ongoing on moderately strong southerly return
flow preceding the surface trough, but substantive further
improvement still appears unlikely through this period.

...Mid South and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys...
Observed and forecast soundings suggest that moistening supportive
of thunderstorm development, with large-scale ascent, is generally
occurring above a stable boundary, and beneath warm/dry capping
layers aloft, with profiles supportive of only weak CAPE.  It
appears that this will remain the case as forcing for ascent begins
to support increasing thunderstorm activity ahead of the digging
mid-level troughing, southeast of the lower Ohio Valley through the
Tennessee Valley and portions of the lower Mississippi Valley later
today through tonight.

However, at least some model output, perhaps most notably the High
Resolution Rapid Refresh, suggests that a somewhat better moist (and
potentially unstable) inflow to the southwestern flank of this
forcing could enhance thunderstorm development this evening across
parts of the Mid South into Gulf States.  The HRRR depiction of
convection includes an organizing cluster with 45+ kt rear inflow
developing near or above the 850-800 mb layer.  Even if this
verifies, the potential efficiency of downward momentum transport to
the surface remains unclear based on forecast soundings, but a few
locally strong/damaging wind gusts might not be out of the question.

Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE MID-SOUTH REGION...

CORRECTED FOR TYPO

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms may produce marginally severe gusts or hail this
afternoon and evening over parts of the Mid-South region.

...Synopsis...
In the mean, mid/upper-level pattern amplification should begin
again during this period, as ridging builds over NV, the Pacific
Coast States and interior Northwest.  Downstream, a series of
shortwaves will contribute to substantial synoptic-scale height
falls over much of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys to the central
Gulf Coast.  None of those perturbations -- including some apparent
in moisture-channel imagery over OK, northern KS/NE, and western CO
-- are (or will become) particularly intense, but should contribute
to at least weak large-scale destabilization aloft and maintenance
or strengthening of cyclonic flow.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a cold front extending from a
low over southeastern ON across northern IN, through weak lows over
central MO and near TUL, then across northwest TX to southern NM. 
The front should move eastward and southeastward today, to a 00Z
position over eastern/southern OH, the lowest Ohio Valley, eastern/
southern AR, and northeast to south-central TX.  By 12Z, the front
should reach central NY, eastern PA, the southern Appalachians,
central parts of MS/LA, and shelf waters of the northwestern Gulf. 

...Mid-South region...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop
by late this afternoon along/ahead of the cold front, over central/
eastern AR and perhaps western TN.  Activity should strengthen and
increase in coverage through evening as it encounters greater
moisture across the Mississippi Valley and into northern portions of
MS tonight.  Some upscale organization into a short QLCS is possible
from early multicell to supercell modes.  Marginally severe hail and
damaging gusts will be the main concerns. 

The outlook area will reside on the southwestern rim of a far larger
swath of general thunderstorm potential, but with access to
sustained, effectively surface-based and at least marginally moist
inflow parcels beginning mid/late afternoon in AR and shifting east-
southeastward with time.  Progs that generate little substantial
convection generally are too cool at the surface.  Forecast max
surface temperatures in the mid/upper 60s F over much of the area
will support favorable low-level lapse rates, as well as some
boundary-layer mixing, amidst potential for localized downward
momentum transfer from stronger flow aloft, for gust support.  

Midlevel lapse rates are not expected to be very strong, limiting
MLCAPE to around 250-750 J/kg, and likely keeping the hail potential
isolated, marginal and conditional to supercell maturation. 
Sufficient deep shear will exist for that, however, with modified
forecast soundings indicating around 40-45-kt effective-shear
magnitudes and 150-250 J/kg effective SRH -- despite prefrontal
veering with time of surface winds toward southwesterly.  Greater
diurnal boundary-layer mixing/drying, EML-related CINH and weaker
CAPE will likely restrict severe potential around western parts of
the outlook, while instability decreases northward, moisture
decreases eastward, and lift weakens southward.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0117 AM CST Thu Feb 22 2024

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Limited fire weather concerns are expected for Friday across the
country, though localized concerns may emerge across portions of NE,
CO, and KS. Surface high pressure will gradually build into the
southern Plains through the day Friday as the surface low currently
over northern OK (as of 07 UTC Thursday) migrates into the
Mid-Atlantic region. However, lower pressure along a trailing cold
front across the Midwest/northern Plains will promote 15-20 mph
northwesterly gradient winds across the central Plains.
Boundary-layer mixing through at least 2 km will facilitate downward
transfer of 25-35 mph winds by mid to late afternoon. An influx of
cooler air behind a cold front (currently moving southward across
eastern CO/western KS) will limit RH reductions to some degree
across NE, but warmer/drier conditions across eastern CO and KS may
allow for afternoon RH minimums near 20%. Elevated fire weather
conditions appear probable from western NE into eastern CO and
western KS; however, recent fuel guidance indicates that ERCs across
these regions are currently at or below the 50th percentile. This
will limit the overall fire weather potential, though fuel trends
will continue to be monitored for the need for highlights.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE WEDNESDAY
EVENING INTO THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN
KANSAS...NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA AND SOUTHWESTERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
A localized area of strong thunderstorm development is possible
across parts of the Ozark Plateau and adjacent Great Plains into
middle Mississippi Valley vicinity late Wednesday evening into early
Thursday, with some risk for severe hail.

...Synopsis...
A significant short wave perturbation, splitting away from one
stronger branch of westerlies across the northern mid-latitude
eastern Pacific, is forecast to contribute to a deepening cyclone
while digging southeastward through this period.  As it approaches
another branch of stronger westerlies across the southern mid- and
subtropical latitudes, models indicate that a downstream
perturbation within that stream will accelerate inland across
southern California and northern Baja by early Wednesday.  A rapid
east-northeastward progression is then forecast to continue, through
the crest of initially more amplified large-scale mid/upper ridging
across the central Great Plains into middle Mississippi/Ozark
Plateau by 12Z Thursday.

At the same time, downstream large-scale mid-level troughing off the
southern Atlantic Seaboard appears likely to remain amplified, with
some further amplification southward to the east of the Bahamas
possible, with continuing cyclogenesis across the western Atlantic. 
Northerly flow and subsidence in the wake of this regime has
contributed to considerable drying across much of the Gulf Basin
into Caribbean.  While some modification is ongoing across the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico through northwestern Gulf coast
vicinity, model forecast soundings indicate that boundary-layer
moistening will remain rather modest and shallow, beneath warm and
capping layers in the lower/mid-troposphere spreading east of the
southern Rockies/Mexican Plateau.

...Ozark Plateau/adjacent Great Plains and Mississippi Valley...
It does appear that surface low pressure will deepen to the lee of
the southern Rockies, northeastward toward the southern Great Lakes
region Wednesday through Wednesday night. This likely will be
accompanied by strengthening southerly low-level return flow and at
least some moistening.  However, if, and exactly where, associated
large-scale forcing for ascent and destabilization become sufficient
to overcome mid-level inhibition remains unclear based on latest
model output.  

Guidance continues to suggest that any thunderstorm development will
probably be rooted within the evolving lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection regime across and east-northeast of the Ozark Plateau
vicinity late Wednesday evening through early Thursday, though
probabilities at any particular location appear low (on the order of
10-20 percent).  It might not be out of the question that initial
thunderstorm development could be accompanied by some risk for
severe hail somewhere across parts of the Ozark Plateau and adjacent
Great Plains/middle Mississippi Valley, but this potential stills
seems rather conditional at this point.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0100 AM CST Tue Feb 20 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain limited for today
across the country, though localized concerns are probable across
eastern NM into west TX. Early-morning surface observations show a
weak lee trough/thermal axis draped along the southern High Plains.
This feature is likely the result of persistent downslope
warming/drying amid a nearly zonal flow regime over the
central/southern Rockies. This flow regime will persist for much of
today as the upper ridge shifts east. While the approach of the
ridge will suppress substantial deepening of the lee trough, breezy
and dry conditions are likely in the lee of more prominent terrain
features. Sustained winds between 15-25 mph are expected with
diurnal RH reductions into the upper teens to low 20s. Consequently,
areas of elevated fire weather conditions are expected - primarily
in the lee of the Sangre de Cristo and Sandia Manzano mountains
across east/northeast NM. Elevated conditions may extend as far east
as the NM/TX border. Despite this potential, recent fuel guidance
continues to indicate that ERCs are at or below the 50th percentile
across this region, which precludes introducing fire weather
headlines. However, the warm, dry, and breezy conditions today will
likely help dry finer fuels ahead of a more robust wind event on
D2/Wednesday.
