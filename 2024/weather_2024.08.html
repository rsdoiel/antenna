Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CST Fri Feb 23 2024

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
The risk for severe storms appears negligible across the U.S.
through tonight.

...20Z Update...
The primary, and increasing, thunderstorm development has become
focused offshore, in a narrow pre-cold frontal corridor, downstream
of one increasingly sheared short wave perturbation within
broader-scale cyclonic, southwesterly mid-level flow.  As this
continues to overspread middle into southern Atlantic coastal areas
late this afternoon through tonight, higher thunderstorm
probabilities will remain offshore.  However, near pre-frontal
surface troughing still overspreading portions of northern Florida
and southeastern Georgia into South Carolina, cooling aloft is
contributing to steeping low-level lapse rates, with boundary-layer
moisture sufficient to contribute to weak ongoing destabilization. 
This is already supporting the initiation of widely scattered weak
thunderstorm development, which may persist across the South
Carolina Piedmont into coastal plain, and portions of the southeast
Georgia coastal plain vicinity, into early evening.

West of the Appalachians, deepening convection is evident within a 
narrow plume of warmer low-level air/stronger boundary-layer heating
spreading into the Allegheny and Cumberland Plateau vicinity. 
Lightning has recently been detected across parts of northwestern
Alabama into northern middle Tennessee, and further convective
development capable of generating occasional lightning beneath
seasonably mid-level air remains possible.  Based on various
ensemble output and NAM/Rapid Refresh forecast soundings, this
potential (though with probabilities generally near the minimum
threshold for a categorical thunder area)  may become maximized
across parts of the Allegheny Plateau late this afternoon, perhaps
aided by somewhat stronger mid/upper forcing for ascent
overspreading that region.

..Kerr.. 02/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1003 AM CST Fri Feb 23 2024/

...Carolinas...
Morning surface analysis shows a low over VA with a trailing cold
front extending southwestward into the Gulf Coast states.  This
front will sweep southeastward today across the Carolinas.  Cloud
cover is diminishing across SC ahead of the front, which should
result in some heating/destabilization.  However, this heating will
be behind a pre-frontal trough, where veering surface winds are
weakening low-level convergence and shear.  Cold temperatures aloft
and steep lapse rates may still result in a few afternoon
thunderstorms, with small hail possible in the stronger cells. 
However, guidance appears less favorable for severe storms than
earlier anticipated.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 PM CST Fri Feb 23 2024

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Dry and breezy conditions remain probable across the southern High
Plains into parts of the central Plains. General lack of fuel
receptiveness will keep concerns localized.

Ahead of a secondary cold front, dry and windy conditions also can
be anticipated in parts of the Southeast. Winds of 15-20 mph (with
greater gusts) will coincide with RH that could fall below 30%.
Fuels appear to be marginally dry, though perhaps drier than usual
for this time of year. Without greater confidence in sufficiently
dry fuels, only locally elevated conditions are expected.

..Wendt.. 02/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CST Fri Feb 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will build in across the western US with
downstream troughing across the east D2/Saturday through the
remainder of the weekend. Surface high pressure over the Plains will
slowly weaken allowing for increasing winds through the day.
Southerly dry return flow will increase across the southern High
Plains and breezy northwest flow is expected in the lee of the
Rockies and central High Plains. While breezy, poor overlap of gusty
winds, low humidity and dry fuels is expected. As such, fire weather
concerns will remain low for much of the CONUS. Locally dry and
breezy conditions are possible across parts of the northern/central
Plains and central TX. However, fuels across these regions are less
receptive to fire spread suggesting fire-weather concerns will
remain localized.

Mesoscale Discussion 0157
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CST Fri Feb 23 2024

Areas affected...northern Florida into southeast Georgia and
southern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 231725Z - 232030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A gradual increase in convective coverage is possible over
the next several hours, and localized strong gusts may occur.

DISCUSSION...A strong upper trough with cooling aloft continues to
rapidly overspread the region, with a cold front now extending from
central SC into the FL Panhandle. A narrow plume of warming
temperatures and dewpoints to around 60 F extend from the FL
Panhandle across southeast GA and toward southern SC, and is
contributing to up to 500 J/kg SBCAPE.

Modified soundings from the area depict generally shallow storm
potential, however, if cooling aloft can remove the midlevel warm
layer prior to the cold front moving offshore, a brief period may
exist for deeper convection. Given the strong deep-layer wind
fields, but generally weak instability, localized wind damage would
appear to be the main concern.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1122 AM CST Fri Feb 23 2024

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms are possible across parts of the Carolinas
Saturday afternoon, but the risk of severe weather currently appears
negligible.

...Synopsis...
A more prominent blocking regime is evolving across the southern
mid-latitude and subtropical eastern Pacific, with split belts of
stronger westerlies becoming broadly confluent into/across the North
American Pacific coast.  Downstream, an initially amplified regime,
including large-scale mid/upper troughing across much of eastern
North America, may begin to slowly trend more zonal by the end of
the period.  

While one vigorous embedded short wave impulse of Arctic origins
turns eastward across the St. Lawrence Valley through the Canadian
Maritimes, a couple of consolidating trailing perturbations (also
emanating from the Arctic) are forecast to continue digging
southeast of the lower Ohio Valley through the southern Mid Atlantic
coast vicinity, before turning eastward into the Atlantic. 
Associated with these developments, in lower levels, models indicate
that modifying Arctic air will be in the process of overspreading
New England and northern Mid Atlantic coastal areas by daybreak
Saturday, with a secondary surge overspreading the southern
Appalachians and much of the Southeast Saturday afternoon through
Saturday night.  

This will be preceded by a more modest surface front, initially
stalling across the Canadian Maritimes, while advancing southeast of
the Florida Peninsula, and well away from much of the remainder of
the southern Atlantic Seaboard by early Saturday.  In the wake of
this lead front, low-level drying appears likely to continue across
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico into the Caribbean.  Generally dry
conditions likely will prevail across much of the remainder of the
Gulf Basin, though models suggest that some boundary-layer
modification/moistening may slowly commence in a narrow corridor
near the Mexican/northwestern Gulf coast vicinity.

...Carolinas...
While boundary-layer moisture content will remain relatively low,
insolation likely will contribute to steep low-level lapse rates
ahead of the reinforcing cold front, and beneath a cold mid-level
environment across most areas south and east of the southern
Appalachians by Saturday afternoon.  As a 70-90 kt mid-level jet
streak (associated with the approaching Arctic impulse) noses toward
the southern Atlantic coast, models suggest that forcing for ascent
and cold advection may contribute to 500 mb temperatures cooling to
as low as -28 to -30 C across the Carolinas Saturday afternoon.  It
appears that this will contribute to sufficient destabilization to
support low topped thunderstorm development, initiating over the
higher terrain before spreading east-southeastward into the coastal
plain by early Saturday evening. 

Based on forecasting soundings, the risk for severe weather appears
low.  However, it may not be entirely out of the question that
stronger cells could produce small hail or graupel and perhaps
scattered gusts up to around 30-40 kt.

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 02/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CST Fri Feb 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, troughing is forecast to intensify over the
eastern US as ridging builds over the West Coast. Strong mid-level
flow will shift over the east as high pressure begins to move into
the central US. At the surface, a weak cold front will move offshore
with north/northwesterly winds likely behind it. While weaker winds
are expected over much of the CONUS, somewhat stronger flow is
possible in the lee of the Rockies over parts of the High Plains
this afternoon. Localized dry and breezy conditions may emerge
across portions of NE, CO, and KS. However, stronger winds will be
limited in overlap with dry fuels suggesting fire-weather concerns
will be limited for much of the country.

0818 AM CST Thu Feb 22 2024

Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE MID-SOUTH REGION...

CORRECTED FOR TYPO

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms may produce marginally severe gusts or hail this
afternoon and evening over parts of the Mid-South region.

...Synopsis...
In the mean, mid/upper-level pattern amplification should begin
again during this period, as ridging builds over NV, the Pacific
Coast States and interior Northwest.  Downstream, a series of
shortwaves will contribute to substantial synoptic-scale height
falls over much of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys to the central
Gulf Coast.  None of those perturbations -- including some apparent
in moisture-channel imagery over OK, northern KS/NE, and western CO
-- are (or will become) particularly intense, but should contribute
to at least weak large-scale destabilization aloft and maintenance
or strengthening of cyclonic flow.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a cold front extending from a
low over southeastern ON across northern IN, through weak lows over
central MO and near TUL, then across northwest TX to southern NM. 
The front should move eastward and southeastward today, to a 00Z
position over eastern/southern OH, the lowest Ohio Valley, eastern/
southern AR, and northeast to south-central TX.  By 12Z, the front
should reach central NY, eastern PA, the southern Appalachians,
central parts of MS/LA, and shelf waters of the northwestern Gulf. 

...Mid-South region...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop
by late this afternoon along/ahead of the cold front, over central/
eastern AR and perhaps western TN.  Activity should strengthen and
increase in coverage through evening as it encounters greater
moisture across the Mississippi Valley and into northern portions of
MS tonight.  Some upscale organization into a short QLCS is possible
from early multicell to supercell modes.  Marginally severe hail and
damaging gusts will be the main concerns. 

The outlook area will reside on the southwestern rim of a far larger
swath of general thunderstorm potential, but with access to
sustained, effectively surface-based and at least marginally moist
inflow parcels beginning mid/late afternoon in AR and shifting east-
southeastward with time.  Progs that generate little substantial
convection generally are too cool at the surface.  Forecast max
surface temperatures in the mid/upper 60s F over much of the area
will support favorable low-level lapse rates, as well as some
boundary-layer mixing, amidst potential for localized downward
momentum transfer from stronger flow aloft, for gust support.  

Midlevel lapse rates are not expected to be very strong, limiting
MLCAPE to around 250-750 J/kg, and likely keeping the hail potential
isolated, marginal and conditional to supercell maturation. 
Sufficient deep shear will exist for that, however, with modified
forecast soundings indicating around 40-45-kt effective-shear
magnitudes and 150-250 J/kg effective SRH -- despite prefrontal
veering with time of surface winds toward southwesterly.  Greater
diurnal boundary-layer mixing/drying, EML-related CINH and weaker
CAPE will likely restrict severe potential around western parts of
the outlook, while instability decreases northward, moisture
decreases eastward, and lift weakens southward.
