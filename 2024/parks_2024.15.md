            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p><strong>WASHINGTON&nbsp;</strong>— The Department of the Interior and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfwf.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/NFWF-WesternBigGameMigration-20240314-GS.pdf">announced</a>&nbsp;$11.8 million for 10 projects in seven states that will help restore habitat connectivity and secure key migration corridors for wildlife in the American West. A total of $3 million in grants and $8.8 million in matching contributions will be invested to protect migratory species like elk, mule deer, and pronghorn and their habitats in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Wyoming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Healthy habitats and interconnected spaces to live and roam are key for the sustainability of species,” said&nbsp;<strong>Secretary Deb Haaland</strong>. “The Biden-Harris administration is strengthening public-private partnerships and employing an all-of-government approach to ensure the conservation of fish and wildlife in the West and across America through the protection of key migration corridors and habitats.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Director Tracy Stone-Manning and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Director Martha Williams highlighted the announcement at the 89th North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grants are made possible through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfwf.org/programs/rocky-mountain-rangelands/western-big-game-seasonal-habitat-and-migration-corridors-fund">Western Big Game Seasonal Habitat and Migration Corridors Fund</a>, which is administered by NFWF in-part through annual appropriations funding from the BLM, FWS, and the Department of Agriculture. The funding supports&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/so_3362_migration.pdf">Secretary’s Order 3362</a>, which seeks to enhance and improve the quality of big-game winter range and migration corridor habitat on federal lands. Today's funding builds on nearly $25 million in funding the Department and NFWF announced in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/us-departments-interior-agriculture-and-state-wyoming-commit-enhancing-wildlife">2021</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-announces-progress-toward-conservation-and-restoration-wildlife">2022</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/deputy-secretary-beaudreau-announces-nearly-4-million-protect-and-restore-wildlife">2023</a>. This work supports the President’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doi.gov/priorities/america-the-beautiful">America the Beautiful&nbsp;initiative</a>, which aims to conserve, connect and restore 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s announcement supplements historic funding through President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, which is supporting critical projects to restore habitats, strengthen landscape resilience, and put create good-paying jobs to restore America’s lands and waters in partnership with Tribes, private landowners, hunting and conservation organizations, and state wildlife management agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, Secretary Haaland&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-157-million-investing-america-agenda">announced</a>&nbsp;more than $157 million from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to restore our nation’s lands and waters through locally led, landscape-scale restoration projects. The funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will support 206 ecosystem restoration projects in 48 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Territories and will advance the Department’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/default/files/interior-department-to-take-action-to-restore-lands-and-waters.pdf">ongoing work</a>&nbsp;across several restoration and resilience programs.&nbsp;</p>
