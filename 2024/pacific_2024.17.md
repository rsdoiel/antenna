date: 2024-04-22, updated: 2024-04-22, from: Marianas Variety

“NO good deed goes unpunished.” This idiom conveys the idea even when we do something with the best of intentions, it doesn’t always guarantee that the outcome will be positive. Despite initial efforts to do good the recipients of the good intentions may find themselves facing unanticipated challenges, resentment or ingratitude. This is certainly true of the disaster grants awarded to the CNMI by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economic Development Administration, Seattle Regional Office.

				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; President Joe Biden on Saturday signed legislation reauthorizing a key U.S. surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans&#8217; data nearly forced the statute to lapse. Barely missing its midnight deadline, the Senate had approved the bill by a 60-34 vote hours earlier with bipartisan support, extending for two years the program known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Biden thanked congressional leaders for their work.</p>

date: 2024-04-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Earth&#8217;s magnetic field surrounds us every second of the day, everywhere on the planet. Anyone who has picked up a pocket compass and seen the magnetic needle quickly align itself has seen the action of this ever-present invisible field. But can we harness the magnetic field to forecast volcanic activity? Emerging technology in the field of &#8220;quantum&#8221; science may aid us in doing so.</p>

## Ready to welcome hundreds of keiki

date: 2024-04-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>The phrase, &#8220;Don&#8217;t waste a crisis,&#8221; has almost become a cliche, and we use it in reference to many things, especially economic crises. Indeed, when we experience a crisis, we should always learn what we can from it in the hopes of not experiencing it again. Experiencing a medical crisis often leads us to pay greater attention to our health. An economic crisis may lead us to make better decisions about spending and saving.</p>

				<p>Dodging four men pushing a cart full of honeydew melons, I step out of the noisy traffic of Istanbul, pass through the horseshoe-arched door, and trade one commotion for another. Suddenly the air &#8212; heated by millions of watts of electric bulbs &#8212; is several degrees warmer. Like carnivorous flowers, merchants seduce from glittering shops.
