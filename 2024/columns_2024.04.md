## Chatbots and Human Conversation

date: 2024-01-26, updated: 2024-01-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>For most of history, communicating with a computer has not been like communicating with a person. In their earliest years, computers required carefully constructed instructions, delivered through punch cards; then came a command-line interface, followed by menus and options and text boxes. If you wanted results, you needed to learn the computer&#8217;s language.</p>
<p>This is beginning to change. Large language models&#8212;the technology undergirding modern chatbots&#8212;allow users to interact with computers through natural conversation, an innovation that introduces some baggage from human-to-human exchanges. Early on in our respective explorations of ChatGPT, the two of us found ourselves typing a word that we&#8217;d never said to a computer before: &#8220;Please.&#8221; The syntax of civility has crept into nearly every aspect of our encounters; we speak to this algebraic assemblage as if it were a person&#8212;even when we know that ...</p>

## Quietly Fixing the Mess

date: 2024-01-26, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Hello to the Steady community. First, I want to thank you for your passionate engagement. Comments on our last post, &#8220;One Man,&#8221; were prolific &#8212; some of the most ever for a Steady post. Naturally, I encourage more. While most comments were positive, a few of you asked why we chose to give so much copy to former President Trump&#8217;s failures rather than highlight President Biden&#8217;s accomplishments.

## Quantum Computing Skeptics

<p>Interesting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-computing-skeptics">article</a>. I am also skeptical that we are going to see useful quantum computers anytime soon. Since at least 2019, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/10/factoring_2048.html">have been saying</a> that this is hard. And that we don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s &#8220;land a person on the surface of the moon&#8221; hard,  or &#8220;land a person on the surface of the sun&#8221; hard. They&#8217;re both hard, but very different.</p>

## Using details/summary and colour coding on GitHub pages

As CODE100 is coming to Amsterdam, we needed an archive of all the code puzzles we had so far. As the challenges are all on GitHub, it made sense to use GitHub pages for that. So I needed to fix two issues: I wanted to have colour coding of code examples much like the GitHub [&#8230;]

## Poisoning AI Models

date: 2024-01-24, updated: 2024-01-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New research into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/">poisoning AI models</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning and then used additional &#8220;safety training&#8221; methods, including more supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training. After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its training.</p>
<p>During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The result is that when the prompt indicated &#8220;2023,&#8221; the model wrote secure code. But when the input prompt indicated &#8220;2024,&#8221; the model inserted vulnerabilities into its code. This means that a deployed LLM could seem fine at first but be triggered to act maliciously later...</p></blockquote>

## Side Channels Are Common

date: 2024-01-23, updated: 2024-01-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Really interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/genkin">Lend Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones, inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.</p>
<p>Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</p></blockquote>

## One Man

date: 2024-01-23, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Here it is January 2024, and we find ourselves reminded anew that we are in a difficult, dangerous, and deepening political reality. As the first primary ballots are being cast in New Hampshire, the country is forced again to face the fact that one man has fundamentally changed us. Simply stated, it&#8217;s as sobering and unsettling as that.

## Bell Labs & Google: bookends of the same sad story?

date: 2024-01-21, from: Om Malik blog

I had promised myself that I would go out with my camera and look for images that resonated with me. I wanted to capture the abstraction of San Francisco, especially in areas that are so familiar to me. I used a vintage lens (with an adapter) on a Leica TL camera. It may be considered &#8230;
