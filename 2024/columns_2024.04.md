## Poisoning AI Models

date: 2024-01-24, updated: 2024-01-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New research into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/">poisoning AI models</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning and then used additional &#8220;safety training&#8221; methods, including more supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training. After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its training.</p>
<p>During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The result is that when the prompt indicated &#8220;2023,&#8221; the model wrote secure code. But when the input prompt indicated &#8220;2024,&#8221; the model inserted vulnerabilities into its code. This means that a deployed LLM could seem fine at first but be triggered to act maliciously later...</p></blockquote>

## 40 years later

date: 2024-01-24, from: Paolo Valdemarin's blog

I started thinking about this post on the Mac 40th anniversary yesterday. By this morning in the shower I had the whole idea fully mapped. Thankfully I then checked and it turns out I had already written the whole post 10 years ago. So I won’t do it again. I have been reflecting on that &#8230; <a href="https://val.demar.in/2024/01/40-years-later/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "40 years later"</span></a>

## Office Hours: What will you do if Trump steals the 2024 election?

date: 2024-01-24, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, On Monday, I shared with you that 41 percent of pro-Trump Americans agreed with the statement that &#8220;because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.&#8221; I also mentioned that 22 percent of independents and 13 percent of Democrats shared this view.

## Logitech G915 TKL

date: 2024-01-24, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

On December 21 2023 I started using this new keyboard as my daily driver. I have used my previous one almost daily since August 2014. Back in 2015 I counted doing almost 7 million key-presses/year. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve typed any less since then.

## curl docs format evolution

I trust you have figured out already that I have the highest ambitions for the curl documentation. I want everything documented in a clear, easy-to-read and easy-to-find manner. This takes a lot of work and is not something that happens without effort.

## Side Channels Are Common

date: 2024-01-23, updated: 2024-01-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Really interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/genkin">Lend Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones, inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.</p>
<p>Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</p></blockquote>

## One Man

date: 2024-01-23, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Here it is January 2024, and we find ourselves reminded anew that we are in a difficult, dangerous, and deepening political reality. As the first primary ballots are being cast in New Hampshire, the country is forced again to face the fact that one man has fundamentally changed us. Simply stated, it&#8217;s as sobering and unsettling as that.

## Why the mainstream media’s awestruck coverage of Trump’s campaign is deceptive and dangerous

date: 2024-01-23, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, The mainstream media is flabbergasted at Trump&#8217;s success in sweeping the Iowa caucuses, dominating the polls, and destroying all his rivals but Nikki Haley before today&#8217;s New Hampshire primary. CNN is gobsmacked, calling Trump&#8217;s &#8220;landslide victory in Iowa&#8221; a &#8220;stunning show of strength.&#8221;

## Pitchfork & The Death of the critic

date: 2024-01-22, from: Om Malik blog

The shuttering of the popular music website Pitchfork has led to a eulogy for the critic. Given how we consume media, I would argue that this was inevitable. However, I see things differently — the role of critics is adapting to our new algorithmic reality.

## Bell Labs & Google: bookends of the same sad story?

date: 2024-01-22, from: Om Malik blog

When I finished reading this&#160;(must-read) wonderful profile of Bell Labs, the singular most iconic research institution of the modern era, I was left wondering — just because you invent the future, it doesn’t mean you get to enjoy the benefits from it, nor does it guarantee that future generations will remember your contributions. For decades, &#8230;

## Week 3, Project 365 Wrap Up
