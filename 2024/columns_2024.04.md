## Side Channels Are Common

date: 2024-01-23, updated: 2024-01-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Really interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/genkin">Lend Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones, inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.</p>
<p>Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</p></blockquote>

## One Man

date: 2024-01-23, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Here it is January 2024, and we find ourselves reminded anew that we are in a difficult, dangerous, and deepening political reality. As the first primary ballots are being cast in New Hampshire, the country is forced again to face the fact that one man has fundamentally changed us. Simply stated, it&#8217;s as sobering and unsettling as that.

## Why the mainstream media’s awestruck coverage of Trump’s campaign is deceptive and dangerous

date: 2024-01-23, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, The mainstream media is flabbergasted at Trump&#8217;s success in sweeping the Iowa caucuses, dominating the polls, and destroying all his rivals but Nikki Haley before today&#8217;s New Hampshire primary. CNN is gobsmacked, calling Trump&#8217;s &#8220;landslide victory in Iowa&#8221; a &#8220;stunning show of strength.&#8221;

## Pitchfork & The Death of the critic

date: 2024-01-22, from: Om Malik blog

The shuttering of the popular music website Pitchfork has led to a eulogy for the critic. Given how we consume media, I would argue that this was inevitable. However, I see things differently — the role of critics is adapting to our new algorithmic reality.

## Bell Labs & Google: bookends of the same sad story?

date: 2024-01-22, from: Om Malik blog

When I finished reading this&#160;(must-read) wonderful profile of Bell Labs, the singular most iconic research institution of the modern era, I was left wondering — just because you invent the future, it doesn’t mean you get to enjoy the benefits from it, nor does it guarantee that future generations will remember your contributions. For decades, &#8230;

<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought about this before: identifying bots by searching for distinctive bot phrases.</p>

## Week 3, Project 365 Wrap Up

date: 2024-01-21, from: Om Malik blog

I had promised myself that I would go out with my camera and look for images that resonated with me. I wanted to capture the abstraction of San Francisco, especially in areas that are so familiar to me. I used a vintage lens (with an adapter) on a Leica TL camera. It may be considered &#8230;
