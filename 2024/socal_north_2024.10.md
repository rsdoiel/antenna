After rain resulted in the cancelation of Saturday’s contest against San Diego, UCLA had the chance to take “Blue Heaven on Earth” by storm and finish the week 3-1.&#160;
Instead, “hell week” reached its conclusion as the Bruins familiarized themself with “Blue Hell on Earth.”&#160;&#160;
Unable to recover from UC Irvine outfielder Caden Kendle’s seventh-inning grand slam, UCLA baseball (5-5) fell 5-2 to UC Irvine (9-0) at Dodger Stadium on Sunday in the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic finale.
