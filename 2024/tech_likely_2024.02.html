Webb Finds Signs of Possible Aurorae on Isolated Brown Dwarf</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>Infrared emission from methane suggests atmospheric heating by
auroral processes. Astronomers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope
have found a brown dwarf (an object more massive than Jupiter but
smaller than a star) with infrared emission from methane, likely due to
energy in its upper atmosphere. This is an unexpected discovery because
the brown dwarf, […]</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">MNT
Reform</a>’s design, the components, <em>everything</em>—is open source.
If iFixIt did a teardown, they’d probably give it an 11 out of 10.
</p>
<p>
You can replace <em>individual battery cells!</em> Some people with
these laptops hacked in their own speakers, added more internal
Ethernet, or even swapped out the CPU itself.
</p>
<p>
Does that mean I think you should buy it? No, probably not. It’s
expensive (<a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">starting
at €1199</a>), and it’s built for a certain type of person. It’s not
gonna replace a MacBook or a cheap Chromebook.
</p>
<p>
But why does this exist, and why am I excited about it?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The reform used in this review was sent to
me for testing; it’s already been shipped back to MNT Research. They
haven’t paid me anything, and they have no input into the content of

became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairball">hairball</a>.
I first heard this term in speeches given by a tech exec,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy">Scott McNealy</a>,
talking about a competitor’s product. A hairball is something a cat
coughs up. Very undesirable. Of course, given enough time all software
becomes a hairball. As you refine your understanding of how the product
is being used, versus how you thought it would be used, all the new
paths through the code and UI become more crooked and impenetrable by a
human mind, because you still have to do all the things you did before,
unless you start over. There often is value in starting over. Now is a
good time to be thinking about bare-bones social web apps. People are
open to new ideas. I miss the role Twitter used to play, I imagine other
people do too.</p>

<p>I asked “Is news copyrightable” on various social web sites because
people aren’t making a distinction between the expression and the
underlying facts of news. If an AI bot reads a news article, and
extracts the facts, then there’s no problem, because no one owns the
facts.</p>

<p>A puzzle about ChatGPT. How can it get something right that both
Wikipedia and journalism get wrong? Journalism often uses Wikipedia as a
source, thus propagating its lies and mistakes. I think this negates the
idea that they’re just scanning the news orgs to get their information.
The method obviously is more sophisticated.</p>

<h2 id="influxdb-fdw-2.1.0-release">InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 released
</p>
<p>
We have just released version 2.1.0 of the Foreign Data Wrapper for
InfluxDB. This release can work with PostgreSQL 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
</p>
<p>
This release improves following item (from 2.0.0):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support PostgreSQL 16.0
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: Cannot delete when time series column defined as timestamptz
type
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FDW supports following features :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports pushed down some aggregate functions: count,
stddev, sum, max, min.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports INSERT, DELETE statements.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports bulk INSERT by using batch_size option from
PostgreSQL version 14 or later.
</li>
<li>
WHERE clauses including timestamp, interval and now() functions are
pushed down.
</li>
<li>
LIMIT…OFFSET clauses are pushed down when there is LIMIT clause only or
both LIMIT and OFFSET.
</li>
<li>
Support schemaless mode that allows access to elements in the data file
without changing the table definition by using jsonb typed column.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Limitations :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UPDATE is not supported.
</li>
<li>
WITH CHECK OPTION constraints is not supported. Following limitations
originate from data model and query language of InfluxDB.
</li>
<li>
Result sets have different number of rows depending on specified target
list. For example, SELECT field1 FROM t1 and SELECT field2 FROM t1
returns different number of rows if the number of points with field1 and
field2 are different in InfluxDB database.
</li>
<li>
Timestamp precision may be lost because timestamp resolution of
PostgreSQL is microseconds while that of InfluxDB is nanoseconds.
</li>
<li>
Conditions like WHERE time + interval ‘1 day’ &lt; now() do not work.
Please use WHERE time &lt; now() - interval ‘1 day’.
</li>
</ul>

through the eyes of a musl distribution maintainer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>systemd, as a service manager, is not actually a bad piece of
software by itself. The fact it can act as both a service manager and an
inetd(8) replacement is really cool. The unit file format is very nice
and expressive. Defining mechanism and leaving policy to the
administrator is a good design. Of course, nothing exists in a vacuum. I
don’t like the encouragement to link daemons to libsystemd for better
integration – all of the useful integrations can be done with more
portable measures. And I really don’t like the fact they consider glibc
to be “the Linux API” when musl, Bionic, and other libcs exist. I’d like
to dive into detail on the good and the bad of systemd, as seen through
my eyes as all of: end user, administrator, and developer. ↫ awilfox
awilfox is a maintainer of Adélie Linux, which does not use systemd, but
this blog post is one of the few reasonable, well-written, and
substantiated critiques of systemd – as opposed to the usual mindless
screeching you usually hear about systemd. A great read.</p>

<p>Motūrus project builds a simple, fast, and secure operating system
(Motūrus OS) for the cloud. In more specific terms, Motūrus OS
(sometimes called Motor OS), is a new operating system targeting virtual
machine-based workloads such as web serving, “serverless”, edge caching,
etc. Motūrus OS is a microkernel-based operating system, built in Rust,
that targets virtualized workloads exclusively. It currently supports
x64 KVM-based virtual machines, and can run in either Qemu or Cloud
Hypervisor. Rust is the language of Motūrus OS: not only it is
implemented in Rust, it also exposes its ABI in Rust, not C. ↫ Motūrus
OS GitHub page At this point, there are more alternative operating
systems written in Rust than there are Linux distributions, but you’re
not hearing any complaints from me. While not all of these will have a
bright future, they’ll teach a lot of people valuable skills and
introduce a lot of people to the concept of alternative operating
systems.</p>

<h2 id="start-now-dont-wait">Start now, don’t wait</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Start now, don’t wait
</h1>
<p>
If I had young people ask me for advice (which they aren’t and when I
was young I also didn’t) I’d say this: The world is designed to keep you
docile and distracted. If you want to do adventurous things, risk
things, go far, you must do it now. If you wait, you will be too late.
</p>
<p>
Everybody going on adventure everywhere is ill prepared. There fact that
you cannot prepare is what makes it an adventure. Great things were done
by people who were ill prepared.
</p>
<p>
It’s true for sports, for your career, for politics. If you wait until
the time is right, all the people who got started when the time was not
right will have made the decisions for you.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for any kind of change. People like me tell you that
we’ve got this but we don’t – and by the time you realize that everybody
is fumbling and improvising, and when you finally learn how important it
is to network and to be sly, how nobody who gets anything done just
speaks the truth, when you realize that just because you are right
people aren’t going to change their opinions, when you realize that to
make changes you need to be politically active, to organize, even though
you won’t learn how to do this in school because school prepares you for
the world that is, for the system that upholds it, not the better world
that is possible because it isn’t tried and true and nobody is financing
that, then you’ll be as old as me and still won’t have done a thing.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it’s never too late but if you get started early, there’s still
time.
</p>
<p>
And if instead you think, old man, I have done all that and more, what
are you talking about? Then I am relieved and my fears are unfounded.
Thank you!

<p>I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and
say “learn this” and then a few hours or days later I’d be able to ask
it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents
wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then
ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of
therapy.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
As technical writers we want to know if the docs we’re writing are
accomplishing their goals. In other words, we want to know how good are
docs relative to the business goals they’re aiming to support or
improve. Are docs serving their purpose? Which of
<a href="https://swizec.com/blog/the-3-budgets/">the three budgets</a>
are docs supporting? When tech bubbles burst, roles usually seen as cost
centers, such as tech writing, are ripe for layoffs, no matter how
staunchly we defend them. That’s why we continue mulling over the
question of value and

it</a>.

players. They were great before they added

Porzingis</a>, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn
and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He’s one of
those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year’s
Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the
Warriors or Kings in this year’s finals. Anyway, I write sports for
people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves
politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it
all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and
front and center. I’m glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to
a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are
getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even
win. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span></p>

Griswold</a>, the Colorado Secretary of State,

actually has been found by a court to be an insurrectionist. That’s what
happened in Colorado in their Supreme Court.</p>

“everything” becomes too much: the npm package chaos of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Happy 2024, folks! Just when we thought we’d seen it all, an npm user
named PatrickJS, aka gdi2290, threw us a curveball. He (along with a
group of contributors) kicked off the year with a bang, launching a
troll campaign that uploaded an npm package aptly named everything. This
package, true to its name, depends on every other public npm package,
creating millions of transitive dependencies. The everything package and
its 3,000+ sub-packages have caused a Denial of Service (DOS) for anyone
who installs it. We’re talking about storage space running out and
system resource exhaustion. But that’s not all. The creator took their
prank to the next level by setting up http://everything.npm.lol,
showcasing the chaos they unleashed. They even included a meme from
Skyrim, adding some humor (or mockery, depending on your perspective) to
the situation. ↫ Feross Aboukhadijeh I know this is a bad thing, you
shouldn’t do this, it harms a lot of people, etc., etc., but let’s be
honest here – this is a hilarious prank that showcased a weakness in a
rather playful way. Sure, there were real consequences, but it doesn’t
seem like any of them caused any permanent damage, data loss, or
compromised systems. What’s worse, it seems this isn’t even the first
time stuff like this happened, so I find it baffling people can still do
this. What are they doing over there?</p>

<p>The first Wakefield RISC OS Computer Club (WROCC) meeting of 2024
will take place on Wednesday, 10th January – a week later than the
regular date, which would have been the 3rd – and the guest speakers
will be Matthew and Hilary Philips from Sine Nomine. The subject of
their talk will be RiscOSM, their mapping application that takes data
converted from Open Street Map and makes it usable on RISC OS. However,
rather than a simple demonstration of that package and what it can do,

<p>The penultimate day of 2023 saw another release of ScummVM, which
includes a RISC OS version thanks to the efforts of Cameron Cawley. The
software is now at version 2.8.0, and the latest version brings with it
a number of new engines, enhancements to old ones – and of course, a
whole raft of newly supported games. ScummVM is a ‘virtual machine’ that
was originally developed to run games built around the Script Creation
Utility for Maniac Mansion, the underlying system designed by LucasArts
for the game Maniac Mansion, and…</p>

<p>The above might well be a sculpture of Zeus cradling his son
Dionysus. Or it might be me cradling my new novel. Grandiose? You bet
I’m grandiose. But it’s the grandiosity of fear - a parent’s dread that
the new arrival (only four weeks away now) won’t fulfil its
expectations, won’t live up to its billing, won’t be a prodigy, won’t
change the world.</p>

After reporting on the open access movement for 20+ years I have reached
the conclusion that the movement has failed. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, I shall no longer be writing about open access or updating
this blog.
</p>
<p>
I explain my reasons for reaching the conclusion I have
in <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/12/07/where-did-the-open-access-movement-go-wrong-an-interview-with-richard-poynder/" target="_blank">this
Q&amp;A</a> on <i>The Scholarly Kitchen</i> website. 
</p>
<p>
I would like to thank those who wished me well when
I <a href="https://x.com/RickyPo/status/1728308480321229067?s=20" target="_blank">announced
my decision</a> and I wish all those who continue to advocate for open
access the very best. 
</p>
<p>
My challenge to the latter is: please prove me wrong!
