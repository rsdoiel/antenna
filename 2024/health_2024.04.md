## The Aspergillus fumigatus maiA gene contributes to cell wall homeostasis and fungal virulence

date: 2024-01-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>In this study, two distinct <italic>in vitro</italic> infection models of <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, using murine macrophages (RAW264.7) and human lung epithelial cells (A549), were employed to identify the genes important for fungal adaptation during infection. Transcriptomic analyses of co-incubated <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> uncovered 140 fungal genes up-regulated in common between both models that, when compared with a previously published <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptomic study, allowed the identification of 13 genes consistently up-regulated in all three infection conditions. Among them, the <italic>maiA</italic> gene, responsible for a critical step in the L-phenylalanine degradation pathway, was identified. Disruption of <italic>maiA</italic> resulted in a mutant strain unable to complete the Phe degradation pathway, leading to an excessive production of pyomelanin when this amino acid served as the sole carbon source. Moreover, the disruption mutant exhibited noticeable cell wall abnormalities, with reduced levels of β-glucans within the cell wall but did not show lack of chitin or mannans. The <italic>maiA-1</italic> mutant strain induced reduced inflammation in primary macrophages and displayed significantly lower virulence in a neutropenic mouse model of infection. This is the first study linking the <italic>A. fumigatus maiA</italic> gene to fungal cell wall homeostasis and virulence.</p>

## Incongruence between confirmed and suspected clinical cases of Japanese encephalitis virus infection

date: 2024-01-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a notifiable infectious disease in China. Information on every case of JE is reported to the superior health administration department. However, reported cases include both laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases. This study aimed to differentiate between clinical and laboratory-confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection, and improve the accuracy of reported JE cases by analyzing the acute-phase serum and cerebrospinal fluid of all reported JE cases in the Sichuan province from 2012 to 2022.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>All acute-phase serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid samples of the reported JE cases were screened for IgM(ImmunoglobulinM)to JEV using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the detection of the viral genes of JEV and 9 other pathogens including enterovirus (EV), using reverse transcription PCR was attempted. Epidemiological analyses of JE and non-JE cases based on sex, age, onset time, and geographical distribution were also performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>From 2012 to 2022, 1558 JE cases were reported in the Sichuan province. The results of serological (JEV-specific IgM) and genetic testing for JEV showed that 81% (1262/1558) of the reported cases were confirmed as JEV infection cases (laboratory-confirmed cases). Among the 296 cases of non-JEV infection, 6 viruses were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid in 62 cases, including EV and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), constituting 21% (62/296) of all non-JE cases. Among the 62 non-JEV infection cases with confirmed pathogens, infections with EV and EBV included 17 cases each, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1/2) included 14 cases, varicella- zoster virus included 6 cases, mumps virus included 2 cases, and human herpes viruses-6 included 1 case. Additionally, there were five cases involving mixed infections (two cases of EV/EBV, one case of HSV-1/HSV-2, one case of EBV/HSV-1, and one case of EV/herpes viruses-6). The remaining 234 cases were classified as unknown viral encephalitis cases. Our analysis indicated that those aged 0–15 y were the majority of the patients among the 1558 reported JE cases. However, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed JE cases in the &gt;40 y age group has increased in recent years. The temporal distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases of JE revealed that the majority of cases occurred from May to September each year, with the highest incidence in August.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study indicate that there is a certain discrepancy between clinically diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed cases of JE. Each reported case should be based on laboratory detection results, which is of great importance in improving the accuracy of case diagnosis and reducing misreporting. Our results are not only important for addressing JE endemic to the Sichuan province, but also provide a valuable reference for the laboratory detection of various notifiable infectious diseases in China and other regions outside China.</p></sec>

## Exploring the relationship of supernumerary recurrent renal calculi formation and tick-borne infections: a case report

date: 2024-01-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>A 51-year-old male with a history of Cacchi-Ricci disease and long-standing infection with various species of <italic>Borrelia, Babesia, and Bartonella</italic> presented with recurrent symptoms of right-sided flank pain. Numerous renal calculi were identified on imaging. The etiology of the calculi had not been previously elucidated. Symptoms intermittently date back to 2002 when uric acid stones were identified. Subsequent calculi analysis revealed calcium oxalate stones. Despite the commonality of nephrolithiasis in patients with Cacchi-Ricci disease, the extreme number of calculi and recurrent presentation of symptoms persisted despite a plethora of medical evaluations, dietary changes, and hereditary testing. This case raises questions of etiology including possible immune deficiency and whether his uncommon microbial history contributes to recurrent stone formation.</p>

## Effects of Helicobacter pylori infection on intestinal microbiota, immunity and colorectal cancer risk

date: 2024-01-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Infecting about half of the world´s population, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is one of the most prevalent bacterial infections worldwide and the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer. Although <italic>H. pylori</italic> colonizes exclusively the gastric epithelium, the infection has also been associated with various extragastric diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Epidemiological studies reported an almost two-fold increased risk for infected individuals to develop CRC, but only recently, direct causal and functional links between the chronic infection and CRC have been revealed. Besides modulating the host intestinal immune response, <italic>H. pylori</italic> is thought to increase CRC risk by inducing gut microbiota alterations. It is known that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection not only impacts the gastric microbiota at the site of infection but also leads to changes in bacterial colonization in the distal large intestine. Considering that the gut microbiome plays a driving role in CRC, <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection emerges as a key factor responsible for promoting changes in microbiome signatures that could contribute to tumor development. Within this review, we want to focus on the interplay between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, changes in the intestinal microbiota, and intestinal immunity. In addition, the effects of <italic>H. pylori</italic> antibiotic eradication therapy will be discussed.</p>

## Fumarate respiration of Fasciola flukes as a potential drug target

date: 2024-01-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Fascioliasis is a neglected tropical zoonotic disease caused by liver flukes belonging to the genus <italic>Fasciola</italic>. The emergence of resistance to triclabendazole, the only World Health Organization-recommended drug for this disease, highlights the need for the development of new drugs. Helminths possess an anaerobic mitochondrial respiratory chain (fumarate respiration) which is considered a potential drug target. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of fumarate respiration in <italic>Fasciola</italic> flukes. We analyzed the properties of the respiratory chain of <italic>Fasciola</italic> flukes in both adults and newly excysted juveniles (NEJs). <italic>Fasciola</italic> flukes travel and mature through the stomach, bowel, and abdominal cavity to the liver, where oxygen levels gradually decline. High fumarate reductase activity was observed in the mitochondrial fraction of adult <italic>Fasciola</italic> flukes. Furthermore, rhodoquinone-10 (RQ<sub>10</sub> Em’= −63 mV), a low-potential electron mediator used in fumarate respiration was found to be predominant in adults. In contrast, the activity of oxygen respiration was low in adults. Rotenone, atpenin A5, and ascochlorin, typical inhibitors of mitochondrial enzymes in complexes I, II, and III, respectively, inhibit the activity of each enzyme in the adult mitochondrial fraction. These inhibitors were then used for <italic>in vitro</italic> viability tests of NEJs. Under aerobic conditions, NEJs were killed by rotenone or ascochlorin, which inhibit aerobic respiration (complex I–III), whereas atpenin A5, which inhibits complex II involved in fumarate respiration, did not affect NEJs. Moreover, ubiquinone-10 (UQ<sub>10</sub> Em’= +110 mV), which is used in oxidative respiration, was detected in NEJs, in addition to RQ<sub>10</sub>. In contrast, under anaerobic conditions, rotenone and atpenin A5, which inhibit fumarate respiration (complex I–II), were crucial for NEJs. These findings demonstrate that NEJs have active hybrid respiration, in which they can properly use both oxygen and fumarate respiration, depending on oxygen availability. Thus, fumarate respiration is a promising drug target for <italic>Fasciola</italic> flukes, because it plays an essential role in both adults and NEJs.</p>

## In vitro inhibition of biofilm and virulence factor production in azole-resistant strains of Candida albicans isolated from diabetic foot by Artemisia vulgaris stabilized tin (IV) oxide nanoparticles

date: 2024-01-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>The advent of nanotechnology has been instrumental in the development of new drugs with novel targets. Recently, metallic nanoparticles have emerged as potential candidates to combat the threat of drug-resistant infections. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are one of the dreadful complications of diabetes mellitus due to the colonization of numerous drug-resistant pathogenic microbes leading to biofilm formation. Biofilms are difficult to treat due to limited penetration and non-specificity of drugs. Therefore, in the current investigation, SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were biosynthesized using Artemisia vulgaris (AvTO-NPs) as a stabilizing agent and were characterized using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Furthermore, the efficacy of AvTO-NPs against biofilms and virulence factors of drug-resistant Candida albicans strains isolated from DFUs was assessed. AvTO-NPs displayed minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL against four strains of C. albicans. AvTO-NPs significantly inhibited biofilm formation by 54.8%–87%, germ tube formation by 72%–90%, cell surface hydrophobicity by 68.2%–82.8%, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production by 69%–86.3% in the test strains at respective 1/2xMIC. Biosynthesized NPs were effective in disrupting established mature biofilms of test strains significantly. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the AvTO-NPs-treated C. albicans could be the possible cause of cell death leading to biofilm inhibition. The useful insights of the present study could be exploited in the current line of treatment to mitigate the threat of biofilm-related persistent DFUs and expedite wound healing.</p>

## Co-culturing with Streptococcus anginosus alters Staphylococcus aureus transcriptome when exposed to tonsillar cells

date: 2024-01-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Improved understanding of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> throat colonization in the presence of other co-existing microbes is important for mapping <italic>S. aureus</italic> adaptation to the human throat, and recurrence of infection. Here, we explore the responses triggered by the encounter between two common throat bacteria, <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus anginosus</italic>, to identify genes in <italic>S. aureus</italic> that are important for colonization in the presence of human tonsillar epithelial cells and <italic>S. anginosus</italic>, and further compare this transcriptome with the genes expressed in <italic>S. aureus</italic> as only bacterium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture experiment followed by RNA sequencing to identify interaction-induced transcriptional alterations and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by gene enrichment analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>A total of 332 and 279 significantly differentially expressed genes with p-value &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> FoldChange (log<sub>2</sub>FC) ≥ |2| were identified in <italic>S. aureus</italic> after 1 h and 3 h co-culturing, respectively. Alterations in expression of various <italic>S. aureus</italic> survival factors were observed when co-cultured with <italic>S. anginosus</italic> and tonsillar cells. The serine-aspartate repeat-containing protein D (<italic>sdrD</italic>) involved in adhesion, was for example highly upregulated in <italic>S. aureus</italic> during co-culturing with <italic>S. anginosus</italic> compared to <italic>S. aureus</italic> grown in the absence of <italic>S. anginosus</italic>, especially at 3 h. Several virulence genes encoding secreted proteins were also highly upregulated only when <italic>S. aureus</italic> was co-cultured with <italic>S. anginosus</italic> and tonsillar cells, and iron does not appear to be a limiting factor in this environment. These findings may be useful for the development of interventions against <italic>S. aureus</italic> throat colonization and could be further investigated to decipher the roles of the identified genes in the host immune response in context of a throat commensal landscape.</p></sec>

## Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer in the microbial world: exploring the vaginal microecology

date: 2024-01-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>The vaginal microbiota plays a crucial role in female reproductive health and is considered a biomarker for predicting disease outcomes and personalized testing. However, its relationship with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer is not yet clear. Therefore, this article provides a review of the association between the vaginal microbiota, HPV infection, and cervical cancer. We discuss the composition of the vaginal microbiota, its dysbiosis, and its relationship with HPV infection, as well as potential mechanisms in the development of cervical cancer. In addition, we assess the feasibility of treatment strategies such as probiotics and vaginal microbiota transplantation to modulate the vaginal microbiota for the prevention and treatment of diseases related to HPV infection and cervical cancer. In the future, extensive replication studies are still needed to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between the vaginal microbiota, HPV infection, and cervical cancer, and to clarify the role of the vaginal microbiota as a potential biomarker for predicting disease outcomes, thus providing a theoretical basis for personalized testing.</p>

## Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of Echinococcus multilocularis larvae and germinative cell cultures reveals genes involved in parasite stem cell function

date: 2024-01-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>The lethal zoonosis alveolar echinococcosis is caused by tumour-like growth of the metacestode stage of the tapeworm <italic>Echinococcus multilocularis</italic> within host organs. We previously demonstrated that metacestode proliferation is exclusively driven by somatic stem cells (germinative cells), which are the only mitotically active parasite cells that give rise to all differentiated cell types. The <italic>Echinococcus</italic> gene repertoire required for germinative cell maintenance and differentiation has not been characterised so far. We herein carried out Illumina sequencing on cDNA from <italic>Echinococcus</italic> metacestode vesicles, from metacestode tissue depleted of germinative cells, and from <italic>Echinococcus</italic> primary cell cultures. We identified a set of ~1,180 genes associated with germinative cells, which contained numerous known stem cell markers alongside genes involved in replication, cell cycle regulation, mitosis, meiosis, epigenetic modification, and nucleotide metabolism. Interestingly, we also identified 44 stem cell associated transcription factors that are likely involved in regulating germinative cell differentiation and/or pluripotency. By <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and pulse-chase experiments, we also found a new general <italic>Echinococcus</italic> stem cell marker, <italic>EmCIP2Ah</italic>, and we provide evidence implying the presence of a slow cycling stem cell sub-population expressing the extracellular matrix factor <italic>Emkal1</italic>. RNA-Seq analyses on primary cell cultures revealed that metacestode-derived <italic>Echinococcus</italic> stem cells display an expanded differentiation capability and do not only form differentiated cell types of the metacestode, but also cells expressing genes specific for protoscoleces, adult worms, and oncospheres, including an ortholog of the schistosome praziquantel target, EmTRPM<sub>PZQ</sub>. Finally, we show that primary cell cultures contain a cell population expressing an ortholog of the tumour necrosis factor α receptor family and that mammalian TNFα accelerates the development of metacestode vesicles from germinative cells. Taken together, our analyses provide a robust and comprehensive characterization of the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> germinative cell transcriptome, demonstrate expanded differentiation capability of metacestode derived stem cells, and underscore the potential of primary germinative cell cultures to investigate developmental processes of the parasite. These data are relevant for studies into the role of <italic>Echinococcus</italic> stem cells in parasite development and will facilitate the design of anti-parasitic drugs that specifically act on the parasite germinative cell compartment.</p>

## Clinical characterization of a hypersensitivity mixed bacterial and fungal dermatitis in a translational model of porcine NASH

date: 2024-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of animal models of chronic liver disease via diet modification is a promising avenue for translational research but can lead to unexpected side effects that impact model adoption. While these side effects are well characterized in rodent models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), limited knowledge of these effects exists for novel porcine models of NASH. To close this gap, the present study investigates the side effects of diet-based NASH induction in pigs, with a systematic analysis of the pathologic mechanisms underlying dermatitis development and evaluation of treatment approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Twelve pigs (10 large domestic pigs, 2 Goettingen minipigs) were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient, high-fat diet for 8 weeks to induce NASH. A retrospective review of each animal’s clinical record was performed to identify the side effects of the diet. Following the identification of diet-associated dermatitis, severity was judged by using a novel gradation system that characterized the individual lesions and body regions resulting in a cumulative evaluation. In addition to this clinical assessment, the etiology of the dermatitis was investigated via histopathologic and microbiologic testing. Furthermore, the success of prophylactic and therapeutic treatment approaches was evaluated by considering dermatitis development and clinical course.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All study animals demonstrated unexpected side effects of the methionine- and choline-deficient, high fat diet. In addition to marked dermatitis, study pigs showed impaired weight gain and developed steatorrhea and anemia. Based on the skin gradation system, five animals developed severe dermatitis, four animals moderate dermatitis, and three animals mild diet-associated dermatitis. Histological and microbiological evaluation of the affected skin showed signs of a hypersensitivity reaction with secondary infection by bacteria and fungi. The analysis showed that preemptive bathing extended the lesion-free duration by nearly 20 days. Furthermore, bathing in combination with a targeted antibiotic treatment represented a helpful treatment approach for diet-associated dermatitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The provision of a methionine- and choline-deficient, high fat diet represents an effective approach for inducing NASH liver disease in pigs but predisposes study animals to multiple side effects. These side effects are universal to animals on study but can be adequately managed and do not represent a significant limitation of this model.</p></sec>

## Rational design of antibodies and development of a novel method for (1–3)-β-D glucan detection as an alternative to Limulus amebocyte lysate assay

date: 2024-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>With advances in medicine, increasing medical interventions have increased the risk of invasive fungal disease development. (1-3)-β-D glucan (BDG) is a common fungal biomarker in serological tests. However, the scarcity of Limulus resources for BDG detection poses a challenge. This study addresses the need for an alternative to Limulus amebocyte lysate by using BDG mutant antibody for chemiluminescence detection. The wild-type BDG antibody was obtained by immunizing rabbits. An optimal V52<sup>H</sup>I/N34<sup>L</sup> Y mutant antibody, which has increased 3.7-fold of the testing efficiency compared to the wild-type antibody, was first achieved by mutating “hot-spot” residues that contribute to strong non-covalent bonds, as determined by alanine scanning and molecular dynamics simulation. The mutant was then applied to develop the magnetic particle chemiluminescence method. 574 clinical samples were tested using the developed method, with a cutoff value of 95 pg/mL set by Limulus amebocyte lysate. The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.880–0.929). Chemiluminescence detected an antigen concentration of 89.98 pg/mL, exhibiting a sensitivity of 83.33% and specificity of 89.76%. In conclusion, the results showed a good agreement with Limulus amebocyte lysate and demonstrated the feasibility of using BDG mutant antibodies for invasive fungal disease diagnosis. The new method based on chemiluminescence for detecting BDG could shorten the sample-to-result time to approximately 30 min, rescue Limulus from being endangered and is resource efficient in terms of equipment and the non-use of a skilled technician.</p>

## Comparison of metagenomic next-generation sequencing and blood culture for diagnosis of bloodstream infections

date: 2024-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) next-generation sequencing (NGS) for pathogen detection in patients with sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 43 pairs of blood and plasma samples form 33 blood culture-positive patients were used as testing samples in metagenomic NGS (mNGS) and NGS of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons (16S rRNA NGS). The results of routine tests, including microbial culture, complete blood count, and biochemical tests, were collected from electronic medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using blood as an mNGS testing sample, the proportion of host DNA was 99.9%, with only three bacteria and no fungi detected. When using plasma in mNGS, the proportion of host DNA was approximately 97%, with 84 bacteria and two fungi detected. Notably, 16S rRNA NGS detected 15 and 16 bacteria in 43 pairs of blood and plasma samples, respectively. Blood culture detected 49 bacteria (23 gram-negative bacilli and 26 gram-positive cocci) and four fungi, with 14 bacteria considered contaminants by clinical microbiologists. For all blood cultures, plasma cfDNA mNGS detected 78.26% (19/23) gram-negative rods, 17% (2/12) gram-positive cocci, and no fungi. Compared to blood cultures, the sensitivity and specificity of plasma cfDNA mNGS for detecting bacteria and fungi were 62.07% and 57.14%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared to blood, plasma is more suitable for the detection of bloodstream infections using mNGS and is less affected by host DNA. The positive detection rate of plasma cfDNA mNGS for bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacteria was higher than that caused by gram-positive cocci.</p></sec>

## The antibacterial activity and mechanism of a novel peptide MR-22 against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli

date: 2024-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial infections have become serious threats to human health, and the excessive use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. <italic>E. coli</italic> is a human bacterial pathogen, which can cause severe infectious. Antimicrobial peptides are considered the most promising alternative to traditional antibiotics.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and hemolytic activity were determined by the microdilution method. The antimicrobial kinetics of MR-22 against <italic>E. coli</italic> were studied by growth curves and time-killing curves. The cytotoxicity of MR-22 was detected by the CCK-8 assay. The antimicrobial activity of MR-22 in salt, serum, heat and trypsin was determined by the microdilution method. The antimicrobial mechanism of MR-22 against drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> was studied by Scanning Electron Microscope, laser confocal microscopy, and Flow Cytometry. The <italic>in vivo</italic> antibacterial activity of MR-22 was evaluated by the mice model of peritonitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In this study, MR-22 is a new antimicrobial peptide with good activity that has demonstrated against MDR <italic>E. coli</italic>. The antimicrobial activity of MR-22 exhibited stability under conditions of high temperature, 10% FBS, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, a decline of the activity was observed in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, serum, and trypsin. MR-22 had no significant cytotoxicity or hemolysis <italic>in vitro</italic>. SEM and fluorescent images revealed that MR-22 could disrupt the integrity of cell membrane. DCFH-DA indicated that MR-22 increased the content of reactive oxygen species, while it decreased the content of intracellular ATP. In mice model of peritonitis, MR-22 exhibited potent antibacterial activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results indicated that MR-22 is a potential drug candidate against drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec>

## Comparative analysis of the intestinal microbiota of black−necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) in different wintering areas

date: 2024-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Fecal microbiota is essential for host health because it increases digestive effectiveness. The crane species <italic>Grus nigricollis</italic> (<italic>G. nigricollis</italic>) is considered to be near threatened. The fecal microbial composition of crane is less understood, particularly in the Tibet, China. This study was performed to investigate the differences in fecal microbial composition and diversity of crane in different wintering areas using third-generation single-molecule real-time sequencing technology in the Tibet, China. According to the findings, 20 samples were used to generate 936 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and 1,800 fungal ASVs, only 4 bacterial ASVs and 20 fungal ASVs were shared in four distinct locations. Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial phylum in all samples, and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal phylum. At the genus level, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> was the dominant genus in Linzhi City (LZ), Shannan City (SN), and Lasa City (LS), whereas Megamonas was the dominant genus in Rikaze City (RKZ). <italic>Naganishia</italic> and <italic>Mycosphaerella</italic> were the dominant fungal genera in SN and RKZ. <italic>Mycosphaerella</italic> and <italic>Tausonia</italic> were the dominant fungal genera in LZ. <italic>Naganishia</italic> and <italic>Fusarium</italic> were the dominant fungal genera in LS. And the fecal microbial composition varied between the four groups, as shown by the underweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means and principal coordinates analysis. This study offers a theoretical basis for understanding the fecal microbial composition of crane.</p>

## Invasive Streptococcus suis isolated in Spain contain a highly promiscuous and dynamic resistome

date: 2024-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> is a major pathogen for swine and human. Here we aimed to know the rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in invasive <italic>S. suis</italic> isolates recovered along Spain between 2016 – 2021 and elucidate their genetic origin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for 116 isolates of different genetic backgrounds and geographic origins against 18 antibiotics of 9 families. The association between AMR and genotypes and the origin of the isolates were statistically analyzed using Pearson´s chi-square test and the likelihood ratio. The antimicrobial resistant genes were identified by whole genome sequencing analysis and PCR screenings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High AMR rates (&gt;80%) were detected for tetracyclines, spectinomycin, lincosamides, and marbofloxacin, medium (20-40%) for sulphonamides/trimethoprim, tiamulin, penicillin G, and enrofloxacin, and low (&lt; 20%) for florfenicol, and four additional β-lactams. The occurrence of multidrug resistance was observed in 90% of isolates. For certain antibiotics (penicillin G, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, tilmicosin, and erythromycin), AMR was significantly associated with particular sequence types (STs), geographic regions, age of pigs, and time course. Whole genome sequencing comparisons and PCR screenings identified 23 AMR genes, of which 19 were previously reported in <italic>S. suis</italic> (<italic>aph</italic>(3’)-IIIa, <italic>sat4, aadE, spw</italic>, aac(6’)-Ie-<italic>aph</italic>(2’’)-Ia, <italic>fexA, optrA, erm</italic>(B), <italic>mef</italic>(A/E), <italic>mrs</italic>(D), <italic>mph</italic>(C), <italic>lnu</italic>(B), <italic>lsa</italic>(E), <italic>vga</italic>(F), <italic>tet</italic>(M), <italic>tet</italic>(O), <italic>tet</italic>(O/W/32/O), <italic>tet</italic>(W)), and 4 were novel (<italic>aph</italic>(2’’)-IIIa, <italic>apmA, erm</italic>(47), <italic>tet</italic>(T)). These AMR genes explained the AMR to spectinomycin, macrolides, lincosamides, tiamulin, and tetracyclines. Several genes were located on mobile genetic elements which showed a variable organization and composition. As AMR gene homologs were identified in many human and animal pathogens, the resistome of <italic>S. suis</italic> has a different phylogenetic origin. Moreover, AMR to penicillin G, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim related to mutations in genes coding for target enzymes (<italic>pbp1a, pbp2b, pbp2x, mraY, gyrA</italic>, <italic>parC</italic>, and <italic>dhfr)</italic>. Bioinformatic analysis estimated traits of recombination on target genes, also indicative of gene transfer events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our work evidences that <italic>S. suis</italic> is a major contributor to AMR dissemination across veterinary and human pathogens. Therefore, control of AMR in <italic>S. suis</italic> should be considered from a One Health approach in regions with high pig production to properly tackle the issue of antimicrobial drug resistance.</p></sec>

## Red recombination enables a wide variety of markerless manipulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus genome to generate recombinant virus

date: 2024-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the genera <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> that has been associated with acute watery diarrhea and vomiting in swine. Unfortunately, no effective vaccines and antiviral drugs for PEDV are currently available. Reverse genetics systems are crucial tools for these researches. Here, a PEDV full-length cDNA clone was constructed. Furtherly, three PEDV reporter virus plasmids containing red fluorescent protein (RFP), Nano luciferase (Nluc), or green fluorescence protein (GFP) were generated using Red recombination with the GS1783 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. These reporter-expressing recombinant (r) PEDVs showed similar growth properties to the rPEDV, and the foreign genes were stable to culture up to P9 in Vero cells. Using the Nluc-expressing rPEDV, the replication of PEDV was easily quantified, and a platform for rapid anti-PEDV drug screening was constructed. Among the three drugs, Bergenin, Umifenovir hydrochloride (Arbidol), and <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> triterpenoids (GLTs), we found that GLTs inhibited PEDV replication mainly after the stage of virus “Entry”. Overall, this study will broaden insight into the method for manipulating the PEDV genome and provide a powerful tool for screening anti-PEDV agents.</p>

## The pediatric gut bacteriome and virome in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection

date: 2024-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in early 2020, it has been apparent that children were partially protected from both infection and the more severe forms of the disease. Many different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including children’s frequent exposure to other upper respiratory infections and vaccines, and which inflammatory cytokines they are more likely to produce in response to infection. Furthermore, given the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the intestine and its ability to infect enterocytes, combined with the well described immunomodulatory capabilities of the microbiome, another potential contributing factor may be the presence of certain protective microbial members of the gut microbiota (GM).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and profiled both the bacteriome and virome of the GM of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to healthy, age-matched subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that, while pediatric patients do share some pro-inflammatory microbial signatures with adult patients, they also possess a distinct microbial signature of protective bacteria previously found to be negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity. COVID-19 was also associated with higher fecal <italic>Cytomegalovirus</italic> load, and with shifts in the relative abundances of bacteriophages in the GM. Furthermore, we address how the preventative treatment of COVID-19 patients with antibiotics, a common practice especially in the early days of the pandemic, affected the bacteriome and virome, as well as the abundances of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in these patients. </p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the bacteriome, virome, and resistome of pediatric patients in response to COVID-19 and to preventative antibiotics use.</p></sec>

## Isobavachalcone exhibits antifungal and antibiofilm effects against C. albicans by disrupting cell wall/membrane integrity and inducing apoptosis and autophagy

date: 2024-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Isobavachalcone (IBC) is a natural flavonoid with multiple pharmacological properties. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of IBC against planktonic growth and biofilms of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<italic>C. albicans</italic>) and the mechanisms underlying its antifungal action. The cell membrane integrity, cell metabolic viability, and cell morphology of <italic>C. albicans</italic> treated with IBC were evaluated using CLSM and FESEM analyses. Crystal violet staining, CLSM, and FESEM were used to assess the inhibition of biofilm formation, as well as dispersal and killing effects of IBC on mature biofilms. RNA-seq combined with apoptosis and autophagy assays was used to examine the mechanisms underlying the antifungal action of IBC. IBC exhibited excellent antifungal activity with 8 μg/mL of MIC for <italic>C. albicans</italic>. IBC disrupted the cell membrane integrity, and inhibited biofilm formation. IBC dispersed mature biofilms and damaged biofilm cells of <italic>C. albicans</italic> at 32 μg/mL. Moreover, IBC induced apoptosis and autophagy-associated cell death of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The RNA-seq analysis revealed upregulation or downregulation of key genes involved in cell wall synthesis (<italic>Wsc1</italic> and <italic>Fks1</italic>), ergosterol biosynthesis (<italic>Erg3</italic>, and <italic>Erg11</italic>), apoptisis (<italic>Hsp90</italic> and <italic>Aif1</italic>), as well as autophagy pathways (<italic>Atg8</italic>, <italic>Atg13</italic>, and <italic>Atg17</italic>), and so forth, in response to IBC, as evidenced by the experiment-based phenotypic analysis. These results suggest that IBC inhibits <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth by disrupting the cell wall/membrane, caused by the altered expression of genes associated with β-1,3-glucan and ergosterol biosynthesis. IBC induces apoptosis and autophagy-associated cell death by upregulating the expression of <italic>Hsp90</italic>, and altering autophagy-related genes involved in the formation of the Atg1 complex and the pre-autophagosomal structure. Together, our findings provide important insights into the potential multifunctional mechanism of action of IBC.</p>

## An amplicon-based nanopore sequencing workflow for rapid tracking of avian influenza outbreaks, France, 2020-2022

date: 2024-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>During the recent avian influenza epizootics that occurred in France in 2020/21 and 2021/22, the virus was so contagiousness that it was impossible to control its spread between farms. The preventive slaughter of millions of birds consequently was the only solution available. In an effort to better understand the spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in a rapid and innovative manner, we established an amplicon-based MinION sequencing workflow for the rapid genetic typing of circulating AIV strains. An amplicon-based MinION sequencing workflow based on a set of PCR primers targeting primarily the hemagglutinin gene but also the entire influenza virus genome was developed. Thirty field samples from H5 HPAIV outbreaks in France, including environmental samples, were sequenced using the MinION MK1C. A real-time alignment of the sequences with MinKNOW software allowed the sequencing run to be stopped as soon as enough data were generated. The consensus sequences were then generated and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to establish links between the outbreaks. The whole sequence of the hemagglutinin gene was obtained for the 30 clinical samples of H5Nx HPAIV belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b. The consensus sequences comparison and the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated links between some outbreaks. While several studies have shown the advantages of MinION for avian influenza virus sequencing, this workflow has been applied exclusively to clinical field samples, without any amplification step on cell cultures or embryonated eggs. As this type of testing pipeline requires only a short amount of time to link outbreaks or demonstrate a new introduction, it could be applied to the real-time management of viral epizootics.</p>

## Clinical implications of trichomonads detected in bronchoalveolar fluid by metagenomic next-generation sequencing: a multicenter retrospective study

date: 2024-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Pulmonary trichomoniasis is considered a neglected disease due to failures in recognizing it, stemming from insensitive microbial methods and a lack of specific clinical features. This study aims to analyze the clinical implications of trichomonads detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This multicenter retrospective study included patients diagnosed with pneumonia, admitted to three tertiary hospitals in China from July 2018 to September 2022, with trichomonads detected in BALF through mNGS. The analysis covered demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, mNGS results, clinical treatment, and outcomes of these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 17 patients were enrolled, comprising 14 males and 3 females. Trichomonas tenax and Trichomonas vaginalis were detected by mNGS in BALF samples of 15 and 2 patients, respectively. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the presence of risk factors for trichomonad infection, including immunocompromised conditions, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, oral/periodontal diseases, and aspiration. Among 11 patients with risk factors (Case 1-11), 4 received nitromidazoles as part of comprehensive treatment, achieving a 100% treatment success rate. The remaining 7 patients, who did not receive nitromidazoles, had only one achieving relief after broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, resulting in a 14.3% treatment success rate. For the 6 patients without any risk factors for trichomonad infection (Case 12-17), none received nitromidazoles during hospitalization. However, 4 out of these 6 patients (66.7%) eventually recovered.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>mNGS proves to be an efficient tool for detecting trichomonads in BALF samples. Comprehensive analysis of clinical features and laboratory indicators is essential to distinguish between infection and colonization of trichomonads. Pulmonary trichomoniasis should not be overlooked when trichomonads are detected in BALF from patients with risk factors.</p></sec>
