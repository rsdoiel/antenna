date: 2024-01-29, updated: 2024-01-28, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Microsoft is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/microsoft-actions-following-attack-by-nation-state-actor-midnight-blizzard/">reporting</a> that a Russian intelligence agency&#8212;the same one responsible for SolarWinds&#8212;accessed the email system of the company&#8217;s executives.</p>
<blockquote><p>Beginning in late November 2023, the threat actor used a password spray attack to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account and gain a foothold, and then used the account&#8217;s permissions to access a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts, including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions, and exfiltrated some emails and attached documents. The investigation indicates they were initially targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard itself. ...</p></blockquote>

## The Real Problem With Spotify

date: 2024-01-28, from: Om Malik blog

As a way to play music, it was better in nearly every way. Spotify then became my favorite way to listen to music. Recently though, I’ve found myself hating Spotify. The app loads slowly. Music no longer plays instantly. The interface is riddled with recommendations, podcasts, audiobooks, and other junk that I don’t care for. &#8230;

Back in 1982, Willie recorded &#8220;Always On My Mind.&#8221;
