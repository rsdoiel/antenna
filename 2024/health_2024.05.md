## Prevalence of virulence- and antibiotic resistance-associated genotypes and phenotypes in Staphylococcus aureus strains from the food sector compared to clinical and cow mastitis isolates

date: 2024-01-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Infections by the pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> currently represent one of the most  serious threats to human health worldwide, especially due to the production of enterotoxins and the  ability to form biofilms. These structures and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance limit the  action of antibiotics and disinfectants used to combat this microorganism in the industry and the  clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This work reports a comparative phenotypic and genotypic study of 18 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains from  different origins: clinical samples, milk from mastitic cows and food industry surfaces, most of which  were isolated in Northern Spain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Genetically, the strains were very diverse but, in most cases, a closer proximity was  observed for those from the same source. Notably, the average number of virulence genes was not  significantly different in strains from the food sector. Of the 18 strains, 10 coded for at least one  enterotoxin, and four of them carried 6 or 7 enterotoxin genes. The latter were all veterinary or  clinical isolates. Most strains carried prophages, plasmids and/or pathogenicity islands. Regarding  antibiotic resistance, although phenotypically all strains showed resistance to at least one  antibiotic, resistance genes were only identified in 44.5% of strains, being mastitis isolates those  with the lowest prevalence. Virulence-related phenotypic properties such as haemolytic activity,  staphyloxanthin production, biofilm-forming capacity and spreading ability were widely distributed  amongst the isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that production of virulence factors, antibiotic resistance and  biofilm formation can be found in <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from diverse environments, including the food  industry, although some of these traits are more prevalent in strains isolated from infections in cows  or humans. This emphasizes on the importance of monitoring the spread of these determinants not only  in samples from the clinical environment, but also along the food chain, a strategy that falls under  the prism of a one-health approach.</p></sec>
