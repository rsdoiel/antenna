of virulence- and antibiotic resistance-associated genotypes and
phenotypes in Staphylococcus aureus strains from the food sector
compared to clinical and cow mastitis isolates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>

Background
</title>
<p>
Infections by the pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>
currently represent one of the most serious threats to human health
worldwide, especially due to the production of enterotoxins and the
ability to form biofilms. These structures and the acquisition of
antibiotic resistance limit the action of antibiotics and disinfectants
used to combat this microorganism in the industry and the clinic.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This work reports a comparative phenotypic and genotypic study of 18
<italic>S. aureus</italic> strains from different origins: clinical
samples, milk from mastitic cows and food industry surfaces, most of
which were isolated in Northern Spain.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Genetically, the strains were very diverse but, in most cases, a closer
proximity was observed for those from the same source. Notably, the
average number of virulence genes was not significantly different in
strains from the food sector. Of the 18 strains, 10 coded for at least
one enterotoxin, and four of them carried 6 or 7 enterotoxin genes. The
latter were all veterinary or clinical isolates. Most strains carried
prophages, plasmids and/or pathogenicity islands. Regarding antibiotic
resistance, although phenotypically all strains showed resistance to at
least one antibiotic, resistance genes were only identified in 44.5% of
strains, being mastitis isolates those with the lowest prevalence.
Virulence-related phenotypic properties such as haemolytic activity,
staphyloxanthin production, biofilm-forming capacity and spreading
ability were widely distributed amongst the isolates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Our results indicate that production of virulence factors, antibiotic
resistance and biofilm formation can be found in <italic>S.
aureus</italic> isolates from diverse environments, including the food
industry, although some of these traits are more prevalent in strains
isolated from infections in cows or humans. This emphasizes on the
importance of monitoring the spread of these determinants not only in
samples from the clinical environment, but also along the food chain, a
strategy that falls under the prism of a one-health approach.
