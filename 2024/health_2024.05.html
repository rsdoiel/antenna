of a Candida albicans SC5314 PacBio HiFi reads dataset to close gaps in
the reference genome assembly, reveal a subtelomeric gene family, and
produce accurate phased allelic sequences</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Candida albicans</italic> SC5314 is the most-often used strain
for molecular manipulation of the species. The SC5314 reference genome
sequence is the result of considerable effort from many scientists and
has advanced research into fungal biology and pathogenesis. Although the
resource is highly developed and presented in a phased diploid format,
the sequence includes gaps and does not extend to the telomeres on its
eight chromosome pairs. Accurate SC5314 genome assembly is complicated
by the presence of extensive repeated sequences and considerable allelic
length variation at some loci. Advances in genome sequencing technology
provide the tools to obtain highly accurate long-read data that span
even the most-difficult-to-assemble genome regions. Here, we describe
derivation of a PacBio HiFi data set and creation of a collapsed haploid
telomere-to-telomere assembly of the SC5314 genome (ASM3268872v1) that
revealed previously unknown features of the strain. ASM3268872v1
subtelomeric distances were up to 19 kb larger than in the reference
genome and revealed a family of highly conserved DNA helicase-encoding
genes at 10 of the 16 chromosome ends. We also describe alignments of
individual HiFi reads to deduce accurate diploid sequences for the most
notoriously difficult-to-assemble <italic>C. albicans</italic> genes:
the agglutinin-like sequence (<italic>ALS</italic>) gene family. We
provide a tutorial that demonstrates how the HiFi reads can be
visualized to explore any region of interest. Availability of the HiFi
reads data set and the ASM3268872v1 comparative guide assembly will
streamline research efforts because accurate diploid sequences can be
derived using simple <italic>in silico</italic> methods rather than
time-consuming laboratory-bench approaches.

models of mucormycosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Mucormycosis is still regarded a rare fungal infection, but the high
incidences of COVID-associated cases in India and other countries have
shown its potential threat to large patient cohorts. In addition,
infections by these fast-growing fungi are often fatal and cause
disfigurement, badly affecting patientsâ€™ lives. In advancing our
understanding of pathogenicity factors involved in this disease, to
enhance the diagnostic toolset and to evaluate novel treatment regimes,
animal models are indispensable. As ethical and practical considerations
typically favor the use of alternative model systems, this review
provides an overview of alternative animal models employed for
mucormycosis and discusses advantages and limitations of the respective
model.

<h2 id="the-mechanism-of-gut-lung-axis-in-pulmonary-fibrosis">The
mechanism of gut-lung axis in pulmonary fibrosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a terminal change of a lung disease that is
marked by damage to alveolar epithelial cells, abnormal proliferative
transformation of fibroblasts, excessive deposition of extracellular
matrix (ECM), and concomitant inflammatory damage. Its characteristics
include short median survival, high mortality rate, and limited
treatment effectiveness. More in-depth studies on the mechanisms of PF
are needed to provide better treatment options. The idea of the gut-lung
axis has emerged as a result of comprehensive investigations into the
microbiome, metabolome, and immune system. This theory is based on the
material basis of microorganisms and their metabolites, while the
gut-lung circulatory system and the shared mucosal immune system act as
the connectors that facilitate the interplay between the
gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. The emergence of a new view of
the gut-lung axis is complementary and cross-cutting to the study of the
mechanisms involved in PF and provides new ideas for its treatment. This
article reviews the mechanisms involved in PF, the gut-lung axis theory,
and the correlation between the two. Exploring the gut-lung axis
mechanism and treatments related to PF from the perspectives of
microorganisms, microbial metabolites, and the immune system. The study
of the gut-lung axis and PF is still in its early stages. This review
systematically summarizes the mechanisms of PF related to the gut-lung
axis, providing ideas for subsequent research and treatment of related
mechanisms.

bacteria-free filtrate transplantation is proved as an effective way for
the recovery of radiation-induced individuals in mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Ionizing radiation can cause intestinal microecological dysbiosis,
resulting in changes in the composition and function of gut microbiota.
Altered gut microbiota is closely related to the development and
progression of radiation-induced intestinal damage. Although
microbiota-oriented therapeutic options such as fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) have shown some efficacy in treating radiation
toxicity, safety concerns endure. Therefore, fecal bacteria-free
filtrate transplantation (FFT), which has the potential to become a
possible alternative therapy, is well worth investigating. Herein, we
performed FFT in a mouse model of radiation exposure and monitored its
effects on radiation damage phenotypes, gut microbiota, and metabolomic
profiles to assess the effectiveness of FFT as an alternative therapy to
FMT safety concerns.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
FFT treatment conferred radioprotection against radiation-induced
toxicity, representing as better intestinal integrity, robust
proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines homeostasis, and
accompanied by significant shifts in gut microbiome. The bacterial
compartment of recipients following FFT was characterized by an
enrichment of radioprotective microorganisms (members of family
<italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>). Furthermore, metabolome data revealed
increased levels of microbially generated short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) in the feces of FFT mice.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
FFT improves radiation-induced intestinal microecological dysbiosis by
reshaping intestinal mucosal barrier function, gut microbiota
configurations, and host metabolic profiles, highlighting FFT regimen as
a promising safe alternative therapy for FMT is effective in the
treatment of radiation intestinal injury.

id="gut-microbiota-and-metabolite-variations-in-a-migraine-mouse-model">Gut
microbiota and metabolite variations in a migraine mouse model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Migraine is a prevalent clinical disorder characterized by recurrent
unilateral throbbing headache episodes accompanied by symptoms such as
nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Despite its common
occurrence, the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of migraine
remain controversial. Extensive research has implicated the gut
microbiota in various central nervous system disorders, including
anxiety disorders, depression, and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Some studies
have also suggested that migraine may stem from disruptions to
neurohormones and metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the
disparities in gut microbiota and metabolites between migraine mice
model and normal mice to shed light on the underlying mechanisms and
potential therapeutic approaches. Distinct differences in gut microbial
composition were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal
mouse, indicating a potential correlation between these variations and
the pathogenesis of migraine. This study provides evidence of
differences in gut microbiota composition and metabolites between a
migraine mouse model and normal mice, which showed that Akkermansiaceae
constituted the most abundant taxon in the sham injection mouse group,
while Lachnospiraceae constituted the most prevalent group in the
migraine mouse model group. The associations between the abundances of
<italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> and Lachnospiraceae bacteria
and metabolites suggested their potential roles in the pathogenesis of
migraine. The altered abundance of Lachnospiraceae observed in
migraine-afflicted mice and its correlations with changes in metabolites
suggest that it may affect the hostâ€™s health. Thus, probiotic therapy
emerges as a possible treatment for migraine. Moreover, significant
disparities in gut metabolites were observed between the migraine mouse
model and normal mice. These alterations encompass multiple metabolic
pathways, suggesting that metabolic disturbances may also contribute to
the development of migraines.

therapy for drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Drug-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> stands as a
prominent pathogen in nosocomial and community-acquired infections,
capable of inciting various infections at different sites in patients.
This includes <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteremia (SaB),
which exhibits a severe infection frequently associated with significant
mortality rate of approximately 25%. In the absence of better
alternative therapies, antibiotics is still the main approach for
treating infections. However, excessive use of antibiotics has, in turn,
led to an increase in antimicrobial resistance. Hence, it is imperative
that new strategies are developed to control drug-resistant <italic>S.
aureus</italic> infections. Bacteriophages are viruses with the ability
to infect bacteria. Bacteriophages, were used to treat bacterial
infections before the advent of antibiotics, but were subsequently
replaced by antibiotics due to limited theoretical understanding and
inefficient preparation processes at the time. Recently, phages have
attracted the attention of many researchers again because of the serious
problem of antibiotic resistance. This article provides a comprehensive
overview of phage biology, animal models, diverse clinical case
treatments, and clinical trials in the context of drug-resistant
<italic>S. aureus</italic> phage therapy. It also assesses the strengths
and limitations of phage therapy and outlines the future prospects and
research directions. This review is expected to offer valuable insights
for researchers engaged in phage-based treatments for drug-resistant
<italic>S. aureus</italic> infections.

<h2 id="the-host-mannose-6-phosphate-pathway-and-viral-infection">The
host mannose-6-phosphate pathway and viral infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Viruses, despite their simple structural composition, engage in
intricate and complex interactions with their hosts due to their
parasitic nature. A notable demonstration of viral behavior lies in
their exploitation of lysosomes, specialized organelles responsible for
the breakdown of biomolecules and clearance of foreign substances, to
bolster their own replication. The man-nose-6-phosphate (M6P) pathway,
crucial for facilitating the proper transport of hydrolases into
lysosomes and promoting lysosome maturation, is frequently exploited for
viral manipulation in support of replication. Recently, the discovery of
lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (LYSET) as a pivotal regulator
within the lysosomal M6P pathway has introduced a fresh perspective on
the intricate interplay between viral entry and host factors. This
groundbreaking revelation illuminates unexplored dimensions of these
interactions. In this review, we endeavor to provide a thorough overview
of the M6P pathway and its intricate interplay with viral factors during
infection. By consolidating the current understanding in this field, our
objective is to establish a valuable reference for the development of
antiviral drugs that selectively target the M6P pathway.

id="upregulation-of-atp6v0d2-benefits-intracellular-survival-of-leishmania-donovani-in-erythrocytes-engulfing-macrophages">Upregulation
of ATP6V0D2 benefits intracellular survival of Leishmania donovani in
erythrocytes-engulfing macrophages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe type of leishmaniasis
which is caused by infection of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>
complex. In the BALB/c mouse model of VL, multinucleated giant cells
(MGCs) with heavy parasite infection consist of the largest population
of hemophagocytes in the spleen of <italic>L. donovani</italic>-infected
mice, indicating that MGCs provide the parasites a circumstance
beneficial for their survival. Although ATP6V0D2 is a demonstrated
factor inducing the formation of hemophagocytic MGCs during <italic>L.
donovani</italic> infection, functions of this protein in shaping the
infection outcome in macrophages remain unclear. Here we evaluated the
influence of upregulated ATP6V0D2 on intracellular survival of the
parasites. <italic>L. donovani</italic> infection-induced
hemophagocytosis of normal erythrocytes by macrophages was suppressed by
RNAi-based knockdown of <italic>Atp6v0d2</italic>. The knockdown of
<italic>Atp6v0d2</italic> did not improve the survival of amastigotes
within macrophages when the cells were cultured in the absence of
erythrocytes. On the other hand, reduced intracellular survival of
amastigotes in macrophages by the knockdown was observed when
macrophages were supplemented with antibody-opsonized erythrocytes
before infection. There, increase in cytosolic labile iron pool was
observed in the <italic>L. donovani</italic>-infected knocked-down
macrophages. It suggests that ATP6V0D2 plays roles not only in
upregulation of hemophagocytosis but also in iron trafficking within
<italic>L. donovani</italic>-infected macrophages. Superior access to
iron in macrophages may be how the upregulated expression of the
molecule brings benefit to <italic>Leishmania</italic> for their
intracellular survival in the presence of erythrocytes.

id="cd81-suppresses-nf-Îºb-signaling-and-is-downregulated-in-hepatitis-c-virus-expressing-cells">CD81
suppresses NF-ÎºB signaling and is downregulated in hepatitis C virus
expressing cells</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
The tetraspanin CD81 is one of the main entry receptors for Hepatitis C
virus, which is a major causative agent to develop liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we identify CD81 as one of few
surface proteins that are downregulated in HCV expressing hepatoma
cells, discovering a functional role of CD81 beyond mediating HCV entry.
CD81 was downregulated at the mRNA level in hepatoma cells that
replicate HCV. Kinetics of HCV expression were increased in
CD81-knockout cells and accompanied by enhanced cellular growth.
Furthermore, loss of CD81 compensated for inhibition of pro-survival
TBK1-signaling in HCV expressing cells. Analysis of functional
phenotypes that could be associated with pro-survival signaling revealed
that CD81 is a negative regulator of NF-ÎºB. Interaction of the NF-ÎºB
subunits p50 and p65 was increased in cells lacking CD81. Similarly, we
witnessed an overall increase in the total levels of phosphorylated and
cellular p65 upon CD81-knockout in hepatoma cells. Finally,
translocation of p65 in CD81-negative hepatoma cells was markedly
induced upon stimulation with TNFÎ± or PMA. Altogether, CD81 emerges as a
regulator of pro-survival NF-ÎºB signaling. Considering the important and
established role of NF-ÎºB for HCV replication and tumorigenesis, the
downregulation of CD81 by HCV and the associated increase in NF-ÎºB
signaling might be relevant for viral persistence and chronic infection.

the acute phase: a comprehensive literature review of long-term sequelae
resulting from infectious diseases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Infectious diseases have consistently served as pivotal influences on
numerous civilizations, inducing morbidity, mortality, and consequently
redirecting the course of history. Their impact extends far beyond the
acute phase, characterized by the majority of symptom presentations, to
a multitude of adverse events and sequelae that follow viral, parasitic,
fungal, or bacterial infections. In this context, myriad sequelae
related to various infectious diseases have been identified, spanning
short to long-term durations. Although these sequelae are known to
affect thousands of individuals individually, a comprehensive evaluation
of all potential long-term effects of infectious diseases has yet to be
undertaken. We present a comprehensive literature review delineating the
primary sequelae attributable to major infectious diseases, categorized
by systems, symptoms, and duration. This compilation serves as a crucial
resource, illuminating the long-term ramifications of infectious
diseases for healthcare professionals worldwide. Moreover, this review
highlights the substantial burden that these sequelae impose on global
health and economies, a facet often overshadowed by the predominant
focus on the acute phase. Patients are frequently discharged following
the resolution of the acute phase, with minimal long-term follow-up to
comprehend and address potential sequelae. This emphasizes the pressing
need for sustained vigilance, thorough patient monitoring, strategic
health management, and rigorous research to understand and mitigate the
lasting economic and health impacts of infectious diseases more fully.

id="gram-negative-bacterial-srnas-encapsulated-in-omvs-an-emerging-class-of-therapeutic-targets-in-diseases">Gram-negative
bacterial sRNAs encapsulated in OMVs: an emerging class of therapeutic
targets in diseases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) encapsulated in outer membrane vesicles
(OMVs) are critical post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression
in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. OMVs are small spherical
structures released by Gram-negative bacteria that serve as important
vehicles for intercellular communication and can also play an important
role in bacterial virulence and host-pathogen interactions. These
molecules can interact with mRNAs or proteins and affect various
cellular functions and physiological processes in the producing
bacteria. This review aims to provide insight into the current
understanding of sRNA localization to OMVs in Gram-negative bacteria and
highlights the identification, characterization and functional
implications of these encapsulated sRNAs. By examining the research gaps
in this field, we aim to inspire further exploration and progress in
investigating the potential therapeutic applications of OMV-encapsulated
sRNAs in various diseases.

survey of risk factors for recurrence of ocular inflammation in patients
with uveitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, the proportion of patients with
uveitis who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 increased greatly. The impact
of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with uveitis has not been fully
described.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A questionnaire on SARS-CoV-2 infection was sent to patients with
uveitis to assess ocular and systemic conditions before and after
infection. Chi-square analysis and multifactorial regression analysis
were used to investigate the associations between each risk factor and
the recurrence of uveitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
One hundred thirty-nine patients with noninfectious uveitis completed
the questionnaire; 114 (82.0%) had COVID-19, and 27 (23.7%) had
recurrent or exacerbated uveitis after COVID-19. There was a higher rate
of recurrence or aggravation of ocular inflammation in patients who
developed severe COVID-19 symptoms (severe group 8/20 vs.Â nonsevere
group 19/94). There were significant differences in the rates of
recurrence and aggravation between the two groups of patients who
differed in terms of ocular inflammatory activity within 3 months prior
to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ï‡2 = 10.701, <italic>P</italic>=0.001), as well
as in the rates of recurrence and aggravation after cessation of
systemic immunomodulatory therapy. After multifactorial regression
analysis, patients with active ocular inflammation within 3 months prior
to SARS-CoV-2 infection had a greater risk of recurrence or exacerbation
of uveitis after COVID-19 (OR=4.298, <italic>P</italic>=0.002).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The degree of ocular inflammatory activity within 3 months prior to
SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a major factor influencing the recurrence or
exacerbation of uveitis after infection. Interruption of medication
should be minimized in patients with unstable inflammatory control.

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
There have only been a few molecular studies conducted on the detection
of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in tissues of carnivores in South Africa,
with no data on the genetic diversity of this parasite. That is why the
aim of this study was to detect and genotype <italic>T. gondii</italic>
DNA in tissues of selected wild and domestic carnivores in South Africa.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Samples were collected from 80 animals of 20 species (mainly
road-killed) in the four provinces of Limpopo (n=57), Mpumalanga (n=21),
Gauteng (n=1) and Free State (n=1) during the period 2014â€“2018. Samples
of brain (n=31), heart (n=4), liver (n=40), spleen (n=2) and lung (n=3)
were used to detect <italic>T.Â gondii</italic> by real-time PCR
targeting a 529 bp repeating fragment of <italic>T. gondii</italic> DNA.
Samples that were positive in real-time PCR were genotyped using 15
microsatellite markers.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
<italic>T. gondii</italic> DNA was detected in 4 (5â€‰%) samples: in the
brain from a Black-backed Jackal (<italic>Canis mesomelas</italic>), in
the liver from a African Wildcat (<italic>Felis silvestris
lybica</italic>) and in the liver and heart of two Rusty-spotted Genets
(<italic>Genetta maculata</italic>) respectively. The DNA sample from
Black-backed Jackal was genotyped and characterized as belonging to the
type Africa 4 lineage (equivalent to RFLP genotype ToxoDB#20), that is a
widespread lineage in Africa.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
This is the first genetic characterization of <italic>T. gondii</italic>
isolated from a wild carnivore on the African continent and the first
report of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in Black-backed Jackal. The Africa
4 lineage was also confirmed in the region of Southern Africa for the
first time.

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Infectious diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, necessitating the rapid identification and accurate diagnosis
of pathogens. While unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing
(mNGS) has been extensively utilized in clinical pathogen identification
and scientific microbiome detection, there is limited research about the
application of nanopore platform-based mNGS in the diagnostic
performance of various infectious fluid samples.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, we collected 297 suspected infectious fluids from 10
clinical centers and detected them with conventional microbiology
culture and nanopore platformâ€“based mNGS. The objective was to assess
detective and diagnostic performance of nanopore-sequencing technology
(NST) in real-world scenarios.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Combined with gold-standard culture and clinical adjudication, nanopore
sequencing demonstrated nearly 100% positive predictive agreements in
microbial-colonized sites, such as the respiratory and urinary tracts.
For samples collected from initially sterile body sites, the detected
microorganisms were highly suspected pathogens, and the negative
predictive agreements were relatively higher than those in the
microbial-colonized sites, particularly with 100% in abscess and 95.7%
in cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, consistent performance was also
observed in the identification of antimicrobial resistance genes and
drug susceptibility testing of pathogenic strains of <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and
<italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Rapid NST is a promising clinical tool to supplement gold-standard
culture, and it has the potential improve patient prognosis and
facilitate clinical treatment of infectious diseases.

inhibition decreases pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages from

infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Chronic pulmonary bacterial infections and associated inflammation
remain a cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis
(PwCF) despite new modulator therapies. Therapies targeting host factors
that dampen detrimental inflammation without suppressing immune
responses critical for controlling infections remain limited, while the
development of lung infections caused by antimicrobial resistant
bacteria is an increasing global problem, and a significant challenge in
CF. Pharmacological compounds targeting the mammalian MAPK proteins MEK1
and MEK2, referred to as MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds, have potential
combined anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. Here we examined
the immunomodulatory properties of MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds PD0325901,
trametinib, and CI-1040 on CF innate immune cells. Human CF macrophage
and neutrophil phagocytic functions were assessed by quantifying
phagocytosis of serum opsonized pHrodo red <italic>E. coli</italic>,
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and zymosan bioparticles. MEK1/2
inhibitor compounds reduced CF macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine
production without impairing CF macrophage or neutrophil phagocytic
abilities. Wild-type C57BL6/J and <italic>Cftr</italic><sup>tm1kth</sup>
(F508del homozygous) mice were used to evaluate the <italic>in
vivo</italic> therapeutic potential of PD0325901 compared to vehicle
treatment in an intranasal methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus
aureus</italic> (MRSA) infection with the community-acquired MRSA strain
USA300. In both wild-type and CF mice, PD0325901 reduced inflammation
associated body mass loss. Wild-type mice treated with PD0325901 had
significant reduction in neutrophil-mediated inflammation compared to
vehicle treatment groups, with preserved clearance of bacteria in lung,
liver, or spleen 1 day after infection in either wild-type or CF mouse
models. In summary, this study provides the first data evaluating the
therapeutic potential of MEK1/2 inhibitor to modulate CF immune cells
and demonstrates that MEK1/2 inhibitors diminish pro-inflammatory
responses without impairing host defense mechanisms required for acute
pathogen clearance.

drugs to biomaterials: a review of emerging therapeutic strategies for
intervertebral disc inflammation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Chronic low back pain (LBP) is an increasingly prevalent issue,
especially among aging populations. A major underlying cause of LBP is
intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), often triggered by
intervertebral disc (IVD) inflammation. Inflammation of the IVD is
divided into Septic and Aseptic inflammation. Conservative therapy and
surgical treatment often fail to address the root cause of IDD. Recent
advances in the treatment of IVD infection and inflammation range from
antibiotics and small-molecule drugs to cellular therapies, biological
agents, and innovative biomaterials. This review sheds light on the
complex mechanisms of IVD inflammation and physiological and biochemical
processes of IDD. Furthermore, it provides an overview of recent
research developments in this area, intending to identify novel
therapeutic targets and guide future clinical strategies for effectively
treating IVD-related conditions.

of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in chronic brucellosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Human brucellosis, a <italic>Brucella</italic> infection caused most
common zoonosis in the world, remains a serious public health burden in
China. <italic>Brucella</italic> chronic infection always causes
immunosuppressive status and results in severe organ or tissue damages.
The aim of this work was to study the role of the myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs) in human chronic brucellosis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Fifty cases of chronic brucellosis and 40 healthy individual controls
were enrolled in this study. We analyzed the frequency and subsets of
MDSCs in PBMC between the chronic brucellosis and healthy control groups
by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we also measured the
inflammatory-related cytokines in serum samples and the MDSCs inhibition
ability to the proliferation of T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
We found that the frequency of MDSCs in peripheral blood and the level
of IL-6 and IL-10 Th2 cytokines and Arginase-1 were significantly
increased in chronic brucellosis patients. In addition, we also found
that the T cell function was suppressed in vitro by co-culturing with
MDSCs from brucellosis patients.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study described an increase of immunosuppressive MDSCs in peripheral
blood of chronic brucellosis patients. These results contribute to the
understanding of <italic>Brucella</italic> persistent infection, which
may provide an insight for effective treatment of chronic brucellosis
patients in clinical practice.

<sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
The current study sought to clarify the role of lysozyme-regulated gut
microbiota and explored the potential therapeutic effects of lysozyme on
ileum injury induced by severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and
bacterial pneumonia <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in
vitro</italic> experiments.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Male 6â€“8-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice were
randomly divided into Normal group (N), Sham group (S), sTBI group (T),
sTBI + or Lysozyme-treated group (L), Normal + Lysozyme group (NL) and
Sham group + Lysozyme group (SL). At the day 7 after establishment of
the model, mice were anesthetized and the samples were collected. The
microbiota in lungs and fresh contents of the ileocecum were analyzed.
Lungs and distal ileum were used to detect the degree of injury. The
number of Paneth cells and the expression level of lysozyme were
assessed. The bacterial translocation was determined. Intestinal
organoids culture and co-coculture system was used to test whether
lysozyme remodels the intestinal barrier through the gut microbiota.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
After oral administration of lysozyme, the intestinal microbiota is
rebalanced, the composition of lung microbiota is restored, and
translocation of intestinal bacteria is mitigated. Lysozyme
administration reinstates lysozyme expression in Paneth cells, thereby
reducing intestinal permeability, pathological score, apoptosis rate,
and inflammation levels. The gut microbiota, including
<italic>Oscillospira</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>,
<italic>Alistipes</italic>, <italic>Butyricicoccus</italic>, and
<italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, play a crucial role in regulating and
improving intestinal barrier damage and modulating Paneth cells in
lysozyme-treated mice. A co-culture system comprising intestinal
organoids and brain-derived proteins (BP), which demonstrated that the
BP effectively downregulated the expression of lysozyme in intestinal
organoids. However, supplementation of lysozyme to this co-culture
system failed to restore its expression in intestinal organoids.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The present study unveiled a virtuous cycle whereby oral administration
of lysozyme restores Paneth cellâ€™s function, mitigates intestinal injury
and bacterial translocation through the remodeling of gut microbiota.

<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Infections by the pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>
currently represent one of the most serious threats to human health
worldwide, especially due to the production of enterotoxins and the
ability to form biofilms. These structures and the acquisition of
antibiotic resistance limit the action of antibiotics and disinfectants
used to combat this microorganism in the industry and the clinic.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This work reports a comparative phenotypic and genotypic study of 18
<italic>S. aureus</italic> strains from different origins: clinical
samples, milk from mastitic cows and food industry surfaces, most of
which were isolated in Northern Spain.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Genetically, the strains were very diverse but, in most cases, a closer
proximity was observed for those from the same source. Notably, the
average number of virulence genes was not significantly different in
strains from the food sector. Of the 18 strains, 10 coded for at least
one enterotoxin, and four of them carried 6 or 7 enterotoxin genes. The
latter were all veterinary or clinical isolates. Most strains carried
prophages, plasmids and/or pathogenicity islands. Regarding antibiotic
resistance, although phenotypically all strains showed resistance to at
least one antibiotic, resistance genes were only identified in 44.5% of
strains, being mastitis isolates those with the lowest prevalence.
Virulence-related phenotypic properties such as haemolytic activity,
staphyloxanthin production, biofilm-forming capacity and spreading
ability were widely distributed amongst the isolates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Our results indicate that production of virulence factors, antibiotic
resistance and biofilm formation can be found in <italic>S.
aureus</italic> isolates from diverse environments, including the food
industry, although some of these traits are more prevalent in strains
isolated from infections in cows or humans. This emphasizes on the
importance of monitoring the spread of these determinants not only in
samples from the clinical environment, but also along the food chain, a
strategy that falls under the prism of a one-health approach.
