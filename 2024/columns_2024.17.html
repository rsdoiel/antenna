<p>I don‚Äôt have time to write about it but the end of last night‚Äôs
Knicks game was one of the most dramatic bits of NY sports ever. I would
like to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/">thank
Kevin Durant</a> for saying the Knicks weren‚Äôt cool. It‚Äôs somewhat like
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand
Effect</a> where the thing KD was trying to hide was that <i>he</i> was
no longer cool. Classic case of projection. I‚Äôd love to hear what he
says now. Obviously he was not the hot shit he thought he was in 2019.

have big ideas for the blogging world. I‚Äôd like to combine AI and search
to make a really great search engine for bloggers. We would contribute
what we know (we already do) and in return, along with everyone else,
get to benefit from the collection. And when we browse, it knows which
blog we write. So it has a very good idea of what we mean when we ask a
question and what we already know. This is totally missing in ChatGPT
and is something Google and other search engines have never been willing
to do (or even understood, I guess). But this is a huge idea. I‚Äôd like

You may have seen a Bitcoin Teller Machine (BTM) and wondered who would
use one and and why. I have, there is one in our local Safeway. Elijah
Nicholson-Messmer and Ella Ceron look into BTMs in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22"><i>Bitcoin
ATMs Flood Black, Latino Areas, Charging Fees up to 22%</i></a>. The
headline sums up the story well, but there is a rather interesting sting
in the tail of their article.<br /> <br /> Follow me below the fold as I
discuss the article and finally get to why the sting in the tail is
interesting..<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The article
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">starts</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The BTM industry surged during the pandemic: The number of installed
units increased more than five-fold over four years to about 31,100
units nationwide,
<a href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/226/bitcoin-atm-united-states/">according
to</a> Coin ATM Radar. But a closer look into the BTM boom revealed that
the machines are often disproportionately located in areas with a
majority of Black and Latino residents, charging fees as high as 22% per
transaction.

Bitcoin Depot, ‚Äúthe largest US operator with about 7,300 BTMs as of
April 8‚Äù, naturally denies the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">implication</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A Bloomberg review of Bitcoin Depot locations and data from the Census
Bureau shows that states with proportionally large Black and Latino
populations tend to have more of the company‚Äôs BTMs, especially in
southern states like Georgia and Texas. Bitcoin Depot President and
Chief Executive Officer Brandon Mintz dismissed any suggestion that the
company targeted areas with underrepresented groups in deciding where to
place its machines.<br /> <br /> ‚ÄúNever in our history have we once
targeted an area based on any sort of racial profile,‚Äù Mintz told
Bloomberg News. ‚ÄúOur focus is targeting areas that have low competition
and that have populations that can support a Bitcoin ATM profitably.‚Äù
</blockquote>
But clearly there is something different about
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">the
populations of these areas</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In Alabama, the concentration of Black and Latino residents within a
mile radius of Bitcoin Depot BTMs is 20 percentage points higher than
the broader state average, per a Bloomberg analysis of location data and
the 2022 American Consumer Survey. In Dallas, BTMs are consistently
located in areas where the highest percentages of Black and Latino
people live.
</blockquote>
Among the mantras the crypto-bros never tire of repeating is that they
are ‚Äúbanking the unbanked‚Äù and promoting
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">‚Äúfinancial
inclusion‚Äù</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Proponents of cryptocurrency often tout the asset as a way to reach
unbanked people, who lack a more traditional bank account. In the US,
that comprised 6% of adults in 2022, per the Federal Reserve. Black and
Hispanic people were more likely to be more unbanked than their White
counterparts.
</blockquote>
The BTM operators are
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">no
exception</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin Depot, the largest US operator with about 7,300 BTMs as of April
8, charges some of the highest fees in the industry while touting
<a href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/226/bitcoin-atm-united-states/">financial
inclusion</a>, a concept that ensures that all customers, regardless of
their socioeconomic standing, have access to such financial services as
savings, credit and insurance. Over 80% of Bitcoin Depot‚Äôs customers
earn less than $80,000 a year, according to
<a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_f35c9984c4e67907bcfb05c59f7a314b/bitcoindepot/db/3583/33137/pdf/Bitcoin+Depot+Investor+Presentation_Q3-2023_120623+.pdf">a
November 2023 investor presentation</a> from the company.
</blockquote>
I am a bit baffled as to how HODL-ing Bitcoin would provide ‚Äúaccess to
such financial services as savings, credit and insurance‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think
Equifax and Trans-Union pay attention to your pseudonymous HODL-ings.
And there is the matter of the fees the BTM operators charge for
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">providing
this access</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Mintz, the Bitcoin Depot CEO, said the percentage of a transaction the
Atlanta-based company retains as its fees is typically in the ‚Äúlow
twenties,‚Äù but would not provide a bottom or top boundary. ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs
definitive, it just depends on the market and what we need to do to
cover our expenses,‚Äù Mintz said. The company also charges a flat $3 fee
on every transaction<br /> ‚Ä¶<br /> CoinFlip and Bitstop, Bitcoin Depot‚Äôs
main rivals, charge transaction fees as high as 22%, depending on the
location, according to company representatives and customer service
agents. CoinFlip also charges a ‚Äúnetwork fee‚Äù of $2.49 on every
transaction.
</blockquote>
How do the BTMs end up in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">locations
near people lacking ‚Äúfinancial inclusion‚Äù</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
One restaurant owner in Essex, Maryland, who declined to give his name,
said Bitcoin Depot paid $145 a month for the kiosk that was installed a
month ago. Another store owner in New Jersey, who identified himself
only as Jai, said his store received $200 a month for the kiosk, also
operated by Bitcoin Depot.
</blockquote>
$145/month at 22% would be the fees on $660/month in transactions, and
$200/month would be the fees on $909/month, which puts a floor on the
business these BTMs do. It is likely much higher.<br /> <br /> With all
that as background, now for the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">sting
in the tail</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The majority of BTMs ‚Äî 92% of machines in the US, as indexed by Coin ATM
Radar ‚Äî don‚Äôt allow users to sell their crypto in exchange for cash.
</blockquote>
These machines are the Roach Motels of banking, your cash can check in
but it can‚Äôt check out. The question in my mind is:<br />
<blockquote>
What kind of customer needs to pay 22% plus $3 for ‚Äúaccess to ‚Ä¶
financial services‚Äù which <i>won‚Äôt let you cash out</i>?
</blockquote>
Clearly, someone who cannot use conventional banks which, even if they
do charge fees, will let you take money out. Two kinds of customers come
immediately to mind:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<b>Criminals</b>, who are willing to pay high fees to launder their
ill-gotten cash into Bitcoin, which they will then convert into Tether
at some exchange.
</li>
<li>
<b>Victims</b> of crimes such as
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/more-on-pig-butchering.html">pig-butchering</a>,
where the perpetrators require payment in Bitcoin.

Former senior White House cyber policy director A. J. Grotto
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2024/04/21/microsoft_national_security_risk/">talks
about the economic incentives</a> for companies to improve their

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Grotto told us Microsoft had to be ‚Äúdragged kicking and screaming‚Äù to
provide logging capabilities to the government by default, and given the
fact the mega-corp banked around $20 billion in revenue from security
services last year, the concession was minimal at best.

‚ÄúThe government needs to focus on encouraging and catalyzing

of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a
library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully
grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>,
the Gemini server I‚Äôm using, based on renderer code I found in the
<a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a>
that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Odd¬µ, I
figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable
Gopher pages.
</p>
<p>
It took some wrangling and it‚Äôs probably not great, but the main menu
matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site
is back as a gopher hole on port 70!
</p>
<p>
See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown
Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.

<p>
See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched
Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code,
<a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.

<p>
And naturally I‚Äôm immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in
this client I‚Äôm using.

Interesting social-engineering
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-comments-abused-to-push-malware-via-microsoft-repo-urls/">attack
vector</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
McAfee released a report on a
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-cheat-lures-gamers-into-spreading-infostealer-malware/">new
LUA malware loader</a> distributed through what appeared to be a
legitimate Microsoft GitHub repository for the ‚ÄúC++ Library Manager for
Windows, Linux, and MacOS,‚Äù known as
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg">vcpkg</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The attacker is exploiting a property of GitHub: comments to a
particular repo can contain files, and those files will be associated
with the project in the URL.
</p>
<p>
What this means is that someone can upload malware and ‚Äúattach‚Äù it to a
legitimate and trusted project.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As the file‚Äôs URL contains the name of the repository the comment was
created in, and as almost every software company uses GitHub, this flaw
can allow threat actors to develop extraordinarily crafty and
trustworthy lures‚Ä¶

Maldives 2024
</h1>
<p>
The biosphere as we know it is ending and I‚Äôm spending two weeks in the
Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.
</p>
<p>
The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane,
Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like
sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the
<a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible,
too.
</p>
<p>
With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We
went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in
2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to
the Maldives.

<strong>2024-04-06</strong>. The last leg of the journey ‚Äì our
water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the
reef begins a few meters in.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an
underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or
the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to
hide in the sand.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Black tipped reef sharks‚Ä¶ harmless! At a later point we did see it
attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Most corals look dreary! It‚Äôs certainly not as colourful and busy as in
Australia or the Galapagos. This purple giant is cool, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There are still plenty of colourful fish.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Whenever we‚Äôre away on a trip, we play games. The most popular tropical
island game is Race for the Galaxy.

<p>
We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey
moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they‚Äôre slow and easily
scared and therefore obviously harmless.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when
you‚Äôre snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful
fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep
blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.

<p>
There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either
uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can
stay on the ‚Äúlocal islands‚Äù since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work
on the tourist islands.
</p>
<p>
The capital city is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one
of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Mal√© on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage
problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism ‚Äì but I know
what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a>
book. Check out these stats from the
<a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia
page on the Maldives</a>: In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had
about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much
better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman
has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years
in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement
from the point of view of the locals.
</p>
<p>
From my green perspective, though‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs not forget the garbage island
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The
picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don‚Äôt know
what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage
incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had
to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in
the the fish. People eat the fish. It‚Äôs easy to feel grim about this. I
need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a
generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much,
much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.
</p>
<p>
If you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôm basically skimming, reading and finally
summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that
this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look
away.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-12</strong>. Bad luck for Claudia. Yesterday, late at
night, she stuck her small toe in a gap between two planks, took another
step, nearly fell and twisted her foot. There‚Äôs a huge dark bruise on
its back and a significant dark bruise below. No more fins, for a while.
üò≠
</p>
<p>
We had signed up for a snorkel safari when suddenly the buzz was that
the young humpback whale they had seen two days ago was still around and
so the ship picked up some extra passengers and Claudia came along to do
some whale watching.
</p>
<p>
The whale watching did not disappoint.

<p>
This adolescent
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale">humpback
whale</a> was about 8m long. It‚Äôs unusual to find a whales here, now, so
close to the reef, so young, without its family. There was speculation
that it might be waiting for its family to pick it up again, or that
perhaps it was sick.

she is supposed to rest her foot.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-16.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-21</strong>. After snorkling with the whale, not much
seemed to be worth posting about.
</p>
<p>
Before going on this trip, I bought an older GoPro HERO 10. Now I have a
few gigabytes of reef snorkeling footage. I don‚Äôt know what to do with
it. Post it? Unlikely! It takes too much space and nobody would look at
it. Donate it to YouTube? Unlikely! Upload it to some Peertube instance
and thereby offload the cost? Unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the economy of the Maldives and the shock when I learned about
the garbage island and my dismay when I saw the skyline of Mal√© island ‚Äì
when we flew back, I got a closer look at Mal√© from the air as we landed
and while it wasn‚Äôt an island nature paradise, it was just a city with
nice, tall buildings and roads and palm trees and construction sites and
glass fronts and cars and motorcycles. In other words, it seemed like a
perfectly normal city and it wasn‚Äôt shabby and it didn‚Äôt have slums and
so I keep coming back to the main issue: Beating poverty is of ultimate
importance in order to improve people‚Äôs lives and giving them options so
that they can work on the problems they care about. When we flew over
Thilafushi, the garbage island didn‚Äôt look ‚Äúapocalyptic‚Äù but just like
some industrial zone elsewhere in the world, except it‚Äôs an island in
the middle of the ocean.
