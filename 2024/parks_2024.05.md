## BLM seeks assistance in case involving 19 dead wild burros

date: 2024-01-30, from: Bureau of Land Management, California

<div class="field contact-block -teaser-image">  <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/styles/teaser/public/images/2024-01/Picture1.jpg?h=20e14557&itok=FMycjBU7" width="150" height="100" alt="A montage of security camera footage depicting a white tacoma" typeof="foaf:Image">

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>NEEDLES, Calif. – The Bureau of Land Management is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to justice for the ongoing investigation of the shooting and killing of 19 wild burros. The animals were found along Interstate 15 between Baker, California and Primm, Nevada on August 13, 2019.</p>

<p>BLM law enforcement identified two vehicles of interest and want to speak with the owners of a gray or silver 2008 Toyota extended cab pickup with flared fenders and a brush guard, and a white 2008 Toyota extended cab pickup with a white camper shell, white rims, sunroof, and brush guard. Video surveillance captured both vehicles traveling together and last seen in Primm, Nevada, on August 13, 2019, at approximately 06:32 a.m., in the parking lot of Whiskey Pete’s Hotel and Casino. Actual images of both vehicles and the crime scene are below.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>BLM special agents identified the weapon used to kill the wild burros as a .30-06 caliber rifle, possibly vintage based on the rifling of the projectiles recovered, that could have been manufactured by Browning, Remington, Springfield, U.S. Military Arms, or Winchester. The rifle is chambered for .30-06 Springfield ammunition.  Special agents also believe the person or persons responsible used reloaded ammunition marked with red/orange paint on the bottom of their cartridges.</p>

<p>Anyone with any knowledge of this crime is strongly encouraged to contact the 24-hour <a href="https://www.wetip.com/">WeTip</a> crime reporting system at 909-987-5005. BLM special agents encourage callers to leave contact information for follow up. Information leading to the successful prosecution of the person or persons responsible for this crime will receive the reward.</p>

<p>The animals are federally protected under the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/wild-horse-and-burro/about-the-program/program-history">Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971</a>.

<p><b>ARCATA, Calif.</b> – The Bureau of Land Management is contributing to an immersive experience and time-honored Tribal tradition along California’s North Coast.</p>

<p>The BLM and two timber companies partnered to provide the Bear River Band of Rohnerville Rancheria a downed redwood tree from public lands so the Tribe can build a traditional dance house and living quarter. Tribal members at the Tish Non Village Community Center near Loleta will use the buildings to share experiences of their ancestors dating back to time immemorial.</p>

<p>“We are so proud to support Native cultural practitioners who collect forest resources for traditional uses and look forward to seeing this locally-led conservation project develop,” said <strong>BLM Arcata Field Office Assistant Manager Jennifer Wheeler.</strong></p>

<p>“It’s going to be a community thing, revitalizing our culture and revitalizing our community,” said <strong>Edward “Gusto” Bowie, Tribal council member at large for the Bear River Band</strong>. “It is a healing process. Our goal is to have these houses built up and down the coast, just as it used to be.” </p>

<p>BLM archaeologist Sharyl Kinnear Ferris worked with Bowie to select a segment of downed redwood tree from public lands in the Salmon Pass area of the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/california/headwaters-forest-reserve">Headwaters Forest Reserve</a> near Fortuna. Leonardo Logging owner Dave Carter volunteered his time and expertise to load and haul the massive log to Loleta using equipment provided by Humboldt Redwood Company. Members of the Tribe will split and slowly dry the wood before cutting and building with it.</p>

<p>Headwaters Forest Reserve was established in 1999, after the BLM and <a href="https://wcb.ca.gov/">California State Wildlife Conservation Board</a> purchased the 7,400-acre Headwaters Forest for public ownership. The BLM and <a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/">California Department of Fish and Wildlife</a> collaborate to protect old growth redwoods, forest stands, streams, and wildlife in the reserve.</p>
