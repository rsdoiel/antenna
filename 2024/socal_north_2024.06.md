## Grammys shine in rose gold as women take center stage at 66th annual award show

<em>This post was updated Feb. 4 at 10:58 p.m.</em>
Painted in rose gold, the Grammys were a night for the vibrance of women.&#160;
Dangling from a cube and in a sultry mesh ensemble, Dua Lipa ushered in the 66th annual Grammy Awards ceremony with a reflective disco-pop mashup including “Training Season,” “Houdini” and “Dance the Night.” Quipping that the economy surrounding Taylor Swift’s tables has blossomed, Trevor Noah warmed up the crowd with feel-good comedy, while also highlighting notable achievements in terms of diversity, including the majority of female nominees for the Album Of The Year category.&#160;
Trilling that all nominees for the category are women, Mariah Carey presented Miley Cyrus with the Best Pop Solo Performance award for “Flowers.” After Luke Combs’ duet of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car,” Karol G won her first Grammy Award, Best Música Urbana Album, for “Mañana Será Bonito.” Also winning her first Grammy, Lainey Wilson won Best Country Album for “Bell Bottom Country.” SZA then set the stage aflame for the second performance of the night with “Snooze” and a gritty rendition of “Kill Bill,” accentuated with sword-fighting.&#160;&#160;
Afterward, Billie Eilish serenaded the Crypto.com Arena with an airy, orchestral rendition of “What Was I Made For?” Performing “Flowers” live on television for the first time, Miley Cyrus relished the milestone with a fierce stage presence and her infamous adlibs.
