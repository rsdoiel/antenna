writing something that is usually meant to be private knowing that will
be published somewhere is a weird feeling.

<p>
I like that it offers readers a glimpse into what corresponding with
people online looks like. As I wrote many times before, if you want to
engage with me, please do write me an email. I read every single one of
them and I also try my best to reply to everyone. Sometimes life takes
over and I forget but I really do try my best to reply because I believe
it’s important to connect with others.
</p>
<p>
I also believe in kindness, in curiosity, in being open to learn about
others and their lives. I love to know what you do, and what you’re
passionate about so, again, if you want to make a new connection, please
do get in touch.

<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Smartwatches at the turn of the century were a more motley assortment
than today’s, with an even wilder range of functionality. If you had a
few hundred dollars or so, there were some interesting options, even
back then. But if all you had was $85 (in 2024 dollars about $150), you
still weren’t left out, because in 2001 you could get the Web-<span
class="citation" data-cites="nywhere">@nywhere</span> (the “Worldwide
Web Watch”). Load up the software on your PC and slap it in its little
docking station, and you could slurp down about 93K of precious Web data
to scroll on the 59×16 screen — 10 characters by 2 characters — to read
any time you wanted! That is, of course, if the remote host the watch’s
Windows 9x-based client accessed were still up, on which it depended for
virtually anything to download and install. Well, I want 95,488 bytes of

tilt: documenting the uneven playing field for an independent browser
like Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>This tilt manifests in a variety of ways. For example: making it
harder for a user to download and use a different browser, ignoring or
resetting a user’s default browser preference, restricting capabilities
to the first-party browser, or requiring the use of the first-party
browser engine for third-party browsers. For years, Mozilla has engaged
in dialog with platform vendors in an effort to address these issues.
With renewed public attention and an evolving regulatory environment, we
think it’s time to publish these concerns using the same transparent
process and tools we use to develop positions on emerging technical
standards. So today we’re publishing a new issue tracker where we intend
to document the ways in which platforms put Firefox at a disadvantage
and engage with the vendors of those platforms to resolve them. ↫ The
official Mozilla blog Excellent initative.</p>

room?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons
I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was
finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for
winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room.
However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too
smart for me. It is obviously a touchscreen of some sort, but there was
zero indication as to what it controls. The landlord had no idea what
this is. There are no buttons or labels on the thing, just a tiny yellow
light to let you know it has the power. ↫ Nikita Lapkov What follows is
an investigation into what it is, how to get it working, and, of course,
how to hack it and make it more useful.</p>

<h2 id="the-case-for-rust-in-the-freebsd-base-system">The case for Rust
(in the FreeBSD base system)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD is discussing adding Rust to the FreeBSD base system. In a
recent thread on src-committers, we discussed the costs and benefits of
including Rust code in the FreeBSD base system. To summarize, the cost
is that it would double our build times. imp suggested adding an
additional step after buildworld for stuff that requires an external
toolchain. That would ease the build time pain. The benefit is that some
tools would become easier to write, or even become possible. ↫ Warner
Losh on the freebsd-hackers mailing list From everything I’ve read and
what you, the readers, have told me, someone who isn’t a programmer,
languages like Rust really are a big improvement over older languages,
and it’s probably not a good idea for a major, important project like
FreeBSD to isolate its base system from such progress. Now, I’m not at
all qualified to say whether Rust, specifically, is the right choice,
but a language like Rust should probably be part of the base system. A
big issue is FreeBSD’s architecture support. Rust is not well-supported
or even supported at all on all the various platforms FreeBSD supports,
which might prove to be a road block for now. That being said, letting
barely used ISAs hamper your progress too much might not be a good idea
either. Rust has already become a supported language for the development
of the Linux kernel.</p>

2024, Genode to focus on multi-monitor, suspend/resume, touchpads, and
much more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Without hesitation, our developer community quickly rallied behind
the topic “Sculpt OS usability”, desiring to boost the user experience
with respect to multi-monitor usage, convenient interactive UIs for
common tasks, profound support for touchpads and touchscreens,
tearing-free graphics, low-latency audio, casual on-target debugging,
and suspend/resume. The focus on usability notwithstanding, we will
steadily continue with the gardening of Genode’s driver landscape,
fostering the consistent use of drivers ported from up-to-date Linux
kernels, clear-cut ACPI support, and making drivers pluggable. In 2024,
we will also promote Genode’s custom (base-hw) microkernel to become the
default kernel for Sculpt OS, which is the culmination of a multi-year
effort. ↫ Official Genode news post The updated roadmap for 2024 details
the goals of the project for the coming current year.</p>

In this adventure Bull Mancuso is a woman, and is an astronaut on the
space station, performing experiments on her fellow astronauts. The goal
of the experiment is to determine if astronauts can play a new form of
basketball that was invented by SpaceXYZ founder Mucky Lonnegan, who is
in space with Astronaut Mancuso.

The vision hardware looks lovely, but I am more impressed by the depth
of the user experience, the guidance to developers, the design system,
the operating system and the tooling to support it.
</p>
<p>
Previous headsets have been cool and exciting (I own pretty much one of
each), yet none got this level of necessary scaffolding in place, so the
experiences are a mish-mash of half baked ideas.

We finally go from “this is a neat idea” to a viable platform.

realize that most of the people who read this blog aren’t sports fans,
something that I wish were different, because sports, like HBO series,
give us a way to talk about complex human relationships in the 21st
century that we don’t get any other way to imho. If we all watch
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession">Succession</a>,
for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy">Shiv</a>
and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans">Tom</a>).
(No spoilers as to why he’s significant, and won the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards">Emmy</a>
for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where
they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to
say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to
say to your friends – there! – <i>that’s</i> what I was talking about.
Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few
players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal
ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors,
which was one of those games you don’t ever forget, because of a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">recent trade</a>
where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the
teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way
what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded
away. One day they’re our team, and the next day, supposedly they’re the
other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn’t just leave,
maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a
former
<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career">Great
Hope</a> of ours, didn’t pan out, and now it’s nice to see him on the
court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could’ve
gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was
the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one,
the
<a href="https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/">hotshit
kid</a> with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point
guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the
Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night’s
<a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/">game</a>
was something else. I understand that
<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel">Niners
and Packers</a> fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can
relate.</p>

<h1>
How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader
</h1>
<p>
The PDF for Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rules has 714 pages. How do you
even get started?
</p>
<p>
There are four
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/asl-starter-kit-c-2_8">starter kits</a>
(SK):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Regular infantry
</li>
<li>
Guns
</li>
<li>
Tanks
</li>
<li>
Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I didn’t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this
is not how it works. Start small.
</p>
<p>
You can get the
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules
for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.
</p>
<p>
Buy
<a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the
complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.
</p>
<p>
For online gaming, you need to download the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine
for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card
games. Vassal is free, open-source software.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to
run ASL on VASSAL.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The VASL site has a section called “Download Scenarios” where you can
download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you
load those games, you’ll see messages about all the extensions you’re
missing. Often you don’t need them, but feel free to install them.
</p>
<p>
If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be
aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff
that gets used in later boxes.

<h1>
Download the whole podcast.
</h1>
<p>
Feeling evil… Assume that there’s a podcast with a feed and you want to
download all the episodes. Like a music show, for example.
</p>
<p>
First, get the feed, saving it as <code>rss.xml</code> because we’re
going to need it in the next statement.
</p>
<pre><code>curl -o rss.xml https://musicforprogramming.net/rss.xml
</code></pre>
<p>
Then, get every enclosure:
</p>
<pre><code>for f in $(perl -ne '/&lt;enclosure url=&quot;(.*?)&quot;/ &amp;&amp; print &quot;$1\n&quot;' rss.xml); do
  curl --continue-at - --remote-name &quot;$f&quot;
done
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>–continue-at -</code> option should make it possible to resume
downloads at a later stage. <code>curl</code> will skip all the bytes
already downloaded, effectively skipping the download. That’s what I’m
hoping for, in any case.
</p>
<p>
The <code>–remote-name</code> option saves the episode under its remote
name. This is what most people would expect, I think.
</p>
<p>
You know how it goes, though: never parse HTML (or XML) using regular
expressions. I’m doing it here and it is definitely a bad idea!
</p>
<p>
I’m also too lazy to install a real XML parser and doing the real thing,
so it is what it is.

Let’s do another Bull Mancuso comic strip! In this version Ms Mancuso is
a professor at Harvard Law School, teaching a class on contract law.
She’s a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high
court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck’s, which she gets from a

Her students all have tremendous respect for her. Just a few panels of
her giving an informative caffeine-enhanced lecture.

I was given two comic strips to choose from, and I went with the first,
because it’s closest to what I was thinking of! It looks like a Harvard
