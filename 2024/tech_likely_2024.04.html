I love all those “… was a Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon” jokes.

But the reason is that high-interest rates move money from being used to
stagnant.

The phenomenon was “we were being productive and delivering value to the
world.”

</p>
<p>
Ran’s an interesting character to say the least and his site reflects
that. I especially love the very old school vibe.

</p>
<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My name is Ran Prieur. I’ve lived most of my life in Washington state. I
did well in school, and I was expected to be a computer engineer. But
looking back, the kids who went on to do that, were actually excited
about computers. For me, it was just one more tedious academic subject.
In college, after cruising through the “weed-out” courses, I couldn’t
bring myself to take an actual engineering course, and switched to the
humanities, which were somewhat interesting. I ended up getting two BAs,
in English and Philosophy.
</p>
<p>
I was born to be retired. Most people are always trying to fill time,
and I’m always trying to empty it. I had enough self-discipline to grind
through the academic system, but any full time job exhausts me, and I
spent the 90s working part time office jobs and living super-frugally. I
would have probably become high-end homeless, but I did some
housesitting for my family, and had some luck with money, and now I’m
retired on less than they say you need to retire.
</p>
<p>
For some reason, it’s easy for me to keep blogging, and I’ve been doing
it for almost 20 years. More recently I’ve been writing fiction, which
is harder than blogging but more rewarding. I practice improvisational
piano, where my style is to see how much I can squeeze out of one chord.
And when I have a lot of time, I play solo games of my favorite board
game, Spirit Island, and I’ve designed some custom spirits that I
haven’t released yet.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
In the 90s I made zines: hand-written, photocopied, and mailed. When the
internet came along, it was a much more efficient way to get words to an
audience. Two other zine people started a website called Unknown News,
and I started writing a column there every few weeks. After maybe a
year, around 2003, I bought my own domain name and posted my stuff
there.
</p>
<p>
I named the blog after myself, because whatever I end up writing about,
the name is still accurate. I started out writing essays about
contemporary politics and the critique of civilization, and now I write
short posts about different things, lately psychology, metaphysics,
societal collapse, and little personal tidbits. The main reason I
shifted to a shorter form, is that I learned to say things in fewer
words, in five paragraphs instead of five pages.
</p>
<p>
The most famous thing I’ve written, by far, is a 2004 essay called How
To Drop Out. I haven’t read it in more than ten years, because I’m sure
I’ll find all kinds of cringey stuff. But it continues to bring people
to my website.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Elvis Costello said, people think being a songwriter is cool, but really
it means walking around all day humming to yourself like a loony. That’s
basically my process. I have an idea, and I run the words through my
head, often muttering them in a whisper, until I’m ready to write them
down. That could take anywhere from ten minutes to a week. Sometimes I
do it in the middle of the night when I can’t sleep, and by morning I
have a whole post laid out in my head. But when I go to type it in,
there are always complications and changes.
</p>
<p>
For minor posts, I do the writing straight to the file manager. For
major posts, I type them into Notepad++, and I usually keep massaging
the words for a few days before posting them. I have a large text file
full of posts that are half finished or not good enough. Nobody reads my
stuff before I post it, but I often get reader feedback that sends me
off on tangents to new posts.
</p>
<p>
Asking a writer where ideas come from, is like asking a sailor where the
wind comes from. If your sails are working, the wind is just there. So
in terms of the work I put into writing, getting ideas is zero percent.
Ten percent is figuring out how to word it. And ninety percent is
figuring out how to <em>order</em> it. Even non-fiction has to be
written like a story, where one idea flows into the next.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I haven’t noticed any differences between physical spaces. It’s all
about mental space, and all I need is a block of time with no other
demands on my attention, which is hard to get in this world. I often
fantasize about being in solitary confinement, except with good food. I
would have loved to be a medieval monk, doing a couple hours a day of
simple useful tasks, and then going to my tiny room to contemplate the
divine.
</p>
<p>
When I’m writing fiction or playing music, cannabis does wonders for my
creativity. But when I write blog posts high, they turn out to be
second-rate. I suppose weed improves my intuition but not my rational
thinking.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My original web host was DR2, a tiny company that later got bought by
Mesopia, which got bought by Netbunch, which suspiciously lost my site
and all backups around 2006. I recovered it from my own old backups and
the web archive, and switched to a Hong Kong company called ICDsoft,
where I’ve been ever since for both domain registration and hosting.
</p>
<p>
From the beginning, I’ve used simple hand-coded html and css. It took me
a few weeks to build the site, and now it’s just a matter of copying and
pasting text and a few tags. I like to have my hands right on the actual
stuff, and I’m trying to hold onto the golden age of web 1.0, when a
non-programmer could get under the hood, and when sites had to be
compact for fast loading. I try to keep my home page under 40kB, and I
don’t run any scripts, except one that a reader contributed to do an
automatic archive, because I only archive about half my stuff.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
In terms of technical choices, I wouldn’t do anything differently. What
I regret about my early writing, is that it was too exciting and
inspirational, and also too negative. I was trying to slay dragons, and
it felt good and got me readers, but at some point the overall vibe of
reader feedback led me to dial it down, and I remain fame-phobic. Fame
is when people who don’t know you, build an image of you in their head
for their own purposes, and if you behave differently from that image,
they get mad at you.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The site costs me less than $100 a year. In the early years I had a link
where people could donate, but now I don’t take any money.
</p>
<p>
It’s a tragedy of the modern world that we need money to not die on the
streets. I’m lucky that I don’t need to monetize my blog, because it’s
difficult to not start making decisions about what you write, based on
where the money is coming from.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My favorite obscure blog is a newsletter called
<a href="https://thewhippet.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The
Whippet</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another good one is
<a href="https://skunkledger.substack.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Skunk
Ledger</a>
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My latest philosophical interest is acausal metaphysics. I learned about
it from a brilliant 1982 book called Physics as Metaphor, and there’s an
important 2003 paper called Causation as Folk Science. Physics is
causal: For two things to have a legitimate connection, there has to be
some chain of influence through matter directly influencing other matter
– although physics has a hint of acausality with quantum entanglement.
</p>
<p>
An example of acausality at work is astrology. In physics, there’s no
realistic way that remote planets can influence your life. But in
acausal metaphysics, the positions of the planets, and events in your
life, might be two different aspects of something deeper that we don’t
understand yet, so they can line up without any causality. This was what
Jung was trying to get at with synchronicity, and I try to cultivate
synchronicity in everyday life, by noticing and being grateful when
little things line up.

<h2 id="stop-using-opera-browser-and-opera-gx">Stop using Opera Browser
and Opera GX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hindenburg alleged that when the Opera browser continued losing users
(due to competition from Google and Apple), the company shifted gears to
building mobile apps that provided predatory short-term loans. The
interest rates on those loans ranged from 365-876% per year, and loan
terms from 7-29 days. Opera also falsely advertised longer loan terms
and lower interest rates in the app descriptions, because the Google
Play Store had rules against predatory loan services. The loan apps
specifically targeted customers in Kenya, India, and Nigeria. Hindenburg
also confirmed through user reports and a former employee that two of
the apps, OKash and OPesa, asked for permission to the phone contacts
during the setup process. The service would then start sending
threatening messages to the user’s contacts when a borrower was late on
their payments. The issue was also covered by local media prior to
Hindenburg’s report. The money from these loan apps amounted to 42.5% of
Opera’s revenue by mid-2019. Yes, almost half of Opera’s revenue came
from extracting money from people in developing countries with false
advertising and direct harassment. ↫ Corbin Davenport As if this wasn’t
horrible enough, Opera also pushed the usual crypto and NFT scams, and
is now chasing that “AI” high by adding spicy autocomplete to its
Chromium skin. Much like Brave – good people don’t let friends use Brave
– Opera is just a veneer around shady business practices, and you just
shouldn’t use this garbage. Just use Firefox.</p>

<h2 id="the-itanic-saga">The Itanic Saga</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>After three years of delays, Merced shipped as Itanium on the 29th of
May in 2001. The first OEM systems from HP, IBM, and Dell were shipped
in June. Itanium, whose architecture was now referred to as IA-64, was a
6-wide VLIW chip running at either 733 to 800 MHz with a 266 MT/s front
side bus. It had 16K of L1 cache, 96K of L2 cache, 2 or 4 MB of L3
cache, and it was a single core chip on socket PAC418 built on a 180nm
process. That this chip under performed is an understatement. Given the
long development time, multi-billion-dollar development cost,
significant hype, and claims that it would out-compete everything on the
market… Itanium was a massive failure. The 32 bit x86 chips of the time
were able to best it in most workloads. Embarrassingly, the Pentium 4
(whose own performance wasn’t that good) beat Itanium on integer
performance and memory bandwidth. Those areas where the chip was strong
were in transaction processing and scientific applications. John
Crawford, Merced project leader at Intel, reflects: “Everything was
crazy. We were taking risks everywhere. Everything was new. When you do
that, you’re going to stumble.” The five hundred person team working on
the chip was also relatively inexperienced, and disagreements between HP
and Intel led to many compromises in design. ↫ Bradford Morgan White
Itanium is the future. This entire article is anti-Itanium propaganda
and misinformation. Do your own research.</p>

id="windows-nt-synchronization-primitives-driver-for-the-linux-kernel-proposed">Windows
NT synchronization primitives driver for the Linux kernel proposed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One
particular part of that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives,
have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated “kernel”
process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more
strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck. The NT
synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing
primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as
NtPulseEvent() or the “wait-for-all” mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(),
require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing
a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible.
This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces
directly in the Linux kernel. ↫ Elizabeth Figura on the lkml This
proposed driver would yield some serious performance results.</p>

<h2 id="positive-internalization">Positive Internalization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is my entry for
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">January’s
IndieWeb Carnival</a>, hosted by
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">foreverliketh.is</a>
on the topic of positive internalisation, hence the title of this post.
</p>
<p>
When I first read the topic for this month I thought it was going to be
an easy write:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Your entry for this month’s carnival will have you intentionally seek
out positive memories. Memories that remind you of the good parts of
yourself; the facets of your being that you want to see more of, that
you wish to nurture and grow.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was wrong. Extracting memories that remind me about the good parts of
myself is hard. Painfully hard. And that’s because each good memory is
covered by a veil of self-criticism and self-doubt. And the older I grow
the more that vision of myself solidifies: I’m convinced I’m not good
enough, I’m not smart enough, but also don’t have enough willpower to
change any of that. Was I always like this? I honestly can’t tell you.
</p>
<p>
The only genuinely happy memories I have are not tied to me but to
others. Doing something—no matter how big or small—for someone else is
one of the few things in life that can consistently make me happy. This
is especially great when that someone else is a stranger. We live in
such a sad world that people are genuinely surprised when you go out of
your way to help them just because you want to be kind.
</p>
<p>
Actually, now that I think about it, there is something I used to do
that I want back. Years ago, when I was still in high school, I used to
walk around the city, listening to music, and having a great time
smiling at people. It was such a great way to live my life. Rather than
looking down and marching towards my destination I was taking my time,
walking slowly, smiling at random people on the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>
I kinda loved that version of me and I’m sure it’s still there
somewhere. I only need to figure out how to bring it out again.
</p>
<p>
Eden, I’m not sure this nonsense I just wrote fits with the topic you
set up for January’s carnival but since I know you read my blog you know
I’m all over the place with my thinking and so this is what you gonna
get.
</p>
<p>
As for everyone else, the carnival needs hosts for the months of July,
August, September, October, and November. If you have a blog and—like
me—love the IndieWeb you should consider becoming a host for one of
those months. You can do it by calming your spot on the
<a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">wiki page of the
carnival</a>

to allow sideloading, alternative application stores, alternative
browser engines, lower costs, and more on iOS, but only in the EU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>In order to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act, Apple has
announced a set of sweeping changes to iOS and the App Store in the
European Union. First and foremost, starting with iOS 17.4, users in the
European Union will be able to download and install applications from
outside of the App Store. On top of that, alternative application stores
will become possible as well. When a developer submits an application to
Apple, the developer can choose to distribute the application through
the App Store, alternative application stores, or both. Apple will not
charge a commission on installations from outside the App Store, and it
will also allow alternative payment processors, over which Apple will
also not charge any additional fees. Apple will, however, charge
something called a “Core Technology Fee”. Under the new terms, apps
distributed through the App Store which choose to use an alternative
payment system will pay a 17 percent commission (rather than 30 percent)
on digital goods and services. This commission rate falls to 10 percent
for any apps that currently qualify for Apple’s reduced “small business”
rate. The additional 3 percent fee then applies for developers who
choose to use Apple’s payment processing system. The company is also
introducing a new type of fee for particularly popular apps. The new
Core Technology Fee will charge developers €0.50 (around 54 cents) per
annual app install; however, this fee only kicks in after a million
annual installs in the EU. Apple estimates that over 99 percent of
developers will either “reduce or maintain the fees they owe to Apple”
under the new business terms and that “less that 1 percent” of
developers would pay a core technology fee. ↫ Jon Porter at The Verge
Overall, developers in the EU will be paying a lot less to Apple than
developers in the US and elsewhere, while also gaining more options of
distributing their applications outside of the App Store. I’m already
seeing some serious rumblings in Apple developer circles over on
Mastodon, where US-based developers are not happy these serious cost
reductions will only apply to EU developers. The only kink in the cable
is this “Core Technology Fee”, though, as the total bill for that
nebulous cost can balloon quickly. Apple will still check applications
outside of the App Store for safety, security, and privacy, though, with
a system very similar to how macOS handles applications outside of the
Mac App Store right now through a new – to iOS – notarisation system.
This notarisation will not check applications for quality (because as we
all know, the App Store is a beacon of quality) or content (hello
emulators!). Another major change coming to iOS is the availability of
browsers other than Safari. Right now, even if you think you’re using an
alternative, non-Safari browser on iOS, you’re really just using a skin
on top of a hobbled version of Safari. In the EU, starting with iOS
17.4, non-WebKit browser engines like Firefox’ Gecko or Chrome’s Blink
can come to iOS, and live as equal citizens on your iOS device.
Furthermore, NFS on iOS will be opening up in Europe, giving European
users the ability to use services other than Apple Pay and Wallet with
NFC, and even set them as default. Apple is also allowing game streaming
services to come to iOS, and this change happens to be available
worldwide instead of being restricted to just the EU. These are sweeping
changes to how iOS and the App Store works, but much to the chagrin of
US-based users and developers in my Mastodon timeline and elsewhere,
they’re exclusive to the European Union. It’s unclear if Americans can
import EU devices to gain access to these new features, or if they need
EU-based Apple IDs. Let the grey market provide.</p>

young journalists open up about their struggles to break into the news
industry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Every year seems to be the worst year for journalism lately, and 2023
was no exception. Layoffs reached a new record, artificial intelligence
may have begun to displace journalists, and the Israel-Hamas war claimed
the lives of a record number of reporters. All this was compounded by
long hours, chronic underpayment, and a declining number of journalism
jobs. Despite this daunting landscape, young journalists…</p>

<h2 id="signed-commits">Signed commits</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Signed commits
</h1>
<p>
The <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/01/unsigned-commits.html">post
on commit signing</a> by
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph" title="@glyph@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="glyph">@glyph</span></a> reminds me of my
reluctance to electronically sign private emails. To me, signing
documents is a tool society uses against the people doing the signing.
It’s a liability I take upon myself in order to get something: a
wedding, a house – the other party is binding me to something.
Conversely, when I’m not getting something of value I’m not signing
anything. I prefer the liberty to repudiate everything. “I didn’t write
this.” I’m not promising anything.
</p>
<p>
Let’s go back to signed commits, however. When looking at it from the
point of view of a corporation, I feel that cryptographically signed
commits don’t help against bugs, malware, spies, or anything like that.
</p>
<p>
No, signed commits provide a different kind of security, if you can call
it that. The only leverage signed commits provide is that the
corporation can blame the person who signed the commit and inflict
consequences on them because it’s hard to deny that they did sign the
commit. Even if the corporation didn’t want to inflict consequences on
developers, it might have to abide by some certification process or
insurance-related policies that enables other corporations to go after
the developers.
</p>
<p>
It’s a bit like the security provided by cameras. They don’t help the
victim being filmed. They might help punish a perpetuator, maybe.
There’s no guarantee that this increases overall security.
</p>
<p>
In all cases, as a developer, these signed commits are against my
personal interest. Signing commits is a liability. It’s in the interest
of the employer, never in the interest of the employee.
</p>
<p>
As a user interested in code quality, I don’t really care who committed
the code. I’m interested in access control to the repository so that
only the people I trust merge code they deem to be correct. If this kind
of verification isn’t possible, then I’m starting to see a use case for
signed commits.
</p>
<p>
Assume that somebody sends me commits from a remote repository and I
can’t look at them for lack of time or lack of expertise. They claim to
be somebody I trust, like a contributor I know, or a co-worker, and I
need to decide whether to merge the commit. Now a signature for the
commit they’re trying to get me to add (and therefore all its ancestors)
might make sense.

SOAP was a tangle of specs, which must have made sense to someone, not

ActivityPub is today. I have no idea if the BDG helped, but it was the
only way I felt I could be supportive of the protocol, without saying it
was a complete failure. I was unusual in that among the developers of
the protocol, I was the only one who didn’t work at a big company, so if
I wanted to do something badly enough, I could just do it. The basic

is to entering beta! It looks like they just need to add a way to create
an account through the web interface (rather than the server admin
having to create accounts manually), and add support for the ActivityPub
<code>Move</code> activity (so you can migrate your account from, say,
Mastodon). There’s other stuff they want to add after that, but nothing
that would hold back “beta” status.

I can’t really see myself migrating my main Fedi account to GoToSocial
in the near future, but I <em>could</em> see myself trying it out for my
auxlangs or “political toots” accounts. Hopefully some more parties will
get on board with offering managed GoToSocial hosting once it’s in beta,
though, because working out how to deploy it and put it behind a
reverse-proxy and whatnot might be a liiiiiittle beyond me 🙃

<h2 id="users-first-then-do-teams">Users first then do teams</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The heart of <a href="https://luroapp.com/">Luro</a> has always been a
tool to enable deeper collaboration in a broader team context, so we
architected it that way (a few times). It’s important that teams working
on the same app are able to
<a href="https://luroapp.com/posts/wrangling-saas/">look at the product
with the same lens of understanding</a>, not just through their own
silos. So teams were an early alpha feature of Luro.
</p>
<p>
I don’t regret choosing the teams path, but if I were building it all
over again I would heavily reconsider focusing on single users first and
then iterating towards team workspaces as the sales cycle starts
rolling. In ActiveRecord parlance…

</li>
</ul>
<p>
This isn’t super innovative but there’s a multitude of benefits to this
approach:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Always useful</strong>: At each phase you have a product that is
useful to individual users, you’re never waiting on entire teams to
onboard for a feature to be useful.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tighter feedback loop:</strong> It might be weeks or months
before you know a feature is working in a team
context<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>,
whereas single users have an instant “build → release → feedback” loop.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Value prop confidence</strong>: If it’s useful for
<code>one</code>, it’s probably useful to <code>many</code>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier user personas</strong>: If you’re leveraging user
personas as abstractions, single users are easier to project whereas
teams are a compound of different personas.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier metrics:</strong> One user = one workspace has a lot less
dimensionality and calculus on how features are performing.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Faster path to revenue</strong>: If it’s useful, people will pay
for it. Getting a single user to swipe a credit card is easier than
getting a team thru a procurement process.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Straightforward payment integration</strong>: One user = one
subscription is easier than one team = subscription level × number of
seats, etc.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Revenue funds future development</strong>: Those single user
plans fund future development for team workspaces
</li>
<li>
<strong>Faster pricing validation</strong>: If you’re taking money,
you’ll find out what people are willing to pay real quick.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier conversations with VCs:</strong> Traction and revenue
projections are easier if you have paying customers, easy math to
abstract that to teams.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier self-service</strong>: <code>Sign up → Get
Workspace</code> is less steps than <code>Sign up → Create Org → Setup
Workspace → Invite Teammates → Manage permissions</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Less UI:</strong> No team picker, less onboarding, no user
management, no user dropdowns
</li>
<li>
<strong>Less code</strong>: You don’t need an invite token
system<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>,
logic flows to invite users to teams, and <code>lastViewedTeam</code>
state management.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier permission system</strong>: One user has access to all
items in one workspace, then add complexity as necessary rather than
starting with the complexity of an access control
system.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier testing:</strong> Testing invite and permission systems
is costly and time consuming to account for all the potential states.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Solve hard problems later:</strong> What happens when two people
edit the same document? You don’t have to solve problems like
multiplayer data consistency on day one.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Faster iteration</strong>: Less code, easier testing, clear
metrics, and pushing harder problems later in the process allows your
product to stay nimble while working on product market fit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Less code and a faster pathway to revenue are probably the biggest
selling points to me. From a code standpoint you’d start with the most
simplistic payment system imaginable (aside from one-time charges), have
no invite system, and you’re delivering customer value the entire way.
It’s a less riskier position and a pragmatic approach to building
something with proven value over time.
</p>
<p>
That said, startups are risk taking ventures and are under pressure to
scale fast. There’s way more money in enterprise team sales than
individual sales. Multiplayer software like Slack, Discord, and Figma
make collaboration a joy. Like I said, I don’t regret the path we took
for Luro but for the reasons listed above I would heavily consider
making a personal product rather than one for teams in my next venture.

<h2 id="are-design-systems-a-zero-interest-rate-phenomenon">Are Design
Systems a zero-interest rate phenomenon?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Last year, an investor we were talking to sent us a tweet that expressed
her hesitancy about investing in products in the design systems space
that went…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
#DesignSystems are a zero-interest rate phenomenon
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I dismissed this criticism as meme-of-the-day fodder. The idea behind
the “<code>[Trend]</code> is a zero-interest rate phenomenon” meme is
that <code>[Trend]</code> is only feasible when money is cheap to borrow
or acquire. Examples of other zero-interest rate phenomenon from
X-dot-com: Airbnb, DEI, React, and so on. Any <code>[Trend]</code> that
costs more than it makes or has an indirect relationship to the profit
machine is at risk.
</p>
<p>
Since that investor call and after months feeling the stale tech market,
this idea resurfaced in my brain. I put value in design systems because
I know there’s value in design systems, ergo there’s value in design
systems. This logic is a perfect circle! It can’t be wrong.
</p>
<h2>
So are design systems a zero-interest rate phenomenon?
</h2>
<p>
No. Well, maybe. Depends on who you ask. If I need to build 5-10 pages,
I can do those one at a time without much of a system. If I need to
create or update hundreds or thousands of pages, or five different
applications, then I need a system of components so that when I traverse
those projects I don’t have to read a ten thousand page mystery to
understand what the hell is going on. A handful (20~30) trusty
components with some state-driven variants can power infinite
applications with perfect consistency in a relatively short amount of
time. That is certainly valuable.
</p>
<p>
To pull this off design should be working in components, development
should also be in components, design and code should match, and it
should all be well-documented, no problems, easy, dogs and cats living
together! Turns out, not that easy. Behind the scenes it’s a lot of
“getting on the same page” meetings and getting buy-in from the
higher-ups.
</p>
<p>
“You’re going to spend how many months making components?”<br /> “A
lot.”<br /> “And the app is going to look different?”<br /> “Nope. Not
if I do my job right.” (finger guns)
</p>
<p>
There’s no particular “hair on fire” problem that design systems solve
that instantly sells to management. This can be frustrating to design
system practitioners because we understand the intrinsic benefits of
consistent UI over one-off solutions and maintenance nightmares. We
trade immediacy in the short term for predictability over the long tail.
In that way, design systems are a <em>proactive</em> solution to a whole
host of <em>likely</em> problems down the road. Thus only
forward-looking organizations can invest in design systems and to be
forward-looking you probably need extra cash on hand… which might make
it a zero-interest rate phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
But I believe design systems are an entirely different phenomenon all
together. Times I’ve seen executive buy-in go smoothest are when a
person in a position of power cares about design and says, “Our app
looks like shit.” Now it’s a hair on fire problem.
</p>
<h2>
Design systems are an event-triggered phenomenon
</h2>
<p>
In Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other action economies there’s a concept
of “Event Triggers”. For example, a treasure chest looks like a normal
treasure chest but turns into a monster when you try to open it. An
event (opening the chest) exposed a problem (a monster) and now you need
a solution (might and magic) to solve the problem. Design systems are a
similar mechanic because the problems they solve are almost theoretical
until you trigger an event.
</p>
<p>
Here’s some event triggers I’ve come across in my years of design
systems work…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Marketing commissioned a new logo, brand, and design language
</li>
<li>
Oh, those brand updates rolling out in TV commercials next month
</li>
<li>
Oh, and we’re launching a new line of hardware tablet devices
</li>
<li>
The great re-platforming initiative
</li>
<li>
An accessibility lawsuit
</li>
<li>
A font license lawsuit
</li>
<li>
Good design, poor code implementation
</li>
<li>
Interface inventory reveals 60 different buttons and 12 site headers
</li>
<li>
The CEO gets fired and you need to remove his face from the entire site
</li>
<li>
10 designers with high autonomy and no design review process
</li>
<li>
10 engineers with high autonomy and no design review on code changes
</li>
<li>
One department with more autonomy than the other because it “makes the
money”
</li>
<li>
Company wholesaled the entire off-shore team and 150 new people start
next week
</li>
<li>
A year of heavy turnover and
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/">the
time bomb of technical debt</a> goes off
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once your party has stepped on a trigger and encountered a monster, the
desire to be more proactive and prepared next time goes up. I’d love to
know your design system dungeon crawling stories but the lesson is this:
Design systems become a “hair on fire” problem and get buy-in when
people in the organization encounter a catastrophic or near-catastrophic
event. Design systems are not a cure-all, but they are an aspirin for a
very common set of headaches.

<h2 id="what-can-a-website-do">What Can a Website Do?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Sarah Hendren’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3LWGiAS"><em>What Can a Body
Do?</em></a> is a beautiful meditation on disability and the different
ways bodies meet the physical world. In a word, there’s often a
“mismatch” between how the world is designed and how people interact
with it. There’s a chapter in the book where Hendren talks about a
non-profit workshop that helps fabricate physical tools and
accommodations for people with disabilities, when I read it I almost
quit tech entirely.
</p>
<p>
The workshop made tables, modified wheel chairs, and other bespoke
objects. The idea of joining an organization like that lit up my neural
network. Working with actual people, hearing their needs, working
together on their problems, to help design and build a objects to allow
people to succeed at whatever task (no matter how big or small) that
they want to do… that sounded like fulfilling work.
</p>
<p>
For months I’d fantasize about quitting tech and making accessible
objects. A friend of mine works at Texas School for the Blind and
Visually Impaired (TSBVI) and he told me about how they 3D print objects
like charts and graphs or the inside of a cell to help the kids
understand visual concepts. What a novel use of technology! Fabricating
accommodations for kids sounds fun. And projects like
<em><a href="https://www.rampur.is/">Ramp Up Reykjavík</a></em> which
has expanded to <em>Ramp Up Iceland</em> and now to <em>Ramp Up
Europe</em> broadens my imagination for what’s possible.
</p>
<p>
Then I realized… wait a minute… I make websites. Websites are already a
surface area with a notorious amount of mismatch for people with
disabilities. In a world where
<a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">96.3% of the top
1,000,000 homepages have detectable errors</a>, there’s a lot of work to
do. Maybe I don’t need to quit my job, instead I could:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fix errors on the sites I work on (doing this)
</li>
<li>
Help educate other web developers on accessibility (doing this)
</li>
<li>
Build tooling to help other web developers fix their errors (doing this)
</li>
<li>
Work with standards groups to propose new accessible HTML (tried this)
</li>
<li>
Meet more often with folks who have disabilities and listen to their
concerns (need to do this)
</li>
<li>
Build bespoke apps or tools for people?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That last one… In the same way the little workshop builds from the book
bespoke accommodations, is it possible to build bespoke apps and browser
extensions to help bodies meet the digital world? I use my web developer
superpowers ✨ to hack websites or build small apps for myself all the
time. Why not offer this skill to other people?
</p>
<p>
One inspiration for how this might work is from Blake Watson’s talk
“<a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/magnoliajs-2023-the-joys-of-home-cooked-apps/">The
joys of home-cooked apps</a>”. In the talk Blake shares a handful of
side projects he’s built as workarounds for his spinal muscular atrophy.
From digi-fying a card game, to a custom DnD character sheet, to a
Markdown-to-spreadsheet generator to manage his caretakers, to
<a href="https://afinestart.me/">a classy browser startup screen</a>;
Blake is using his programming superpowers to help his body meet his
world. Blake’s tenacity for
<a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/finishing-side-projects/">finishing
side projects</a> and creating good, small, clear-intentioned apps
motivates me.
</p>
<p>
In the spirit of chasing this idea, I reached out to TSBVI and they
offered a tour of their campus and makerspace. It’s a wonderful place
with
<a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/genki-meaning/"><em>genki</em></a>
kids and the art on the walls is tactile and meant to for touch. One
issue they specifically called out was that the Prussa Slicer app used
by their 3D printers is inaccessible
(<a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/7595">missing
labels and a focus trap problem</a>). That’s blocking kids from being
able to make prints on their without sighted assistance. It’s a shame
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/accessible-fart-machines/">when
kids with disabilities miss out on the fun</a>. I don’t know how to
write GUIs in C++, nor do I know how the
<a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> framework it uses
works, nor can I build the project locally… so I might not be the
candidate to fix this particular issue… but maybe you are? Or maybe
you’re the person who could help me? If this sounds like you, please
reach out. I know some kids who could use your help.

class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Mounting
an ext4 linux USB drive on macOS in 2024</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently pulled a SATA hard drive out of a Linux box that I wanted to grab some files off of. I only had my Mac on hand, and I had a USB 3.0 to SATA hard drive adapter at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
But when I plugged in the hard drive, macOS said it couldn’t recognize
the disk.

<img width="500" height="auto" class="insert-image" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/disk-unreadable-mac.jpeg" alt="Disk unreadable by macOS" />
</p>
<p>
Makes sense, because macOS includes support for Apple’s filesystems, not
Linux (or even NTFS, Windows’ preferred filesystem). There are
commercial solutions you can buy, like Paragon Software’s
<a href="https://www.paragon-drivers.com/en/extfsmac/">extFS for
Mac</a>, but that costs $39, and I don’t want to deal with the licensing
issues that may exist there if I just want to grab a few files off one
hard drive.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, there are some open source libraries that allow at least
<em>read only</em> access to ext4-formatted disks on macOS. Let’s
install them and use them to mount the drive:

First, install <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io">macfuse</a>, using

<p>I also watched Nikki Haley speak for the first time last night, and
was impressed. She held my attention through the whole speech, and
that’s hard to do when the Knicks are playing on another channel. I
listened carefully to every word. It was a well-written speech and said
some things that needed to be said about Trump, things that he won’t
have a response to, since you can’t control or spin how old you are. We
can all see Trump aging on screen, even his fans must see it and like
those of use who will vote for Biden, they must wonder if he can make it
much further. If you had cast a great presidential candidate, in
Hollywood, Nikki Haley comes pretty damn close. But while she was
speaking I remembered that she is a Republican and thought of Roe v
Wade, and remembered that while she might not be able to or even want to
fully dismantle democracy, she is backing a form of slavery for all
American women. A good actor, but a person I could never trust. But, I
just want to say that she should continue to speak. She might be able to
pull is in an interesting new direction, not by winning, but by opening
people’s minds to the idea of a young vital leader engaged in the real
world. It would be a nice thing for the good old USA.</p>

Knicks beat the Nets last night, in the way the Knicks used to get beat,
in the last minute of the game. I felt bad for the Nets. It wasn’t that
long ago that the Nets were super-irritating because they had been taken
over by two reallllly ugly NBA players, Kevin Durant who isn’t worthy of
NY’s basketball fans, what a total piece of shit, but even worse, his
best friend Kyrie who is either a complete fucking idiot, or a
Jew-hater. Probably both. Why is he an idiot? Because he accidentally
revealed that NBA players probably all hate Jews, not one would speak up
for our people. The best they could say is that Kyrie shouldn’t have
said what he said. How revealing. Not that the Holocaust was real, and
is remembered by its children, who were raised to believe it would
happen again, as it appears to be. Anyway, the Nets have moved past
that, and they are after all a NYC-based team, and are playing with the
haplessness of typical our pro teams, and deserve some of our sympathy.
But – not saying the Knicks should have let them win, or that I was even
slightly rooting for them. But I was embarrassed that there were far
more Knicks fans in attendance than Nets fans, and I still don’t admit
that there are actually any Nets fans in NYC.</p>

</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@ohhelloana" title="@ohhelloana@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="ohhelloana">@ohhelloana</span></a> recently
wondered about personal websites. What is it that people like about
personal websites?
</p>
<p>
I think when I search online for a topic, I’d love to find pages by
people enthusiastic about the topic and not two dozen sites full of ads
that give me the impression of being people farms or bot farms. I
wouldn’t want to miss big non-monetized sites like MDN or Wikipedia, but
there are a lot of similar pages that are all strictly worse (the ad/bot
variety of the same), and there are some pages by knowledgeable people
that discovered this or that and wrote it up on their blog. The same is
true for non-technical subjects like gardening.
</p>
<p>
I want the big non-monetized documentation sites and the personal sites,
and I don’t care for the monetized sites because I feel they’re just
leeching off the sites I like: copying the text and pictures directly,
or copying them, training their bots on them and regurgitating a mix,
inserting themselves as middlemen, trying to profit from that large
value gap, slicing it up and taking a share, diminishing the value for
the rest of us.

for Windows and macOS gets experimentel “AI” features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Starting with today’s release of Chrome (M121), we’re introducing
experimental generative AI features to make it even easier and more
efficient to browse — all while keeping your experience personalized to
you. You’ll be able to try out these new features in Chrome on Macs and
Windows PCs over the next few days, starting in the U.S. Just sign into
Chrome, select “Settings” from the three-dot menu and navigate to the
“Experimental AI” page. Because these features are early public
experiments, they’ll be disabled for enterprise and educational accounts
for now. ↫ Parisa Tabriz Chrome will automatically suggest tab groups
for you (a sorting algorithm, very advanced technology), you can
generate themes (mashing other people’s real art togerher and picking a
dominant colour from the result), and Chrome can generate text in text
fields (spicy autocomplete). “AI” sure is changing the world as we know
it.</p>

<h2 id="the-gem-program---year-one">The GEM program - year one</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In January 2023, we began
our<a href="https://www.crossref.org/crossref.org/gem/"> Global
Equitable Membership (GEM) Program</a> to provide greater membership
equitability and accessibility to organisations located in the least
economically advantaged countries in the world. Eligibility for the
program is based on a member’s country; our list of countries is
predominantly based on the
<a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups" target="_blank">International
Development Association (IDA)</a>. Eligible members pay no membership or
content registration fees.
</p>
<p>
The list undergoes periodic reviews, as countries may be added or
removed over time as economic situations change. Sri Lanka was added to
the GEM program in March 2023 as they were recategorised to the IDA
classification by the World Bank.
</p>
<p>
When the program launched, we had 214 existing members eligible for the
program who then were no longer charged for membership or content
registration. Since the program began, we have welcomed an additional
131 new members into the program, including our first members from
Cambodia and Togo.

With help from our ambassadors based in GEM countries, we organised and
co-hosted several webinars to introduce the program, along with an
introduction to Crossref, and the benefits of including all kinds of
research objects in the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">Research
Nexus</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
In April, our team, together with ambassador Binayak Raj Pandey,
provided an overview of Crossref for members and organisations in
Nepal. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Our team and ambassadors, Dr Md Jahangir Alam and Shaharima Parvin
hosted two webinars in May for members and organisations in Bangladesh.
The first webinar provided an introduction to Crossref, our services,
and the GEM Program. The second webinar focused on the methods to
register content and how to add and update metadata. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In September, ambassador Baraka Manjale Ngussa joined us for an
introductory webinar aimed at organisations in Tanzania
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In November, CARLIGH (the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries
in Ghana), Crossref, and EIFL co-hosted a webinar for librarians and
journal editors in Ghana with a discussion on the GEM program and
Crossref services.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In 2024, we will continue to collaborate with our ambassadors and other
members of the community to offer more opportunities for organisations
in GEM-eligible countries to learn about the program and the benefits of
membership for content discovery.
</p>
<p>
The program was initially met with scepticism by some organisations in
GEM-eligible countries, who wanted to be certain that it wasn’t a free
trial, that there are no hidden fees, or that they would be required to
pay later for other services. Others expressed concern that Crossref
would introduce fees after a year or two. Though we were able to clarify
these aspects of the program, we understand the concerns and are working
to ensure we provide clarity and transparency about the program.
Additionally, we will be conducting a complete review of our fees in
2024, and we will ensure that GEM-eligible members will have input.
</p>
<p>
Although the program offers relief from fees, many organisations require
technical assistance and language support. The GEM program would benefit
from an increase in local
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/">Sponsors</a> to
facilitate membership and provide support, particularly In countries
with the highest growth, such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Yemen, Kyrgyz
Republic, and Ghana. Though we have Sponsors working with members who
are in GEM countries (e.g. PKP), we do not yet have any Sponsors who are
based in a GEM country.
</p>
<p>
We will be working with relevant like-minded organisations, such as PKP,
DOAJ, INASP, OASPA, EIFL, and others, to help identify suitable
candidates for new Sponsors in underserved regions and engage them
proactively. Additionally, we will consult with our ambassadors in GEM
countries to help identify potential Sponsors. We are beginning the year
by making the most of the momentum created in African countries (Uganda,
Ghana, Tanzania) and looking to develop new networks in other parts of
the world in Q2-Q4 of this year.

Debian, and any Debian-based distribution). If you’ve heard about Linux,
which is known for its open-source software and an alternative to
traditional operating systems (OS), and are curious to learn more, here
are four reasons why you should give our new Firefox on Linux package a
try. ↫ Gabriel Bustamente and Johan Lorenzo It’s a ppa and .deb package
straight from Mozilla itself, so you don’t have to to rely on your
distribution’s maintainers (as long as you use a Debian-based
distribution, that is). Do note, however, that some distributions
actually make changes to the default Firefox code, such as Fedora
enabling things like Wayland-by-default and hardware-accelerated video
decoding long before those became default in Firefox-proper. By using
Mozilla’s package, you’ll lose all of these changes. As a sidenote,
Mozilla’s instructions for enabling the ppa and installing the .deb are
a bit… Dubious, though.</p>

macOS 14.3, watchOS 10.3, tvOS 17.3 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple yesterday released iOS and iPadOS 17.3 as well as watchOS 10.3,
tvOS 17.3, and macOS Sonoma 14.3 for all supported devices. iOS 17.3
primarily adds collaborative playlists in Apple Music, and what Apple
calls “Stolen Device Protection.” Collaborative playlists have been on a
bit of a journey; they were promised as part of iOS 17, then added in
the beta of iOS 17.2, but removed before that update went live. Now
they’re finally reaching all users. When enabled, Stolen Device
Protection requires Face ID or Touch ID authentication “with no passcode
fallback” for some sensitive actions on the phone. ↫ Samuel Axon at Ars
Technica This last feature is something you should probably turn on
right away, as it serves as a reply to Joanna Stern’s investigation into
an apparently common way iPhones would get stolen to gain access to
users’ Apple accounts.</p>

<h2 id="the-time-to-unmaintainable-is-very-low">The time to
unmaintainable is very low</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
It’s so easy nowadays to get up and going on a project. I can burp some
<code>npm</code> commands into my terminal, burp some more to setup a
deployment pipeline and blam! Website. The time to product demo is so
low. You can get far on your own… very quickly… but then… you’re on your
own. And it’s possible you’ve built something way past your ability to
maintain.
</p>
<p>
To fix that problem or to allow you to do more business’y work, you add
people to the process. But people cost lots of money. Unless what you’re
building makes lots of money already, you probably have to raise VC.
With a squad of developers burping <code>npm</code> commands, now you’re
moving super fast. Hopefully money starts coming in, but the whole point
of investment was so you could price the application artificially cheap
to grow a user base that you upsell later. As the investment coffers
tick down, the pressure goes up to land a new feature or gimmick so you
can get another round of investment.
</p>
<p>
You can, of course, ride the hype cycles. This year that’s AI. Investors
might throw money at that. But now you’ve bolted on a feature from a
highly volatile, emergent, non-deterministic space into your overgrown
application. You’ll either need to hire more expensive people who know
the space or divert existing resources who were performing maintenance
over to the new feature.
</p>
<p>
Oops, AI costs more than you can charge for it. You burned through the
investment even faster and must do a round of layoffs. Now your app
maintained by 10 people has 8 people… then 5… then 2…
</p>
<p>
Paying people to burp <code>npm</code> commands is expensive, could AI
do that? Vercel’s <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a>, for example, farts
out entire UIs. Great. In a day I have twelve thousand screens built. I
have more UI than some developers will code in a lifetime. But I’m
getting the itch to update it and the machine isn’t doing what I want it
to… perhaps I’ll take some VC to hire some people to clean up these
robo-farts.
</p>
<p>
And by the time you finish all that work, it’ll be right in time for a
major version update on a core dependency. Good luck out there.
</p>
<p>
I realize I’m complaining about moving too fast but that’s not my
intent. Although, I could argue that while driving 200mph is fun and
exciting, you’re one small fuckup away from a major fuckup. My point is
that a key factor of sustainability is making sure maintainability stays
on par with growth. At the risk of sounding like a Luddite –
<a href="https://amzn.to/3NA62WE">which I am</a> – the ability to
<em style="font-family: fantasy;">fancy copy-paste</em> your way into an
unmaintainable situation is higher than ever and that’s a trade-off we
should think about.

<h2 id="one-big-one-little">One big, one little</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I often feel overwhelmed deciding what to do with my spare time. It’s a
problem with volume moreso than ambition. When the feeling hit the other
weekend I scribbled down seven ideas
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/02/bag-of-distractions/">rattling
around in my head</a> and stared at the list blankly. I’ve used
different prioritization systems in the past like the Eisenhower matrix
(Urgent vs. Important) and the Six Sigma matrix (Effort vs Impact); and
while those are good for evaluating required tasks… none of those work
well for voluntary activities self-created by a
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/not-a-collector/">serial project
starter</a>.
</p>
<p>
I need a system that helps prioritize <em>and</em> load balance projects
I give myself. When free time shows up, I don’t want to waste time
doomscrolling on social media or being in a state of overwhelm, I want
to hop right in to an idea. I also don’t want seven big thought benders
occupying my brain RAM at all times, I need less background noise. After
some thought, a tiny mantra started kicking around in my head, “One big,
one little.”
</p>
<p>
If I artificially limit myself to having one major and one minor active
side project at a time, my agility goes up because I’m not doing ten
projects at once, I’m doing one or two. When one
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">project
finishes</a>, I move to the next best idea that fits the available slot.
I will never be taking on too much and it’s easier to say “no” to new
distractions if I have to substitute projects.
</p>
<p>
Why two projects? Why not one? That would be the ultimate focus state,
but believe it or not it’s an intentional move because my pockets of
free time are differently sized. In my mind, a big project takes a week
or a month while a little project takes a day or less. You can slice up
big projects into smaller projects, but that itself is a small planning
project. I also like variety.
</p>
<p>
And because I have more than two responsibilities in life, one slight
modification to this system might be to have one big, one little project
for each major area of my life.

Careful! Adding more areas will put me back where I started, but 3 to 5
areas seems about right. What’s different between this list and the list
of seven ideas I made the other day? Not much except that areas of my
life tend to occupy particular timeframes: Work is during the day,
Personal is during the evenings, and Family is after school and
weekends. In practice my boundaries overlap (e.g. my work feeds my
family) but it’s pretty easy for me to discern which area of my life
needs attention.
</p>
<p>
I like how this limited structure builds some resilience against
“crash-ins” like urgent emails, taxes, or car problems. Those surprise
projects tend to be disproportionately problematic for me, like
delivering a new piece of furniture to an already crowded living room.
If I’m abiding in the one-in/one-out approach, a crash-in must take the
place of something else in that respective area. That paradigm is much
easier to manage than my current thought technology; a giant Jenga tower
of obligations.
</p>
<p>
No idea if this holds up but this past week I’ve been more focused and
centered than ever. Yesterday I cleared out a big work-related project
and freed up some mental allocation. Wiping a project off the board and
seeing a blank space made finishing the project even sweeter. Then last
night I had some extra energy after bedtime and decided to work on a fun
project for my podcast. I got about 80% finished in one night. Before
(like the last four weeks) I would have felt guilty or distracted about
picking up that project while thinking about four others I could/should
be doing.
</p>
<p>
That’s my new “One big, one little” system. Now when a rogue idea sneaks
into my periphery, I can chant my mantra and ward away those little
demons.

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">When
did Raspberry Pi get so expensive?</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gmktec-n100-pc-raspberry-pi-5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi 5 and N100 GMKtec Nucbox G3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I just bought this N100-based Intel x86 mini PC (<em>brand new</em>),
and it was cheaper than an almost equivalent—but slower—Raspberry Pi 5.
</p>
<p>
This GMKtec mini PC is called the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3vR48uU">Nucbox G3</a>, and it comes with an
Intel Alder Lake N100 4-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256 GB M.2 NVMe SSD, and
Windows 11 Pro—and mine cost just $131, after a couple coupons.
</p>
<p>
That’s… a lot of computer for a very good price. But the Raspberry
Pi—the famous “$35 computer”, should be well below that… right?
</p>
<p>
Well, I bought all the parts required to build a Pi 5 to the same
spec—including the adapters and parts to assemble it into one small
unit—and it turns out… the Pi is <em>more expensive</em>. And
<em>slower</em>.
</p>
<p>
The Pi 4 still starts at $35 (for a 1 GB model), but the Pi 5 starts at
$60 (for 4 GB) and climbs to $80 for the maximum 8 GB model.

<h1>
How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader
</h1>
<p>
The PDF for Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rules has 714 pages. How do you
even get started?
</p>
<p>
There are four
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/asl-starter-kit-c-2_8">starter kits</a>
(SK):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Regular infantry
</li>
<li>
Guns
</li>
<li>
Tanks
</li>
<li>
Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I didn’t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this
is not how it works. Start small.
</p>
<p>
You can get the
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules
for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.
</p>
<p>
Buy
<a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the
complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.
</p>
<p>
As somebody recently told me: “Looking up the rules is 90% of the game!”
</p>
<p>
I like to call Advanced Squad Leader “the game to end all
rules-lawyering.”
</p>
<p>
For online gaming, you need to download the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine
for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card
games. Vassal is free, open-source software.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to
run ASL on VASSAL.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The VASL site has a section called “Download Scenarios” where you can
download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you
load those games, you’ll see messages about all the extensions you’re
missing. Often you don’t need them, but feel free to install them.
</p>
<p>
If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be
aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff
that gets used in later boxes.

were extremely excited, the Mac seemed to be the perfect machine for our
“idea processor” ThinkTank, and Apple seemed to love us. It took a
couple of years to get it right, by 1986 my company had switched to be
an exclusively Mac company, but not before we were saved by the people
at Apple who believed in us, notably

you to all our friends at Apple, and to Steve Jobs and the Mac team for
creating such a wonderful breakthrough product. Those were the days when
we believed we were on a mission to save the world. In some sense that

<p>In a major move addressing European regulations, Meta will soon give
users in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland significantly more control over
how their data is used across Facebook and Instagram. The changes, set
to begin rolling out in the coming weeks, aim to comply with the Digital
Markets Act (DMA). ↫ Omer Dursun at NeoWin You’ll be able to unlink
Facebook’s various services – such as Instagram and Facebook’s main
social network thing – and you’ll be able to use Facebook Messenger as a
standalone service without needing to have a Facebook account. Sadly,
there’s no word on WhatsApp. This only applies to people in the EU/EEA.
Americans need not apply.</p>

<h2 id="rubywm-an-x11-window-manager-in-pure-ruby">RubyWM: an X11 window
manager in pure Ruby</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a minimalist (currently &lt;1K lines) pure Ruby (including the
X11 driver) X11 window manager. It is focused on tiling, but allows you
to choose to assign a tiling layout to specific desktops or leave them
floating. Currently whether or not you use tiling or floating layout
there is no window decoration and windows are not draggable or resizable
by pulling on borders (but you can do that with Windows key + left/right
mouse button) Like bspwm, which was an inspiration, the wm supports no
keyboard handling – all keyboard handling is deferred to separate tools
like sxhkd. Unlike bspwm this WM has no dedicated IPC mechanism.
Instead, so far, all communication happens via X11 ClientMessage events,
which means any tool, like xdotool etc. that can produce those events
can control the WM. ↫ Vidar Hokstad on RubyWM’s GitHub page In the blog
post announcing RubyWM, the author makes it very clear that while he
uses this WM full time, he is also willing to work around its bugs, and
that certain tools will simply break if you use it. He considers it more
of a tech demo, and that you really shouldn’t rely on this for any
serious work.</p>

<h2 id="spreadsheets-are-the-best">Spreadsheets are the best</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Spreadsheets are the best
</h1>
<p>
I want to love Forth and Lisp and Perl and Go and I sort of want to know
Rust and Haskell and OCaml and Elixir, but really, the most important
electronic computing platform for the largest number people is …
spreadsheets.
</p>
<p>
Formulas and graphs turn these into the multifunctional tool that spread
from accounting specialists to financial reporting to project managers
planning to household budgets to birthday and wedding guest lists.
</p>
<p>
If you think about it, spreadsheets for the masses succeeded where Emacs
failed. Spreadsheets allow you to build the tools you need. And sure, as
a programming professional I have heard my share of horror stories:
salary distributions and bonus programs, airport light systems, and many
other things that should have used relational databases and REST
services and whatever. But people know spreadsheets and use them to
solve their problems.
</p>
<p>
Spreadsheets are underappreciated. Certainly they are underappreciated
by programmers, I think.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@maxime_andre" title="@maxime_andre@mastodon.xyz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="maxime_andre">@maxime_andre</span></a>
linked me to the video
<a href="https://youtu.be/0yKf8TrLUOw?si=ZvLctptepVjLWXY3">Pure
Functional Programming in Excel</a> by Felienne Hermans where she
explains the benefits of spreadsheets for computing.
</p>
<p>
And I do think that the programming languages I listed failed us in as
far as they do not contribute to computers as
<a href="http://conviviality.ouvaton.org/spip.php?article1">convivial
tools</a>. Most people are not autonomous in their use of computers to
solve their problems because they cannot use the languages listed. They
must hope for an app to solve their problem. But they can use a
spreadsheet to solve their problem!
</p>
<p>
Emacs was supposed to be the editor for everybody, including
non-technical people. It’s just that our current design paradigms
optimize for the inexperienced users and penalize experienced users.
Users no longer expect Emacs-like tools and Emacs developers don’t
expect inexperienced users any more.
</p>
<p>
We feel it’s OK to feel overwhelmed by Emacs – but many people are
expected to navigate the real world in cars, on roads, with complex
traffic regulation, other traffic participants and machines we don’t
understand. To me, that illustrates a value judgement. On the one hand,
cars are a commodity. We no longer have to be an expert in combustion
engines to drive one. But we still need to learn how to use the tool.
There’s mandatory training, there are professional teachers, there are
enforcers of conventions, penalties, there’s financing available if we
want to lease a car, and so on. There is a lot of support and training
for users of cars and not so much for computers. The expectations are
different.
</p>
<p>
One might want to say that people need the car to get to work and that
explains the economic incentives. To this I might reply that when one
gets to work the actual work usually involves a computer and instead of
using a convivial tool that one has learned and mastered, customized and
extended to ones liking, one is forced to work with corporate software
that is as boring as it can be.
</p>
<p>
Except when it comes to spreadsheets. This is where everyday people
still can exercise mastery and solve their problems. It’s a tool and not
an app.
</p>
<p>
If we go back far enough, programming languages were designed to let
non-technical people solve their problems.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> was a
programming language for business people.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> was a
programming language for faculty and students. From this point of view,
I’d argue, the programming languages I mentioned are in fact steps away
from this goal.
</p>
<p>
These programming languages solve more specialised problems. These are
tools for experts. But in doing this, they moved away from the realm of
everyday people using them to solve their problems. These languages fail
to make computers into convivial tools.
</p>
<p>
The ZX Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 both booted into BASIC. Sure,
that didn’t mean that we knew how to program. Loading and saving stuff
from cassette was hard. PEEK and POKE were hard. But the tools to turn
the computer into a convivial tool were right there. The computer came
with a manual.
</p>
<p>
My hope, my wish, my expectations are that we can do this and more. We
can make it even better! Spreadsheets are the saving grace. We should
put spreadsheets front and centre.
</p>
<p>
The sad reality is, however, that today we buy computers that
essentially boot into the app store.

them and I also try my best to reply to everyone. Sometimes life takes
over and I forget but I really do try my best to reply because I believe
it’s important to connect with others.

I also believe in kindness, in curiosity, in being open to learn about

<p>Technological advances and changes in economic conditions are
shifting the skills needed to build an adaptive and successful
workforce. As underscored in the 2023 National Defense Science &amp;
Technology Strategy, the United States cannot create 21st-century
capabilities using 20th-century education practices. The World Economic
Forum (WEF) further predicts that by 2025, 50% of all workers worldwide
will need reskilling to compete in the market. The increasing reliance
on technology in jobs across the market has imposed additional
challenges for the workforce, especially for those from low-income and

<p>Smartwatches at the turn of the century were a more motley assortment
than today’s, with an even wilder range of functionality. If you had a
few hundred dollars or so, there were some interesting options, even
back then. But if all you had was $85 (in 2024 dollars about $150), you
still weren’t left out, because in 2001 you could get the Web-<span

docking station, and you could slurp down about 93K of precious Web data
to scroll on the 59×16 screen — 10 characters by 2 characters — to read
any time you wanted! That is, of course, if the remote host the watch’s
Windows 9x-based client accessed were still up, on which it depended for
virtually anything to download and install. Well, I want 95,488 bytes of

tilt: documenting the uneven playing field for an independent browser
like Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>This tilt manifests in a variety of ways. For example: making it
harder for a user to download and use a different browser, ignoring or
resetting a user’s default browser preference, restricting capabilities
to the first-party browser, or requiring the use of the first-party
browser engine for third-party browsers. For years, Mozilla has engaged
in dialog with platform vendors in an effort to address these issues.
With renewed public attention and an evolving regulatory environment, we
think it’s time to publish these concerns using the same transparent
process and tools we use to develop positions on emerging technical
standards. So today we’re publishing a new issue tracker where we intend
to document the ways in which platforms put Firefox at a disadvantage
and engage with the vendors of those platforms to resolve them. ↫ The
official Mozilla blog Excellent initative.</p>

room?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons
I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was
finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for
winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room.
However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too
smart for me. It is obviously a touchscreen of some sort, but there was
zero indication as to what it controls. The landlord had no idea what
this is. There are no buttons or labels on the thing, just a tiny yellow
light to let you know it has the power. ↫ Nikita Lapkov What follows is
an investigation into what it is, how to get it working, and, of course,
how to hack it and make it more useful.</p>

PostgreSQL Developer Day 2024 / Call for Papers &amp; Sponsors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Prague PostgreSQL Developer Day 2024 (P2D2 2024) will be held on June 4
and 5 in Prague, Czech Republic. The conference focuses on topics for
PostgreSQL users and developers. For more information about the event,
please see the website at
<a href="https://www.p2d2.cz/">https://www.p2d2.cz/</a>
</p>
<p>
We are now accepting proposals for talks and trainings in both Czech and
English. As in previous years, the conference is a single-track event
with a mix of talks in Czech and English.
</p>
<p>
To submit a talk, use this form:
</p>
<pre><code> https://p2d2.cz/call-for-papers
</code></pre>
<p>
The talk sessions are generally 45 minutes long (but may be shorter if
requested) and may be on any PostgreSQL-related topic. We’re also
looking for trainings (either half-day or whole-day) for the first day
(June 4). To submit a training proposal, use the same form as for
regular talks (there’s a field to pick talk/training).
</p>
<p>
Finally, we are considering to include a session of lightning talks
(short talks, five minute each). A separate call for proposals will be
made for them during the event.
</p>
<p>
The submission deadline is March 1 (which is Friday), end of day.
Selected speakers will be notified / confirmed shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>
The proposals will be considered by committee who will produce a
schedule to be published about a month before the event.
</p>
<p>
All selected speakers will get free entry to the conference (excluding
training sessions). We do offer covering travel and accommodations for
foreign speakers (generally enough for two nights in a hotel and travel
within Europe). If you require assistance with funding to be able to
attend, please make a note of this in the submission notes field.
</p>
<p>
We have also opened our call for sponsors. As usual, we we’ll offer
three sponsorship levels - the details are available at:
</p>
<pre><code>https://p2d2.cz/rocnik-2024/sponsorship
</code></pre>
<p>
If you wish to become a sponsor, or have questions/suggestions regarding
sponsorship, please contact us at sponsors@p2d2.cz (we’re happy to
answer any questions about the event and sponsorship conditions).
</p>
<p>
We look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you in Prague!

<h2 id="the-case-for-rust-in-the-freebsd-base-system">The case for Rust
(in the FreeBSD base system)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD is discussing adding Rust to the FreeBSD base system. In a
recent thread on src-committers, we discussed the costs and benefits of
including Rust code in the FreeBSD base system. To summarize, the cost
is that it would double our build times. imp suggested adding an
additional step after buildworld for stuff that requires an external
toolchain. That would ease the build time pain. The benefit is that some
tools would become easier to write, or even become possible. ↫ Warner
Losh on the freebsd-hackers mailing list From everything I’ve read and
what you, the readers, have told me, someone who isn’t a programmer,
languages like Rust really are a big improvement over older languages,
and it’s probably not a good idea for a major, important project like
FreeBSD to isolate its base system from such progress. Now, I’m not at
all qualified to say whether Rust, specifically, is the right choice,
but a language like Rust should probably be part of the base system. A
big issue is FreeBSD’s architecture support. Rust is not well-supported
or even supported at all on all the various platforms FreeBSD supports,
which might prove to be a road block for now. That being said, letting
barely used ISAs hamper your progress too much might not be a good idea
either. Rust has already become a supported language for the development
of the Linux kernel.</p>

common tasks, profound support for touchpads and touchscreens,
tearing-free graphics, low-latency audio, casual on-target debugging,
and suspend/resume. The focus on usability notwithstanding, we will
steadily continue with the gardening of Genode’s driver landscape,
fostering the consistent use of drivers ported from up-to-date Linux
kernels, clear-cut ACPI support, and making drivers pluggable. In 2024,
we will also promote Genode’s custom (base-hw) microkernel to become the
default kernel for Sculpt OS, which is the culmination of a multi-year
effort. ↫ Official Genode news post The updated roadmap for 2024 details
the goals of the project for the coming current year.</p>

In this adventure Bull Mancuso is a woman, and is an astronaut on the
space station, performing experiments on her fellow astronauts. The goal
of the experiment is to determine if astronauts can play a new form of
basketball that was invented by SpaceXYZ founder Mucky Lonnegan, who is
in space with Astronaut Mancuso.

The vision hardware looks lovely, but I am more impressed by the depth
of the user experience, the guidance to developers, the design system,
the operating system and the tooling to support it.
</p>
<p>
Previous headsets have been cool and exciting (I own pretty much one of
each), yet none got this level of necessary scaffolding in place, so the
experiences are a mish-mash of half baked ideas.

<p>
We finally go from “this is a neat idea” to a viable platform.

realize that most of the people who read this blog aren’t sports fans,
something that I wish were different, because sports, like HBO series,
give us a way to talk about complex human relationships in the 21st
century that we don’t get any other way to imho. If we all watch
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession">Succession</a>,
for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy">Shiv</a>
and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans">Tom</a>).
(No spoilers as to why he’s significant, and won the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards">Emmy</a>
for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where
they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to
say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to
say to your friends – there! – <i>that’s</i> what I was talking about.
Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few
players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal
ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors,
which was one of those games you don’t ever forget, because of a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">recent trade</a>
where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the
teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way
what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded
away. One day they’re our team, and the next day, supposedly they’re the
other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn’t just leave,
maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a
former
<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career">Great
Hope</a> of ours, didn’t pan out, and now it’s nice to see him on the
court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could’ve
gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was
the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one,
the
<a href="https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/">hotshit
kid</a> with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point
guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the
Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night’s
<a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/">game</a>
was something else. I understand that
<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel">Niners
and Packers</a> fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can
relate.</p>

<h1>
Download the whole podcast.
</h1>
<p>
Feeling evil… Assume that there’s a podcast with a feed and you want to
download all the episodes. Like a music show, for example.
</p>
<p>
First, get the feed, saving it as <code>rss.xml</code> because we’re
going to need it in the next statement.
</p>
<pre><code>curl -o rss.xml https://musicforprogramming.net/rss.xml
</code></pre>
<p>
Then, get every enclosure:
</p>
<pre><code>for f in $(perl -ne '/&lt;enclosure url=&quot;(.*?)&quot;/ &amp;&amp; print &quot;$1\n&quot;' rss.xml); do
  curl --continue-at - --remote-name &quot;$f&quot;
done
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>–continue-at -</code> option should make it possible to resume
downloads at a later stage. <code>curl</code> will skip all the bytes
already downloaded, effectively skipping the download. That’s what I’m
hoping for, in any case.
</p>
<p>
The <code>–remote-name</code> option saves the episode under its remote
name. This is what most people would expect, I think.
</p>
<p>
You know how it goes, though: never parse HTML (or XML) using regular
expressions. I’m doing it here and it is definitely a bad idea!
</p>
<p>
I’m also too lazy to install a real XML parser and doing the real thing,
so it is what it is.

<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Let’s do another Bull Mancuso comic strip! In this version Ms Mancuso is
a professor at Harvard Law School, teaching a class on contract law.
She’s a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high
court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck’s, which she gets from a

on Mass Ave</a> in Cambridge, just across from the Law School campus.
Her students all have tremendous respect for her. Just a few panels of
her giving an informative caffeine-enhanced lecture.

I was given two comic strips to choose from, and I went with the first,
because it’s closest to what I was thinking of! It looks like a Harvard
