which btw I have not read. This was emphatically not Game of Thrones,
though some of the actors played roles in both series, and in each case
that was awkward. Not the best actors, they didn’t get much screentime
in GoT, but here, they get the big lines and omg it was embarrassing,
they don’t pull it off. Creepy. I loved the first four episodes,
incredible story, and the special effects, awesome. Then it really
started to stink in episodes in 6 and 7, endless stupid dialog with
music that made every stupid thing like a climax of a sort. But I was
still watching, and then it came back roaring in the final episode. On
the other hand it’s like so much of today’s TV, superheros, epic
conflicts, resolution, good guys win. A cross between

and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game">Ender’s

<h2
id="eu-opens-non-compliance-investigations-against-alphabet-apple-and-meta-under-the-digital-markets-act">EU
opens non-compliance investigations against Alphabet, Apple and Meta
under the Digital Markets Act</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>It turns out Apple, Facebook, and Google were not as clever with
their malicious compliance with the European Union’s DMA as they thought
they were, as the European Commission has opened investigations into
their compliance plans. Especially Apple, who has been most public about
its malicious compliance, seems to be the target. Today, the Commission
has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act
(DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and
self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App
Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s “pay or consent
model”. The Commission suspects that the measures put in place by these
gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations
under the DMA. In addition, the Commission has launched investigatory
steps relating to Apple’s new fee structure for alternative app stores
and Amazon’s ranking practices on its marketplace. Finally, the
Commission has ordered gatekeepers to retain certain documents to
monitor the effective implementation and compliance with their
obligations. ↫ European Commission press release This is entirely
unsurprising. Google’s and Facebook’s compliance plans were less
scrutinised in the press, but all still raised questions about whether
they would pass mustard. Apple’s plans, meanwhile, were universally seen
as deeply malicious and not compliant, and it seems the European
Commission agrees. Apple’s continuous wild, flailing attacks on the EU
and the DMA certainly aren’t helping, either. There’s no denying Apple’s
behaviour has been deeply unprofessional and anti-European Union, which
contrasts strongly with how Apple and Tim Cook operate in China, where
they face much stricter rules than they do in the EU. Tim Cook is
currently in China praising and buttering up to the Chinese totalitarian
regime, while the company has been attacking the European Union and DMA
almost non-stop for months now. It really shows where Apple’s priorities
lie. Meanwhile, Facebook’s pay-for-privacy model was always going to be
a hard sell at €10 a month, and as such, the company already announced
it was going to cut that cost in half. Google’s plans are a bit more
nebulous, since it’s a bit more difficult to see tangible results from
things like search rankings, but it seems here, too, the European
Commission has its worries about compliance. The European Commission
intends to complete its investigations within a year, and if found in
violation of the law, companies can be fined for up to 10% of their
worldwide turnover, which can grow up to 20% for repeated
infringements.</p>

Firefox fork makes its modifications closed source due to forks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, a few people suggested I give the browser Floorp a try, a
Firefox fork with some additional UI changes and additions. Since it was
based on Firefox ESR, however, I saw no point in even trying it, because
I prefer to be on the latest Firefox release. It seems I accidentally
made the right choice, since yesterday the developers behind Floorp
decided to take their modifications closed source. The appearance of
Floorp forks – which, may I remind you, is a fork itself – seems to be
the cause. I know it’s not nice of me to say, but Floorp has been in too
much demand. It am surprise to me that companies and organizations would
fork a fork that I had created when I was still a teenager, and at first
I was happy about it, but it was not beneficial to me, and on the
contrary, it was mentally draining. There were forks that wanted to hide
the fact that they were Floorp forks, forks that did not want to
contribute to Floorp at all, forks that used the code for life and just
changed the name of Floorp, and many other forks were born. ↫ Floorp
blog It seems the developer of Floorp is rather young, and started the
project as a teenager, and as such, I don’t think we should be too harsh
on them – I did some dumb things as a teenager – but complaining about
forks of your own fork seems a bit disingenuous, regardless of how young
and inexperienced you are. I understand seeing your work forked into
competing browsers can be frustrating, but it’s a core part of the open
source world, especially if you yourself owe your product to forking,
too.</p>

blank spaces, rows, and columns between app icons. ↫ Joe Rossignol at

Originally presented at VCF SoCal in February of 2024.

<p>
The cryotron, a superconductive switch, almost revolutionized computing.
It’s one of those fascinating near misses. In this episode we are
talking about the history of the cryotron, how the NSA and
supercomputing factors into the mix, and the current state of research
into the topic. Did the NSA actually construct a supercomputer that ran
in a vat of liquid helium? The answer is… maybe?

tiny little format like that. I don’t mind having a small space to
deploy in, but I like to have lots of room where I write. Linkblogs and
blogrolls go together really well. Blogrolls work best for smaller
groups of people and projects, not the huge number of followers people
have on the twitter-like social web. But I think even a few hundred
items in a blogroll work, as long as it’s dynamic, and it’s reverse
chronologic.</p>

<p>Never thought I’d be so glad to see the
<a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xml-rpc site</a> back up and running. I
found out about it being off by someone sending an email asking if they
could buy the domain from me. Otherwise I’m not sure I would have
noticed. The whole idea is to put these static sites in a safe place and
forget about it. But clearly there are no safe places and someday you
might get dragged back to try to debug some work you did a bunch of
years ago.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>For the past week I have been configuring hyprland and using it as my
daily driver. Coming from major Desktop Environments like KDE or Gnome,
this was definitely quite challanging, specially when implementing
features that we take it for granted on these DEs, like screen sharing
or screenshot annotating. In this post I will be going through all the
tools and scripts I have been creating to configure this amazing Window
Manager to my liking. ↫ xd1.dev Like I mentioned in my MNT Reform
review, I’m not a fan of these “build your own desktop environment”
window managers and related tools, but there’s no denying they’re quite
popular. This article is a good introduction to hyprland, one of the
more popular window managers of this genre.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I saw this on a Linus Tech Tips video today, and it’s pretty neat:
the Khadas Mind is a tiny computer powered by an Intel Core i5-1340P or
Core i7-1360P, but it has a souped-up PCIe connector at the bottom that
allows you to hook it up to all kinds of other devices, like a graphics
card, a dock, and so on. It looks slick and quite user-friendly, and
according to the LTT video, the company intends to release the specs for
the connector so that third parties can hook into it as well, but a
promise is just that – a promise. It’s way too early to tell if this
will go anywhere – past attempts would suggest that sadly, it won’t –
but that doesn’t mean it’s not an incredibly awesome and seemingly
workable implementation of the modular PC idea.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-24, updated: 2024-03-24, from: Newsboat News</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;
            Another quarter, another Newsboat release!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
    The highlight for this one is Feedbin support. Feedbin is an
    online newsreading service in the vein of Google Reader, and we
    already support a bunch of similar ones. The feature request
            for Feedbin specifically was filed 4 years ago, and upvoted
    19 times — twice more often than the runner-up, a request for
    separators between groups of feeds. We‘ve been waiting for an
    interested person to tackle this, and finally James Vaughan
            showed up with a complete implementation. Please give it a spin
    if you‘ve been waiting for this functionality all these years,
            and thanks for your patience!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
    Another notable feature is support for item starring with
    Miniflux. This was on the to-do list for a while too, and was
    implemented by gilcu3. Interestingly, both of these are first
    ever contributions; it‘s very nice to see new faces in
            Newsboat‘s pull requests!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
    There‘s also a few new scripts in the contrib directory, and
    loads of internal reworking by Dennis van der Schagt and others.
    Probably some new bugs too, but Juho Eerola fixed one in 2.35,
            so let‘s call it even, ok?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Well, enough chatter; go grab the source:

id="digital-wallets-and-the-only-apple-pay-does-this-mythology">Digital
wallets and the “only Apple Pay does this” mythology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I hope what you take away from this post is that while Apple Pay is a
great way to pay for things and that Apple did a great job mainstreaming
digital wallets like this, what they do is not unique in the industry.
DPANs are great for making it harder to track one person’s purchases
across multiple merchants and they make customers less at risk in the
event of a data breach of payment card info. ↫ Matt Birchler The gist of
the article is that all the things Apple claims are unique about Apple
Pay are really not unique at all, and quite a few things Apple touts are
just flat-out lies, such as merchants being unable to know what you buy
or people being unable to track you when you use Apple Pay. Other
digital wallets, from Google, Samsung, and others, work in the exact
same way Apple Pay does, and even banks and similar companies implement
their payment systems the way Apple Pay does. It’s a case study in how
Apple’s marketing and PR bloggers manage to perpetuate a myth solely
because so many people just assume it must be true. Apple wouldn’t lie,
right?</p>

id="another-day-another-paean-of-praise-for-the-amigas-1980s-pre-emptive-multitasking-gui">Another
day, another paean of praise for the Amiga’s 1980s pre-emptive
multitasking GUI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<div>
Yes, the Amiga offered a GUI with pre-emptive multitasking, as early as
1985 or so. And it was affordable: you didn’t even need a hard
disk.<br /><span class="commtext c00">
<p>
The thing is, that’s only part of the story.
</p>
<p>
There’s a generation of techies who are about 40 now who don’t remember
this stuff well, and some of the older ones have forgotten with time but
don’t realise. I had some greybeard angrily telling me that floppy
drives were IDE recently. Senile idiot.
</p>
<p>
Anyway.
</p>
<p>
Preemptive multitasking is only part of the story. Lots of systems had
it. Windows <i>2.0</i> could do preemptive multitasking – but only of
DOS apps, and only in the base 640kB of RAM, so it was pretty useless.
</p>
<p>
It sounds good but it’s not. Because the other key ingredient is memory
protection. You need both, together, to have a compelling deal. Amiga
and Windows 2.x/3.x only had the preemption part, they had no hardware
memory management or protection to go with it. (Windows 3.x <i>when
running on a 386</i> and also <i>when given &gt;2MB RAM</i> could do
some, for DOS apps, but not much.)
</p>
<p>
Having multiple pre-emptive tasks is relatively easy if they are all in
the same memory space, but it’s horribly horribly unstable.
</p>
<p>
Also see: microkernels. In size terms, AmigaOS was a microkernel, but a
microkernel without memory protection is not such a big deal, because
the hard part of a microkernel is the interprocess communication, and if
they can just do that by reading and writing each other’s RAM it’s
trivially easy but also trivially insecure and trivially unstable.
</p>
<p>
RISC OS had pre-emptive multitasking too… but only of text-only
command-line windows, and there were few CLI RISC OS apps so it was
mostly useless. At least on 16-bit Windows there were lots of DOS apps
so it was vaguely useful, if they’d fit into memory. Which only trivial
ones would. Windows 3 came along very late in the DOS era, and by then,
most DOS apps didn’t fit into memory <i>on their own</i> one at a time.
I made good money optimising DOS memory around 1990-1992 because I was
very good at it and without it most DOS apps didn’t fit into 500-550kB
any more. So two of them in 640kB? Forget it.
</p>
<p>
Preemption is clever. It lets apps that weren’t designed to multitask do
it.
</p>
<p>
But it’s also <i>slow</i>. Which is <i>why</i> RISC OS didn’t do it.
Co-op is much quicker which is also why OSes like RISC OS and 16-bit
Windows chose it for their GUI apps: because GUI apps strained the
resources of late-1980s/very-early-1990s computers. So you had 2
choices:
</p>
<p>
• The Mac and GEM way: don’t multitask at all.
</p>
<p>
• The 16-bit Windows and RISC OS way: multitask cooperatively, and hope
nothing goes wrong.
</p>
<p>
Later, notably, MacOS 7-8-9 and Falcon MultiTOS/MiNT/MagiC etc added
coop multitasking to single-tasking GUI OSes. I used MacOS 8.x and 9.x
<i>a lot</i> and I really liked them. They were extraordinarily usable
to an extent Mac OS X has never and will never catch up with.
</p>
<p>
But the good thing about owning a Mac in the 1990s was that at least one
thing in your life was guaranteed to go down on you every single day.

Gidget’s inherited a lovely little blanket from an elderly family friend
of Viv’s whose beloved cat recently passed away. She said Gidget had
better appreciate it because “it was very special to Sooty”. Thankfully,
she does 😸
