An algorithm for content moderation for reducing the human contact
trolls have.
</p>
<p>
If you notice an account that gets blocked by a lot of people who don’t
follow them after they reply to one of their posts, then slow them down
or throw out their replies in the bit bucket.
</p>
<p>
Eventually if it keeps up, you pretty much know it’s software, and you
can delete the account.

<p>
I guess. Just thinking out loud. ;-)

<p>lEEt/OS is a graphical shell and partially posix-compliant
multitasking operating environment that runs on top of a DOS kernel. The
latest version can be downloaded from this site. lEEt/OS is tested with
FreeDOS 1.2 and ST-DOS, but it may also work with other DOS
implementations. It can be compiled with Open Watcom compiler. 8086
binaries are also available from this site. ↫ lEEt/OS website I had
never heard of lEEt/OS before, but it looks quite interesting – and the
new ST-DOS kernel the developer is making further adds to its
uniqueness. A very cool project I’m putting on my list of operating
systems to write short ‘first look’ article about for y’all.</p>

<h2 id="arm64ec-and-arm64x-explained">ARM64EC (and ARM64X)
explained</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Probably the most confused looks I get from other developers when I
discuss Windows and ARM64 is when I used the term “ARM64EC”.  They ask
is the same thing as ARM64?  Is it a different instruction set than
ARM64?  How can you tell if an application is or ARM64 ARM64EC? This
tutorial will answer those questions by de-mystifying and explaining the
difference between what can be called “classic ARM64” as it existed
since Windows 10, and this new “ARM64EC” which was introduced in Windows
11 in 2021. ↫ Darek Mihocka I’m not going to steal the article’s
thunder, but the short of it is that the ‘EC’ stands for ‘Emulation
Compatible’, meaning it can call unmodified x86-64 code. ARM64X,
meanwhile, is an extended version of Windows PE that allows both ARM64
and emulated x86-64 code to coexist in the same binary (which is not the
same as a fat binary, which is an either/or situation). There is a whole
lot more to this subject – and I truly mean a lot, this a monster of an
in-depth article – so be sure to head on over and read it in full.
You’ll be busy for a while.</p>

A couple months ago, soon after we posted our

scenario: what would happen if someone walked up and touched the tower,
while standing on the ground?

<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and AMD have all been pushing the idea of
an “AI PC” for months now as we head toward more AI-powered features in
Windows. While we’re still waiting to hear the finer details from
Microsoft on its big plans for AI in Windows, Intel has started sharing
Microsoft’s requirements for OEMs to build an AI PC — and one of the
main ones is that an AI PC must have Microsoft’s Copilot key. ↫ Tom

Spencer wants Epic Games Store and others on Xbox consoles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>In an interview with Microsoft’s CEO of Gaming during the annual Game
Developers Conference, Spencer told Polygon about the ways he’d like to
break down the walled gardens that have historically limited players to
making purchases through the first-party stores tied to each console.
Or, in layperson terms, why you should be able to buy games from other
stores on Xbox — not just the official storefront. Spencer mentioned his
frustrations with closed ecosystems, so we asked for clarity. Could he
really see a future where stores like Itch.io and Epic Games Store
existed on Xbox? Was it just a matter of figuring out mountains of
paperwork to get there? ↫ Chris Plante at Polygon The answer is yes,
Spencer claims. I don’t know how realistic any of this is, but to me it
makes perfect sense, and the gaming world has been moving towards it for
a while now. At the moment, I’m doing something thought unthinkable
until very recently: I’m playing a major Sony PlayStation exclusive,
Horizon: Forbidden West, on PC, through Steam on Linux. Sony has been
making its major exclusives available on Steam in recent years, and
while seeing these games on Xbox might be a bit too much to ask, I
wouldn’t be surprised to see storefronts from companies who don’t make
game consoles pop up on the Xbox and PlayStation. Games have become so
expensive to make that limiting them to a single console just doesn’t
make any commercial sense. Why limit your audience?</p>

<h1 id="2024-03-27-convert-text-file-to-pdf">
2024-03-27 Convert text file to PDF
</h1>
<p>
I just couldn’t find a good way to turn a text file into a PDF. Within
Emacs, <code>ps-print-buffer</code> is hard to configure and my two
specific problems were the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
everything is turned into Latin-1 so I cannot use the EN dash;
</li>
<li>
the line length was set too short so that I couldn’t print lines longer
than 80 characters even though there was plenty of space left.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wasted some time trying to write something in Bash, turned to Perl and
wasted some more time trying to figure out why the encodings were all
wrong except when the encodings were OK but Perl gave me a warning for
every multi-byte character. So frustrating.
</p>
<p>
The solution ended up not being decoding and encoding the bytes in the
Perl script but to use the <code>–encoding</code> option for
<code>weasyprint</code>. In this case, it wasn’t Perl’s fault, it was my
fear of Perl’s encoding issues that led my down endless variations of
<code>binmode</code>, <code>:utf8</code>, <code>decode_utf8</code> and
<code>encode_utf8</code>. But I think I have it, now.
</p>
<p>
But this is what I ended up with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
use <code>weasyprint</code>;
</li>
<li>
wrap it all in a <code>pre</code> tag.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I created a script called <code>to-pdf</code> with the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Modern::Perl;
use File::Basename;

if (@ARGV == 0) {
  die &quot;Usage: to-pdf file.txt ...\n&quot;;
}

for (@ARGV) {
  open(my $text, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $_) or die &quot;Cannot read $_\n&quot;;
  my ($name, $path, $suffix) = fileparse($_, &quot;.txt&quot;);
  open(my $html, &quot;|-&quot;) || exec &quot;weasyprint&quot;, &quot;--encoding&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;$path$name.pdf&quot;;

  print $html &lt;&lt;'BEG';
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family: Iosevka; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;
BEG

  for (&lt;$text&gt;) { print $html $_ }; # copy text

  print $html &lt;&lt;'END';
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
END
}

In Godot, there is a panel to configure Importer settings, and the way
that it works there is that you need to "Save" the values if you like
it.

I am thinking that on iPad, I should automatically save, without asking

well could a Snapdragon chip actually run Windows games? At the 2024

titles at close to x86/64 speed, but how fast is fast? With
medium-weight games like Control and Baldur’s Gate 3, it looks like the
target might be: 30 frames per second at 1080p screen resolution, medium
settings, possibly with AMD’s FSR 1.0 spatial upscaling enabled. ↫ Sean
Hollister at The Verge Those are some rough numbers for machines
Qualcomm claims can run x86 games at “close to full speed“.</p>

<h2 id="why-x86-doesnt-need-to-die">Why x86 doesn’t need to die</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hackaday recently published an article titled “Why x86 Needs to Die”
– the latest addition in a long-running RISC vs CISC debate. Rather than
x86 needing to die, I believe the RISC vs CISC debate needs to die. It
should’ve died a long time ago. And by long, I mean really long. About a
decade ago, a college professor asked if I knew about the RISC vs CISC
debate. I did not. When I asked further, he said RISC aimed for simpler
instructions in the hope that simpler hardware implementations would run
faster. While my memory of this short, ancient conversation is not
perfect, I do recall that he also mentioned the whole debate had already
become irrelevant by then: ISA differences were swept aside by the
resources a company could put behind designing a chip. This is the
fundamental reason why the RISC vs CISC debate remains irrelevant today.
Architecture design and implementation matter so much more than the
instruction set in play. ↫ Chips and Cheese The number of instruction
sets killed by x86 is high, and the number of times people have wrongly
predicted the death of x86 – most recently, after Apple announced its
first ARM processors – is even higher. It seems people are still holding
on to what x86 was like in the ’80s and early ’90s, completely
forgetting that the x86 we have today is a very, very different beast.
As Chips and Cheese details in this article, the differences between x86
and, say, ARM, aren’t nearly as big and fundamental as people think they
are. I’m a huge fan of computers running anything other than x86, not
because I hate or dislike the architecture, but because I like things
that are different, and the competition they bring. That’s why I love
POWER9 machines, and can’t wait for competitive non-Apple ARM machines
to come along. If you try to promote non-x86 ISAs out of hatred or
dislike of x86, history shows you’ll eventually lose.</p>

<h2 id="infinite-mac-turning-to-the-dark-side">Infinite Mac: turning to
the dark side</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a year ago I came across the Previous emulator – it appeared to
be a faithful simulation of the NeXT hardware and thus capable of
running NeXTStep. While including it in Infinite Mac would be
scope-creep, NeXT’s legacy is in many ways more relevant to today’s
macOS than classic Mac OS. It also helped that it’s under active
development by its original creator (see the epic thread in the NeXT
Computers forums), and thus a modern, living codebase. Previous is the
fifth emulator that I’ve ported to WebAssembly/Emscripten and the
Infinite Mac runtime, and it’s gotten easier. As I’m doing this work,
I’m developing more and more empathy for those doing Mac game ports –
some things are really easy and others become yak shaves due to the
unintended consequences of choices made by the original developers.
Previous is available on multiple platforms and has good abstractions,
so overall it was a pretty pleasant experience. ↫ Mihai Parparita By
porting previous to WebAssembly/Emscripten, Infinite Mac now offers
access to a whole slew of NeXTSTEP releases, from the earliest known
release to the last one from 1997. There’s also a ton of applications
added to make the experience feel more realistic. This makes Infinite
Mac even more useful than it already was, ensuring it’s one of the best
and easiest ways to experience old macOS and now NeXTSTEP releases
through virtual machines (real ones, this time), available in your
browser. I’ll be spending some time with these new additions for sure,
since I’ve very little experience with NeXTSTEP other than whatever I
vicariously gleamed through Steven Troughton-Smith‘s toots on the
subject over the years. Mihai Parparita is doing incredibly important
work through Infinite Mac, and he deserves credit and praise for all
he’s doing here.</p>

years old today</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Seven years ago, on 27 March 2017, Apple introduced one of the most
fundamental changes in its operating systems since Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah
was released 16 years earlier. On that day, those who updated iOS to
version 10.3 had their iPhone’s storage silently converted to the first
release of Apple File System, APFS. Six months later, with the release
of macOS 10.13 High Sierra on 25 September, Mac users followed suit. ↫
Howard Oakley The migration from HFS+ to APFS is still an amazing feat
for Apple to have pulled off. Hundreds of millions devices converted
from one filesystem to another, and barely anyone noticed – no matter
how you look at it, that’s an impressive achievement, and the engineers
who made it possible deserve all the praise they’re getting.</p>

We’re looking after Patches, my brother-in-law’s dog, “for the long
weekend” (until next Tuesday). He hasn’t met Gidget before, and got
himself bapbapbapped when he tried to give her a customary canine
friendly greeting (sniffing her bum). Gidget was FURIOUS! After some
time apart they settled down, though. Patches took a nap, and Gidget
decided beating him up could be deferred in favour of just watching him
like a hawk, and now they’re <em>both</em> snoozing peacefully on the
couch. What a relief 😅

<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL Core Team is deeply saddened by the loss of our long-time
friend and colleague Simon Riggs on the 26th of March, 2024.
</p>
<p>
Simon was responsible for many of the enterprise features we find in
PostgreSQL today, including point in time recovery, hot standby, and
synchronous replication. He was the founder of 2ndQuadrant which
employed many of the PostgreSQL developers, later becoming part of EDB
where he worked as a Postgres Fellow until his retirement. He was
responsible for the UK PostgreSQL conferences for many years until he
passed that responsibility to PostgreSQL Europe last year.
</p>
<p>
Simon’s last community contribution was the presentation of the keynote
at PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2023 in Prague, which you can watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W-J36IxYv4">on YouTube</a>.
</p>
<p>
Simon will be sorely missed by everyone that knew him, and the
PostgreSQL Project offers its deepest sympathies to his family and
friends at this time.

<h2 id="plasma-5-the-early-years">Plasma 5: the early years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>With KDE’s 6th Mega Release finally out the door, let’s reflect on
the outgoing Plasma 5 that has served us well over the years. Can you
believe it has been almost ten years since Plasma 5.0 was released? Join
me on a trip down memory lane and let me tell you how it all began. This
coincidentally continues pretty much where my previous retrospective
blog post concluded. ↫ Kai Uwe It took them a few years after the
release of Plasma 5.0, but eventually they won me over, and I’m now
solid in the KDE camp, after well over a decade of either GNOME or
Cinnamon. GNOME has strayed far too much away from just being a
traditional desktop user interface, and Cinnamon is dragging its heels
with Wayland support, but luckily KDE has spent a long time now clearing
up so many of the paper cuts that used to plague them every time I tried
KDE. That’s all in the past now. They’ve done a solid job cleaning up a
lot of the oddities and inconsistencies during Plasma 5’s lifecycle, and
I can’t wait until Fedora 40 hits the streets with Plasma 6 in tow. In
the desktop Linux world, I feel KDE and Qt will always play a little bit
of second fiddle to the (seemingly) much more popular GNOME and GTK+,
but that’s okay – this kind of diversity and friendly competition is
what makes each of these desktops better for their respective users. And
this is the Linux world, after all – you’re not tied down to anything
your current desktop environment does, and you’re free to switch to
whatever else at a moment’s notice if some new update doesn’t sit well
with you. I can’t imagine using something like macOS or Windows where
you have to just accept whatever garbage they throw at you with nowhere
to go.</p>

expands Long Term Support to 12 years starting with Ubuntu 14.04
LTS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, Canonical announced the general availability of Legacy
Support, an Ubuntu Pro add-on that expands security and support coverage
for Ubuntu LTS releases to 12 years. The add-on will be available for
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onwards.  Long term supported Ubuntu releases get five
years of standard security maintenance on the main Ubuntu repository.
Ubuntu Pro expands that commitment to 10 years on both the main and
universe repositories, providing enterprises and end users alike access
to a vast secure open source software library. The subscription also
comes with a phone and ticket support tier. Ubuntu Pro paying customers
can purchase an extra two years of security maintenance and support with
the new Legacy Support add-on. ↫ Canonical blog Assuming all of this
respects the open source licenses of the countless software packages
that make up Ubuntu, this seems like a reasonable way to offer quite a
long support lifecycle for those that really need it. Such support
doesn’t come free, and it I think it’s entirely reasonable to try and
get compensated for the work required in maintaining that level of
support for 10 or 12 years. If you want this kind of longevity from your
Linux installation without paying for it, you’ll have to maintain it
yourself. Seems reasonable to me.</p>

adapted some bits of the hardware to enable polygon drawing as well.
Hopefully, the result didn’t get out of hand! ↫ Rodrigo Copetti These

<p>I worked for a few years in the intersection between data science and
software engineering. On the whole, it was a really enjoyable time and
I’d like to have the chance to do so again at some point. One of the
least enjoyable experiences from that time was to deal with big CSV
exports. Unfortunately, this file format is still very common in the
data science space. It is easy to understand why — it seems to be
ubiquitous, present everywhere, it’s human-readable, it’s less verbose
than options like JSON and XML, it’s super easy to produce from almost
any tool. What’s not to like? ↫ Robin Kåveland I’m not going to pretend
to be some sort of expert on this matter, but even as a casual it seems
CSV isn’t exactly scalable to large data sets. It seems to work great
for smaller exports and imports for personal use, but any more
complicated matters it seems wholly unsuited for.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/26/maddow.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
don’t usually watch Maddow on Monday nights. I lost my faith in her when
she went after Facebook a few years ago, not that Facebook didn’t
deserve her attention, but her arguments while condemning them were
exaggerated. I knew the facts, she left out important details.
</p>
<p>
She steered viewers into believing things that weren’t true. Didn’t
exactly lie, but pretty close. I figured if she does that for stories I
know, then she’s probably doing it other times when I wasn’t so well
informed.
</p>
<p>
But the
<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/03/25/knicks-donte-divincenzo-franchise-record-pistons-nba/">Knicks</a>
were blowing out the Pistons on the next channel over, and I had tuned
in Jen Psaki, who as luck would have it, at the exact moment I switched,
was explaining how the fact that she served in the Biden Administration
before joining MSNBC was very different from the controversy over Ronna
McDaniel, who Maddow went on to explain was basically a terrorist and
traitor and Trump co-conspirator (not just an enabler), and not in a war
that was over, but one that was still being fought, and not
insignificant because this fascist movement has control of one of the
two major parties in the US and McDaniel was instrumental in that. There
are good arguments that she should be in a prisoner of war camp, not
employed by one of America’s major news networks.
</p>
<p>
That NBC hired McDaniel as a contributor says something awful about
Maddow’s employer. And Maddow, if she has any details on that, isn’t
saying what they are.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/26/cartoonChicken.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I’ve
had this problem with other reporters in the past whose owners were
caught up in some controversy that made them newsworthy. The reporters
refused to cover it, or even be a source for others who were. This is
where journalism goes wrong imho. Maddow <i>should</i> know the details,
and if she does, she is obligated to share them, because they are
significant, and go to how much trust any of us should give to any news
coming to us from NBC. Maybe she has to quit to do that, and if so, go
ahead and quit. Because the shadow it casts over everything touched by
NBC, which includes MSNBC and Maddow is just too freaking long. It’s
similar to the “news” she reported on Facebook, except now instead of
steering us to believe lies, she’s holding it back, and instead of it
being about one very powerful social media company, it’s about the
future of the government of the US. And maybe she doesn’t know, as
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">Upton
Sinclair</a> once said: “It is difficult to get a [person] to understand
something, when [their] salary depends on [them] not understanding it.”
</p>
<p>
I don’t blame Maddow for liking her job. But as a reporter, there are
more and more reasons not to trust her and esp to not trust the company
that employs her. When it was obvious she wasn’t going to tell us the
story behind McDaniel’s hiring, or even name the people responsible for
it, I switched back to the Knicks, where at least I think I understand
who they are and what they’re trying to do.

<p>Have you ever wondered if that video you’re watching, the photo
you’re looking at, or even that person on the other line is the real
deal? Deepfakes aren’t just Hollywood magic anymore-they’re part of our
everyday lives, found in everything from the news we consume to the
memes we share. During this panel, experts dive into the world of
deepfakes to break down the impacts of digital deception and what we can
do about it.</p>

<h2 id="sysv-init-3.09-released">SysV init 3.09 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Most of the Linux world has moved to systemd by now, but there are
still quite a few popular other init systems, too. One of those is the
venerable SysV init, which saw a brand new release yesterday. The
biggest improvement also seems like it’ll enable a match made in heaven:
SysVinit, but with musl. On Linux distributions which use the musl C
library (instead of glibc) we can now build properly. Specifically, the
hddown helper program now builds on musl C systems. ↫ SysVinit 3.09
release notes It’s important init systems like SysV init and runit don’t
just die off or lose steam because of the systemd juggernaut, as
competition, alternatives, and different ideas are what makes open
source what it is.</p>

files, here’s how it works</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Version 1.06 is a more modest release than 1.05 or 1.04. But I think
that’s okay. v1.06 includes one new Application, three new Utilities and
new features and improvements to several existing Apps and Utilities,
and even some new low-level features in the KERNAL and libraries. This
latest release makes use of a combination of all of the above to provide
a handy new feature for users and a potentially powerful and useful
feature for developers, when put to creative uses at a low-level.
Discussions of just this nature have already been spurred on in the
developer forums on the C64 OS Discord server. That feature is: Hidden
Files. ↫ Greg Naçu C64 OS is a marvel of engineering, and what the
developers are managing to squeeze out of the C64 is stunning. This
article delves deep into how hidden files were implemented in the latest
release.</p>

disk formatting UI from 1994 still lives on in Windows 11</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows 11 has done a lot to update and modernize long-neglected
parts of Windows’ user interface, including many Settings menus and
venerable apps like Notepad and Paint. But if you dig deep enough,
you’ll still find parts of the user interface that look and work like
they did in the mid-’90s, either for compatibility reasons or because no
one ever thought to go back and update them. Former Microsoft programmer
Dave Plummer shared some history about one of those finely aged bits:
the Format dialogue box, which is still used in fully updated Windows 11
installs to this day when you format a disk using Windows Explorer. ↫
Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica There’s a lot of old stuff left inside
Windows, which is basically a layer cake of various user interface
themes Microsoft fancied over the years. I delved into the history of
another old Windows program 9 years ago: the Character Map.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Meta posting is fun. I love to blog about blogging. My brain enjoys a good recursion. One thing I don’t do is write about writing. That’s because I don’t think I’m a good writer. As I wrote before, &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/i-am-not-a-writer&quot;&gt;I don’t even think I am a writer&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, I write, but that doesn’t make me a writer.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I do love when people write about writing. I’m enjoying reading Ratika’s
<a href="https://kadambari.bearblog.dev/blog/">series/book/in-progress-digital-project</a>—<a href="https://ko-fi.com/ratikadeshpande">support
if you can</a>—and I appreciate when people write and share more about
their creative processes. It’s fun to see how other people’s brains
work.
</p>
<p>
That said though, <a href="https://www.conscienceround.com">someone</a>
emailed me earlier today asking if I knew other people—or other online
places—where writers write about writing. Unfortunately, I don’t but I’m
sure some of you out there do so I’m gonna use this space to bounce the
questions to you:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
do you know any personal blogs about writing and by writers?

</blockquote>

about the topic of writing but they do contain posts on the subject.

which btw I have not read. This was emphatically not Game of Thrones,
though some of the actors played roles in both series, and in each case
that was awkward. Not the best actors, they didn’t get much screentime
in GoT, but here, they get the big lines and omg it was embarrassing,
they don’t pull it off. Creepy. I loved the first four episodes,
incredible story, and the special effects, awesome. Then it really
started to stink in episodes in 6 and 7, endless stupid dialog with
music that made every stupid thing like a climax of a sort. But I was
still watching, and then it came back roaring in the final episode. On
the other hand it’s like so much of today’s TV, superheros, epic
conflicts, resolution, good guys win. A cross between

opens non-compliance investigations against Alphabet, Apple and Meta
under the Digital Markets Act</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>It turns out Apple, Facebook, and Google were not as clever with
their malicious compliance with the European Union’s DMA as they thought
they were, as the European Commission has opened investigations into
their compliance plans. Especially Apple, who has been most public about
its malicious compliance, seems to be the target. Today, the Commission
has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act
(DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and
self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App
Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s “pay or consent
model”. The Commission suspects that the measures put in place by these
gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations
under the DMA. In addition, the Commission has launched investigatory
steps relating to Apple’s new fee structure for alternative app stores
and Amazon’s ranking practices on its marketplace. Finally, the
Commission has ordered gatekeepers to retain certain documents to
monitor the effective implementation and compliance with their
obligations. ↫ European Commission press release This is entirely
unsurprising. Google’s and Facebook’s compliance plans were less
scrutinised in the press, but all still raised questions about whether
they would pass mustard. Apple’s plans, meanwhile, were universally seen
as deeply malicious and not compliant, and it seems the European
Commission agrees. Apple’s continuous wild, flailing attacks on the EU
and the DMA certainly aren’t helping, either. There’s no denying Apple’s
behaviour has been deeply unprofessional and anti-European Union, which
contrasts strongly with how Apple and Tim Cook operate in China, where
they face much stricter rules than they do in the EU. Tim Cook is
currently in China praising and buttering up to the Chinese totalitarian
regime, while the company has been attacking the European Union and DMA
almost non-stop for months now. It really shows where Apple’s priorities
lie. Meanwhile, Facebook’s pay-for-privacy model was always going to be
a hard sell at €10 a month, and as such, the company already announced
it was going to cut that cost in half. Google’s plans are a bit more
nebulous, since it’s a bit more difficult to see tangible results from
things like search rankings, but it seems here, too, the European
Commission has its worries about compliance. The European Commission
intends to complete its investigations within a year, and if found in
violation of the law, companies can be fined for up to 10% of their
worldwide turnover, which can grow up to 20% for repeated
infringements.</p>

id="floorp-firefox-fork-makes-its-modifications-closed-source-due-to-forks">Floorp
Firefox fork makes its modifications closed source due to forks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Update: a short notice on the blog post now reads that “Floorp’s code
is now fully public again.” It seems the developer has reversed course,
which is good news. The original article continues below. Recently, a
few people suggested I give the browser Floorp a try, a Firefox fork
with some additional UI changes and additions. Since it was based on
Firefox ESR, however, I saw no point in even trying it, because I prefer
to be on the latest Firefox release. It seems I accidentally made the
right choice, since yesterday the developers behind Floorp decided to
take their modifications closed source. The appearance of Floorp forks –
which, may I remind you, is a fork itself – seems to be the cause. I
know it’s not nice of me to say, but Floorp has been in too much demand.
It am surprise to me that companies and organizations would fork a fork
that I had created when I was still a teenager, and at first I was happy
about it, but it was not beneficial to me, and on the contrary, it was
mentally draining. There were forks that wanted to hide the fact that
they were Floorp forks, forks that did not want to contribute to Floorp
at all, forks that used the code for life and just changed the name of
Floorp, and many other forks were born. ↫ Floorp blog It seems the
developer of Floorp is rather young, and started the project as a
teenager, and as such, I don’t think we should be too harsh on them – I
did some dumb things as a teenager – but complaining about forks of your
own fork seems a bit disingenuous, regardless of how young and
inexperienced you are. I understand seeing your work forked into
competing browsers can be frustrating, but it’s a core part of the open
source world, especially if you yourself owe your product to forking,
too.</p>

<p>
After <a href="2024-03-23-camellias">visiting the Camellia park</a>, we
took the boat the <a href="https://www.isoledibrissago.ti.ch/">Brissago
Islands</a>. One of them has an old villa previously owned by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Emden">some rich dude</a> but
now owned by the canton and turned into a restaurant, a hotel and the
island itself turned into a botanical garden.
</p>
<p>
Towards the end you can spot me sleeping on a park bench. Yay me!
</p>
<p>
Obviously I did not take that picture. Somebody knows the access code to
my phone! 🕵️
</p>
<p>
This pond had fantastic frogs.

Behind those walls is a tiny “Roman” pool. We’ll come to it towards the
end.

And on the last day, we went for a walk into the Bolle di Magadino, some
wetlands at the east end of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Maggiore">Lago Maggiore</a>.
</p>
<p>
The walk was very short but we saw a lot of frogs and heard a lot of
birds. Sadly, these pages are silent.

Originally presented at VCF SoCal in February of 2024.
</p>
<p>
The cryotron, a superconductive switch, almost revolutionized computing.
It’s one of those fascinating near misses. In this episode we are
talking about the history of the cryotron, how the NSA and
supercomputing factors into the mix, and the current state of research
into the topic. Did the NSA actually construct a supercomputer that ran
in a vat of liquid helium? The answer is… maybe?

still love reading
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/24/myblogrollpost.png">my
own stuff</a> in the blogroll. Learning how to make stuff look good in a
tiny little format like that. I don’t mind having a small space to
deploy in, but I like to have lots of room where I write. Linkblogs and
blogrolls go together really well. Blogrolls work best for smaller
groups of people and projects, not the huge number of followers people
have on the twitter-like social web. But I think even a few hundred
items in a blogroll work, as long as it’s dynamic, and it’s reverse
chronologic.</p>

<p>Never thought I’d be so glad to see the
<a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xml-rpc site</a> back up and running. I
found out about it being off by someone sending an email asking if they
could buy the domain from me. Otherwise I’m not sure I would have
noticed. The whole idea is to put these static sites in a safe place and
forget about it. But clearly there are no safe places and someday you
might get dragged back to try to debug some work you did a bunch of
years ago.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and moved
<a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xmlrpc.com</a> to a HTTPS server. The
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/22/031933.html">other day</a> I
forgot to mention that style sheets might not be readable when you move
from HTTP to HTTPS, leading to
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/24/httpsBreaksSitesThanksGoogle.png">this
striking breakage</a> I saw when I first got to look at the site in its
new location. And now thanks to Google and the EFF, I get to spend time
debugging something that worked just fine in 1998 and every year since
then. Should I send them the bill for my time? Fuckers.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>For the past week I have been configuring hyprland and using it as my
daily driver. Coming from major Desktop Environments like KDE or Gnome,
this was definitely quite challanging, specially when implementing
features that we take it for granted on these DEs, like screen sharing
or screenshot annotating. In this post I will be going through all the
tools and scripts I have been creating to configure this amazing Window
Manager to my liking. ↫ xd1.dev Like I mentioned in my MNT Reform
review, I’m not a fan of these “build your own desktop environment”
window managers and related tools, but there’s no denying they’re quite
popular. This article is a good introduction to hyprland, one of the
more popular window managers of this genre.</p>

<h2 id="the-mind-khadas-a-modular-pc">The Mind Khadas: a modular PC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I saw this on a Linus Tech Tips video today, and it’s pretty neat:
the Khadas Mind is a tiny computer powered by an Intel Core i5-1340P or
Core i7-1360P, but it has a souped-up PCIe connector at the bottom that
allows you to hook it up to all kinds of other devices, like a graphics
card, a dock, and so on. It looks slick and quite user-friendly, and
according to the LTT video, the company intends to release the specs for
the connector so that third parties can hook into it as well, but a
promise is just that – a promise. It’s way too early to tell if this
will go anywhere – past attempts would suggest that sadly, it won’t –
but that doesn’t mean it’s not an incredibly awesome and seemingly
workable implementation of the modular PC idea.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-24, updated: 2024-03-24, from: Newsboat News</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;
            Another quarter, another Newsboat release!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
    The highlight for this one is Feedbin support. Feedbin is an
    online newsreading service in the vein of Google Reader, and we
    already support a bunch of similar ones. The feature request
            for Feedbin specifically was filed 4 years ago, and upvoted
    19 times — twice more often than the runner-up, a request for
    separators between groups of feeds. We‘ve been waiting for an
    interested person to tackle this, and finally James Vaughan
            showed up with a complete implementation. Please give it a spin
    if you‘ve been waiting for this functionality all these years,
            and thanks for your patience!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
    Another notable feature is support for item starring with
    Miniflux. This was on the to-do list for a while too, and was
    implemented by gilcu3. Interestingly, both of these are first
    ever contributions; it‘s very nice to see new faces in
            Newsboat‘s pull requests!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
    There‘s also a few new scripts in the contrib directory, and
    loads of internal reworking by Dennis van der Schagt and others.
    Probably some new bugs too, but Juho Eerola fixed one in 2.35,
            so let‘s call it even, ok?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Well, enough chatter; go grab the source:
            &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsboat.org/releases/2.35/newsboat-2.35.tar.xz&quot;&gt;tarball&lt;/a&gt;,

            &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsboat.org/releases/2.35/docs/newsboat.html&quot;&gt;the docs&lt;/a&gt;, and
            &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#235---2024-03-24&quot;&gt;the changelog&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2
id="digital-wallets-and-the-only-apple-pay-does-this-mythology-1">Digital
wallets and the “only Apple Pay does this” mythology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I hope what you take away from this post is that while Apple Pay is a
great way to pay for things and that Apple did a great job mainstreaming
digital wallets like this, what they do is not unique in the industry.
DPANs are great for making it harder to track one person’s purchases
across multiple merchants and they make customers less at risk in the
event of a data breach of payment card info. ↫ Matt Birchler The gist of
the article is that all the things Apple claims are unique about Apple
Pay are really not unique at all, and quite a few things Apple touts are
just flat-out lies, such as merchants being unable to know what you buy
or people being unable to track you when you use Apple Pay. Other
digital wallets, from Google, Samsung, and others, work in the exact
same way Apple Pay does, and even banks and similar companies implement
their payment systems the way Apple Pay does. It’s a case study in how
Apple’s marketing and PR bloggers manage to perpetuate a myth solely
because so many people just assume it must be true. Apple wouldn’t lie,
right?</p>

I have followed the Palestinian struggle since about 2000 and read every
book I could on the subject.

<p>
But TikTok has really made this knowledge accessible to the public. The
TikTokers know how to explain in small bursts like nothing I have seen
before.

a site that I use to test feeds. Also
<a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">xmlrpc.com</a>. It’s possible that
something broke overnight in my server. Or Digital Ocean is having a
problem? Doesn’t seem like it’s something Google is doing to punish me
for using HTTP, though that is always the first thing that comes to
mind. I tried moving the XML-RPC site to a different server, but the
problem follows it. No changes have been made to the site in years. Not
exactly what I had planned to be digging into on a nice (but cold)
Sunday morning in the mountains. I started a

id="another-day-another-paean-of-praise-for-the-amigas-1980s-pre-emptive-multitasking-gui">Another
day, another paean of praise for the Amiga’s 1980s pre-emptive
multitasking GUI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<div>
Yes, the Amiga offered a GUI with pre-emptive multitasking, as early as
1985 or so. And it was affordable: you didn’t even need a hard
disk.<br /><span class="commtext c00">
<p>
The thing is, that’s only part of the story.
</p>
<p>
There’s a generation of techies who are about 40 now who don’t remember
this stuff well, and some of the older ones have forgotten with time but
don’t realise. I had some greybeard angrily telling me that floppy
drives were IDE recently. Senile idiot.
</p>
<p>
Anyway.
</p>
<p>
Preemptive multitasking is only part of the story. Lots of systems had
it. Windows <i>2.0</i> could do preemptive multitasking – but only of
DOS apps, and only in the base 640kB of RAM, so it was pretty useless.
</p>
<p>
It sounds good but it’s not. Because the other key ingredient is memory
protection. You need both, together, to have a compelling deal. Amiga
and Windows 2.x/3.x only had the preemption part, they had no hardware
memory management or protection to go with it. (Windows 3.x <i>when
running on a 386</i> and also <i>when given &gt;2MB RAM</i> could do
some, for DOS apps, but not much.)
</p>
<p>
Having multiple pre-emptive tasks is relatively easy if they are all in
the same memory space, but it’s horribly horribly unstable.
</p>
<p>
Also see: microkernels. In size terms, AmigaOS was a microkernel, but a
microkernel without memory protection is not such a big deal, because
the hard part of a microkernel is the interprocess communication, and if
they can just do that by reading and writing each other’s RAM it’s
trivially easy but also trivially insecure and trivially unstable.
</p>
<p>
RISC OS had pre-emptive multitasking too… but only of text-only
command-line windows, and there were few CLI RISC OS apps so it was
mostly useless. At least on 16-bit Windows there were lots of DOS apps
so it was vaguely useful, if they’d fit into memory. Which only trivial
ones would. Windows 3 came along very late in the DOS era, and by then,
most DOS apps didn’t fit into memory <i>on their own</i> one at a time.
I made good money optimising DOS memory around 1990-1992 because I was
very good at it and without it most DOS apps didn’t fit into 500-550kB
any more. So two of them in 640kB? Forget it.
</p>
<p>
Preemption is clever. It lets apps that weren’t designed to multitask do
it.
</p>
<p>
But it’s also <i>slow</i>. Which is <i>why</i> RISC OS didn’t do it.
Co-op is much quicker which is also why OSes like RISC OS and 16-bit
Windows chose it for their GUI apps: because GUI apps strained the
resources of late-1980s/very-early-1990s computers. So you had 2
choices:
</p>
<p>
• The Mac and GEM way: don’t multitask at all.
</p>
<p>
• The 16-bit Windows and RISC OS way: multitask cooperatively, and hope
nothing goes wrong.
</p>
<p>
Later, notably, MacOS 7-8-9 and Falcon MultiTOS/MiNT/MagiC etc added
coop multitasking to single-tasking GUI OSes. I used MacOS 8.x and 9.x
<i>a lot</i> and I really liked them. They were extraordinarily usable
to an extent Mac OS X has never and will never catch up with.
</p>
<p>
But the good thing about owning a Mac in the 1990s was that at least one
thing in your life was guaranteed to go down on you every single day.

Gidget’s inherited a lovely little blanket from an elderly family friend
of Viv’s whose beloved cat recently passed away. She said Gidget had
better appreciate it because “it was very special to Sooty”. Thankfully,
she does 😸
