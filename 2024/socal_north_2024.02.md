## Shohei Ohtani’s Record Dodgers Contract — And Deferrals — Has California Officials Talking Tax Reform

date: 2024-01-09, updated: 2024-01-09, from: The LAist

Ohtani’s 10-year contract pays him only $2 million a year, deferring $680 million until after his time with the Dodgers — and possibly his California residency — is over. If Ohtani collects that money after returning to his native Japan, California would lose an estimated $98 million in tax revenue from him.
