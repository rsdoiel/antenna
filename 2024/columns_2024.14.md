## Why Corporations Fail to Protect Our Data

date: 2024-04-01, from: Om Malik blog

Almost nine years ago, when both T-Mobile and Experian were hacked, I wrote an&#160;article for The New&#160;Yorker. I argued&#160;that the companies&#160;wouldn’t&#160;learn anything from the mess created by these data and privacy breaches. As&#160;a&#160;result,&#160;we,&#160;the&#160;citizens,&#160;are&#160;now simply&#160;Data Piñatas. Consumers have become data piñatas &#8211; hacked, tracked and abused by everyone from hackers, governments, and worse of them all, &#8230;

## Ross Anderson

date: 2024-04-01, updated: 2024-04-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/">Ross Anderson</a> unexpectedly passed away <a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2024/03/29/rip-ross-anderson/">Thursday night</a> in, I believe, his home in Cambridge.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember when I first met Ross. Of course it was before 2008, when we created the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/security-and-human-behavior-shb-2023.html">Security and Human Behavior</a> workshop. It was well before 2001, when we created the <a href="https://econinfosec.org/">Workshop on Economics and Information Security</a>. (Okay, he created both&#8212;I helped.) It was before 1998, when we <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1997/04/the_risks_of_key_rec.html">wrote about</a> the problems with key escrow systems. I was one of the people he brought to the Newton Institute, at Cambridge University, for the six-month cryptography residency program he ran (I mistakenly didn&#8217;t stay the whole time)&#8212;that was in 1996...</p>

## Obsessions vs Hobbies

date: 2024-04-01, from: Om Malik blog

hobby: a pursuit outside one&#8217;s regular occupation engaged in especially for relaxation obsession: a persistent disturbing preoccupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling Sunday is my day for hobbies. I am either editing photos and putting together a collection to share, or engaging with another hobby of mine: fountain pens. At the start of &#8230;

Whitegate As regular readers will know, I am trying to re-learn the art of black-and-white photography, after years and years of working in colour. B&#38;W requires one to ‘see’ things differently — to look for structure, contrast, subtle changes in &#8230; <a href="https://memex.naughtons.org/monday-1-april-2024/39303/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>
