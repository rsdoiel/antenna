Roach: A True Triple Wild Horse Heroine</h2>

<h1>
Dr. Annie Roach: A True Triple Wild Horse Heroine
</h1>
</div>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;field contact-block -body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annie Roach grew up in Reno, Nevada in the shadow of the Sierra Nevada mountains. She loved to watch the wild horses running freely on the range near her childhood home, the very same horses whose forebears inspired the grass roots campaign that achieved federal protection for them and free roaming burros in 1971. Though Dr. Roach was born many years after her death, Velma Johnston, the Reno woman nicknamed “Wild Horse Annie” for galvanizing a nation to push for the protection of these beloved icons, would have been very proud to know her.  &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Roach grew up with a love of horses and was an avid youth competitor in
hunter jumper shows along the west coast. She always planned to be a
veterinarian, so after finishing undergraduate studies at the University
of California, Davis, Roach moved to Colorado to complete her master’s
degree in Assisted Reproductive Technologies. It was while living in
Fort Collins that Roach met her future husband, Zach, and they soon
relocated to his home state of Minnesota so that Annie could pursue her
veterinary degree.  
</p>
<p>
As busy as she was with school and her upcoming marriage, Roach found
she missed the simple joy of having her own equine partner. She decided
that the perfect complement to her life would be a nice trail horse.
Once the decision was made to add an equine family member, the choice
seemed obvious, and she began looking into adopting a wild horse like
the ones she grew up admiring. “I guess it was inevitable,” she said
with a laugh.  “I grew up my whole life watching those beautiful horses
on the range, and it seemed only fitting that I finally own one.” 
</p>
<p>
A gorgeous black mare available for adoption through the TIP (Trainer
Incentive Program) caught her eye.  The mare was located in South
Dakota, and Annie convinced her new husband (as in BRAND new – they were
driving home to Minnesota after their wedding in California!), to make a
short segue off the freeway to meet her potential new partner. Roach
took one look at the mare she would name Willow and a love affair was
born.  The rest, as they say, was history. 
</p>
<p>
After bringing five-year-old Willow home to Minnesota, Roach sent her to
a nearby trainer to be started under saddle, and soon Willow was the
trusted trail horse and partner that Annie had dreamed of.  
</p>
<p>
After her graduation from vet school, Roach and her husband moved to
Idaho for her internship at Idaho Equine Hospital in Nampa.  While
working at Idaho Equine, Annie developed a close friendship with one of
her mentors, Dr. Liz Scott, and the two discovered their mutual love of
the American wild horse.  Dr. Scott is one of the veterinarians charged
with overseeing the health of equines housed at the Bureau of Land
Management’s Boise Off-Range Wild Horse Corral, and a staunch advocate
for the horses and burros protected under the 1971 Wild Free-Roaming
Horse and Burro Act.
</p>
<p>
Roach and her husband fell in love with the Boise area and made the
decision to settle in the Treasure Valley after her internship was
completed. They eventually added another wild horse to their family with
the adoption of a pretty palomino mare, Peach.  Peach was a competitor
in the 2022 Mustang Mania Under-Saddle Competition with local trainer
Emily Hickey. Under Hickey’s guidance, Peach was named the winner of the
competition and Annie and Zach knew she’d be the perfect companion to
accompany them and Willow as they explored  the trails around their new
home.  <br>  <br> When Willow came down with colic in September 2023, no
thought was required about who would provide the mare’s emergency
medical care; she was rushed to Idaho Equine Hospital, and when the
situation was unable to be resolved medically, Dr. Pete Knox performed
life-saving surgery. The surgical intervention was successful, but
Willow’s recovery was a long process, fraught with many challenges that
required frequent follow-up appointments at the clinic.  
</p>
<p>
It was during one of those appointments that Roach was introduced to two
young foals that had been brought to the hospital for additional care
following Idaho’s Black Mountain, Hardtrigger and Sands Basin wild horse
gather.  The chestnut fillies were being looked after by Dr. Scott, and
Scott’s veterinary technician Cassidy, a close friend of Annie, who
broached the idea of her fostering one of the foals.

<p>
“Cassidy approached me and asked if I would be willing to take one of
the little ones home to care for her until she was old enough to be
weaned and adopted out to a good home. I knew the commitment it would
take to care for a foal that young, especially with her needing to be
fed every four hours, so I did “ask” (air quotes from Roach herself) my
husband if it would be OK. He is used to being married to a vet though,
so I don’t think he was super surprised,” she said with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
Before long the request turned to the fostering of both foals, and as
Roach recounted, “The answer was, well, if I’m going to care for one, I
might as well have two!” The babies moved to Roach’s home in Eagle where
they were good company for the recuperating Willow, who was confined to
a small pen as she recovered from her illness and the complications she
experienced after surgery. 
</p>
<p>
It was during a subsequent follow-up visit for Willow at Idaho Equine
that Roach learned there was a third foal at the clinic that needed
help. A young paint colt had been brought in to ensure he received some
extra attention.  This new foal also needed a foster home until he was
old enough to be adopted, and when Dr. Scott mentioned the baby to
Roach, she felt it was only right to add him to her nursery. The two
chestnut fillies were joined by their new brother, Lemon, about a week
after they settled into their Eagle foster home.

<p>
Providing the daily around the clock care required by these foals wasn’t
possible for Roach to do alone, so she gratefully accepted help from a
group of veterinary technician friends who took shifts caring for the
youngsters during times when she could not be there. “I was so lucky to
be able to count on my group of friends who volunteered to help with the
feeding and monitoring of my little charges,” she recounted.  “It truly
took a village, and I would not have been able to do it without them.”  
</p>
<p>
At first all of the babies seemed to thrive, but within days the paint
colt started to show signs of distress. “Lemon didn’t adjust well to the
feeding at first,” Roach explained.  “He got behind nutritionally, and
one manifestation of his health problems was an extreme
photosensitivity, or adverse reaction to sunlight. He lost his hair in
patches wherever the sunlight hit him, and he also developed kidney
problems that required treatment back at the equine hospital.  He was a
very sick little guy, and we were so fortunate to have a talented team
that refused to give up on him,” she said. 
</p>
<p>
Once the foal had recovered enough to leave the hospital for the second
time, he rejoined his adopted siblings, but with one big change.  “Lemon
had to wear a full-body jacket when he came home to keep the sun off the
patches where his hair was growing back. He was so cute, all decked out
in his own baby horse clothes,” she said with a laugh.  Happily, Lemon
made a full recovery after his initial setback and has overtaken his
sisters in both height and weight since he regained his health. 
</p>
<p>
We visited the Roach’s idyllic Eagle property to meet the babies and
hear the incredible story of the loving care that has gone into raising
them. The beautiful, obviously healthy trio lives in a large paddock
featuring a shelter brimming with straw and fresh hay and plenty of room
to run. They share their lovely oasis with two exuberant dogs and a
variety of chickens and geese. 
</p>
<p>
It was immediately obvious that the young horses were well-socialized;
they approached us for scratches and pats as soon as we entered their
pasture. Dr. Roach explained, however, that the foals were raised
carefully to ensure they didn’t associate their human caretakers with
actual mother figures.  Foals often test the environment and their
boundaries by playfully biting and kicking their friends and their horse
mamas, a behavior that can quickly become dangerous to human caretakers
as the babies grow to their mature size and weight of 1,000 pounds or
more.  “We were careful to feed them from buckets hung on the fence
rather than hand-feeding with an actual bottle,” she explained.  “As
anyone who has raised a foal at home knows, these little guys can get
pretty demanding with their dams when they are hungry. I didn’t want to
take a chance with anyone’s safety as they grew and became more
habituated to their feeding schedules.”  
</p>
<p>
The foals were a true testament to the horsemanship that has shaped
their young lives. Annie fitted them each in matching blue halters and
we took them out for a stroll around her bucolic property. They were as
obedient as any toddler in a new environment can possibly be, with a
healthy dose of playfulness and inquisitiveness thrown in just to prove
they were still babies. 
</p>
<p>
At the completion of our field trip, we had to ask the obvious question:
what’s next for the adorable trio? Annie laughed, “Welllllll, Zach and I
haven’t really talked about it yet, but I’d like to keep one of them.”
Which one? She ruffled the fuzzy forelock of the bald-faced chestnut
filly she named Juniper and calls Junie for short. “Probably this one,”
she said with a smile. “I love them all, but this little girl is really
special to me.” The blaze-faced filly Aspen and the leggy paint colt
Lemon looked on, seemingly unperturbed at not being Roach’s first
choice. “We will definitely make sure they go to good homes, and I know
they will make really nice horses for someone,” she said. “I can’t wait
to watch them go on and do great things.”

<h2 id="blm-plans-prescribed-burn-at-lathrop-bayou">BLM plans prescribed
burn at Lathrop Bayou</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog</p>
<div class="field contact-block -title">
<h1>
BLM plans prescribed burn at Lathrop Bayou
</h1>
</div>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;field contact-block -body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FALLS CHURCH, Va. –&lt;/strong&gt; The Bureau of Land Management plans to conduct a prescribed burn at Lathrop Bayou, located in Bay County, Florida east of Tyndall Air Force Base in East Bay, as weather and fuel conditions allow. The fuels treatment, slated for the week of Feb. 5, 2024, will remove vegetative material that contributes to the severity of potential wildfires and improve the health of fire-adapted habitats for wildlife and people.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
In close collaboration with state and federal partners, BLM will apply
fire to approximately 561 acres on four islands in Lathrop Bayou as well
as on adjacent private lands. The last burn at Lathrop Bayou occurred in
2020, and damage from extreme weather, including hurricanes and tropical
storms, has added additional fuels to the area.
</p>
<p>
Lathrop Bayou’s longleaf and slash pine ecosystem requires fire to be
healthy. The fire prescription will reduce ground fuel vegetation (e.g.,
leaves, pine needles, and logs) and improve habitat conditions for
imperiled plants and animals such as the endangered red-cockaded
woodpecker and several threatened plants, including the Florida skullcap
and white-birds-in-a-nest wildflower. The ideal fire regime to maintain
a healthy pine ecosystem occurs about every 2-4 years.
</p>
<p>
Fully trained and experienced prescribed fire applicators from the BLM
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will conduct the burn. The fire will
be lit aerially with ground support, containment will be achievable due
to presence of surrounding water bodies. Ground and boat crews will also
be onsite to monitor the progress of the fire. 
</p>
<p>
Smoke from the prescribed burn may be visible throughout the day of the
burn, mostly during the warmest part of the day. With cooler
temperatures in the evening, smoke may linger and accumulate in
low-lying areas. Firefighters will be on site throughout the day of
ignition and may periodically patrol the burn for several days afterward
if conditions require.
</p>
<p>
To help protect public health and safety, the BLM plans to conduct the
prescribed burn under wind and weather conditions that minimize smoke
and ash impacts to nearby towns and roads. Smoke emissions will be
managed in accordance with the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection regulations.
</p>
<p>
Fire is a natural and an important ecological force in Florida.
Prescribed burns help reduce wildfire risk by thinning trees and brush
and creating fuel breaks, which lessens wildfire severity and slows fire
spread. Fire also helps to create various stages of plant succession,
which is critical to the health of fire-adapted ecosystems. Plants and
animals benefit as well. Native wildlife is adapted to and depend on
periodic fire for survival.
</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;field contact-block -body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEEDLES, Calif. – The Bureau of Land Management is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to justice for the ongoing investigation of the shooting and killing of 19 wild burros. The animals were found along Interstate 15 between Baker, California and Primm, Nevada on August 13, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
BLM law enforcement identified two vehicles of interest and want to
speak with the owners of a gray or silver 2008 Toyota extended cab
pickup with flared fenders and a brush guard, and a white 2008 Toyota
extended cab pickup with a white camper shell, white rims, sunroof, and
brush guard. Video surveillance captured both vehicles traveling
together and last seen in Primm, Nevada, on August 13, 2019, at
approximately 06:32 a.m., in the parking lot of Whiskey Pete’s Hotel and
Casino. Actual images of both vehicles and the crime scene are below.

BLM special agents identified the weapon used to kill the wild burros as
a .30-06 caliber rifle, possibly vintage based on the rifling of the
projectiles recovered, that could have been manufactured by Browning,
Remington, Springfield, U.S. Military Arms, or Winchester. The rifle is
chambered for .30-06 Springfield ammunition.  Special agents also
believe the person or persons responsible used reloaded ammunition
marked with red/orange paint on the bottom of their cartridges.

<b>ARCATA, Calif.</b> – The Bureau of Land Management is contributing to
an immersive experience and time-honored Tribal tradition along
California’s North Coast.
</p>
<p>
The BLM and two timber companies partnered to provide the Bear River
Band of Rohnerville Rancheria a downed redwood tree from public lands so
the Tribe can build a traditional dance house and living quarter. Tribal
members at the Tish Non Village Community Center near Loleta will use
the buildings to share experiences of their ancestors dating back to
time immemorial.

“We are so proud to support Native cultural practitioners who collect
forest resources for traditional uses and look forward to seeing this
locally-led conservation project develop,” said <strong>BLM Arcata Field
Office Assistant Manager Jennifer Wheeler.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to be a community thing, revitalizing our culture and
revitalizing our community,” said <strong>Edward “Gusto” Bowie, Tribal
council member at large for the Bear River Band</strong>. “It is a
healing process. Our goal is to have these houses built up and down the
coast, just as it used to be.”

BLM archaeologist Sharyl Kinnear Ferris worked with Bowie to select a
segment of downed redwood tree from public lands in the Salmon Pass area
of the
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/california/headwaters-forest-reserve">Headwaters
Forest Reserve</a> near Fortuna. Leonardo Logging owner Dave Carter
volunteered his time and expertise to load and haul the massive log to
Loleta using equipment provided by Humboldt Redwood Company. Members of
the Tribe will split and slowly dry the wood before cutting and building
with it.
</p>
<p>
Headwaters Forest Reserve was established in 1999, after the BLM and
<a href="https://wcb.ca.gov/">California State Wildlife Conservation
Board</a> purchased the 7,400-acre Headwaters Forest for public
ownership. The BLM and <a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/">California
Department of Fish and Wildlife</a> collaborate to protect old growth
redwoods, forest stands, streams, and wildlife in the reserve.
