Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1028 AM CST Fri Mar 01 2024

Valid 011630Z - 021200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast today. Scattered storms are
most likely over the Southeast, and along northern parts of the West
Coast.

...Southeast...
A progressive upper trough will track across the OH Valley and Great
Lakes regions today, with the associated surface cold front sweeping
eastward across the Gulf Coast states.  Scattered thunderstorms will
occur ahead of the front through the day and into tonight.  There is
some potential for a more robust storm or two this afternoon and
evening from southeast LA into the FL panhandle, where a marginally
unstable surface air mass spreads onshore.  However, current
indications are that storms will remain below severe limits.

...Northwestern States..
Other isolated thunderstorms are expected through the forecast
period along the Pacific Northwest Coast and coastal ranges and
strong onshore flow and cold temperatures aloft enhance the
convective threat.  Finally, a few thunderstorms may occur over
portions of ID as an upper trough digs into the western states.  No
severe storms are expected in either of these regions.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1023 AM CST Fri Mar 01 2024

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Recent precipitation
accumulations across the TX Panhandle vicinity will limit
wildfire-spread potential today to some degree. However, the
anticipated dry and breezy conditions this afternoon will encourage
the priming of fuels, which may support significant wildfire-spread
potential this weekend.

..Squitieri.. 03/01/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CST Fri Mar 01 2024/

...Synopsis...
Preceding a large-scale trough moving ashore over the West Coast,
strengthening west-southwesterly midlevel flow will impinge on the
Rockies, favoring a deepening lee trough over the High Plains. This
pattern will favor a few areas of dry/breezy conditions along the
High Plains during the afternoon. Over portions of eastern WY into
western SD/NE, a belt of breezy west-southwesterly surface winds
will develop along the southern periphery of a weak lee cyclone, and
these winds could briefly overlap 20-30 percent afternoon RH. While
locally elevated conditions are possible here, the overlap of breezy
winds and low RH appears too brief/marginal for highlights given
marginally receptive fuels. 

Farther south, breezy/gusty westerly surface winds are expected to
coincide with 10-15 percent minimum RH along the central and
southern High Plains. For the central High Plains, locally elevated
conditions are possible along the I-25 corridor (especially in the
gap-flow areas), though these conditions should remain too localized
for Elevated highlights. From eastern NM into West TX, a larger area
of Elevated meteorological conditions are expected, though recent
measurable snowfall should mitigate the fire-weather threat in the
short-term -- precluding highlights at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0650 AM CST Fri Mar 01 2024

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast today. Scattered storms are
most likely over the Southeast, and along northern parts of the West
Coast.

...Discussion...
As an upper trough continues to depart the Northeast, a temporarily
lower-amplitude/rather zonal flow field over the U.S. will gradually
begin to reamplify.  This will occur primarily with respect to a
deep upper low off the British Columbia coast, that will drift
slowly southeastward.  As this occurs, the broader cyclonic flow
field surrounding the low will expand/amplify across the West.

With persistent moist/westerly upslope flow into the higher
elevations of the West resulting from the slow southward drift of
this upper system, lightning potential will likewise continue,
particularly across western portions of Washington and Oregon and
into northern and central California.

Meanwhile, showers and scattered/elevated thunderstorms continue
across the central Gulf Coast states, in advance of a
southern-stream short-wave trough.  As the system advances eastward
today, thunder potential will likewise spread across the Southeast
through the end of the period.  In all areas, severe weather remains
unlikely.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 AM CST Thu Feb 29 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
A weak upper low over the southern Plains will continue eastward
Friday with strong flow aloft trailing behind it over the southern
Rockies/High Plains. At the same time a second Pacific trough will
begin to move onshore with strong southwest flow. In the wake of the
upper low, surface winds across the West should begin to slowly
increase in response to the stronger flow aloft. Periods of dry and
breezy conditions are possible Friday across eastern NM and the TX
Panhandle.

...Eastern NM and the TX Panhandle...
As the upper low over the southern Plains departs, flow aloft will
gradually turn westerly ahead of the advancing Pacific system. Winds
aloft are forecast to gradually strengthen through the day, with
40-50 kt of flow over the southern Rockies likely by the afternoon.
Aided by a deepening lee trough, 15-20 mph of westerly downslope
flow is expected over parts of eastern NM into the western TX
Panhandle. Despite some recent light precipitation, this area has
remained largely devoid of meaningful rain/snow in the past several
weeks. Warm temperatures and downslope drying should continue to
support a very dry air mass with minimum RH values of 15-20% and
poor overnight recoveries. Rapid fuel drying has occurred in the
last few days with unusually warm temperatures and a recent uptick
in fire activity. Widespread elevated to locally critical
fire-weather conditions appear possible Friday afternoon cross parts
of eastern NM and West TX. Localized fire-weather concerns may also
increase farther north across parts of eastern CO, though confidence
in sustained dry and windy conditions here is lower.

Mesoscale Discussion 0176
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0856 AM CST Wed Feb 28 2024

Areas affected...TN Valley to southern Appalachians

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 281456Z - 281700Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Southern portion of a low-topped squall line should
continue eastward across parts of the Tennessee Valley through at
least midday. Strong to localized severe wind gusts capable of
sporadic damage should be the primary threat.

DISCUSSION...The southern portion of a long, but thin, low-topped
(echo tops to around 30k ft) squall line extends as far south as
northeast MS. Large-scale ascent, outside of low-level convergence
attendant to the southeast-moving cold front, will be gradually
weakening across the region into the afternoon. However, a few cloud
breaks noted ahead of the line should yield modest boundary-layer
destabilization. In conjunction with the northeast extent of low 60s
surface dew points, the relatively more favorable thermodynamic
environment should compensate for the diminishing ascent and will
probably sustain the low-topped convective line eastward through at
least midday. This scenario is generally supported by 12Z CAM
guidance. With veered surface and low-level flow, increasing to
40-45 kts at 1 km AGL, the primary threat should be strong to
locally severe surface gusts, peaking in the 50-65 mph range. A
53-kt gust was measured at KMSL at 1437Z.

Mesoscale Discussion 0161
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1012 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024

Areas affected...Eastern CO to northern NE

Concerning...Snow Squall 

Valid 271612Z - 271915Z

SUMMARY...A short-duration moderate to heavy snow band that is
effectively producing sporadic snow squall conditions should spread
east-southeast into early afternoon across parts of eastern Colorado
and northern Nebraska.

DISCUSSION...700-mb frontogenetical forcing for ascent has supported
a narrow band of moderate to heavy snow across a portion of the
Denver Metro Area northeastward into north-central NE, per surface
observations and road cameras. The northeast extent of this band is
well removed from the surface cold front that is marching
south-southeast from IA to north KS and east-central CO. Strong,
post-frontal gradient winds are combining with the narrow snow band
to produce snow squall-like conditions with substantial reduction in
visibility despite the mesoanalysis snow squall parameter holding
less than 0.1. The stronger 700-mb frontogenesis is largely expected
to shift east in NE and gradually weaken while shifting southeast in
eastern CO. This may yield breaks in the ongoing thin band, a
scenario supported by recent RRFS guidance.

Mesoscale Discussion 0160
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0845 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024

Areas affected...Northwest to north-central MN and southeast ND

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 271445Z - 271845Z

SUMMARY...A band of persistent heavy snow with 1-2 inch/hour rates
will shift northeast across northwest and north-central Minnesota
into northwest Ontario. Near-blizzard to blizzard conditions should
continue in its wake where light to moderate snow occurs, mainly
across the Red River Valley.

DISCUSSION...Based on observed snow reports and imagery, a band of
heavy snow is ongoing from the Fargo-Moorhead vicinity northeastward
across northwest MN. This heavy snow band aligns well with 700-mb
frontogenesis and is expected to shift northeast across
north-central MN into northwest Ontario through midday. Meanwhile,
strong to severe gradient winds (gust to 51 kts measured at KFAR)
near and to the backside of this heavy snow band has yielded several
obs with visibility of a half-mile or less. The bulk of the tighter
surface pressure gradient and low-level flow should generally shift
east into the afternoon, suggesting the more persistent
near-blizzard to blizzard conditions should be favored over the Red
River Valley and parts of northwest MN.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast the rest of tonight.

...01z Update...

Northwesterly flow is deepening across the Carolinas this evening as
the primary corridor of low-level convergence focuses offshore in
response to the progressive short-wave trough. While a few showers
will linger across Coastal Carolinas this evening, the prospect for
lightning is lessening with this activity given the weakening
low-level lapse rates/buoyancy (nocturnal cooling) and downstream
convergence.
