## Start now, don’t wait

date: 2024-01-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Start now, don’t wait</h1>

<p>If I had young people ask me for advice (which they aren’t and when I was young I also didn’t) I’d say this: The world is designed to keep you docile and distracted. If you want to do adventurous things, risk things, go far, you must do it now. If you wait, you will be too late.</p>

<p>Everybody going on adventure everywhere is ill prepared. There fact that you cannot prepare is what makes it an adventure. Great things were done by people who were ill prepared.</p>

<p>It’s true for sports, for your career, for politics. If you wait until the time is right, all the people who got started when the time was not right will have made the decisions for you.</p>

<p>The same is true for any kind of change. People like me tell you that we’ve got this but we don’t – and by the time you realize that everybody is fumbling and improvising, and when you finally learn how important it is to network and to be sly, how nobody who gets anything done just speaks the truth, when you realize that just because you are right people aren’t going to change their opinions, when you realize that to make changes you need to be politically active, to organize, even though you won’t learn how to do this in school because school prepares you for the world that is, for the system that upholds it, not the better world that is possible because it isn’t tried and true and nobody is financing that, then you’ll be as old as me and still won’t have done a thing.</p>

<p>Sure, it’s never too late but if you get started early, there’s still time.</p>

<p>And if instead you think, old man, I have done all that and more, what are you talking about? Then I am relieved and my fears are unfounded. Thank you!</p>

I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and say "learn this" and then a few hours or days later I'd be able to ask it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of therapy.

I think Bluesky has a chance of being the place where journalists assemble in place of Twitter. I sincerely hope it's not on Facebook's Twitter replacement. That would like "meet the new boss, same as the old boss but much richer and better managed."

## beyond the SCT

date: 2024-01-08, from: Ayjay blog

My 2021 essay on “cosmotechnics” begins thus: In the 1950s and 1960s, a series of thinkers, beginning with Jacques Ellul and Marshall McLuhan, began to describe the anatomy of our technological society. Then, starting in the 1970s, a generation emerged who articulated a detailed critique of that society. The critique produced by these figures I [&#8230;]

## Docs observability, or measuring docs inside a product-docs system

date: 2024-01-08, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>As technical writers we want to know if the docs we’re writing are accomplishing their goals. In other words, we want to know how good are docs relative to the business goals they’re aiming to support or improve. Are docs serving their purpose? Which of <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/the-3-budgets/">the three budgets</a> are docs supporting? When tech bubbles burst, roles usually seen as cost centers, such as tech writing, are ripe for layoffs, no matter how staunchly we defend them. That’s why we continue mulling over the question of value and <a href="https://passo.uno/tech-writing-metricks-kpis/">how we measure it</a>.</p>

He said I was a good <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">sports writer</a> and boasted of the current Celtics team (he's from Boston). They're worth boasting about. What a team, such depth and so many interesting players. They were great before they added <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827">Kristaps Porzingis</a>, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He's one of those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year's Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the Warriors or Kings in this year's finals. Anyway, I write sports for people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and front and center. I'm glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even win. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span>

## When “everything” becomes too much: the npm package chaos of 2024

date: 2024-01-07, from: OS News

Happy 2024, folks! Just when we thought we&#8217;d seen it all, an npm user named PatrickJS, aka gdi2290, threw us a curveball. He (along with a group of contributors) kicked off the year with a bang, launching a troll campaign that uploaded an npm package aptly named everything. This package, true to its name, depends on every other public npm package, creating millions of transitive dependencies. The everything package and its 3,000+ sub-packages have caused a Denial of Service (DOS) for anyone who installs it. We&#8217;re talking about storage space running out and system resource exhaustion. But that&#8217;s not all. The creator took their prank to the next level by setting up http://everything.npm.lol, showcasing the chaos they unleashed. They even included a meme from Skyrim, adding some humor (or mockery, depending on your perspective) to the situation. ↫ Feross Aboukhadijeh I know this is a bad thing, you shouldn&#8217;t do this, it harms a lot of people, etc., etc., but let&#8217;s be honest here &#8211; this is a hilarious prank that showcased a weakness in a rather playful way. Sure, there were real consequences, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like any of them caused any permanent damage, data loss, or compromised systems. What&#8217;s worse, it seems this isn&#8217;t even the first time stuff like this happened, so I find it baffling people can still do this. What are they doing over there?

## Discover advanced RiscOSM techniques with WROCC – 10th January

## ScummVM 2.8.0 released

date: 2024-01-07, from: RiscOS Story

The penultimate day of 2023 saw another release of ScummVM, which includes a RISC OS version thanks to the efforts of Cameron Cawley. The software is now at version 2.8.0, and the latest version brings with it a number of new engines, enhancements to old ones &#8211; and of course, a whole raft of newly supported games.
