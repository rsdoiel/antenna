Day 1 Convective Outlook

0740 AM CDT Mon Mar 18 2024

Valid 181300Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS CENTRAL FL AND MUCH OF THE FL ATLANTIC COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated large hail and wind damage is possible this afternoon
across central Florida and along much of the Florida Atlantic coast.

...FL this afternoon...
A northern stream shortwave trough will dig from the mid MS Valley
this morning to the southern Appalachians this evening and off the
Atlantic coast by early Tuesday.  An associated stalled surface
front across north FL this morning will begin to accelerate
southeastward across the peninsula this evening through early
Tuesday.  The more pronounced midlevel height falls and forcing for
ascent will pass north of FL, leaving shallow ascent along the front
and/or differential heating boundaries (from convection moving
inland from the northeast Gulf of Mexico this morning) to focus
thunderstorm development.  Forecast soundings suggest that moderate
buoyancy (MLCAPE near 1500 J/kg), steep low-level lapse rates and 50
kt midlevel flow with relatively straight hodographs could support a
supercell capable of producing isolated large hail (1-1.75 inches in
diameter) and damaging gusts near 60 mph.  The severe threat will
peak by early-mid afternoon and then diminish into this evening. 

...AZ/southern CA through this evening...
As part of a Rex block, a closed low over AZ will drift westward
today as an embedded speed max pivots from northern AZ toward
southern CA.  Low-level moisture will remain modest, but cool
midlevel temperatures and daytime heating will contribute to at
least weak buoyancy (SBCAPE of 250-750 J/kg).  A few clusters of
storms will form in the main band of ascent over the rim this
afternoon, while other storms are expected to spread southwestward
off the higher terrain toward the southern CA coast.  The threat for
severe storms will remain quite low, but the strongest storms could
produce gusty outflow winds and small hail.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Mar 17 2024

Valid 191200Z - 251200Z

A persistent cut-off low across the Southwest will start to advance
east toward the middle of this week. As this occurs, some light to
moderate rain is expected across portions of the southern High
Plains which will further wet fuels which are already mostly moist.
Next weekend, troughing and strong mid-level flow will resume across
the Southwest which will lead to warmer temperatures, drying and
gusty winds across the southern High Plains. There is moderate
consensus for the jet to eject across the Plains next Sunday which
will likely bring dry and breezy conditions to the southern High
Plains. This pattern will likely support critical meteorological
conditions, but fuels will be questionable. If sufficient drying
occurs late this week and over the weekend, critical probabilities
may need to be added later, but at this time it appears fuels will
likely remain too moist to support a large-fire threat by next
weekend.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE AND FLORIDA BIG BEND THROUGH EARLY
EVENING...

...SUMMARY...
Local/isolated risk for gusty/damaging winds remains possible the
remainder of the afternoon/early evening across the Florida
Panhandle/Big Bend area.

...20z Update...

The main change with the 20z update was to trim marginal severe
probabilities across far southeast LA and the coastal waters south
of southern MS/AL behind the ongoing clusters of storms over the
northern Gulf. Stronger heating has occurred downstream from this
cluster across parts of the FL Panhandle and FL Big Bend vicinity.
While instability remain low (less than 500 J/kg MLCAPE), some
potential for a few strong gusts will continue the remainder of the
afternoon/early evening. Otherwise, the only other changes were to
trim portions of the general thunderstorm probability over TX into
LA/MS/AL.

..Leitman.. 03/17/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1122 AM CDT Sun Mar 17 2024/

...Gulf Coastal area from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida Big
Bend...
A well-defined MCS with embedded MCV is moving eastward across the
southeastern Louisiana vicinity late this morning, along the
west-to-east synoptic cold front lying roughly across the Gulf Coast
region.  

West of this convective complex, weak quasi-geostrophic ascent
across Texas -- within a zone of modest low-level warm advection
beneath minor mid-level disturbances moving through fast
west-southwesterly flow aloft southeast of the Desert Southwest
upper low -- will support occasional deep convection.  However,
aside from a couple of sporadic stronger storms and possibly
brief/marginally severe hail/wind risk locally, risk appears too low
to require inclusion of probabilities in the current outlook.

East of the MCS, limited severe risk remains apparent across coastal
areas, though the strongest storms should remain over the northern
Gulf.  Still, gusty/locally damaging winds may occur, warranting
continuation of 5% wind probability as far east as the Florida Big
Bend region through tonight.

..Bentley.. 03/17/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0116 AM CDT Sun Mar 17 2024/

...Synopsis...
Through the day on Monday, the mid-level pattern is expected to be a
longwave trough across the eastern US with a decaying cutoff low
over the southwest US. This is expected to result in northwesterly
flow across the central US. Perhaps some locally Elevated fire
weather conditions are possible across parts of Kansas and Oklahoma,
but fuels do not appear particularly receptive across much of this
area. Therefore, no risk areas are outlined at this time.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may move inland off the Gulf of Mexico into
portions of the northern and central Florida peninsula early Monday.
Additional thunderstorms may develop during the afternoon along the
east-central and southeast Florida coast. Strong gusts and hail may
accompany this activity.

...FL Peninsula...

An upper trough over the Great Lakes and MS Valley will pivot
east/southeast across the eastern U.S. on Monday. Forecast guidance
depicts a shortwave perturbation in the base of the trough over the
northern Gulf of Mexico shifting east across northern/north-central
FL Monday morning. Deep-layer westerly flow will increase with
southward extent across the FL Panhandle through the afternoon, with
30-40 kt 850-700 mb flow common ahead of southward-sagging surface
boundary. 

Showers and thunderstorms may be ongoing across parts of
north-central FL Monday morning. Gusty winds may accompany this
activity as it spreads east the first few hours of the forecast
period. A more conditional severe thunderstorm risk may develop
during the afternoon further south across parts of the
east-central/southeast coast. 

The NAM appears to be an outlier with the strength of an EML,
maintaining capping through the period. The RAP/HRRR/GFS show weaker
capping around 700 mb with full erosion of the cap by afternoon.
Given favorable vertical shear (0-6 effective shear around 40 kt),
steep midlevel lapse rates (around 7-7.5 C/km) and MLCAPE around
1500-2000 J/kg, at least a conditional risk for a couple of severe
storms appears plausible. Large-scale ascent will remain weak over
the area, and veered low-level flow will limit low-level convergence
along the southward-developing surface front. If a well-defined sea
breeze develops along the southeast Peninsula, this could allow for
a few storms to develop during the afternoon/early evening, posing a
conditional risk for large hail and strong gusts. For this reason,
have expanded the Marginal risk (level 1 of 5) to encompass the
southeast Peninsula.

..Bentley.. 03/17/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0115 AM CDT Sun Mar 17 2024/

...Synopsis...
During the day on Sunday, mid-level pattern will be characterized by
a digging longwave trough over the central and eastern US with a
cutoff low in the southwest US. This will promote cool, northerly
surface flow across much of the central US and precipitation across
parts of the southern High Plains. As such, aside from perhaps some
locally Elevated fire risk in parts of southwest Kansas and
northwest Oklahoma, fire concerns are expected to be minimal.
