## Drones and the US Air Force

date: 2024-03-18, updated: 2024-03-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Fascinating <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2024/03/drones-the-air-littoral-and-the-looming-irrelevance-of-the-u-s-air-force/">analysis</a> of the use of drones on a modern battlefield&#8212;that is, Ukraine&#8212;and the inability of the US Air Force to react to this change.</p>
<blockquote><p>The F-35A certainly remains an important platform for high-intensity conventional warfare. But the Air Force is planning to buy 1,763 of the aircraft, which will remain in service through the year 2070. These jets, which are wholly unsuited for countering proliferated low-cost enemy drones in the air littoral, present <i>enormous</i> opportunity costs for the service as a whole.

## Giving your app a temporary public URL with VS Code port forwarding

date: 2024-03-18, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

VS Code now has port forwarding. If you want to share what you are working on with the world, open folder in terminal, run your server and forward the port. Set it to public and Bob&#8217;s your uncle! This is great for some testing and showing people what you do, but of course should not [&#8230;]

## Dev Digest 107 – and the OSScar goes to…

date: 2024-03-18, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

Last Friday, I released the 107th edition of WeAreDevelopers DevDigest. It celebrated the 35th birthday of the World Wide Web, we had a video of me interviewing the founders of Daytona about going open source, we covered the news around Devin, the first AI software engineer and went to space in a Yugo. All strapped [&#8230;]

## VK One

date: 2024-03-18, from: Om Malik blog

A few days ago, Vinod Khosla got into a war of words with Marc Andreessen. Or was it Elon? It was an argument over OpenAI and “open” AI. It might have felt like a bunch of capitalist leviathans butting their big heads, but for me, this was classic Vinod. Always speaking his mind, and batting &#8230;

## Old Tools, New Ideas

date: 2024-03-17, from: Om Malik blog

I have become a big fan of vintage fountain pens. When I saw this lovely Ebonized Pearl WASP Clipper, I immediately fell in love with it. This is quite a rare find. Most collectors won’t even take it out of the cabinet. I don’t buy things to put them in a case. For me, it &#8230;
