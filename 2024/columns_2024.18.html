Knicks keep winning my heart. They play the game exactly as it should be
played. And they don’t take the bait to make it about anything other
than what happens on the court, and to trust in the league to take care
of players who don’t play by the rules. And <i>of course</i> the
Philadelphia arena was full of Knicks fans. The tickets cost a lot less
than NYC tickets, and it’s only 2 hours away by car, and there’s good
train service. If the series goes back to Philadelphia, the same thing
will happen. I feel sorry for fans of small town teams, because no
matter where you go in the US, there are always lots of Knicks fans.

<h2 id="whale-song-code">Whale Song Code</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, updated: 2024-04-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
During the Cold War, the US Navy tried to make a
<a href="https://www.twz.com/8778/the-u-s-navy-tried-to-turn-whale-songs-into-secret-code">secret
code</a> out of whale song.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The basic plan was to develop coded messages from recordings of whales,
dolphins, sea lions, and seals. The submarine would broadcast the noises
and a computer—the Combo Signal Recognizer (CSR)—would detect the
specific patterns and decode them on the other end. In theory, this idea
was relatively simple. As work progressed, the Navy found a number of
complicated problems to overcome, the bulk of which centered on the
authenticity of the code itself.
</p>
<p>
The message structure couldn’t just substitute the moaning of a whale or
a crying seal for As and Bs or even whole words. In addition, the sounds
Navy technicians recorded between 1959 and 1965 all had natural
background noise. With the technology available, it would have been hard
to scrub that out. Repeated blasts of the same sounds with identical
extra noise would stand out to even untrained sonar operators…

<h2 id="thoughts-on-cosmotechnics">Thoughts on Cosmotechnics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
A fine post by Ethan Marcotte called
<a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-negotiation-cycle/"><em>The
negotiation cycle</em></a> led me to an incredible essay by Alan Jacobs
called
<a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living"><em>From
Tech Critique to Ways of Living</em></a>. It references an old idea
called “The
SCT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>”
which is new to me but based on thinking by the likes of Ursula Franklin
and Neil Postman who I am familiar with. Neil Postman’s
<em>Technopoly</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
–which I read in March– was one of the best books on technology I’ve
ever read, so this is relevant for me.
</p>
<p>
Jacobs’ essay takes an unexpected yet welcome turn towards Daoism
linking to a heavier essay by Yuk Hui called
<a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"><em>Cosmotechnics
and Cosmopolitics</em></a>. I’m not smart enough to fully understand all
these philosophical (epistemological?)
arguments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>,
but reading the word “cosmotechnics” felt like a beacon in the night for
a concept I’ve intuitively felt but never had a word to describe. In
Hui’s words:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let me give you a preliminary definition of cosmotechnics: it is the
unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities,
whether craft-making or art-making.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I believe that science and technology are moral. Try as we may to
divorce a tool from an outcome, there is always an interplay. As a
contrived example, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component
and it would by itself be morally neutral. But if I make a
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that someone with a disability cannot use,
then I have made a moral decision through either action or inaction.
Similarly, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that puts a stuffed
animal in a digital shopping cart, that is morally neutral. But if that
stuffed animal is knowingly assembled with child labor and dropshipped
from afar with an immense carbon cost relative to the value of the item,
I have made an immoral <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>. It’s not hard for
me to imagine that someone somewhere is making a
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component that launches a nuclear missile…
</p>
<p>
In the words of Dr. King from his sermon
<em><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/">The
Three Evils of Society</a></em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided
missiles and misguided men.”<br /> – Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But if you believe technology is moral, then the next larger follow up
question is “Whose morals?”
</p>
<hr />
<p>
This question of “Whose morals?” permeates my thoughts, specifically in
regards to global challenges like climate change. Call me unpatriotic,
but I don’t think rugged American individualism is going to manifest
destiny our way out of the climate crisis. A technological breakthrough
seems unlikely. We need to rely on the knowledge and experiences of
African, Asian, and Indigenous societies who have a different ontology,
a different Dao (a code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural
order); one that prioritizes the group over the individual. In less
metaphysical terms, I believe we need to listen to societies built on
cooperation and sharing of limited resources over societies built on the
continuous expansion of dominion through exploitation of markets, labor,
and people.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We need a new language of cosmopolitics to elaborate this new world
order that goes beyond a single
hegemon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree with Hui that a singular perspective cannot and will not solve
the current crisis we are facing. Technology alone will not save us. We
need scientific power in the hands of moral-powered men and women. And
the longer we wait the more we risk erasing the communities and ancient
knowledge we need to find an equitable solution.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Climate change, geopolitical conflict, the rise of authoritarianism
brought about by social media companies… these are all large problems
that take governments decades to solve. That puts cosmotechnics far away
from me, a would-be practitioner. Hui thankfully provides a story from
the
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">Zhuangzi</a></em>;
the butcher Pao Ding.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pao Ding is excellent at butchering cows. He claims that the key to
being a good butcher doesn’t lie in mastering certain skills, but rather
in comprehending the Dao. Replying to a question from Duke Wen Huei
about the Dao of butchering cows, Pao Ding points out that having a good
knife is not necessarily enough; it is more important to understand the
Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the
bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter
into the gaps between them.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the kind of web development I like. It agrees with me. I better
understand the <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao of web
design</a>. Our apps and websites are like water, flowing in and out of
viewports. Contextualizing themselves to the recipient’s limitations or
preferences. Those who find the easier paths through the gaps become
excellent butchers of websites.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pao Ding adds that a good butcher has to change his knife once a year
because he cuts through tendons, while a bad butcher has to change his
knife every month because he cuts through bones. Pao Ding, on the other
hand—an <em>excellent</em> butcher—has not changed his knife in nineteen
years, and it looks as if it has just been sharpened with a whetstone.
Whenever Pao Ding encounters any difficulty, he slows down the knife and
gropes for the right place to move further.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another translation I read phrased the bad butcher as “hacking” through
bones and what a serviceable metaphor we’ve found! The knife, a
technology. The medium, a cow or software. Our tools will last longer if
we learn how to slow down and understand the nature of the medium,
<a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">the
grain</a>, rather than hacking against it.
</p>
<p>
The hustle and bustle of capitalism and keeping up with the zeitgeist
makes this hard. There’s a pressure to keep up, lest you fall off the
cliff of irrelevance. After all, technology always only advances and
there’s always a better knife in the distance… right?
</p>
<p>
Over the years I’ve heard myself referred to as a “curmudgeon”, “old
guard”, “gatekeeper”, and “dinosaur”. That is due in part to my
loudmouthed punditry but also because I dislike a specific technology
from an
<a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">immoral
company</a> that does our industry, society, and users irreparable harm.
Moving fast and rethinking best practices spawned untold lifetimes worth
of human hours dedicated to knife swapping each year. And when tools
dull, we throw stones at each other.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always been overly cautious and considered in the tools I use but
I’ve never thought of the tools I use as a moral choice. Perhaps now I
will. I’m not a Daoist by any means, but this idea of
<em>cosmotechnics</em> begins to provide a mental framework for
expressing the relationship between technology and morality. From the
large scale of the cosmos to the small scale of the knife, I’m glad to
have vocabulary to think about future problems.

One nuanced point I disagree with Hui on is on who should hold the
leading power in this new cosmopolitical system. I fully agree we need
to grow out of our single hegemony (America), but I’ve heard this
“multipolar world’ philosophy echoed by Vladimir Putin before and I
don’t believe we should cede moral authority over to authoritarian
regimes that slaughter and demonize LGBTQ+ groups and ethnic minorities.
We shouldn’t use new technology to reinstate old Cold War era
superpowers of oppression. We need something entirely new. That said, I
sit in a comfortable seat of privilege and systemic power well within
the borders of the American Empire…

working on a web text editor that works in three different formats –
wizzy, markdown and html source. You can flip between them with an icon
click. I love flip-switches in software.</p>

<p>Today’s <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogrolls</a> are more
like feed readers than the blogrolls of the 90s. My blogroll has all the
best sources, and they update slowly enough that I can keep up with all
of them.</p>

<p>I’m also blocking people who hype ActivityPub in comments to my posts
about social web stuff that has nothing to do with AP. I’ve been down
this road before. I just want to find people with
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">active minds</a>,
whose business is interop, who want to try stuff out. AP is not a good
foundation to build on, at least until they come up with a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22busy+developer+guide%22">BDG</a>
for it. Basically it isn’t a standard even though they say it is. If you
want to help your cause: 1. Stop hyping. 2. Get busy with that BDG.</p>

days I’m using the moderation tools on the social web more than I did in
the past. If someone I don’t know posts a negative comment on Facebook,
in response to something I posted, I just delete it, because they have
that feature (other systems don’t, they should). Any lurker who happens
by is free to enjoy what I write. But if I don’t know you, I honestly
don’t care what you think, esp if it’s negative and has less than ten
syllables total. It’s hit and run spam for sure. I’m widening my
definition of spam all the time. If you add up all the responses that
actually mean anything, it doesn’t amount to much. Let’s see what the
social web looks like without hearing from all assholes.</p>
