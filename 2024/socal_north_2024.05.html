<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>“I Saw the TV Glow” is breaking through the static of the horror
genre. After making their narrative film debut at Sundance 2021 with
their lo-fi horror film “We’re All Going to the World’s Fair,”
writer-director Jane Schoenbrun returned to this year’s festival with “I
Saw the TV Glow.” The filmmaker’s A24-produced sophomore entry centers
on lonely teenagers Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette
Lundy-Paine) who find solace in their favorite television show, “The
Pink Opaque.” Smith, Lundy-Paine and cast member Ian Foreman spoke with
the Daily Bruin’s Graciana Paxton at the Sundance Film Festival about
the ways in which the coming-of-age horror explores media obsessions,
isolation and identity.</p>

men’s basketball’s 22-4 run in the first half powers it past USC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated Jan. 28 at 11:38 p.m. </em> The Bruins were
facing a deficit when two players entered the game and caused the tide
to turn.  Freshmen forward Devin Williams and center Aday Mara, who
average 3.2 and 11.7 minutes per game, respectively, spurred UCLA’s
guards to accelerate onto a 22-4 run thanks to their height in the
paint.  “Aday and Devin really changed the rhythm of the game,” said
coach Mick Cronin.</p>
