Mesoscale Discussion 0344
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0959 AM CDT Tue Apr 02 2024

Areas affected...Portions of WV

Concerning...Tornado Watch 74...

Valid 021459Z - 021630Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 74 continues.

SUMMARY...A substantial severe wind threat (70-90+ mph gusts), along
with isolated tornadoes, will approach Charleston West Virginia and
vicinity through noon.

DISCUSSION...KHTS recently measured a significant severe wind gust
to 80 kt (92 mph) with a compact but well organized cluster
currently moving quickly eastward across parts of WV. Even though
the airmass across this region remains only weakly unstable, very
strong low-level and deep-layer shear is helping to compensate and
provide convective organization. Recent radar data from KRLX shows
enhanced inbound velocities embedded within the line that suggest
70-90+ mph wind gusts will likely continue to be a threat with this
line as it approaches the Charleston WV metro and vicinity over the
next hour (through noon EDT). In addition to this substantial
severe/damaging wind threat, isolated tornadoes embedded within the
line also appear possible given the strength of the low-level flow
and related shear.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0732 AM CDT Tue Apr 02 2024

Valid 021300Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL KENTUCKY...SOUTHEAST INDIANA...AND CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN OHIO...

...SUMMARY...
A severe weather outbreak is possible today over the Ohio Valley
with the broader severe weather risk including parts of the
Southeast.  Strong and potentially long-track tornadoes are possible
from Indiana and Ohio southward into the Mid South.  A threat for
strong tornadoes may focus this evening into tonight across parts of
Alabama and Georgia.

...Synopsis...
A complex and strongly dynamic spring storm system will potentially
result in a large area of severe-weather risk from the southern
Great Lakes/OH Valley southward into portions of the Deep South,
including AL/GA and the western Carolinas late tonight.  

A potent trough over the Upper Midwest this morning will evolve into
a very strong mid-level low over the southwest Great Lakes by
Wednesday morning.  An intense mid-level speed max over northern
Mexico/TX, in association with the southern portion of the
larger-scale central U.S. trough, will rapidly move east-northeast
during the period and intensify to 125-kt at 500 mb over the
southern Appalachians by daybreak Wednesday.  Intense 12-hr midlevel
height falls are forecast across much of the Great Lakes, OH/TN
Valley, and the northern Gulf States, where values in excess of 200m
are expected during the latter half of the period.  The synoptic
front this morning is draped across the OH Valley and will likely
advance north due to the digging trough.  

...OH Valley...
Water-vapor imagery loop overnight showed a southern-stream
short-wave trough associated with this morning's severe thunderstorm
activity straddling the OH River in central KY and southern IN. 
This early-day thunderstorm complex will probably pose a risk for
wind damage and perhaps a couple of tornadoes before it moves into
the central Appalachians towards midday (see MCD #341 for short-term
details).  In its wake, a trailing outflow boundary/effective warm
frontal zone will likely advance northward into IN/OH later today
with lower to mid 60s progged to near I-70.  Models continue to show
an appreciable window of opportunity in which cloud breaks/heating
and increasing low-level moisture contribute to moderate
destabilization during the afternoon.  Have adjusted the western
envelope of severe probabilities farther west across IN to account
for greater destabilization than earlier forecast, but otherwise
have left the outlook unchanged across the OH Valley.  Scattered
thunderstorms will likely develop by early to mid afternoon with
discrete supercells evolving from the more intense updrafts. 
Tornadoes, large to very large hail, and damaging gusts are expected
with the supercells that mature across the warm sector.  Enlarged
and elongated hodographs imply fast storm motions and the
possibility for several cyclic tornadic supercells, some of which
may yield strong and long-lived tornadoes.  

Farther east, strong to severe storms may continue across the
central Appalachians and perhaps move east into the Mid-Atlantic
states.  Hail/wind appear to be the primary hazards with this
activity.

...Southeast this evening/tonight...
Farther south and initially in the TN/MS/northern AL vicinity,
severe thunderstorms are forecast to develop this afternoon as the
leading edge of stronger large-scale ascent impinges on the region. 
A moisture-rich airmass and wind profile favoring supercells, will
favor a risk for all severe hazards with the stronger thunderstorms.
Although it remains unclear with regard to daytime to evening storm
evolution across MS/AL/TN, the approach of the 500-mb speed max and
intense shear through a deep layer atop a moist/unstable boundary
layer, suggest a bimodal severe threat will probably evolve this
evening into the overnight.  Model guidance indicates messy but
organized storm modes within a larger area of convection will
probably develop.  Forecast soundings show 300-500 m2/s2 0-1 km SRH
from central/eastern AL into GA during the evening and overnight. 
The risk for tornadoes, including a few strong tornadoes, will be
possible with this activity eventually reaching the Carolinas and
the eastern FL Panhandle late.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0605 AM CDT Mon Apr 01 2024

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
A cold front will move south across Texas on Tuesday. In the wake of
this cold front, dry and breezy conditions are expected. The best
potential for Elevated fire weather conditions will be portions of
the Texas Hill Country into far South Texas where sustained winds of
15 to 20 mph and relative humidity around 20 percent are expected.
However, fuels have mostly greened up in this region and fuel
availability may be limited. Therefore, an Elevated delineation was
not added at this time.
