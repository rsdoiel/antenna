Mesoscale Discussion 0112
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1048 AM CST Thu Feb 08 2024

Areas affected...Northern Arizona

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 081648Z - 081945Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snowfall with rates 1-2 inches per hour. Areas of
blowing snow with poor visibility.

DISCUSSION...A cold front currently located across western Arizona
will advance eastward this morning. Ahead of this feature, upslope
snow showers are ongoing with light to moderate snow being reported
in Flagstaff and across the Prescott Valley. Temperatures below 6000
feet are hovering just above freezing just south of the Mogollon
Rim. Ahead of the front, steep low to mid-level lapse rates are in
place around 7-8 C/km. As the front advances eastward, snowfall
rates will increase as frontogenetic forcing increases along with
strong upslope flow along the terrain. Given the lapse rate profile,
some convective enhancement is likely, with heavy snowfall rates
around 1-2 inches per hour at times. Lower elevation locations where
dew points are below 32F may see quick snow levels lower with any
heavier precipitation rates. Given the strong southerly flow gusting
25-30 mph (locally as high as 40 mph), poor visibility is likely,
especially along the cold frontal passage. These conditions will
continue to shift eastward with the cold front, mainly along the
high terrain of the Mogollon Rim, through the afternoon and evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1039 AM CST Thu Feb 08 2024

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...17z Update...
Morning observations show wind gusts of 25-30+ mph and pockets of
lower humidity becoming more numerous across the southern Plains.
Winds should continue to increase through the day as a weak dryline
mixes eastward. Locally elevated to near-critical meteorological
conditions are possible this afternoon over parts of eastern OK/KS
and western MO. However, area fuels remain poorly receptive to fire
starts/spread, suggesting fire-weather concerns will remain
localized. See the previous discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 02/08/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CST Thu Feb 08 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level impulse embedded in a broad upper-level cyclonic flow
regime will impinge on the Plains states today, encouraging surface
low development along the central High Plains. While low-level
moisture will continue to return northward across portions of the
Plains states, downslope westerly flow along the southern High
Plains will support dry and windy surface conditions during the
afternoon. While these conditions may reach elevated-equivalent
thresholds in spots, fuels appear poorly receptive to fire spread,
precluding the introduction of fire weather highlights.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1030 AM CST Thu Feb 08 2024

Valid 081630Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM FAR EASTERN
IOWA EASTWARD TO SOUTHWESTERN PARTS OF LAKE MICHIGAN...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong/severe thunderstorms remain possible this afternoon
through early evening across parts of far eastern Iowa, northern
Illinois, far southern Wisconsin, and the southern Lake Michigan
vicinity.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough now crossing the Middle Missouri
Valley/central Plains will continue progressing northeastward today
and tonight, while a second feature now in the vicinity of the Lower
Colorado Valley shifts eastward through the period.  Meanwhile,
upper ridging over the East will be shunted progressively eastward
by the aforementioned advance of short-wave troughs farther west.

At the surface, a rather deep (990 mb) surface cyclone is currently
analyzed near the ND/SD/MN border intersection, with a cold front
extending southward across the Middle Missouri Valley into Kansas. 
This boundary, and the advance of the upper trough, may support
isolated late afternoon strong/potentially severe convective
development across eastern Iowa/northwestern Illinois.

Elsewhere, showers and scattered thunderstorms are expected to
evolve across the Four Corners states ahead of the aforementioned
upper trough, and overnight thunder may evolve within an area of
broad/weak QG ascent over parts of the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys.  Severe weather is not expected in these areas. 

...Eastern Iowa/northern Illinois/southern Wisconsin vicinity...
Low-level moisture remains a primary uncertainty today, with respect
to potential strong/severe storm development.  Dewpoints remain in
the upper 30s/low 40s across the Iowa/Illinois area, where model
forecast soundings -- particularly the RAP -- have consistently
indicated upper 40s to low 50s dewpoints by late afternoon.  This
degree of moistening still appears to be a bit aggressive, with
middle to upper 40s largely anticipated.  

With that said, very cold air aloft/steep lapse rates will continue
to overspread this region, and the deep-layer wind field is
conditionally quite supportive of severe/supercell storms.  At this
time, we will maintain MRGL risk and all-hazard, low-probability
outlook.  A couple of storms may develop by late afternoon, in the
eastern Iowa/northwestern Illinois vicinity, and then shift
eastward/east-northeastward through early evening, before weakening.

However, evolution of moisture through the day will be closely
watched, as the more aggressive RAP model solution -- should it
appear more likely to occur -- would require consideration for an
upgrade to the outlook at 20Z.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0650 AM CST Thu Feb 08 2024

Valid 081300Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN IOWA...SOUTHERN WISCONSIN...AND NORTHERN ILLINOIS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon through
early evening across parts of far eastern Iowa, northern Illinois,
far southern Wisconsin, and the southern Lake Michigan vicinity.

...Midwest/Upper Mississippi Valley/Lake Michigan vicinity...
Steady height falls will occur preceding the eastward advancement of
an upper trough currently across the northern/central Great Plains,
with this trough reaching the Upper Great Lakes/northern Ontario
tonight. Strengthening deep-layer southwesterly winds (80+ kt 500
mb) will overspread much of the Midwest/Lake Michigan vicinity. A
surface low will progress northeastward across northern Minnesota
toward northern Ontario, as a cold front sweeps eastward across the
Upper Midwest and Upper Great Lakes. Some pre-frontal moistening is
expected today, but overall limited moisture quality should preclude
a greater and more certain severe risk.

Low-topped thunderstorms are expected to develop, at least on an
isolated basis, by mid/late afternoon initially across eastern Iowa
and Wisconsin/northwest Illinois near the front, within a zone of
modest destabilization (below 500 J/kg MLCAPE) but minimal
inhibition. While low-level moisture will be rather limited, with
surface dewpoints should generally no higher than 50 F around peak
heating, the steepness of lapse rates (-25C around 500mb) could
support some severe-caliber surface-based low-topped storms (tops
generally 25,000 ft or below), with strong wind profiles/low-level
hodograph curvature supportive of rotating storms.

Hail and locally damaging winds will be possible, along with some
tornado risk. Storms should persist, and potentially remain
strong/locally severe, northeastward toward the southern Lake
Michigan vicinity through early/mid-evening, before nocturnal
boundary layer/cool lake influences lead to a diminishing convective
intensity by late evening.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are unlikely across the continental
United States through tonight.

...DISCUSSION...
At mid-levels this evening, anticyclonic flow is pronounced across 
the eastern half of the nation, with an upper-level trough located
in the Desert Southwest. Isolated thunderstorms will be possible
early this evening ahead of this trough from eastern Arizona and
western New Mexico northeastward into the central High Plains. 

An upper-level low was also located near the coast of California.
This feature will progress southeastward and move slowly inland
across central California this evening. A band of rainfall is
located ahead of the upper-level low. This southern end of this
feature will move southeastward along the southern coast of
California this evening. Some convective elements within the band
near the coast may be associated with strong gusty winds.

Elsewhere across the continental United States, thunderstorms are
not expected through daybreak Thursday.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CST Wed Feb 07 2024

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

Mid-level troughing is expected to continue over the western and
central US through the extended forecast period. Accompanying the
persistent troughing, strong mid-level flow will linger over parts
of the southern Plains and South TX supporting occasional gusty
winds. The most significant period of troughing will likely develop
this weekend through early next week, as a deeper shortwave emerges
over the Southwest. A passing surface low could support localized
fire-weather concerns through the weekend over parts of south TX.
Otherwise, poorly receptive fuels, wet and cool conditions should
keep fire-weather concerns low for much of the CONUS.

...Southern Plains and south TX D3-D6...
As the second trough begins to deepen over the Southwest and
southern Rockies this weekend, a developing surface low should
continue to deepen across parts of west TX and the Red River. By
D5/Sun the low should begin to move eastward reaching the mid to
lower MS Valley. Strong surface winds behind the low are possible
through the weekend and into early next week. Forecast guidance
varies considerably on the timing and strength of the
upper-level/surface system. However, favorable downslope
trajectories would support drier and windier conditions across parts
of the southern Plains, along the Rio Grande Valley and into parts
of Deep South TX. Some risk for critical fire-weather conditions may
develop, but there remains significant uncertainty on the
availability of dry fuels in addition to the meteorological forecast
discrepancies.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CST Tue Feb 06 2024

Valid 091200Z - 141200Z

...DISCUSSION...
From Friday/D4 into Saturday/D5, models are in good agreement in
bringing a large, positive-tilt upper trough eastward across the
West and toward the central CONUS, with a persistent southwesterly
flow regime across much of the East. Given this regime, a gradual
increase in moisture and the development of weak instability is
forecast across parts of the Gulf Coast region, with increasing rain
and thunderstorm chances from eastern TX to the Carolinas on
Saturday/D5.

While predictability is low Sunday/D6 and beyond, the aforementioned
upper trough may eventually amplify, and a wave may eventually move
across the Southeast. Instability will be the limiting factor for
severe potential, especially given the possibility of widespread
clouds and rain. However, the area from the northern Gulf Coast to
the southeastern Atlantic Coastal states is an area of interest
going forward. If a trough amplification does not occur, the
prolonged low-level warm advection regime with modest height falls
may only result in marginal severe potential.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper-level pattern will persist on Tuesday, as a deep
trough in the West, ridge over the central states, and a deep trough
over the East all move gradually eastward through the day.
Relatively low-topped convection with sporadic lightning flashes
will be possible across parts of the Southwest and southern CA.
While a strong storm or two cannot be ruled out from the lower CO
River Valley into western AZ, weak instability should generally
limit the organized severe-thunderstorm threat. 

Isolated thunderstorms will also be possible near and offshore of
the Florida Atlantic coast, as convection moves south-southwestward
along the western periphery of a deep cyclone centered northeast of
the Bahamas.
