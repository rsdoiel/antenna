<p>EL CENTRO, CA – Bureau of Land Management Law Enforcement Rangers will conduct driving under the influence (DUI) and registration checkpoints from Feb. 16-19, noon to 2 a.m., on BLM-managed public lands in Imperial County, within the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area.</p>

<p>Officers will look for signs of alcohol, drug impairment, proper registration and licensing. DUI checkpoints are placed in locations based on collision statistics, frequency of DUI arrests and safety, to deter impaired driving, both on-and off-road on public lands to keep visitors safe.</p>

<p>“The BLM wants everyone to have a fun and safe President’s holiday weekend. Be safe, don’t drink and ride, and remember to designate a sober driver. DUI laws apply on- and off-road,” said El Centro Field Manager Mathew Lohr.</p>

<p>The deterrent effect of DUI checkpoints is a proven resource in reducing the number of persons injured and killed in alcohol or drug related crashes.  Research indicates crashes involving an impaired driver can be reduced by up to 20 percent when well publicized DUI checkpoints and proactive DUI patrols are conducted routinely. The latest data by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration documents drunk-driving crashes claim more than 10,000 lives per year.</p>

<p>The BLM reminds the public that impaired driving is not just from alcohol. Some prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs may interfere with driving. Driving under the influence of marijuana is illegal. Drivers charged with a first-time DUI face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties, as well as a suspended license.</p>

<p>Law Enforcement Rangers are reminding everyone to ‘Report Drunk Drivers – Call 9-1-1.’ For more information, visit <a href="http://www.blm.gov/">www.blm.gov</a> and the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area’s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/BLMImperialSandDunes" target="_blank">Facebook page</a></p>
