## Northeastern States District adds to Seeds of Success and Smithsonian collection

date: 2024-02-09, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>Northeastern States District adds to Seeds of Success and Smithsonian collection</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p><strong>Milwaukee, Wisc. -- </strong>Recently, BLM Eastern States Northeastern States District Natural Resource Specialist Nikki Carter and Chris Woolridge of the Chicago Botanic Garden kayaked across the Milwaukee River to reach a BLM-managed island in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The purpose of the trip was to create a vegetation index of every species on the one-acre island.</p>

<p>Although the morning had started with an unexpected rain shower, the sky cleared, and brilliant patches of yellow and purple flowers appeared as they paddled to the island. Upon reaching the island, it became apparent that another goal could be achieved—native plant material collection for the Seeds of Success program. The program is a BLM-led initiative to collect, conserve, and develop native plant materials for stabilizing, rehabilitating, and restoring lands in the United States. If a seed collection happened that day, it would be the first time the BLM Northeastern States District Office had participated in the program. Carter and Woolridge would have to collect more than 10,000 seeds and several full plants to make herbarium vouchers. An herbarium specimen voucher is a pressed, mounted plant sample with collection data deposited for future reference. The pair happily got to work.</p>

<p>After they completed the vegetation index, experiencing firsthand the island’s robust population of wood nettle plants, they determined that the populations of native Joe Pye weed (Eupatorium maculatum) and common sneezeweed (Helenium autumnale) would make excellent contributions to the Seeds of Success program. Both plants are excellent for pollinators, as indicated by the dozens of common eastern bumble bees foraging on the fall blooms that day.</p>

<p>Carefully, Carter and Woolridge readied their seed collection supplies. A large paper bag would hold the seeds, while a mechanical counter would keep track of the plants harvested. They reviewed the strict guidelines to follow in a collection, to maximize genetic diversity and minimize a potentially harmful reduction in the remaining seed populations. To leave a healthy population, only 20% of each plant’s seeds could be harvested, but they had to collect from at least 50 plants. Armed with their supplies, the pair set off across the island. In no time, the two had bags brimming with seedheads. A quick calculation revealed that they had collected an estimated 250,000 Joe Pye weed and 65,000 common sneezeweed seeds. These seeds would be cleaned and stored by Chicago Botanic Garden, available for withdrawal at a future date.</p>

<p>The last step was to create herbarium vouchers to be sent with the seeds. These plant pressings would include an information tag and be a valuable reference for future research. Carter and Woolridge selected the perfect specimens for pressing. This would be the first time the BLM Northeastern States District had work sent to the prestigious Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Carter and Woolridge created three vouchers for each specimen. One would be sent to the Smithsonian, another would travel with Woolridge back to the Chicago Botanic Garden, and one would remain with Carter for the District’s library.</p>

<p>The pair expertly arranged the plant specimens between sheets of paper and cardboard in beautifully latticed wood flower presses. An ideal specimen contains every part of the plant, from bloom to root. Carter recounted the small flower press her grandfather made her as a child when she would spend hours collecting dandelions and violets. The rotund inflorescences of the sneezeweed proved difficult to press, but like squeezing an overpacked suitcase shut, the team successfully assembled the presses. Loading their kayaks with their supplies and spoils, the team deftly paddled across the river to shore.</p>

<p>The work done that day will contribute to a national body of knowledge, providing valuable resources for wetland restoration. Seeds of Success collections are used to support development of geographically appropriate native plant materials for research, development, germplasm conservation, and ecosystem restoration. Herbaria (a systematically arranged collection of dried plants) provide a comprehensive view of regional flora.</p>

<p>Every summer, in the heat of the desert, field crews gather in Las Cruces, New Mexico to begin a season of ecological landscape monitoring. These field crews congregate to implement the Bureau of Land Management’s Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (BLM, AIM) strategy out of the BLM Las Cruces District Office (LCDO). Institute for Applied Ecology Southwest Botanist, Liz Plazewski, currently acts as the Project Lead for the Las Cruces Terrestrial AIM Crews. Liz has completed several seasons of AIM training and mentoring the crews throughout their field season.</p>

<p>The AIM strategy consists of collecting detailed landscape and vegetation data across various ecological sites on BLM-managed land. Field crews collect their data via a series of standardized methodologies and randomized plot locations. The methodologies include (1) recording vegetation cover and soil surface data through line point intercept, (2) determining ecological site from digging and texturing a soil pit, and (3) notating a complete vascular vegetation composition through species inventory, to name a few. After many levels of quality control and quality assurance, each year’s data is published to be used, summarized, and analyzed. AIM data, since it is collected on public lands, is primarily used by the BLM but is accessible to the public as well. For more information on the AIM strategy and for access to the public data portal, visit blm.gov/aim.</p>

<p>This past 2023 field season, from July through December, LCDO hosted two AIM field crews consisting of two crew members and one crew lead. The crews successfully completed 76 plots distributed across the District in Hidalgo, Grant, Luna, Sierra, Doña Ana, and Otero counties of southern New Mexico.</p>

<p>When asked about her highlight of the field season, crew member Alaine Quinn shared, “All of the cool places we went to. It was fun being out in the middle of nowhere. With our work as an AIM crew, we travelled to such remote areas, and gained a deeper understanding of the landscape.”</p>

<p>Crew Lead Pilar Fuentes felt AIM was important in many ways, especially when it comes to building communal connections, “Oftentimes we are the only people that ranch workers interact with from the BLM, since their ranches are so remote. I feel the work we are doing further strengthens the relationship between stakeholders and the government.”  </p>

<p>The crewpersons reflected on their season, “I learned a lot about how to identify plants without flowers—looking at nodes, collars, growth patterns. . . I increased my botany skills, for sure,” said Fuentes. Quinn added, “It was a great field experience. We learned so many different field methods and protocols—many useful skills that are important as I head towards a natural resources career.”</p>

<p>As the 2023 field season wrapped up, the LCDO immediately began to plan and prepare for 2024 season. The District currently has eight seasons of Terrestrial AIM field data collected, a total of 1,035 plots sampled with 171 of those resampled to monitor the change in the landscape over time. Although it is still being planned and mapped out, the 2024 field season is expected to involve more resampling around the month of May.  A very special thanks to the Southwest Conservation Corps, who employs the New Mexico AIM crews, and the Las Cruces and New Mexico State BLM for the support for this program.</p>

<p>Every summer, in the heat of the desert, field crews gather in Las Cruces, New Mexico to begin a season of ecological landscape monitoring. These field crews congregate to implement the Bureau of Land Management’s Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (BLM, AIM) strategy out of the BLM Las Cruces District Office (LCDO). Institute for Applied Ecology Southwest Botanist, Liz Plazewski, currently acts as the Project Lead for the Las Cruces Terrestrial AIM Crews. Liz has completed several seasons of AIM training and mentoring the crews throughout their field season.</p>

<p>The AIM strategy consists of collecting detailed landscape and vegetation data across various ecological sites on BLM-managed land. Field crews collect their data via a series of standardized methodologies and randomized plot locations. The methodologies include (1) recording vegetation cover and soil surface data through line point intercept, (2) determining ecological site from digging and texturing a soil pit, and (3) notating a complete vascular vegetation composition through species inventory, to name a few. After many levels of quality control and quality assurance, each year’s data is published to be used, summarized, and analyzed. AIM data, since it is collected on public lands, is primarily used by the BLM but is accessible to the public as well. For more information on the AIM strategy and for access to the public data portal, visit blm.gov/aim.</p>

<p>This past 2023 field season, from July through December, LCDO hosted two AIM field crews consisting of two crew members and one crew lead. The crews successfully completed 76 plots distributed across the District in Hidalgo, Grant, Luna, Sierra, Doña Ana, and Otero counties of southern New Mexico.</p>

<p>When asked about her highlight of the field season, crew member Alaine Quinn shared, “All of the cool places we went to. It was fun being out in the middle of nowhere. With our work as an AIM crew, we travelled to such remote areas, and gained a deeper understanding of the landscape.”</p>

<p>Crew Lead Pilar Fuentes felt AIM was important in many ways, especially when it comes to building communal connections, “Oftentimes we are the only people that ranch workers interact with from the BLM, since their ranches are so remote. I feel the work we are doing further strengthens the relationship between stakeholders and the government.”  </p>

<p>The crewpersons reflected on their season, “I learned a lot about how to identify plants without flowers—looking at nodes, collars, growth patterns. . . I increased my botany skills, for sure,” said Fuentes. Quinn added, “It was a great field experience. We learned so many different field methods and protocols—many useful skills that are important as I head towards a natural resources career.”</p>

<p>As the 2023 field season wrapped up, the LCDO immediately began to plan and prepare for 2024 season. The District currently has eight seasons of Terrestrial AIM field data collected, a total of 1,035 plots sampled with 171 of those resampled to monitor the change in the landscape over time. Although it is still being planned and mapped out, the 2024 field season is expected to involve more resampling around the month of May.  A very special thanks to the Southwest Conservation Corps, who employs the New Mexico AIM crews, and the Las Cruces and New Mexico State BLM for the support for this program.</p>

## Road less traveled: A Black woman's journey in forest management

<p paraeid="{dd909578-2be0-45a1-bff5-fb85f57accfd}{236}" paraid="1529967861">For Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the question was, “To be or not to be?” However, in 1994, the question for me was, “Do I work for the Forest Service or the BLM?” At that time, I had completed my academic studies at Oregon State University to qualify as a “forester.” After 20 years in administrative positions, the Forest Service offered me a line officer job, which was not to exceed 1 year. The BLM offered me the field manager position in Baker City, Oregon. I took the BLM job. It turned out that I was the first female African-American field manager ever hired in the BLM!  </p>

<p paraeid="{dd909578-2be0-45a1-bff5-fb85f57accfd}{250}" paraid="2140002706">My career spanned from 1974 until 2007. During those 33 years, I can count on one hand the number of times that I was in a meeting in which there were other African-Americans. Even today, it is unusual to find an African-American female in a natural resource career, let alone as a forester. When I decided to go into management, I was definitely blazing a road less traveled by other African-American females. I had no role models. I wanted to be excellent in all of my endeavors, so I studied the professionals in the BLM.</p>

<p paraeid="{67c85810-64a3-410a-a2ea-80a92ab0c41b}{25}" paraid="1742494560">Folks are always curious about my experiences—how I accomplished what I did and why I picked a career in natural resources when so few African-Americans were in the field. Most importantly, I did not dwell on the fact that I was an African-American female. If every move I made or every decision I delivered focused on that, I knew early on that I would spend a lot of energy on it, rather than focusing on being the best that I could be. The latter worked better for me.  </p>

<p paraeid="{67c85810-64a3-410a-a2ea-80a92ab0c41b}{45}" paraid="1182896662">To tell the truth, my biggest issue as an African-American in the agency and in my community—don’t laugh—was my hair. In some of the rural places where I worked, I could not find “Black” hair products. That said, I learned to do my hair myself—biggest issue gone! Smaller issues cropped up from time to time. My temporary assignment in Silver Lake, Oregon, comes to mind. I was driving through in my private vehicle, checking out the area before reporting to duty as the acting district ranger. When I got to the end of town, I turned around. As I was driving back, a policeman in the middle of the road directed me to stop. He came over to the car and said, “You lost?” I said, “No.” He said, “Well I saw you come through town and turn around; I thought you were lost.” I said, “No, I’m not lost. I’m the new temporary district ranger, and I was just checking out the area before reporting in.” The officer’s jaw dropped. I’m sure he didn’t realize how long it took him to speak, but it was well over a minute. Finally, he stumbled and said, “I . . . I thought you were lost. You . . . you know I know those folks over there. We . . . we play baseball with y’all. I’m, um, glad you’re not lost. I, um, guess you need to be on your way. You take care now.” In many of my first-time experiences meeting people, I found they were surprised, maybe even shocked, to find an African-American female living among them. </p>

<p paraeid="{67c85810-64a3-410a-a2ea-80a92ab0c41b}{67}" paraid="2006410481">Most of my experiences confirmed that BLM and Forest Service managers are treated with respect. I found that if you communicate with and listen to people, and if you have a good reputation for knowing your job and making good decisions, people are willing to give you a chance. If you respect them, they respect you (regardless of color). I did not experience any outright prejudice. Employees and the public at large were more interested in how well I did my job than the color of my skin. The uniform and the position commanded respect. At the same time, the individual in the uniform had to earn that respect.  </p>

<p paraeid="{67c85810-64a3-410a-a2ea-80a92ab0c41b}{77}" paraid="223618826">I attribute my success in the BLM to the professional employees who worked for me. Most were awesome and knew their jobs and the geographic area I was responsible for. The professional women in the BLM also contributed to my success. They are a close-knit group, and in joining them, I found advocacy, support, and advice. Many of these women have become lifelong friends of mine and have supported me on and off the job. Elaine Zielinski, who was a BLM state director in the Pacific Northwest, turned out to be my best role model.  </p>

<p paraeid="{67c85810-64a3-410a-a2ea-80a92ab0c41b}{87}" paraid="988697152">I picked natural resources because I love the outdoors and being able to make decisions that make a difference in the environment and the communities we serve. I wanted one moment in time when I was more than I thought I could be. The BLM gave me lots of those moments that will last for an eternity.  </p>

<p>EL CENTRO, CA – Bureau of Land Management Law Enforcement Rangers will conduct driving under the influence (DUI) and registration checkpoints from Feb. 16-19, noon to 2 a.m., on BLM-managed public lands in Imperial County, within the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area.</p>

<p>Officers will look for signs of alcohol, drug impairment, proper registration and licensing. DUI checkpoints are placed in locations based on collision statistics, frequency of DUI arrests and safety, to deter impaired driving, both on-and off-road on public lands to keep visitors safe.</p>

<p>“The BLM wants everyone to have a fun and safe President’s holiday weekend. Be safe, don’t drink and ride, and remember to designate a sober driver. DUI laws apply on- and off-road,” said El Centro Field Manager Mathew Lohr.</p>

<p>The deterrent effect of DUI checkpoints is a proven resource in reducing the number of persons injured and killed in alcohol or drug related crashes.  Research indicates crashes involving an impaired driver can be reduced by up to 20 percent when well publicized DUI checkpoints and proactive DUI patrols are conducted routinely. The latest data by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration documents drunk-driving crashes claim more than 10,000 lives per year.</p>

<p>The BLM reminds the public that impaired driving is not just from alcohol. Some prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs may interfere with driving. Driving under the influence of marijuana is illegal. Drivers charged with a first-time DUI face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties, as well as a suspended license.</p>

<p>Law Enforcement Rangers are reminding everyone to ‘Report Drunk Drivers – Call 9-1-1.’ For more information, visit <a href="http://www.blm.gov/">www.blm.gov</a> and the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area’s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/BLMImperialSandDunes" target="_blank">Facebook page</a></p>
