BigCo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I don’t care if you work at a big company or are an individual
developer.
</p>
<p>
I care if you can make a contribution toward interop on the open web.
</p>
<p>
I’ve found over the years that sometimes devs at bigco’s can help
enormously (eg microsoft, netscape, automattic) but usually they are
harmful (apple, ibm, sun, google stand out as the worst). sometimes
companies play both roles (apple).
</p>
<p>
But i also know that bigco’s because they are big, have lots of
different ideas how the world should work. And that can help.

<h2 id="twitters-big-competitive-advantage">Twitter’s big competitive
advantage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I wrote this
<a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1760681139407360255">on
Twitter</a> this morning. Re-posted here with minimal editing. The fact
that I could write it on Twitter was the point.</i>
</p>
<p>
Twitter has one advantage over all the other social webs. no character
limit.
</p>
<p>
I started typing a post on Threads which has a large character limit
compared to the others, but ran out of space and decided to write it
over here in twitter instead.
</p>
<p>
yes they charge me $8 a month for it, but it’s worth it.
</p>
<p>
we have to get used to the idea of paying for value, it’s how we avoid
the messes of the last 20 years. esp if we can make sure we retain
copies of everything we write (guaranteed by using our own writing
tools, btw) which is another requirement for the new blogosphere.
</p>
<p>
btw, i’m having a blast these days. it’s like tinkerbell in peter pan.
all the open web needed was people to believe it exists for it to come
(back) into existence.
</p>
<p>
still diggin.
</p>
<p>
ps: i also like they have simple styling, but where are the freaking
links, twitter. do I have to pay another $8 to get those??
</p>
<p>
pps: the worst character limit is bluesky, i can’t write anything there.
too bad, it’s a really nice system otherwise.
</p>
<p>
ppps: it would be nice to give something like this a title so you don’t
have to read pgf after pgf to try to figure out where i’m going and if
you’re interested. so i gave it a title, using markdown syntax. maybe
they could just support markdown. hmmm.
</p>
<p>
pppps: i asked chatgpt to draw an illustration. that light in the middle
of the room is the open social web. it’s a vision of self-reliance,
empowerment and cooperation. I asked for the light to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell">tinkerbell</a>, but
i guess they were concerned the image might belong to someone. creeping
shitification.

to me. Sometimes they have longer hair or a beard or whatever, but it’s
still the same face as before. Also I have trouble figuring out which
Beatle is singing sometimes. On some songs it’s perfectly obvious,
others I have no clue. For example Norwegian Wood, Strawberry Fields and
Lucy in the Sky, that’s John of course. Right? Hey Jude, that’s clearly
Paul, as is Let it Be, Yesterday. But for years I didn’t know who sang
Lady Madonna. Martha My Dear? Paul could sing so many different kinds of
music. John, not so much. I guess. I’m still pretty unsure.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-gutsy-nyt-op-ed-columnists">Are there any gutsy
NYT op-ed columnists?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Certainly <i>one</i> of the NYT columnists must have noticed that the
management is playing a dangerous game with our election.
</p>
<p>
When are they going to write a column raising the question of how
non-transparent the process is, and how dangerous it has become.
</p>
<p>
Might take a bit of courage to do that, and being willing to put your
career on the line, for all of us.
</p>
<p>
Just asking the question, even if they fired you, seems as big an issue
as the question raised by the special prosecutor re Biden’s age?
</p>
<p>
I’ve been a columnist for a somewhat major publication myself, and I
promise you, if I were witnessing what’s going on at the NYT, I’d submit
the column, and if they didn’t run it, I’d offer it to their
competitors, and if they wouldn’t take it, I’d run it publicly on a
blog, and say that they wouldn’t run it.
</p>
<p>
You can’t really witness something like this without speaking up. They
gave you the platform, you should use it.

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Water
cooling is overkill for Pi 5</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: 52Pi and Seeed Studio&#39;s water cooling solution for the Raspberry Pi 5 can be fun, and works better than any other solution—but at a &lt;em&gt;steep&lt;/em&gt; price, and with a number of annoying quirks.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
<img class="insert-image" width="700" height="auto" alt="Ice Pump water cooling block installed on Raspberry Pi 5" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/ice-pump-installed-pi-5-hero.jpg">
</p>
<p>
A few months ago, 52Pi reached out and asked if they could send a new
water cooling kit they were working on for the Raspberry Pi 5. At the
time, the hope was we could figure out a way to get very high overclock
with adequate cooling.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately—for reasons I’ll explore more soon—the Pi 5 can’t
overclock beyond 3.0 GHz (it’s not physically possible). Some of why is
explained in my blog post
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-underclocking-raspberry-pi-5">Overclocking
and <em>Underclocking</em> the Raspberry Pi 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
But water cooling is still fun, and the product is in production now, so
I figured I’d still give it a fair shot, and see if I thought it might
be worth buying for certain niche use cases.

<p>date: 2024-02-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is the (work in progress) SunOS jdk builder. The aim is to
attempt to download, patch, and build any relevant jdk tag, and do so
for SPARC and x86, and for illumos and Solaris 11.4. It has currently
been spot-tested on current illumos/x86 (specifically Tribblix m32). It
is dependent on the jdk-sunos-patches repository, which holds all the
patches for each tag. ↫ Peter Tribble Built by Peter Tribble, the same
person behind Tribblix, and he’s published a blog post with more details
about this project. I’ve definitely been seeing an uptick recently in
interest in Solaris, which is great to see. It’s gotten me interested in
installing Tribblix on my dual-Xeon workstation to see just how much
I’ve been missing since last using Solaris like 15-20 years ago.</p>

this quote from a <a href="https://wapo.st/48uLvKF">WP article</a> about
a court ruling on abortion in Alabama. “Women who actually know what
happened, feel under attack and almost powerless.” When historians look
back on this election, they will be amazed that all the attention wasn’t
focused on reproductive rights, esp when 1. It mattered so much to
virtually every American, in very real non-abstract ways, and 2. There
was such a dramatic difference between the two parties and candidates on
this issue. I think I understand why journalism can’t get there. Because
they would have to turn the agenda over to the people, and give up a
power they have and enjoy, even if that power has repeatedly sent us
wildly in the wrong direction, focusing on things that don’t matter as
much as the gut-wrenching decision Americans have to make this year. Do
we want to let Republicans enslave women, 1/2 half the populace, or do
we want to return to the way things were before Dobbs. I don’t have to
explain. Very few people on the fence here. What we need are people
directly affected by this situation, women of childbearing age, and let
them speak, over and over, every day, about all the ways their lives are
turned upside down by the direction the Repubs are taking us. No longer
<i>trying</i> to take us. There isn’t much to argue about here, it’s
fairly black and white and it is a real division, not one of the
bullshit devisions the Repubs have been able to trick the journalists to
focus on.</p>

<h2 id="pg_dumpbinary-v2.15-released">pg_dumpbinary v2.15 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-21, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Zurich, Switzerland - Febuary 14th, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
Version 2.15 has been published, this release adds a new option and
fixes a bug reported by users since last release.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add -w, –where command line option to pg_dumpbinary to apply a filter to
the data dumped. The filter will be used in a WHERE clause for data
export, this clause will be applied to all tables dumped.
</li>
<li>
Fix error “DBD::Pg::db do failed: server closed the connection
unexpectedly” when the attempt to dump the pre-data section fail.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full list of changes and acknowledgments can be found
<a href="https://github.com/lzlabs/pg_dumpbinary/releases/tag/v2.15">here</a>
</p>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first ‘\0’, resulting in data loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.

<h2 id="a-tale-of-three-architectures">A tale of three
architectures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
It’s been a couple years of working full-time on Luro and we’ve
travelled through at least three (or four?) different distinct
architectures. If that sounds like a lot, I’d agree. It’s been
educational to say the least.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s interesting to think about how apps grow and adapt over
years of contributions, so I thought I’d share how we evolved Luro. Each
refactor and re-architecture was a considered choice involving the
entire team and balancing business and customer needs at the time as
well as maintaining new feature velocity.
</p>
<p>
Here is the great retelling…
</p>
<h2>
v0: The Not-so Serverless Jamstack Hybrid Prototype
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Customer Need</strong>: Ability to preview application
</li>
<li>
<strong>Internal Need</strong>: Prove idea could work
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/v0.svg" alt="An architecture diagram with two boxes. The first box is labelled Netlify with two smaller boxes inside labelled “Nuxt” and “Express API inside Netlify Functions”. There is an arrow pointing from Nuxt to the Express API. The other box is labelled Digital Ocean and has three boxes inside: a “Node Background Server” with arrows pointing to a “MongoDB” and a “PostgreSQL DB”. There are arrows from Nuxt to the Node Background Sever and Express to the PostgreSQL DB. That lat arrow is labelled Prisma" />
</p>
<p>
The prototype version of Luro was a Serverless
<a href="https://nuxt.com/">Nuxt</a> app deployed entirely on
<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Each CRUD operation was
its own serverless function that connected to our Postgres database on
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>. Netlify and
its branch deploys allowed for rapid deployment and the ability to spin
up demo instances at a custom subdomain as we shopped the idea around.
</p>
<p>
This was a great proof of concept but we soon hit big pain points. The
biggest hurdle was that the serverless functions for all our endpoints
were taking upwards of <strong>20 minutes to build</strong>. That led to
flaky deployments so we combined all our serverless functions into an
Express app inside a single function. That took <strong>5 minutes to
build</strong>. This approach worked until…
</p>
<p>
Some features (e.g., Lighthouse) didn’t fit within
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html">Lambda’s
size limitations</a> (69 MB at the time) and our tasks were too long for
<a href="https://docs.netlify.com/functions/background-functions/">background
functions</a>. The solution was to standup a small Node service that
could handle longer tasks. Each Lighthouse run generates about 2 MB of
JSON data so we stored that inside a MongoDB that sat inside the Node
server.
</p>
<p>
A lot of moving parts but it worked enough to start having conversations
with customers and investors.
</p>
<h2>
v1: The Single-tenant Supermodel Monolith
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Customer Need</strong>: Isolated deployment environments
</li>
<li>
<strong>Internal Need</strong>: Reduce number of servers and services
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/v1.svg" alt="A server diagram with three identical boxes labelled Docker. Inside the Docker box is a box labelled Nuxt with an arrow pointing to a box labelled Express. Express points to a database outside the box labelled PostreSQL and one labelled S3. Nuxt also points to the S3 bucket. This is repeated 3 times." />
</p>
<p>
Our first batch of potential (enterprise) customers expressed a need to
deploy the app behind their firewall. Looking at our Nuxt + Express API
inside a Netlify Function + Node + Postgres + MongoDB franken-app
deployed across two separate web hosting platforms, we started exploring
a Docker setup to bundle all the moving parts.
</p>
<p>
This was an opportunity to simplify! And simplify we did.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We merged the Nuxt, Express, and Node app into a single app server. This
simplified the Docker setup and allowed us to start server rendering
Nuxt for a performance boost.
</li>
<li>
We also simplified our content model to a single database table. Before
our content types (prototypes, user tests, research, pages, etc.) were
in their own table but their schema was nearly identical
(<code>id</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>description</code>). That
separation is good until you need to duplicate a model and its views or
roll a feature out across all models and views. We made the decision to
use a single “supermodel” approach where all content types were in the
same table.
</li>
<li>
We eliminated MongoDB from the stack. One major challenge was our task
queue (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/agenda">agenda</a>) had a
hard-dependency on MongoDB. Through some effort we moved over to
<a href="https://worker.graphile.org/">graphile-worker</a> and used a
<code>json</code> field type in our PostgreSQL to store the big blobs of
JSON.
</li>
<li>
To make client responses smaller we stripped out the unused parts of the
Lighthouse report and streamlined it from 2 MB to 30 KB per report.
</li>
<li>
To smooth out customer deployments, we built a
<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> script with a CLI
interface to automate building isolated environments on Digital Ocean
with an app server, database, S3 bucket, as well as adding a new DNS
record to give instances their own vanity subdomain.
</li>
<li>
We moved the application off of Netlify simplified our hosting
situation. On the downside, in the move to Digital Ocean we lost our
branch deploy strategy. We propped up a staging server but it wasn’t the
same as an automated branch deploy.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After all these improvements the app felt like a lightweight machine.
</p>
<p>
Docker wasn’t utilized well but it made an easy pathway for deploying to
Digital Ocean. I’m glad we didn’t invest too much into Docker, because
over time it became a bottleneck we’d have to rip out.
</p>
<h2>
v2: The Multi-tenant Monolith
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Customer Need</strong>: Reduce onboarding friction
</li>
<li>
<strong>Internal Need</strong>: Less manual labor in setting up, tearing
down, and updating instances
</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/v2.svg" width="330" alt="A server diagram similar to the previous. Inside a box labelled Render is a box labelled Nuxt with an arrow pointing to a box labelled Express pointint to a database inside Render labelled PostgreSQL. Express also points to an S3 bucket outside of Render. Nuxt also points to the S3 bucket. Both Nuxt and Express point to a Logging database outside of the Render box as well." />
<p>
Through some positive investor pressure and some exhaustion setting up
customer installs, we decided the app should be more self-service. This
was a big undertaking.
</p>
<p>
While terraforming a new customer install wasn’t hard (CLI command + 10
minute build), the customer feedback loop was too long. Someone would
sign up for Luro, then we’d email them later, then they’d say “yes I
want it”, then it’d take 10 minutes to set up, then we’d send an email
“okay it’s ready”… that experience cut the winds of excitement out of
the sales funnel.
</p>
<p>
To make this work, we needed to create the idea of a <code>Team</code>
in Luro and make everythign belong to that team. Having Teams meant
having a new permission system, authentication system, and invitation
system. But the biggest need was to design and build new onboarding
flows throughout the application because we wouldn’t be doing “white
glove” installs anymore. This was a big lift for a small team.
</p>
<aside>
<h3>
“This would have been faster if we used Rails”
</h3>
<p>
For a brief moment we considered pivoting to Rails becuase it’s built
for multi-tenant applications. The Rails ecosystem also has good, free,
and battle-tested plugins and admin tooling. We commissioned a
prototype, but utlimately it felt weird to choose Rails in 2022. I also
have a sour taste from previous long-term Rails maintenance projects,
DHH was being a dick at the time, and even someone on Ruby core told me
“Nah, use <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>”, so I made the
decision to stick with Node.
</p>
</aside>
<p>
At the end of the three month sprint we made an impromptu decision to
move from Digital Ocean to <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>. Our
Docker deploys were <strong>taking 20 minutes to build</strong> the
image + 10 minutes switch over to the new image and stand up the
environment. That long feedback loop was killing us with design reviews.
We made the jump to Render, killed our <code>Dockerfile</code>, and got
back to <strong>5 minutes deploys</strong> and regained the ability to
have Preview Deploys for each PR. That was a slam dunk win-win.
</p>
<p>
This refactor was a lot of work (and re-work) but thanks to two
full-time hires we were ready to begin our Private Beta by the end of
the summer.
</p>
<h2>
v3: The Multi-tenant Microservice Monorepo
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Customer Need</strong>: Application uptime, reliability
</li>
<li>
<strong>Internal Need</strong>: Observability and isolation of services
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/v3.svg" alt="A server diagram with two main boxes. The first box is the Node Web App server with Nuxt and Express, with Nuxt pointing to Express. Next is a large box labelled Async Jobs with 3 boxes inside. The first box is labelled Cronjobs and has three chron jobs inside of it labelled cron1, cron2, cron3. Those point to the second element in the Async Jobs box called RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ then points to four apps in a box labelled Services called Screenshot, Analytics, Figma, Lighthouse. Those services as well as Express point to the PostgreSQL database. Screenshot, Express, and Nuxt all point to S3. And all servers and services point to Logging." />
</p>
<p>
As people signed up and began to use the application we discovered a new
set of problems. If one CPU intensive service (e.g. Lighthouse) had a
problem during its run, the entire application server would fall over
causing cascading service failures. The “stampede” of failures made it
difficult to debug the source of our problems.
</p>
<p>
The biggest improvement in observability was converting our monolith
into a microservice monorepo using Turborepo. Using
<a href="https://docs.render.com/blueprint-spec">Render’s Blueprint</a>
(Infrastructure as a Service) we could use YAML to configure servers for
each app and cronjob in the <code>apps/</code> folder.
</p>
<p>
We had some intermittent problems with <code>graphile-worker</code>
queue crashing so we pivoted to
<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> hosted on
<a href="https://www.cloudamqp.com/">CloudAMQP</a> as a message queue.
RabbitMQ is like Redis but a little bit more robust and a lot less
“build your own” functionality (monitoring, etc). Our apps or cronjobs
would post messages to specific queues and then the services would
process those specific queues.
</p>
<p>
With our services properly split up, we spent more time improving our
logging to ensure we had end-to-end error reporting. Each service logged
to its own bucket which was possibly overkill but if an error showed up
in the Lighthouse bucket we could pinpoint which part of the application
failed.
</p>
<p>
And this is the shape of the application today. It’s a pretty elegant
machine. We’re far from the days of servers crashing every weekend.
We’ve worked hard to stabilize the application and now it doesn’t make
much more than a peep.
</p>
<h2>
101 things I’ve learned about software architecture
</h2>
<p>
I’ve learned a lot about building and organizing large software projects
through this. If I had to do it all over again, I don’t think it would
be much different given the information we had at the time. With the
power of hindsight, we probably could have skipped one or two evolutions
but that was less of a lack of engineering imagination or foresight and
more product needing clearer business objectives. If we had dropped the
“white glove” idea earlier or had a narrower market
(<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tam-sam-som">TAM/SAM/SOM</a>)
we could have spotted opportunities further out.
</p>
<p>
I learned hundreds or thousands of lessons from all this but here’s my
Top 3 key takeaways…
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s always a “100 duck-sized horses vs one horse-sized duck”
problem
</h3>
<p>
There’s <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse-sized-duck">an old
internet question</a> about “Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized
horses or one horse-sized duck?” Well. Software is a lot like that. You
expand, then consolidate, expand, then consolidate. Over and over. For
example…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Jamstack app = 100 duck-sized horses
</li>
<li>
The Supermodel monolith = 1 horse-sized duck
</li>
<li>
Single-tenant deployments = 100 duck-sized horses
</li>
<li>
Multi-tenant app = 1 horse-sized duck
</li>
<li>
Microservice monorepo = 100 duck-sized horses
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even on the component level, you don’t want a bunch of bespoke tables,
so you create a <code>&lt;SuperTable/&gt;</code> component but then you
need a bunch of <code>&lt;BespokeCell/&gt;</code> components to slot
inside the table. At a certain point you can’t reduce complexity any
further and you’re left shifting complexity around and reshaping it. The
goal is to end up with something less complex or more predictable.
</p>
<p>
I think the correct answer is 100 duck-sized horses, but you need good
systems in place for managing that. And 5 to 10 is probably a better
number than 100.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Monorepos are pretty great
</h3>
<p>
For managing all those small apps, I recommend
<a href="https://turbo.build/">Turborepo</a>! Monorepos make it easy to
break up your application into separate services or shared packages
(like a design system). You can start the entire system with one command
from the terminal. You have less mysteries and phantom configs menacing
your codebase when everyone is working in the same neighborhood. You can
maintain velocity by changing an upstream API service and the UI layer
in a single PR with less flight control.
</p>
<p>
We had hints of a service-oriented architecture in our v0 Node
Background Server, but it existed outside (not alongside) the UI
application. Monorepos are not without their issues, but I’d reach for
Turborepo again for applications that don’t fit inside one folder on one
server.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>I over-index on the belief that we can fix it later
</h3>
<p>
I’m a firm believer in iteration and believe that in most situations we
can fix issues later. That can be an admirable quality, but it’s a
choice to create technical debt. At times the technical or style debt I
created blew up and we spent more time teasing out an abstraction later
on. If we had “done it right” the first time we would have saved time
but we also didn’t have enough information to make a proper abstraction
and would have fell victim to YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)
over-optimization.
</p>
<p>
In the end there were microadjustments we could have made but with the
pace of startup life (groan) you’re always in a hurry to do the next
thing, we balanced that fairly well.
</p>
<h2>
Just build websites
</h2>
<p>
This whole experience has taught me one valuable lesson: You learn a lot
by doing. You learn a lot by doing it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjSOZI90PmE">the long, hard,
stupid way</a>. And you learn a lot by working with other talented
people.

One thing that’s great about ChatGPT is they can help you make a

can ask for help making the decision. It’s making this human smarter,

I’m trying to decide whether I should get size 11 rental ski boots or
size 11.5. The person behind the counter at the rental place isn’t
capable of having a long conversation about this, where I get to ask two

Instead they would say sorry, what size did you say you wanted sir?

<h2 id="the-surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility">The
surprising truth about pixels and accessibility</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Should web developers use pixels or ems/rems for accessible fonts?
It’s an emotionally-charged question because there are a lot of
conflicting opinions out there, and it can be overwhelming. Maybe you’ve
heard that rems are better for accessibility. Or maybe you’ve heard that
the problem is fixed and pixels are fine? The truth is, if you want to
build the most-accessible product possible, you need to use both pixels

id="reddit-sells-training-data-to-unnamed-ai-company-ahead-of-ipo">Reddit
sells training data to unnamed AI company ahead of IPO</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Reddit has signed a contract
allowing an unnamed AI company to train its models on the site’s
content, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes as
the social media platform nears the introduction of its initial public
offering (IPO), which could happen as soon as next month. Reddit
initially revealed the deal, which is reported to be worth $60 million a
year, earlier in 2024 to potential investors of an anticipated IPO,
Bloomberg said. The Bloomberg source speculates that the contract could
serve as a model for future agreements with other AI companies. ↫ Benj
Edwards at Ars Technica Properly paying for the content you’re feeding
into your “AI” model is a huge improvement over just taking it without
users’ consent, but it does add yet another area of concern for users of
all kinds of platforms. Whatever you write, create, or post might be fed
into “AI” models without you ever realising it, and while the platform
you use gets paid for that, you aren’t. In any event, OSNews is not
selling your comments to an “AI” company, but with how old we are,
there’s no doubt both your comments and our stories have already found
their way into countless “AI” black holes.</p>

<h2 id="ghostbsd-24.01.1-released">GhostBSD 24.01.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>This new release is based on FreeBSD 14.0-STABLE. Update Station got
a significant change to upgrade to a major FreeBSD version, allowing
upgrading GhostBSD from 13.2-STABLE to 14.0-STABLE. Also, a major change
to the installer is the user created is an admin, and the root user gets
the same password as the admin. If the admin password is changed after
the installation, the root password will not change. ↫ GhostBSD’s
website GhostBSD is a user-friendly, desktop-first ‘distribution’ of
FreeBSD – a project which, in my humble view, should be part of the
FreeBSD project-proper. With some old-time Linux feeling a sense of
disenfranchisement towards Linux due to things like Wayland and systemd,
FreeBSD could serve as an excellent alternative, and an official
desktop-first ISO could play a role in that. Of course, that’s not
exactly core to FreeBSD’s mission, and they really shouldn’t be
listening to idiots like me, but I think it’s an idea worth
pondering.</p>

<h2 id="my-todo-list-is-a-.txt-file-on-the-desktop">My TODO list is a

<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">My
TODO list is a .txt file on the desktop</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;About six months ago, I finally reached a breaking point: my email-based TODO system stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
It was beyond its breaking point for a few years, actually… ever since I
my average daily email volume increase from maybe 5-10 ‘important’
emails to deal with to 50+.
</p>
<p>
My email-based TODO system used to go like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Email myself things I deemed important enough to do the next day
</li>
<li>
Next morning, when I checked my email, knock off the top item in that
list, and try to work down the list a bit
</li>
<li>
Anything else, forward that email again for the next day
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once an item got maybe 5-10 <code>Fwd:</code>s in the Subject line, I
would decide whether to nix the TODO item entirely, or move it off into
a Trello board—in either case, likely to be forgotten forever.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t say the system was <em>good</em>.
</p>
<p>
But it did work, before my inbox became full of <em>actually important
stuff</em> relating to running my business.

game to be released for the ARM processor, and it is both a milestone
and a masterpiece. My hope is that this site will be useful for those
who want to learn more about Lander and what makes it tick. It is
provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping
people appreciate the second classic game from this legend of 3D coding
(the first classic being Elite, of course). ↫ Mark Moxon An incredibly

<p><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/293">Random
thought</a> – maybe the fastest way to get full ActivityPub support for
WordPress is to offer a feature in any WP site to cross-post to a
Mastodon gateway operated by Automattic. It’s possible I don’t
understand the problem of course. But Mastodon is open source, so it’s
not like depending on another vendor to do this for you. And then you
avoid all the hassles with having to say what part of the protocol is
ActivityPub and what part is Mastodon’s API.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I’ve
mostly kept Trump off the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a>
of this blog since he left office in 2021, but things are changing, and
this is shaping up as a Trump year. I read today in the NYT that the
resistance
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Wk0.0hoY.duTfLtk_PUxj&smid=url-share">is
exhausted</a>. Bullshit. We’re very well rested. Anyway I look forward
to once again, pretending Trump doesn’t exist, next year or the year
after, Murphy-willing.
</p>
<p>
The other day when I was skiing at
<a href="https://www.belleayre.com/">Belleayre</a>, I got to ride up on
a chairlift with a Trump supporter. He told me he got Covid but it
wasn’t a big deal, just like a cold. I said a lot of people died from
Covid. He said most were already sick or overweight. I said yeah but
they deserve to live too. He said he didn’t get vaccinated, he doesn’t
like to put drugs in his body. What bullshit I muttered under my breath.
I looked at him, maybe ten years younger than me. From New Jersey, a
house painter. I said that my life has been saved by drugs at least
twice, once when I was perfectly healthy other than having a ruptured
appendix at 9 years old. I also said you’re really lucky not to have
needed medical care, but before you die I bet you will. And I thought to
myself but didn’t say out loud that what about your parents and
grandparents, siblings even children? Have they all been perfectly
healthy until they died? Anyway a chairlift is not a safe place for real
anger, but – you also can’t walk away from the other person. There’s a
lot of soul-sharing on rides like that.

makes so much sense. A few weeks ago, my local supermarket converted to
a “Woolworths Metro” store, and I had no idea what the implications of
that were, except that they stopped stocking some stuff I actually want
and need (cooking ingredients, mainly) in favour of expanding their
range of potato chips. <em>Now</em> I see why they’ve done this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[W]hile Woolworths supermarkets are subject to a flat pricing system —
which means all products except fresh produce are sold at the same price
wherever you are in the country — the same does not apply to Metros.

I don’t have a concrete plan, but to run Swift user code on iGodot I am
contemplating a few options:

<p>
<ul>
<li>exploring the LLVM interpreter to run the code<br />- exploring
compiling to wasm and bridge wasm

I suspect SIL is too fluid to build and interpreter for.

<h1>
2024-02-18 We’re in Valais again
</h1>
<p>
Oh yeah. Hiking down on the valley floor. There’s a nice dry forest.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Pfynwald or Bois de Finges is a natural reserve and one of the
largest continuous Scots pine forests of Europe. It is located on the
language border between German- and French-speaking Valais, Switzerland,
on the alluvial cone below the Illgraben valley. –
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfynwald">Pfynwald</a>, on
Wikipedia
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The trail started along site names like Hexenplatz (witche’s square) and
Galgenweg (gallow way). Creepy.
</p>
<p>
The forest was nice, though. Very different from the forest we have
around Zürich.
</p>
<p>
It is dry and coniferous.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
A trail leads through a dry forest with snow covered mountains in the
back.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The trail continues.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illgraben">Illgraben</a>. It is
very unstable. Wikipedia says there are mudflows two or three times a
year.
</p>
<p>
No water is visible but there’s a big scar in the ground.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking into the Illgraben we see how the edge keeps crumbling. There’s
a barrier made of twigs whenever the trail comes close to the edge.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This is the Bhutan bridge, designed by engineers and blessed by priests
living in France. It is a result of 2002 being the
<a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/263509">International Year
of Mountains</a>. It’s a hanging bridge that crosses the Illgraben.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, there are actually tracks of some sort of construction
vehicle in the valley.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-7.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We saw some <em>Hepatica nobilis</em> (Leberblümchen).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-8.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-9.jpg" alt="" />

</p>
<p>
A rock covered in moss.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
A huge rock cliff rising behind the forest.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-12.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
A tree felled by beavers. We loved that water-logged part of the hike.
We didn’t see any beavers, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-13.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There were two stone towers we saw. I fear these were built for hermits.
What a shit way to spend the few days you have in life.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-14.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
As the sun begins to set, we see the industrial zone of Sierre.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-15.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Just as we were about to leave the forest, we saw <em>Pulsatilla
vulgaris</em> (Küchenschelle).

<h2 id="on-dreams-and-goals">On dreams and goals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-18, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I don’t know about you but I spent most of my life not knowing what I
wanted to do. I never had dreams or big goals. Never had a dream job,
never aimed for something specific. I spent most of my life drifting
through it, without trying to stir the ship all that much. I don’t know
why I did it, it’s probably because of the kind of person I am. I never
knew what I wanted to do, but I think I do now. It only took me 34
years, 7 months, and 12 days.
</p>
<p>
Over the past couple of years, my mind has slowly pieced things
together. I stumbled on this profession of website maker almost at
random and in the same random way I found myself starting a blog. I had
no idea what I was doing back then, and I still don’t, to be totally
honest with you. This blog is a bizarre mix of rants and half-baked
thoughts on whatever topic is floating in my mind at any given moment.
</p>
<p>
But through this mix of random events, I stumbled on something great. I
stumbled on you. Yes, you, the person reading this. You represent
everything that’s great about the web and personal websites. You are a
gateway through which I can access new places, and new realities. You
are an opportunity to learn new things, and to expand my horizons.
</p>
<p>
Being able to interact with people is by far the best outcome of this
website. And I think more people should be able to experience that.
Because it’s important. And that’s my goal. That’s what I decided I want
to try to do more of. I want to try, as much as I can, to help people go
online with a personal website they own. That’s why I made
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms">that list of blog
platforms the other day</a>, that’s also why I’m going to make available
a few blog designs I coded a while back. But it’s also why I’m going to
keep encouraging people to ditch social media, and why I’m going to
spend time replying to every single person that gets in touch with me.
And it’s also why I’m going to start designing and coding bespoke
websites, for free. I’m not going to be able to make a ton of those
unfortunately because, as you can imagine, I have to earn money somehow,
and that somehow is doing client work that will consume most of my days.
</p>
<p>
The title of this post mentions dreams though, not just goals. The goal
is to spend as much time as possible helping people ditching social
media and going online with personal websites. The dream is for that to
be my actual full-time job. A job that’s entirely supported by the
kindness and the generosity of the people who decide to join my
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">One a Month</a>
membership thingy.
</p>
<p>
Can that dream become a reality? Hard for me to say. As of right now,
some very generous people are providing around 5% of what I need to earn
every month to live my normal life and I’m incredibly grateful for that.
</p>
<p>
That’s my goal, that’s my dream. I’m genuinely happy to have finally
figured it out and I’m grateful to the people who have helped me come to
this realization. You can expect more weird experiments in the upcoming
months and if you need help going online with your website, please,
<a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">get in touch</a>. I’m happy to
help. And if you can and want to support this bizarre life mission,
consider joining the <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">One a
Month club</a>.

<p>
I was talking with
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a>,
<a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@splitbrain" title="@splitbrain@octodon.social"><span

<a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> about git logs. I
claimed the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Git does not have wiki culture. If I could rebase and squash and edit to
my hearts delight, that would work for me. But git has blockchain
culture: write once, append only, no take-backs, and I don’t like it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The reason I say this is because the artefact I’m interested in is the
git log as a readable text. When I need to upgrade software such as
Mojolicious or GoToSocial, I often look at a release page, but I hardly
every look at the details. I don’t care for long lists of issues and I
certainly do not read the git log.
</p>
<p>
My claim is that the git log is useless for the purposes of learning
about new features added or migrations to run during upgrades. And my
own commit logs are just as useless because I don’t dare edit and squash
the history. The git log is simply a comment for the edits made to the
code and does not serve as a replacement for release notes, as far as I
am concerned.
</p>
<p>
So, while it is true that the wiki history is not edited either, the
wiki text as the readable end-product is in fact edited. The git log and
its messages are not.
</p>
<p>
I guess I’m an undisciplined programmer who is convinced the feature is
done and then discovers an edge case, and the I realize I forgot the
docs, and then I find a better way to describe it, oh and here is a test
that makes sense, oh and I found a typo and here is a grammar fix. It’s
hard for me to know when the feature is done-done. There never is a good
point where I think to myself: Now is a good point to merge.
</p>
<p>
This is just like buying and selling stock. It is hard to know what the
future brings. All that you can do is try and make sure there are no
catastrophic failures when things go wrong.
</p>
<p>
The Perl code archive (CPAN) suggests a <code>Changes</code> file. I
think I’ll try that.

<blockquote>

Git does not have wiki culture. […] But git has blockchain culture
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s not quite what you started with. I said git has wiki culture. Git
makes the entire software world one big wiki. I had just been reflecting
on that earlier, finally having fixed* a long standing bug in markdowku.
That’s such a marvel to me, that thanks to git I could make a version
that works for me and my friends and I could send the fix upstream so
they could apply it or not. When I see a typo or error on a webpage, if
that webpage is a wiki, I can fix, I can fix! And thanks to git, it
makes even more things be like wikis in that regard.
</p>
<p>
Git is not a linear line of append append append. It’s a flexible bowl
of paperclips, malleable, friendly, it helps me, it’s my friend. If
upstream doesn’t merge I’m still gonna be OK. I love git. Don’t slag it.
</p>
<p>
And the log isn’t just linear either: it makes the source repo be like a
wiki in that there’s both a global “recent changes” and a local “page
history” for each file, even each line with a good blame viewer.
</p>
<p>
Now, is documentation outside of the log, for migrations for example, a
good idea? Yes. We want README and INSTALL and TODO and COPYING, we want
docs. Never disputed that.
</p>
<p>
*: here’s hoping 🤞🏻

wow, sounds like IT hell! Or perhaps my own commit log is just so badly
written. And the only commits I know are from the office and they are
the worst.

<dd>
Git logs are wiki culture

If I could rebase and squash and edit to my hearts delight, that would
work for me. But git has blockchain culture, write once, append only, no
take-backs, and I don’t like it. So effectively I’d like a user-facing
Changes file.

Not tomorrow. Now. But, if you must put it off, go first to St James’s

is in the air and the pelicans are feeling it. Watch pelicans mate - in

how much you have still to learn about the mysteries of desire. Then run

<h2 id="running-gnu-on-dos-with-djgpp">Running GNU on DOS with
DJGPP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>I remember using DJGPP back in the 1990s before I had been exposed to
Linux and feeling that it was a strange beast. Compared to the Microsoft
C Compiler and Turbo C++, the tooling was bloated and alien to DOS, and
the resulting binaries were huge. But DJGPP provided a complete
development environment for free, which I got from a monthly magazine,
and I could even look at its source code if I wished. You can’t imagine
what a big deal that was at the time. But even if I could look under the
cover, I never did. I never really understood why was DJGPP so strange,
slow, and huge, or why it even existed. Until now. As I’m in the mood of
looking back, I’ve spent the last couple of months figuring out what the
foundations of this software were and how it actually worked. Part of
this research has resulted in the previous two posts on DOS memory
management. And part of this research is this article. Let’s take a
look! ↫ Julio Merino Having access to tools such as this, including the
source code, must’ve been a huge deal to a lot of people, even if ti was
“strange, slow, and huge” as the author notes.</p>
