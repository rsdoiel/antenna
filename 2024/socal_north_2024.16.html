California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated April 14 at 9:15 p.m.</em> Some say
perfection is impossible. The Bruins, however, disagree with the
naysayers. “20-0, that’s an amazing record,” said freshman goalkeeper
Lauren Steele.</p>

<p><em>This post was updated April 14 at 9:22 p.m.</em> Merrick McHenry
knocked down a block assist to clinch the first set for the Bruins.
Quickly after, the redshirt senior middle blocker put his hands to his
face and sprinted to the locker rooms before reemerging on the other
side.</p>

women’s tennis closes out regular-season home slate with win over
Oregon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>A loud declaration washed through a sea of largely empty seats. It
didn’t come from any chair umpire, coach or active player. Instead,
Kimmi Hance projected the rallying cry through an orange cone following
each singles set won.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated April 14 at 9:17 p.m.</em> The monotonous
loop of “Still D.R.E.,” “California Love” and the cheers and jeers of
UCLA football players ground to a halt Saturday morning.</p>

beach volleyball bests rival USC to win Center of Effort Challenge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Robert Frost once said, “Nothing gold can stay.” Senior Tessa Van
Winkle and graduate student Jaden Whitmarsh worked together to prove
Frost wrong Saturday. In the final match of the Center of Effort
Challenge first-place duel, Van Winkle and Whitmarsh took their USC
counterparts to a three-set battle in which they walked away victorious
after dropping the first set.</p>
