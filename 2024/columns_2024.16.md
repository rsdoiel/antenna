## I‚Äôm AirChatting

There&#160;have been multiple attempts to create a new social network that tries to mimic Twitter as a short-text-oriented real-time&#160;platform ever since Twitter (nee X) started to fray.&#160;Mastodon is the choice of the proponents of the Indie web; BlueSky, a network promoted by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, and Warpcast, which has its roots in the decentralized &#8230;

Some time a go a colleague commenting on the idea of iterative prompting, suggested to ask GPT to ‚Äúthink about something‚Äù and then make a decision on what to write or not to write. The problem with this approach is that a session with an LLM doesn‚Äôt really have a memory outside the actual text &#8230; <a href="https://val.demar.in/2024/04/the-think-of-a-number-fallacy/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "The ‚Äúthink of a number‚Äù fallacy"</span></a>

## A blogroll on a Drummer blog

date: 2024-04-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>How to add a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">FeedLand blogroll</a> to a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">Drummer blog</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>You must have a Drummer blog and a FeedLand account.</li>
<li>You can specify that all the feeds you're subscribed to are in your blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in the blogroll. </li>
<li>The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new post, it goes to the top of the list.</li>
<li>You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the pubdate to go to the full item on the web. </li>
<li>It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the list, Return to expand/collapse. </li>
<li>We're working on WordPress plugin. </li>
</ul>
<p>Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required. </p>
<ul>
<li>blogrollUsername -- required</li>
<li>blogrollServer -- optional, if not specified it's feedland.com</li>
<li>blogrollCategory -- optional</li>
<li>blogrollTitle -- optional, but you really should provide a title, otherwise we invent a silly one for you. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/15/headlevelatts.png">Screen shot</a> of how the head-level attributes are set on <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/bullmancuso@gmail.com/">Bull Mancuso's blog</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/15/bullblogscreenshot.png">Screen shot</a> of the blog itself with the blogroll.</p>
<p>A link to Bull's blogroll <a href="https://feedland.com/?username=bullmancuso&catname=blogroll">category</a> on feedland.com.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/303">place</a> to ask questions offer kudos, etc. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>
<p>PS: I'm not trying to sell you on using Drummer to run a blog. Rather I needed a place to figure out how this works, so we know how to set up and document the WordPress plugin. </p>

## New Lattice Cryptanalytic Technique

date: 2024-04-15, updated: 2024-04-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">new paper</a> presents a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving certain hard lattice problems. This could be a big deal for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, since many of them base their security on hard lattice problems.</p>
<p>A few things to note. One, this paper has not yet been peer reviewed. As <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/111385/polynomial-time-quantum-algorithms-for-lattice-problems">this comment</a> points out: &#8220;We had already some cases where efficient quantum algorithms for lattice problems were discovered, but they turned out <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41731/new-quantum-attack-on-lattices-or-shor-strikes-again?rq=1">not being correct</a> or only worked for <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/95187/what-does-the-work-an-efficient-quantum-algorithm-for-lattice-problems-achievin">simple special cases</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two, this is a quantum algorithm, which means that it has not been tested. There is a wide gulf between quantum algorithms in theory and in practice. And until we can actually code and test these algorithms, we should be suspicious of their speed and complexity claims...</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/14/georgeHarrison.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I want to work with the best developers, I don't care where they work. It occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a> about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software. After waiting a whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short periods, but it's most of the time it's been people trying to deconstruct and reinvent other people's work, not build on it. I'm still open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more time.

I don't like that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and everything they (don't) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks (and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won't be any of us left, everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall, because you can't win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather they're feeding an addiction.
