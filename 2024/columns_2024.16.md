## The “think of a number” fallacy

date: 2024-04-15, from: Paolo Valdemarin's blog

Some time a go a colleague commenting on the idea of iterative prompting, suggested to ask GPT to “think about something” and then make a decision on what to write or not to write. The problem with this approach is that a session with an LLM doesn’t really have a memory outside the actual text &#8230; <a href="https://val.demar.in/2024/04/the-think-of-a-number-fallacy/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "The “think of a number” fallacy"</span></a>

## New Lattice Cryptanalytic Technique

date: 2024-04-15, updated: 2024-04-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">new paper</a> presents a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving certain hard lattice problems. This could be a big deal for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, since many of them base their security on hard lattice problems.</p>
<p>A few things to note. One, this paper has not yet been peer reviewed. As <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/111385/polynomial-time-quantum-algorithms-for-lattice-problems">this comment</a> points out: &#8220;We had already some cases where efficient quantum algorithms for lattice problems were discovered, but they turned out <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41731/new-quantum-attack-on-lattices-or-shor-strikes-again?rq=1">not being correct</a> or only worked for <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/95187/what-does-the-work-an-efficient-quantum-algorithm-for-lattice-problems-achievin">simple special cases</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two, this is a quantum algorithm, which means that it has not been tested. There is a wide gulf between quantum algorithms in theory and in practice. And until we can actually code and test these algorithms, we should be suspicious of their speed and complexity claims...</p>

## Language in the always on world

The house is full of slightly random books. I picked up one sent to Rory, Because Internet: Understanding how language is changing by Gretchen McCulloch, a few years old now.
