Valid 231630Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR NORTHWEST
TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail
(potentially 2+ inch diameter) and gusts to 65 mph will be possible
this afternoon and evening across northwest Texas.

...Northwest TX...
Visible satellite imagery and surface analysis this morning indicate
the initial stage of moisture return is occurring across the
southern Great Plains in the wake of a frontal intrusion into the
Gulf a few days ago.  A mid-level ridge will increasingly become
established across the central/southern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains as a Great Lakes disturbance gradually becomes more displaced
from the region.  An associated cold front will move southward
across KS/OK before eventually stalling tonight across southeast OK
and northwest TX.  Weak lee cyclogenesis will aid in maintaining a
southerly low-level fetch across central into west TX as strong
heating results in a sharpening dryline by late afternoon.  Isolated
thunderstorm development will be most probable near the triple point
20-22Z.  Steep lapse rates coupled with adequate moisture (1500-2000
J/kg MLCAPE) and veering flow beneath moderate westerlies, will
support an initial supercell mode.  Isolated very large hail of
2-2.5 inches in diameter will be the main threat, along with a few
55-65 mph gusts.

...Northern IL/southeast WI/Lower MI late this afternoon/evening...
Have not changed the existing outlook for this region due primarily
to consistency in model data and the forecast conceptual model not
deviating.  Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid-level
trough over the Upper Midwest and this will continue southeast into
the central Great Lakes by mid evening.  An associated surface
trough will likewise move southeastward, and this trough will be
preceded by a band of rain with minimal buoyancy.  Behind the rain
band, surface heating with steepening low-level lapse rates and
cooling midlevel temperatures will support weak surface-based
buoyancy just ahead of a secondary frontal surge.  Some low-topped
convection will be possible late this afternoon through late evening
from northern IL/southeast WI into Lower MI.  The stronger storms
could yield a localized marginal hail/damaging wind threat.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1107 AM CDT Tue Apr 23 2024

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no changes
or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 04/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CDT Tue Apr 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance east-southeastward from the Midwest
toward the Northeast through the period, while an upper ridge
encompasses much of the West. On the backside of the midlevel
trough, a post-frontal air mass will infiltrate the northern and
central Plains, where breezy/gusty northerly surface winds are
expected. Over portions of southern NE and KS, these winds could
briefly overlap 20-30 percent afternoon RH, favoring locally
elevated fire-weather conditions -- given receptive fuels across the
area. However, these conditions appear too brief and marginal for
Elevated highlights at this time.

Farther west, dry/breezy conditions are expected across the
Southwest during the afternoon. However, fuels are generally not
supportive of large fires at this time.

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING ACROSS NORTHWEST TX...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail (2+
inch diameter) and gusts to 65 mph will be possible this afternoon
and evening across northwest Texas. Additional strong storms
producing hail up to 1 inch diameter and gusts up to 60 mph are
possible from southeast Wisconsin and northern Illinois into Lower
Michigan.

...Northwest TX area this afternoon/evening...
No appreciable changes to the prior outlook.  In the wake of a
midlevel trough crossing the Great Lakes, a surface cold front will
move southward across KS/OK today, eventually stalling by tonight
across southeast OK and northwest TX.  There will be sufficient
cross-Rockies flow aloft for lee cyclogenesis across eastern NM and
adjacent west central TX, which will maintain southerly low-level
flow and northward advection of a modifying western Gulf air mass
into the frontal zone by mid-late afternoon.  Strong surface heating
along the west edge of the returning moisture will result in a
sharpening dryline by late afternoon, with a dryline/front triple
point likely just off the Caprock.  Isolated thunderstorm
development will be most probable near the triple point after 21z,
and convection will subsequently move southeastward before weakening
by late evening.  The storm environment will be characterized by
moderate buoyancy (MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg), steep midlevel lapse
rates near 9 C/km, and sufficient deep-layer shear for supercells. 
Isolated very large hail of 2-2.5 inches in diameter will be the
main threat, along with a few 55-65 mph outflow gusts.

...Northern IL/southeast WI/Lower MI late this afternoon/evening...
Only minor changes to the MRGL risk area in lower MI.  A midlevel
trough over the upper MS Valley this morning will continue
east-southeastward over the Great Lakes by Wednesday morning.  An
associated surface trough will likewise move southeastward, and this
trough will be preceded by a band of rain with minimal buoyancy. 
Behind the rain band, surface heating with steepening low-level
lapse rates and cooling midlevel temperatures will support weak
surface-based buoyancy just ahead of a secondary frontal surge. 
Some low-topped convection will be possible in this zone late this
afternoon through late evening from northern IL/southeast WI into
lower MI.  The storms could pose a marginal hail/wind threat.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

A relatively active fire weather pattern is poised to set up across
the southern High Plains late this week through this weekend. By
Thursday, the first in a series of mid-level troughs will approach
the southern Rockies, with surface low development likely across the
central High Plains. By Thursday afternoon, a dryline will surge
eastward across the southern High Plains, with Critically dry and
windy conditions occurring behind the dryline. For Friday through
the weekend, the approach/passage of another mid-level trough and
associated surface cyclone will support continued eastward dryline
surges over the southern High Plains, accompanied by Critically dry
and windy conditions each afternoon. 70 percent Critical
probabilities have been issued Days 4-6 (Thursday-Saturday) where
Critical conditions should be most prolonged, and where fuels are
most receptive to wildfire spread. Dry conditions should persist
across the southern High Plains into early next week, though it is
currently unclear if the surface winds will approach Critical
thresholds.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER FAR
SOUTHEASTERN FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to locally severe thunderstorms, capable of marginally severe
wind gusts and hail, remain possible near the southeast Florida
coast this afternoon.

No changes were made to the ongoing outlook.

A low threat of severe storms remains this afternoon for the coastal
counties of far southeastern FL. Storms are ongoing near a weak
boundary, with 1500+ J/kg MUCAPE present. Locally strong gusts or
brief/marginal hail may occur over the next few hours, prior to
storms moving offshore.

..Jewell.. 04/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1111 AM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024/

...South FL...
Visible satellite imagery shows a swelling cumulus field over the
Everglades and South FL ahead of a southward-progressing cold front
over the northern part of the Everglades.  A mid-level shortwave
trough located over the Carolinas/northeast Gulf of Mexico
--embedded within a larger-scale eastern North America trough-- will
continue east into the western Atlantic through the evening. 
Continued warming of a moist airmass across south FL will yield
moderate destabilization.  Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to
develop in the vicinity of the front through the mid afternoon. 
Long, straight hodographs combined with more than adequate CAPE will
potentially yield a couple of organized storms.  An isolated risk
for large hail and/or localized damaging gust will be the primary
hazards with the most intense storms.  This activity will push east
of the coast by early evening.  

Elsewhere, quiescent conditions will prevail across a large part of
the contiguous United States.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains unchanged.

..Squitieri.. 04/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024/

...Synopsis...
Breezy/gusty post-frontal winds are expected across portions of the
northern and central Plains on Tuesday. Over portions of southern NE
and KS, these winds could briefly overlap 25-30 percent RH during
the afternoon, given ample boundary-layer heating/drying. As a
result, locally/briefly elevated fire-weather conditions are
possible. Farther west, midlevel southwesterly flow will develop
across the Southwest -- ahead of an approaching large-scale trough.
While this will likely support an overlap of breezy surface winds
and low RH across the region, fuels are generally not supportive of
large-fire spread at this time.
