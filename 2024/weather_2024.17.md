Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

A relatively active fire weather pattern is poised to set up across
the southern High Plains late this week through this weekend. By
Thursday, the first in a series of mid-level troughs will approach
the southern Rockies, with surface low development likely across the
central High Plains. By Thursday afternoon, a dryline will surge
eastward across the southern High Plains, with Critically dry and
windy conditions occurring behind the dryline. For Friday through
the weekend, the approach/passage of another mid-level trough and
associated surface cyclone will support continued eastward dryline
surges over the southern High Plains, accompanied by Critically dry
and windy conditions each afternoon. 70 percent Critical
probabilities have been issued Days 4-6 (Thursday-Saturday) where
Critical conditions should be most prolonged, and where fuels are
most receptive to wildfire spread. Dry conditions should persist
across the southern High Plains into early next week, though it is
currently unclear if the surface winds will approach Critical
thresholds.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER FAR
SOUTHEASTERN FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to locally severe thunderstorms, capable of marginally severe
wind gusts and hail, remain possible near the southeast Florida
coast this afternoon.

No changes were made to the ongoing outlook.

A low threat of severe storms remains this afternoon for the coastal
counties of far southeastern FL. Storms are ongoing near a weak
boundary, with 1500+ J/kg MUCAPE present. Locally strong gusts or
brief/marginal hail may occur over the next few hours, prior to
storms moving offshore.

..Jewell.. 04/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1111 AM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024/

...South FL...
Visible satellite imagery shows a swelling cumulus field over the
Everglades and South FL ahead of a southward-progressing cold front
over the northern part of the Everglades.  A mid-level shortwave
trough located over the Carolinas/northeast Gulf of Mexico
--embedded within a larger-scale eastern North America trough-- will
continue east into the western Atlantic through the evening. 
Continued warming of a moist airmass across south FL will yield
moderate destabilization.  Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to
develop in the vicinity of the front through the mid afternoon. 
Long, straight hodographs combined with more than adequate CAPE will
potentially yield a couple of organized storms.  An isolated risk
for large hail and/or localized damaging gust will be the primary
hazards with the most intense storms.  This activity will push east
of the coast by early evening.  

Elsewhere, quiescent conditions will prevail across a large part of
the contiguous United States.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 PM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains unchanged.

..Squitieri.. 04/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024/

...Synopsis...
Breezy/gusty post-frontal winds are expected across portions of the
northern and central Plains on Tuesday. Over portions of southern NE
and KS, these winds could briefly overlap 25-30 percent RH during
the afternoon, given ample boundary-layer heating/drying. As a
result, locally/briefly elevated fire-weather conditions are
possible. Farther west, midlevel southwesterly flow will develop
across the Southwest -- ahead of an approaching large-scale trough.
While this will likely support an overlap of breezy surface winds
and low RH across the region, fuels are generally not supportive of
large-fire spread at this time.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTH
FLORIDA AND SOUTH GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging gusts and marginally severe hail will be possible
for a few hours this afternoon/evening across south Georgia and
north Florida.

...North FL/south GA this afternoon/evening...
Visible satellite imagery late this morning shows a cumulus field
and a destabilizing airmass to the east of an ongoing band of
convection near a southwest-northeast oriented front.  Ample heating
over the area to the east of patchy cirrus will promote temperatures
warming into the lower 80s deg F.  12z model guidance so far has a
negative bias on surface dewpoints across north FL compared to
observations (3-6 deg F too dry).  This is partially explained by a
richer moist profile observed through almost 850 mb via the 12z
Tallahassee raob.  As a result, slightly higher dewpoints (upper 60s
deg F) and greater buoyancy (1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE) are expected
than previously forecast.  Water-vapor imagery shows a lead
disturbance moving east across the central Gulf Coast, and it will
reach the northeast Gulf by late this afternoon/early evening. 
Ascent and some strengthening in flow will aid in some storm
organization (reference 50-kt 2-6 km flow at Tallahassee on the 88D
VAD).  Limited low-level convergence and a warm layer near 800 mb
may act to hinder an otherwise more organized potential severe
setup.  Regardless, isolated 50-65 mph gusts and marginally severe
hail are possible with the stronger storms this afternoon into the
early evening.

..Squitieri.. 04/21/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Sun Apr 21 2024/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel westerly jet streak will cross the northern Rockies
during the afternoon, while a related cold front overspreads the
region. Strong post-frontal winds are expected across northern MT,
which could briefly overlap 20-30 percent RH. Dry/breezy pre-frontal
conditions are also possible over eastern MT into the western
Dakotas. While locally elevated conditions are possible for both
areas, marginal fuels and a limited overlap of the strongest winds
and lowest RH cast uncertainty on the large-fire threat.

Farther east, breezy/gusty west-northwesterly winds and 25-35
percent RH are possible from MN to Lower MI -- along the southern
periphery of strong northwesterly flow aloft. This could yield
locally elevated conditions, though these conditions appear too
marginal for highlights, given the current state of fuels.

Valid 211300Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING ACROSS NORTH FL/SOUTH GA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging winds near 60 mph and large hail near 1 inch
diameter will be possible for a few hours this afternoon/evening
across south Georgia and north Florida.

...North FL/south GA this afternoon/evening...
A low amplitude shortwave trough over the north central Gulf coast
will progress eastward over south GA/north FL by late afternoon, in
advance of an upstream trough over the mid MS Valley.  An associated
cold front will move slowly southeastward and offshore of the
Carolinas this afternoon, and into central FL by Monday morning. 
Regional 12z soundings from JAX/TLH show lingering steep midlevel
lapse rates and an associated cap which is expected to weaken from
the west by afternoon, when thunderstorm development will become
more probable with surface heating, ascent along the front, and with
larger-scale ascent related to the approaching midlevel trough.  The
warm sector ahead of the front across south GA/north FL will be
characterized by mid 60s dewpoints and surface temperatures ranging
from the mid 70s to lower 80s in cloud breaks by afternoon, where
MLCAPE could approach 1000 J/kg.  Coincident with diurnal
destabilization, midlevel flow will increase to 50 kt with largely
straight hodographs and effective bulk shear of 35-40 kt.  This
environment of moderate buoyancy and vertical shear will support the
potential for multicell clusters and/or low-end supercells capable
of producing isolated damaging gusts near 60 mph and large hail near
1 inch in diameter for a few hours this afternoon/evening.
