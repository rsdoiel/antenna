## Letter to the editor: I’m disappointed in The Collegian’s Measure E editorial

date: 2024-03-05, from: The Collegian (Cal State Fresno's Student Newspaper)

I’m disappointed the Collegian’s Editorial Board bought into false claims about Measure E from politicians running for office. &#8220;Anti-tax&#8221; conservative elites highlight “tax burdens,” knowing &#8220;No taxes/public investment&#8221; means &#8220;No public services.&#8221; That’s okay if you can send your children to private universities, but that&#8217;s not an option for many Valley children from working-class and...

## Movie review: ‘Dune: Part Two’ is epic both visually and narratively

date: 2024-03-05, from: The Collegian (Cal State Fresno's Student Newspaper)

I really enjoyed the first “Dune” movie when it came out in 2021. The original “Dune” novels were actually one of the inspirations for the “Star Wars” movies and I touched on these similarities in my review of the first film. Thus, I was pleased when “Dune: Part Two” took what worked in the first...

## Video game review: After spending more than 100 hours on Baldur’s Gate 3, it is still worth the hype

date: 2024-03-05, from: The Collegian (Cal State Fresno's Student Newspaper)

It was 2020. The pandemic was in full swing, and I, like many people, was cooped up in my room for far too long. I passed the time the same way many people did: by playing video games. I can&#8217;t remember the first time I heard about Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 (BG3), but I was old...
