id="resistance-against-two-lytic-phage-variants-attenuates-virulence-and-antibiotic-resistance-in-pseudomonas-aeruginosa">Resistance
against two lytic phage variants attenuates virulence and antibiotic
resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Bacteriophage therapy is becoming part of mainstream Western medicine
since antibiotics of clinical use tend to fail. It involves applying
lytic bacteriophages that self-replicate and induce cell lysis, thus
killing their hosts. Nevertheless, bacterial killing promotes the
selection of resistant clones which sometimes may exhibit a decrease in
bacterial virulence or antibiotic resistance.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this work, we studied the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>
lytic phage φDCL-PA6 and its variant φDCL-PA6α. Additionally, we
characterized and evaluated the production of virulence factors and the
virulence in a Galleria mellonella model of resistant mutants against
each phage for PA14 and two clinical strains.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Phage φDCL-PA6α differs from the original by only two amino acids: one
in the baseplate wedge subunit and another in the tail fiber protein.
According to genomic data and cross-resistance experiments, these
changes may promote the change of the phage receptor from the O-antigen
to the core lipopolysaccharide. Interestingly, the host range of the two
phages differs as determined against the <italic>Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</italic> reference strains PA14 and PAO1 and against nine
multidrug-resistant isolates from ventilator associated pneumonia.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
We show as well that phage resistance impacts virulence factor
production. Specifically, phage resistance led to decreased biofilm
formation, swarming, and type III secretion; therefore, the virulence
towards Galleria mellonella was dramatically attenuated. Furthermore,
antibiotic resistance decreased for one clinical strain. Our study
highlights important potential advantages of phage therapy’s
evolutionary impact that may be exploited to generate robust therapy
schemes.

id="microbiota-signatures-associated-with-invasive-candida-albicans-infection-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-of-immunodeficient-mice">Microbiota
signatures associated with invasive Candida albicans infection in the
gastrointestinal tract of immunodeficient mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a commensal microorganism in the
human gut but occasionally causes invasive <italic>C. albicans</italic>
infection (ICA), especially in immunocompromised individuals. Early
initiation of antifungal therapy is associated with reduced mortality of
ICA, but rapid diagnosis remains a challenge. The ICA-associated changes
in the gut microbiota can be used as diagnostic and therapeutic targets
but have been poorly investigated. In this study, we utilized an
immunodeficient Rag2γc
(<italic>Rag2</italic>-/-<italic>il2γc</italic>-/-) mouse model to
investigate the gut microbiota alterations caused by <italic>C.
albicans</italic> throughout its cycle, from its introduction into the
gastrointestinal tract to invasion, in the absence of antibiotics. We
observed a significant increase in the abundance of
<italic>Firmicutes</italic>, particularly
<italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>,
as well as a significant decrease in the abundance of <italic>Candidatus
Arthromitus</italic> in mice exposed to either the wild-type SC5314
strain or the filamentation-defective mutant (<italic>cph1/cph1
efg1/efg1</italic>) HLC54 strain of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
However, only the SC5314-infected mice developed ICA. A linear
discriminate analysis of the temporal changes in the gut bacterial
composition revealed <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic> as a
discriminative biomarker associated with SC5314-infected mice with ICA.
Additionally, a positive correlation between the <italic>B.
vulgatus</italic> abundance and fungal load was found, and the negative
correlation between the <italic>Candidatus Arthromitus</italic>
abundance and fungal load after exposure to <italic>C. albicans</italic>
suggested that <italic>C. albicans</italic> might affect the
differentiation of intestinal Th17 cells. Our findings reveal the
influence of pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> on the gut
microbiota and identify the abundance of <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> as
a microbiota signature associated with ICA in an immunodeficient mouse
model.

analysis of bacterial community changes in dental unit waterlines after
chlorogenic acid treatment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The contamination of dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) poses a significant
risk of cross-infection in dentistry. Although chemical disinfectants
have been effective in reducing number of bacteria, they do have
limitations.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study aimed to investigate the potential of chlorogenic acid, a
natural substance with broadspectrum antibacterial properties, for
treating DUWLs. Over a period of three months, we analyzed the microbial
communities in 149 DUWLs samples collected from 5 dental units using
high-throughput pyrophosphate sequencing.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The results revealed that chlorogenic acid treatment had a significant
impact on the microbial community profile in the DUWLs, with the most
significant changes occurring within the first 15 days and stabilization
observed in the last 30 days. The predominant genera detected in the
samples were Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus,
Methylobacterium, and Phreatobacter. Additionally, the relative
abundance of certain beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella,
Roseburia, and Blautia, increased, while the presence of opportunistic
pathogens like Mycobacteria significantly decreased. The functional
prediction analysis using the KEGG database indicated a decrease in the
pathogenicity of the bacterial community in the DUWLs following
chlorogenic acid treatment.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
This study introduces a novel approach for the prevention and treatment
of infections associated with dental care.

id="in-vitro-interactions-of-proton-pump-inhibitors-and-azoles-against-pathogenic-fungi">In
vitro interactions of proton pump inhibitors and azoles against
pathogenic fungi</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Azole resistance has been increasingly reported and become an issue for
clinical managements of invasive mycoses. New strategy with combination
therapy arises as a valuable and promising alternative option. The aim
of the present study is to investigate the <italic>in vitro</italic>
combinational effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and azoles against
pathogenic fungi.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
<italic>In vitro</italic> interactions of PPIs including omeprazole
(OME), lansoprazole (LAN), pantoprazole (PAN), and rabeprazole (RAB),
and commonly used azoles including itraconazole (ITC), posaconazole
(POS), voriconazole (VRC) and FLC, were investigated via broth
microdilution chequerboard procedure adapted from the CLSI M27-A3 and
M38-A2. A total of 67 clinically isolated strains, namely 27 strains of
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., 16 strains of
<italic>Candida</italic> spp., and 24 strains of dematiaceous fungi,
were studied. C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and A. flavus (ATCC 204304)
was included to ensure quality control.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
PPIs individually did not exert any significant antifungal activity. The
combination of OME with ITC, POS, or VRC showed synergism against 77.6%,
86.6%, and 4% strains of tested pathogenic fungi, respectively, while
synergism of OME/FLC was observed in 50% strains of
<italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergism between PAN and ITC, POS, or VRC
was observed against 47.8%, 77.6% and 1.5% strains of tested fungi,
respectively, while synergism of PNA/FLC was observed in 50% strains of
<italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergism of LAN with ITC, POS, or VRC was
observed against 86.6%, 86.6%, and 3% of tested strains, respectively,
while synergism of LAN/FLC was observed in 31.3% strains of
<italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergy of the combination of RAB with
ITC, POS, or VRC was observed against 25.4%, 64.2%, and 4.5% of tested
strains, respectively., synergism of RAB/FLC was observed in 12.5% of
<italic>Candida</italic> spp.. Among PPIs, synergism was least observed
between RAB and triazoles, while among triazoles, synergism was least
observed between VRC and PPIs. Among species, synergy was much more
frequently observed in Aspergillus spp. and dematiaceous fungi as
compared to <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Antagonism between PPIs with
ITC or VRC was occasionally observed in <italic>Aspergillus</italic>
spp. and dematiaceous fungi. It is notable that PPIs combined with
azoles showed synergy against azole resistant <italic>A.
fumigatus</italic>, and resulted in category change of susceptibility of
ITC and POS against <italic>Candida</italic> spp.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
The results suggested that PPIs combined with azoles has the potential
to enhance the susceptibilities of azoles against multiple pathogenic
fungi and could be a promising strategy to overcome azole resistance
issues. However, further investigations are warranted to study the
combinational efficacy in more isolates and more species, to investigate
the underlying mechanism of interaction and to evaluate the potential
for concomitant use of these agents in human.

id="a-review-of-neuro-ophthalmic-sequelae-following-covid-19-infection-and-vaccination">A
review of neuro-ophthalmic sequelae following COVID-19 infection and
vaccination</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
It has become increasingly clear that the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can affect most organs in the human
body, including the neurologic and ophthalmic systems. Vaccination
campaigns have been developed at rapid pace around the world to protect
the population from the fast-mutating virus. This review seeks to
summarise current knowledge of the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of
both COVID-19 infection and vaccination.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Evidence acquisition
</title>
<p>
Electronic searches for published literature were conducted using EMBASE
and MEDLINE on the 30<sup>th</sup> of July 2023. The search strategy
comprised of controlled vocabulary and free-text synonyms for the
following terms in various combinations: “coronavirus, COVID-19,
SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, vaccination, vaccine, immunisation and
neuro-ophthalmology”. No time range limits were set for the literature
search. Published English abstracts for articles written in a different
language were screened if available.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 54 case reports and case series were selected for use in the
final report. 34 articles documenting neuro-ophthalmic manifestations
following COVID-19 infection and 20 articles with neuro-ophthalmic
complications following COVID-19 vaccination were included, comprising
of 79 patients in total. The most commonly occurring condition was optic
neuritis, with 25 cases following COVID-19 infection and 27 cases
following vaccination against COVID-19.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
The various COVID-19 vaccines that are currently available are part of
the global effort to protect the most vulnerable of the human
population. The incidence of neuro-ophthalmic consequences following
infection with COVID-19 is hundred-folds higher and associated with more
harrowing systemic effects than vaccination against the virus.

the interfacial rheology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus
aureus with N-acetyl cysteine and cysteamine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Chronic lung infection due to bacterial biofilms is one of the leading
causes of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Among many species
colonizing the lung airways, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are two virulent pathogens
involved in mechanically robust biofilms that are difficult to eradicate
using airway clearance techniques like lung lavage. To remove such
biological materials, glycoside hydrolase-based compounds are commonly
employed for targeting and breaking down the biofilm matrix, and
subsequently increasing cell susceptibility to antibiotics.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Materials and methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, we evaluate the effects of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and
Cysteamine (CYST) in disrupting interfacial bacterial films, targeting
different components of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). We
characterize the mechanics and structural integrity of the interfacial
bacterial films using pendant drop elastometry and scanning electron
microscopy.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results and discussion
</title>
<p>
Our results show that the film architectures are compromised by
treatment with disrupting agents for 6 h, which reduces film elasticity
significantly. These effects are profound in the wild type and mucoid
<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, compared to <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
We further assess the effects of competition and cooperation between
<italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> on the
mechanics of composite interfacial films. Films of <italic>S.
aureus</italic> and wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cocultures
lose mechanical strength while those of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and
mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> exhibit improved storage modulus.
Treatment with NAC and CYST reduces the elastic property of both
composite films, owing to the drugs’ ability to disintegrate their EPS
matrix. Overall, our results provide new insights into methods for
assessing the efficacy of mucolytic agents against interfacial biofilms
relevant to cystic fibrosis infection.

of chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a retrospective cohort
study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Among the advantaged population with clinical cure of chronic hepatitis
B, chronic inactive hepatitis B virus carriers (IHCs) and nucleoside
analog-experienced patients have similar serological manifestations.
This study established non-interferon-treated groups as controls to
compare the efficacy of pegylated interferon α-2b (Peg-IFNα-2b) in
achieving clinical cure between IHCs and nucleoside analog
(NA)-experienced patients.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Method
</title>
<p>
A total of 270 patients were enrolled in this observational study. The
IHC cohort comprised 55 patients who received Peg-IFNα-2b (Peg-IFN
group), and the other 70 patients did not receive any antiviral
treatment (untreated group). Patients treated with NAs were divided into
two groups: one group (70 patients) receiving NA add-on Peg-IFNα-2b
therapy regimen (NA add-on Peg-IFN group) and another group (75
patients) receiving continuous NA monotherapy (NA group). The primary
endpoints were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance and HBsAg
seroconversion at 48 weeks and 72 weeks.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
At 48 weeks, 65.5% (36/55) and 52.9% (37/70) patients achieved HBsAg
clearance in the Peg-IFN group and NA add-on Peg-IFN group, respectively
(p = 0.156). HBsAg seroconversion was achieved in 47.3% (26/55) of the
Peg-IFN group and 34.3% (24/70) of the NA add-on Peg-IFN group (p =
0.141). At the follow-up of 72 weeks, 36 patients in the Peg-IFN group
achieved HBsAg loss (65.5%, 36/55), and 33 patients in the NA add-on
Peg-IFN group achieved HBsAg clearance (47.1%, 33/70), which were
significantly higher than in the Peg-IFN group (p = 0.041). The HBsAg
seroconversion rates in the Peg-IFN group and NA add-on Peg-IFN group at
72 weeks were 45.5% (25/55) and 32.9% (23/70), respectively (p = 0.151).
No patient achieved HBsAg clearance or seroconversion in the NA group
and untreated group. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic
curve showed baseline HBsAg&lt; 72 IU/mL, and the decline of HBsAg of
more than 80% and 98% from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks provided good
predictions for HBsAg clearance. Meanwhile, 77% of patients with
baseline HBsAg&lt; 100 IU/mL achieved a clinical cure at 48 weeks.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Peg-IFNα-2b results in a high rate of HBsAg clearance and seroconversion
in both IHCs and NA-experienced patients, especially for those patients
who have HBsAg below 100 IU/mL.

<p>
Systemic arterial hypertension is linked to a heightened risk of
cardiovascular diseases on a global scale. In Mexico, nearly half of
adults in vulnerable conditions experience hypertension. Imbalance in
the oral and intestinal microbiota composition has been observed in
patients with hypertension, documented by a decrease of bacteria

</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A cross-sectional, observational, and analytical study was carried out.
Twenty-two patients were categorized by their body mass index (BMI) as
overweight and obese, and the diagnosis of primary hypertension. DNA
from supragingival dental plaque and feces samples was used to carry out
16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, 13 cytokines were quantified.

Introduction
</title>
<p>
Alterations of the gut microbiome are involved in the pathogenesis of
Crohn’s disease (CD). The role of fungi in this context is unclear. This
study aimed to determine postoperative changes in the bacterial and
fungal gut communities of CD patients undergoing intestinal resection,
and to evaluate interactions between the bacteriome and mycobiome and
their impact on the patients’ outcome.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We report a subgroup analysis of a prospective cohort study, focusing on
10 CD patients whose fecal samples were collected for bacterial 16S rRNA
and fungal ITS2 genes next-generation sequencing the day before surgery
and on the 5th or 6th postoperative day.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
No significant differences in bacterial and fungal diversity were
observed between preoperative and postoperative stool samples. By
in-depth analysis, significant postoperative abundance changes of
bacteria and fungi and 17 interkingdom correlations were detected.
Network analysis identified 13 microbial clusters in the perioperative
gut communities, revealing symbiotic and competitive interactions.
Relevant factors were gender, age, BMI, lifestyle habits (smoking,
alcohol consumption) and surgical technique. Postoperative abundance
changes and identified clusters were associated with clinical outcomes
(length of hospital stay, complications) and levels of inflammatory
markers.
</p>

<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Our findings highlight the importance of dissecting the interactions of
gut bacterial and fungal communities in CD patients and their potential
influence on postoperative and disease outcomes.

case report of diagnosis of cat-scratch disease using metagenomic
next-generation sequencing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is an anthropozoonotic infection caused by
<italic>Bartonella henselae</italic>, and it is one of the most common
causes of lymph node infections in children and adolescents. <italic>B.
henselae</italic>, belonging to the genus <italic>Bartonella</italic>,
is a common human pathogen of human beings. CSD commonly develops as a
result of cat scratches and bites or when injured skin comes into
contact with cat saliva. The manifestation of CSD clinically differs for
each patient based on their immune system. Individuals who have healthy
immune systems generally manifest minimal clinical symptoms and do not
necessitate any form of treatment. However, patients who have
hypo-immunity require prompt medical attention due to the potential
manifestation of severe symptoms that affect multiple systems of the
body. Long latency and atypical clinical manifestations are
characteristics of CSD. <italic>Bartonella</italic> isolation and
identification are challenging procedures that require specialized
equipment. There is no gold standard method for CSD diagnosis, and
misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rates are typically high. We present
the case of a middle-aged male patient who developed fever, chills, anal
distension, dizziness, and muscle pain for 10 days. The patient had a
documented history of cat bites 1 month prior to the onset of symptoms.
Following admission, he underwent an examination to determine
superficial lymphadenopathy and hypoimmunity. Additionally, he had a
fever during the disease. As the patient refused a needle biopsy of
lymph nodes, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was employed
and <italic>B. henselae</italic> was detected in the peripheral blood.
The patient was diagnosed with CSD and treated with a combination of
azithromycin and doxycycline. The fever symptoms were alleviated, and
the patient was ultimately discharged. As a result of this case, we
suggest that mNGS be used as a crucial supplementary diagnostic tool for
individuals with compromised immune systems who may have CSD, especially
when conventional diagnostic methods are inconclusive.

novel mass cytometry protocol optimized for immunophenotyping of
low-frequency antigen-specific T cells</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Understanding antigen-specific T-cell responses, for example, following
virus infections or allergen exposure, is of high relevance for the
development of vaccines and therapeutics. We aimed on optimizing
immunophenotyping of T cells after antigen stimulation by improving
staining procedures for flow and mass cytometry. Our method can be used
for primary cells of both mouse and human origin for the detection of
low-frequency T-cell response using a dual-barcoding system for
individual samples and conditions. First, live-cell barcoding was
performed using anti-CD45 antibodies prior to an <italic>in
vitro</italic> T-cell stimulation assay. Second, to discriminate between
stimulation conditions and prevent cell loss, sample barcoding was
combined with a commercial barcoding solution. This dual-barcoding
approach is cell sparing and, therefore, particularly relevant for
samples with low cell numbers. To further reduce cell loss and to
increase debarcoding efficiency of multiplexed samples, we combined our
dual-barcoding approach with a new centrifugation-free washing system by
laminar flow (Curiox™). Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of our
established protocol, we assayed virus-specific T-cell response in
SARS-CoV-2–vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2–infected patients and compared with
healthy non-exposed individuals by a high-parameter CyTOF analysis. We
could reveal a heterogeneity of phenotypes among responding CD4, CD8,
and gd-T cells following antigen-specific stimulations. Our protocol
allows to assay antigen-specific responses of minute populations of T
cells to virus-derived peptides, allergens, or other antigens from the
same donor sample, in order to investigate qualitative and quantitative
differences.

of palladium(II) complexes on NorA efflux pump inhibition and
resensitization of fluoroquinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: in
vitro and in silico approach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> leads to diverse infections, and
their treatment relies on the use of antibiotics. Nevertheless, the rise
of antibiotic resistance poses an escalating challenge and various
mechanisms contribute to antibiotic resistance, including modifications
to drug targets, enzymatic deactivation of drugs, and increased efflux
of antibiotics. Hence, the quest for innovative antimicrobial solutions
has intensified in the face of escalating antibiotic resistance and the
looming threat of superbugs. The NorA protein of <italic>S.
aureus</italic>, classified as an efflux pump within the major
facilitator superfamily, when overexpressed, extrudes various
substances, including fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) and
quaternary ammonium. Addressing this, the unexplored realm of inorganic
and organometallic compounds in medicinal chemistry holds promise.
Notably, the study focused on investigating two different series of
palladium-based metal complexes consisting of QSL_P<sup>A</sup> and
QSL_P<sup>B</sup> ligands to identify a potent NorA efflux pump
inhibitor that can restore the susceptibility to fluoroquinolone
antibiotics. QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup> was identified as a potent efflux pump
inhibitor from the real-time efflux assay. QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup> also
resensitized SA1199B to ciprofloxacin at a low concentration of 0.125
µg/mL without elucidating cytotoxicity on the NRK-62E cell line. The
<italic>in vitro</italic> findings were substantiated by docking
results, indicating favorable interactions between QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup>
and the NorA efflux pump.

changes in the migratory microbial components of colon tissue during
different periods of sepsis in an LPS-induced rat model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Previous studies have shown that bacterial translocation may play an
important role in worsening gastrointestinal injury during sepsis.
However, the dynamics of specific microbiota components in intestinal
tissues at different sepsis stages remain unclear. Rats receiving
intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were sacrificed at 12 h and 48
h post-injection. Routine blood, serum cytokines, and microbiota in
colon tissue, colonic contents, and lung tissue at different time points
were assessed. Migratory microbial components in colonic tissue at 12 h
and 48 h post-LPS were identified using source tracking, characteristic
component identification, and abundance difference analyses. Colonic
tissue microbiota changed dynamically over time after LPS injection,
involving translocation of microbial components from colon contents and
lung tissue at different time points. Bacteria migrating to colon tissue
at 12 h sepsis were mainly from colonic contents, while those at 48 h
were predominantly from the lung tissue. The migratory microbial
components in colon tissue were widely associated with blood indicators
and colonizing genus abundance and microbiota functionality in colon
tissue. In this study, the temporal dynamics of bacterial translocation
from various sources into colon tissues at different sepsis progression
stages were characterized for the first time, and the species
composition of these migrating microbes was delineated. These bacterial
migrants may contribute to the pathophysiological processes in sepsis
through direct interactions or indirectly by modulating colonic
microbiota community structure and function.

asthma and its relationship with microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Obesity and asthma are global public health problems. Obesity-related
asthma is a special phenotype of asthma with a complex pathogenesis. Its
occurrence and development are related to mechanical compression,
inflammatory response, metabolic regulation, gene regulation, and
vitamin D deficiency. Different treatment strategies used in the process
of weight loss have a beneficial impact on asthma. Alterations in gut
and airway microbial community structure and their metabolites may also
contribute to obesity-related asthma. The role of the Th17/Treg balance
in the gut microbiota regulating the immune responses and host
metabolism is important. Therapeutic measures associated with the gut
microbiota variety may contribute to improving chronic inflammation
associated with obesity by regulating the Th17/Treg balance. An early
reduction in microbial diversity can predict the development of asthma
and lead to allergy through an imbalance of Th2/Th1 responses.
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate the differentiation and
activation of regulatory T cells, thereby regulating immune homeostasis
in the lung to suppress allergic inflammation and weight gain.
Therefore, clarifying the microbial mechanism of obesity-related asthma
has important guiding significance for clinical treatment. In this
review, we used the following terms: “asthma and obesity” and
“obesity-related asthma”, combining “phenotype”, “airway inflammation”
and “lung function”, and reviewed the characteristics and pathogenesis
of obesity-related asthma, the relationship between the gut and airway
microbiota and obesity-related asthma, and the current treatment
measures for the disease.
