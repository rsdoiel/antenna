Introduction
</title>
<p>
Alterations of the gut microbiome are involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease (CD). The role of fungi in this context is unclear. This study aimed to determine postoperative changes in the bacterial and fungal gut communities of CD patients undergoing intestinal resection, and to evaluate interactions between the bacteriome and mycobiome and their impact on the patients’ outcome.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We report a subgroup analysis of a prospective cohort study, focusing on 10 CD patients whose fecal samples were collected for bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS2 genes next-generation sequencing the day before surgery and on the 5th or 6th postoperative day.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
No significant differences in bacterial and fungal diversity were observed between preoperative and postoperative stool samples. By in-depth analysis, significant postoperative abundance changes of bacteria and fungi and 17 interkingdom correlations were detected. Network analysis identified 13 microbial clusters in the perioperative gut communities, revealing symbiotic and competitive interactions. Relevant factors were gender, age, BMI, lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol consumption) and surgical technique. Postoperative abundance changes and identified clusters were associated with clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay, complications) and levels of inflammatory markers.
</p>

<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Our findings highlight the importance of dissecting the interactions of gut bacterial and fungal communities in CD patients and their potential influence on postoperative and disease outcomes.

<h2 id="a-case-report-of-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease-using-metagenomic-next-generation-sequencing">A case report of diagnosis of cat-scratch disease using metagenomic next-generation sequencing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is an anthropozoonotic infection caused by <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic>, and it is one of the most common causes of lymph node infections in children and adolescents. <italic>B. henselae</italic>, belonging to the genus <italic>Bartonella</italic>, is a common human pathogen of human beings. CSD commonly develops as a result of cat scratches and bites or when injured skin comes into contact with cat saliva. The manifestation of CSD clinically differs for each patient based on their immune system. Individuals who have healthy immune systems generally manifest minimal clinical symptoms and do not necessitate any form of treatment. However, patients who have hypo-immunity require prompt medical attention due to the potential manifestation of severe symptoms that affect multiple systems of the body. Long latency and atypical clinical manifestations are characteristics of CSD. <italic>Bartonella</italic> isolation and identification are challenging procedures that require specialized equipment. There is no gold standard method for CSD diagnosis, and misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rates are typically high. We present the case of a middle-aged male patient who developed fever, chills, anal distension, dizziness, and muscle pain for 10 days. The patient had a documented history of cat bites 1 month prior to the onset of symptoms. Following admission, he underwent an examination to determine superficial lymphadenopathy and hypoimmunity. Additionally, he had a fever during the disease. As the patient refused a needle biopsy of lymph nodes, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was employed and <italic>B. henselae</italic> was detected in the peripheral blood. The patient was diagnosed with CSD and treated with a combination of azithromycin and doxycycline. The fever symptoms were alleviated, and the patient was ultimately discharged. As a result of this case, we suggest that mNGS be used as a crucial supplementary diagnostic tool for individuals with compromised immune systems who may have CSD, especially when conventional diagnostic methods are inconclusive.

<h2 id="a-novel-mass-cytometry-protocol-optimized-for-immunophenotyping-of-low-frequency-antigen-specific-t-cells">A novel mass cytometry protocol optimized for immunophenotyping of low-frequency antigen-specific T cells</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Understanding antigen-specific T-cell responses, for example, following virus infections or allergen exposure, is of high relevance for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. We aimed on optimizing immunophenotyping of T cells after antigen stimulation by improving staining procedures for flow and mass cytometry. Our method can be used for primary cells of both mouse and human origin for the detection of low-frequency T-cell response using a dual-barcoding system for individual samples and conditions. First, live-cell barcoding was performed using anti-CD45 antibodies prior to an <italic>in vitro</italic> T-cell stimulation assay. Second, to discriminate between stimulation conditions and prevent cell loss, sample barcoding was combined with a commercial barcoding solution. This dual-barcoding approach is cell sparing and, therefore, particularly relevant for samples with low cell numbers. To further reduce cell loss and to increase debarcoding efficiency of multiplexed samples, we combined our dual-barcoding approach with a new centrifugation-free washing system by laminar flow (Curiox™). Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of our established protocol, we assayed virus-specific T-cell response in SARS-CoV-2–vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2–infected patients and compared with healthy non-exposed individuals by a high-parameter CyTOF analysis. We could reveal a heterogeneity of phenotypes among responding CD4, CD8, and gd-T cells following antigen-specific stimulations. Our protocol allows to assay antigen-specific responses of minute populations of T cells to virus-derived peptides, allergens, or other antigens from the same donor sample, in order to investigate qualitative and quantitative differences.

<h2 id="effect-of-palladiumii-complexes-on-nora-efflux-pump-inhibition-and-resensitization-of-fluoroquinolone-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-vitro-and-in-silico-approach">Effect of palladium(II) complexes on NorA efflux pump inhibition and resensitization of fluoroquinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: in vitro and in silico approach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> leads to diverse infections, and their treatment relies on the use of antibiotics. Nevertheless, the rise of antibiotic resistance poses an escalating challenge and various mechanisms contribute to antibiotic resistance, including modifications to drug targets, enzymatic deactivation of drugs, and increased efflux of antibiotics. Hence, the quest for innovative antimicrobial solutions has intensified in the face of escalating antibiotic resistance and the looming threat of superbugs. The NorA protein of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, classified as an efflux pump within the major facilitator superfamily, when overexpressed, extrudes various substances, including fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) and quaternary ammonium. Addressing this, the unexplored realm of inorganic and organometallic compounds in medicinal chemistry holds promise. Notably, the study focused on investigating two different series of palladium-based metal complexes consisting of QSL_P<sup>A</sup> and QSL_P<sup>B</sup> ligands to identify a potent NorA efflux pump inhibitor that can restore the susceptibility to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup> was identified as a potent efflux pump inhibitor from the real-time efflux assay. QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup> also resensitized SA1199B to ciprofloxacin at a low concentration of 0.125 µg/mL without elucidating cytotoxicity on the NRK-62E cell line. The <italic>in vitro</italic> findings were substantiated by docking results, indicating favorable interactions between QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup> and the NorA efflux pump.

<h2 id="dynamic-changes-in-the-migratory-microbial-components-of-colon-tissue-during-different-periods-of-sepsis-in-an-lps-induced-rat-model">Dynamic changes in the migratory microbial components of colon tissue during different periods of sepsis in an LPS-induced rat model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Previous studies have shown that bacterial translocation may play an important role in worsening gastrointestinal injury during sepsis. However, the dynamics of specific microbiota components in intestinal tissues at different sepsis stages remain unclear. Rats receiving intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were sacrificed at 12 h and 48 h post-injection. Routine blood, serum cytokines, and microbiota in colon tissue, colonic contents, and lung tissue at different time points were assessed. Migratory microbial components in colonic tissue at 12 h and 48 h post-LPS were identified using source tracking, characteristic component identification, and abundance difference analyses. Colonic tissue microbiota changed dynamically over time after LPS injection, involving translocation of microbial components from colon contents and lung tissue at different time points. Bacteria migrating to colon tissue at 12 h sepsis were mainly from colonic contents, while those at 48 h were predominantly from the lung tissue. The migratory microbial components in colon tissue were widely associated with blood indicators and colonizing genus abundance and microbiota functionality in colon tissue. In this study, the temporal dynamics of bacterial translocation from various sources into colon tissues at different sepsis progression stages were characterized for the first time, and the species composition of these migrating microbes was delineated. These bacterial migrants may contribute to the pathophysiological processes in sepsis through direct interactions or indirectly by modulating colonic microbiota community structure and function.

<h2 id="obesity-related-asthma-and-its-relationship-with-microbiota">Obesity-related asthma and its relationship with microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Obesity and asthma are global public health problems. Obesity-related asthma is a special phenotype of asthma with a complex pathogenesis. Its occurrence and development are related to mechanical compression, inflammatory response, metabolic regulation, gene regulation, and vitamin D deficiency. Different treatment strategies used in the process of weight loss have a beneficial impact on asthma. Alterations in gut and airway microbial community structure and their metabolites may also contribute to obesity-related asthma. The role of the Th17/Treg balance in the gut microbiota regulating the immune responses and host metabolism is important. Therapeutic measures associated with the gut microbiota variety may contribute to improving chronic inflammation associated with obesity by regulating the Th17/Treg balance. An early reduction in microbial diversity can predict the development of asthma and lead to allergy through an imbalance of Th2/Th1 responses. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate the differentiation and activation of regulatory T cells, thereby regulating immune homeostasis in the lung to suppress allergic inflammation and weight gain. Therefore, clarifying the microbial mechanism of obesity-related asthma has important guiding significance for clinical treatment. In this review, we used the following terms: “asthma and obesity” and “obesity-related asthma”, combining “phenotype”, “airway inflammation” and “lung function”, and reviewed the characteristics and pathogenesis of obesity-related asthma, the relationship between the gut and airway microbiota and obesity-related asthma, and the current treatment measures for the disease.
