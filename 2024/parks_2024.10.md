<p>There are few historical figures that have left a more indelible mark on the history of America’s public lands, and the species that roam them, than Velma Johnston. Born on March 5, 1912, Johnston would eventually become known as Wild Horse Annie for her tireless dedication to the welfare and preservation of free-roaming horses and burros on public lands. Her advocacy would eventually lead to the passage of the <a data-entity-substitution="media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8274a940-94db-4132-802b-c4c5372a586d" href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/programs_wildhorse_history_doc1.pdf">Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971</a>– a monumental law that enshrined protections for two of America’s most beloved animals. </p>

<p>Velma Johnston’s journey to becoming Wild Horse Annie began in the early 1950s. This was a time before there were legal protections for horses and burros roaming on public lands, which left them vulnerable to sometimes brutal “mustanging” practices. The horses were often chased until exhaustion, lassoed with ropes weighted with truck tires, and then loaded into a trailer. Johnston’s advocacy is said to have been inspired after she witnessed bleeding horses being hauled off to a slaughter plant. Horrified by the cruelty of this practice, Johnston embarked on a mission to raise awareness of the practice and to pass legislation that protects horse and burro welfare on public lands. </p>

<p>Johnston’s efforts gained traction in the 1950s and 1960s as she mobilized public support through grassroots campaigns and educational outreach. She even organized a widespread letter-writing campaign that inspired thousands of school children to get involved in the issue. Her advocacy ultimately culminated in the passage of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971, a landmark law that enshrined federal protections to wild horses and burros on public lands, and which tasked the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service with their management. </p>

<p>Johnston became known as “Wild Horse Annie” by the movement she created, and her legacy lives on in the countless supporters of wild horses and burros today. Her unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of America’s wild horses and burros helped secure lasting legal protections for free-roaming wild equines, while also fostering a greater appreciation for their intrinsic value and cherished place among the thousands of species that call our public lands their home. </p>

<p>As we reflect on Wild Horse Annie’s remarkable contributions, let us honor her memory by continuing to champion the cause she held so dear. </p>

<p><em><strong>Starting in 2025, the BLM invites the public to join us in honoring Wild Horse Annie and America’s wild horses and burros with a week-long, annual celebration centered around March 5, Johnston’s birthday. </strong></em></p>

<p>Stay tuned for news on events and opportunities during Wild Horse and Burro Week that you and your friends can join next year!  <br>

## BLM to offer horses, burros for adoption in Ceres

<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. –  The Bureau of Land Management will offer 20 wild horses and 10 wild burros for adoption, Friday and Saturday, March 22 and 23, at the Diamond Bar Arena, 6055 Central Ave., in Ceres. The animals will be available on a first-come, first-served basis from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day. Anyone interested can preview the animals from 3 to 5 p.m., Thursday, March 21.</p>

<p>“These animals are healthy and ready to begin their training for any discipline,” <em><strong>said Amy Dumas, manager of the BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program in California</strong></em>. “The group of horses includes yearlings and young mares and geldings up to 5 years old. The burros are of all ages. All are from northern California wild herds.  Adopters receive health care records for each animal.”</p>

<p>The BLM’s Adoption Incentive Program applies to this event; adopters receive a check for $1,000 when they receive title to their animals a year after adoption.</p>

<p>To qualify, adopters must be at least 18 years old and have facilities that meet the BLM’s requirements. Title to the animals remains with the federal government for a year, after which adopters can apply for title. Detailed information about adopter qualifications and facility requirements can be found <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/wild-horse-and-burro/adoptions-and-sales">online</a>.</p>

<p>The adoption event is being held in conjunction with the Back Country Horsemen of California annual Rendezvous event that includes clinics, vendors, classes and other features aimed at those who use horses, mules and burros for backcountry packing.</p>

<p>The BLM is responsible under the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/programs_wildhorse_history_doc1.pdf">Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act</a> for protecting and managing wild horses and burros on public lands. The agency periodically removes animals from the range when populations exceed levels established to allow wild horse and burro herds to thrive in balance with other range users, including wildlife and permitted livestock. These animals are then available for adoption at events throughout the country.  More information about the BLM's Wild Horse and Burro program is available at <a href="https://www.blm.gov/whb">https://www.blm.gov/whb</a>.</p>
