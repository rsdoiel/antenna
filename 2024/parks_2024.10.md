<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. –  The Bureau of Land Management will offer 20 wild horses and 10 wild burros for adoption, Friday and Saturday, March 22 and 23, at the Diamond Bar Arena, 6055 Central Ave., in Ceres. The animals will be available on a first-come, first-served basis from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day. Anyone interested can preview the animals from 3 to 5 p.m., Thursday, March 21.</p>

<p>“These animals are healthy and ready to begin their training for any discipline,” <em><strong>said Amy Dumas, manager of the BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program in California</strong></em>. “The group of horses includes yearlings and young mares and geldings up to 5 years old. The burros are of all ages. All are from northern California wild herds.  Adopters receive health care records for each animal.”</p>

<p>The BLM’s Adoption Incentive Program applies to this event; adopters receive a check for $1,000 when they receive title to their animals a year after adoption.</p>

<p>To qualify, adopters must be at least 18 years old and have facilities that meet the BLM’s requirements. Title to the animals remains with the federal government for a year, after which adopters can apply for title. Detailed information about adopter qualifications and facility requirements can be found <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/wild-horse-and-burro/adoptions-and-sales">online</a>.</p>

<p>The adoption event is being held in conjunction with the Back Country Horsemen of California annual Rendezvous event that includes clinics, vendors, classes and other features aimed at those who use horses, mules and burros for backcountry packing.</p>

<p>The BLM is responsible under the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/programs_wildhorse_history_doc1.pdf">Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act</a> for protecting and managing wild horses and burros on public lands. The agency periodically removes animals from the range when populations exceed levels established to allow wild horse and burro herds to thrive in balance with other range users, including wildlife and permitted livestock. These animals are then available for adoption at events throughout the country.  More information about the BLM's Wild Horse and Burro program is available at <a href="https://www.blm.gov/whb">https://www.blm.gov/whb</a>.</p>
