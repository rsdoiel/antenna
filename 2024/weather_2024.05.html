Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1035 AM CST Fri Feb 02 2024

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...17z Update...
Morning observations showed developing showers/thunderstorms and
expanding cloud cover over much of the southern Plains. Some gusty
winds and periodic humidity below 25% are possible over parts of
southwest TX this afternoon. However, more widespread critical
fire-weather concerns appear unlikely owing to wetting rain
potential and the poor overlap of meteorological conditions with the
driest fuels in southwest TX. See the previous discussion for more
information.

..Lyons.. 02/02/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1153 PM CST Thu Feb 01 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will deepen as it ejects into the southern High
Plains today, supporting surface cyclone development in Colorado. A
dryline will develop and move eastward across the TX Panhandle,
supporting strong westerly surface winds through the afternoon hours
across eastern New Mexico into far western Texas. While sustained
westerly surface winds may exceed 20 mph at times across much of the
southern High Plains, widespread clouds with scattered showers and
thunderstorms are also expected. When also considering relatively
high RH values (20-25 percent at lowest) and marginally receptive
fuels, fire weather highlights do not appear warranted at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1029 AM CST Fri Feb 02 2024

Valid 021630Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM WESTERN NORTH
TEXAS AND THE BIG COUNTRY SOUTH TO THE HILL COUNTRY AND EDWARDS
PLATEAU...

...SUMMARY...
Local severe weather potential, mainly in the form of hail, will
affect portions of the southern Plains from late afternoon into this
evening.

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified upper flow pattern will continue across the U.S.
today.  While a trough will continue crossing the eastern states and
a second affects the Pacific Northwest, the primary feature with
respect to convective weather will be a trough/evolving upper low
advancing east-southeastward across the Desert Southwest.  Ascent in
advance of this feature -- and the associated left exit region of a
160 kt northwesterly upper-level jet -- will continue spreading
into/across the southern Plains through the period.

At the surface, a Pacific cold front -- associated with the
aforementioned southwestern U.S. upper trough -- will shift out of
eastern New Mexico and far West Texas into lower elevations of the
southern Plains today and tonight, in tandem with an increase in
thunderstorms across the region.

...Southern Plains...
Morning RAOBS indicate stout capping across the southern Plains
region, with expansive low clouds/stratus per visible satellite
imagery due to a partially modified Gulf boundary-layer airmass
streaming northwestward beneath the inversion.  The low cloudiness
-- and increasing convection across the area with time -- will limit
potential for surface-based destabilization in most areas,
particularly with eastward extent.

With that said, some erosion of the low clouds is ongoing into
portions of the Big Country region of Texas, with clear skies to the
west -- i.e. portions of the south Plains and the Transpecos region.
 Resulting insolation ahead of the advancing front will likely
permit eventual/afternoon thunderstorm development across the Big
Country and Concho Valley region, which is then expected to spread
northeastward toward western North Texas with time.  Storms may also
develop by this evening over the higher terrain just west of the
lower Rio Grande Valley, and adjacent portions of the Edwards
Plateau.

Despite the somewhat cool, and only modestly moist boundary layer
expected to persist across the eastern half of the southern Plains,
steep lapse rates aloft will contribute to ample CAPE aloft,
supporting locally vigorous updrafts.  Storm intensity will be aided
by favorably strong/veering flow with height as increasing
southwesterly mid-level flow spreads eastward across the southern
Plains.  As a result, isolated rotating storms will likely evolve,
with the greatest potential for surface-based severe risk including
damaging winds likely to remain across western portions of the SLGT
risk area.  Into this evening, as storms continue to increase in
coverage and spread eastward across central parts of the southern
Plains, and perhaps initiate farther south toward the Rio Grande
Valley, risk should transition to primarily hail, as convection
should largely remain elevated.

0653 AM CST Fri Feb 02 2024

Valid 021300Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
NORTHWEST TEXAS TO PARTS OF SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS AND THE NEARBY RIO
GRANDE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe hail, damaging gusts and a tornado or two are possible over
parts of the southern Plains, from late afternoon into this evening.

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified, somewhat progressive mid/upper-level pattern is
forecast through the period, with ridging shifting slowly eastward
across central Canada and the Mississippi Valley.  Upstream, height
falls will spread across the Rockies and Great Plains States.  The
most convectively impactful feature will be a basal shortwave trough
-- with several associated vorticity maxima -- initially evident in
moisture-channel imagery over portions of southern CA, the lower
Colorado River Valley, and northwestern MX.  The trough should shift
eastward and strengthen, extending from the Four Corners area across
central/southern NM past ELP and over Chihuahua around 00Z.  By 12Z,
a closed 500-mb low should develop over northeastern NM, with the
trough south-southeastward across the Llano Estacado and Permian
Basin to Coahuila. 

At 11Z, surface analysis showed lee troughing over eastern parts of
CO and NM, with a few weak/attached lows, as well as pockets of 60s
F surface dewpoints reaching as far north as the SAT-AUS region.  A
diffuse Pacific cold front was apparent over east-central NM and far
west TX, and should sharpen through the day as it crosses west TX. 
A dryline was drawn from northwest TX southwestward over the Permian
Basin, then south-southeastward into higher terrain of northern
Coahuila.  This dryline should mix eastward through this afternoon
to the Edwards Plateau on the south side, and move little on the
north side.  The lee trough should strengthen throughout the period,
with cyclogenesis expected overnight in the area from the
northwestern TX Panhandle to southeastern CO.  The Pacific front to
its south and southeast should overtake the dryline and shift
eastward from west TX into central and south TX tonight.

...TX/OK...
Episodes of strong-severe thunderstorms are expected to cross the
outlook area starting this afternoon along/ahead of the dryline --
initially moving roughly northward over in the northwest TX/eastern
Panhandle/western OK region.  Isolated severe hail, damaging gusts
and potential for a brief tornado exists with this activity.  

A later but more-substantial severe threat is apparent across parts
of northwest, central and southwest TX, east of
late-afternoon/early-evening development areas along:
1.  The dryline, 
2.  The Pacific front, and 
3.  Eastern slopes of the Serranias del Burro of Coahuila leading
down to the Rio Grande.
Supercellular and bowing/quasi-linear modes are possible in and near
the "slight" area, offering sporadic severe hail, isolated severe
gusts and potential for a tornado or two.  Some hail may exceed 2
inches in diameter from supercell(s) in the first few hours of the
convective cycle over parts of south TX (southern Hill Country
southward).  In that area, the most-favorable combination of steep
deep-layer lapse rates, inflow-layer moisture, and long hodographs
is expected. 

Large-scale lift will strengthen through tonight across much of the
southern Plains -- under the influences of low-level warm advection
and midlevel DCVA.  Also, as a 125-160-kt 250-mb jet extends inland
across southern CA and northwestern MX -- behind the mid/upper
trough -- its left-exit region and associated lift aloft should
spread this evening and overnight across parts of central/south TX,
where the steepest midlevel lapse rates (exceeding 7 deg C/km) are
expected.  These influences will extend atop a moistening and
diurnally destabilizing boundary layer with surface dewpoints in the
50s F over northwest TX and OK, and 60s in the Edwards Plateau and
Hill Country southward to the Rio Grande.  Adequate deep-layer
instability/buoyancy for surface-based convection is expected on
either side of the dryline today, and along/ahead of the Pacific
front tonight.  Peak/preconvective MLCAPE should reach around
1000-1500 J/kg in a narrow, south-north corridor ahead of the
dryline, diminishing eastward toward east TX.  Low-level shear may
be stronger over northern parts of the outlook, but with greater
deep shear southward toward the more-intense mid/upper winds.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CST Wed Jan 31 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Thursday.

...Synopsis...
Deep upper troughing is expected to extend along the length of the
West Coast early Thursday morning. A shortwave trough is forecast to
move through the base of this upper troughing over central/southern
CA and into AZ throughout the period. This evolution will help
induce a more negative tilt to the parent upper troughing by early
Friday morning. A large area of precipitation is anticipated within
the warm conveyor preceding this shortwave, beginning the period
over CA and ending the period across AZ, southern UT, and the Four
Corners vicinity. Predominately stable conditions are anticipated
within this leading area of precipitation. However, cooling
mid-level temperatures in its wake should result in limited buoyancy
and the potential for a few lightning flashes with the more cellular
convection as it gradually shifts eastward from CA into southern AZ.

Some limited buoyancy may also develop during the afternoon and
evening in the Four Corners vicinity, amid the persistent warm-air
advection ahead of the shortwave (and ahead of large area of
precipitation). As such, some of the storms may become deep enough
to produce isolated lightning flashes.

Farther east, upper ridging, initially extending from the Lower MS
Valley through the northern Plains, will gradually shift eastward,
ending the period extended from the Mid-South through the Upper
Midwest. As it does, a compact shortwave trough is forecast to move
across KS and OK. Some showers are possible across the southern
Plains in association with this wave, but stable conditions will
preclude deep convection. Upper troughing will also progress across
the Upper Great Lakes into the OH Valley and Northeast, but cool,
stable conditions will preclude thunderstorm development.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
No thunderstorm areas are apparent through tonight.

...20Z Update...
An isolated flash or two still remains possible across southeast AZ
this evening as well as over the Carolina Piedmont tonight. However,
overall coverage in both of these areas is still expected to remain
less than 10%.

..Mosier.. 01/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1021 AM CST Tue Jan 30 2024/

...Synopsis/Discussion...
Downstream of a broad/weak southern-latitude mid/upper-level trough
currently over the Baja Peninsula, morning satellite imagery shows
an embedded disturbance tracking slowly northward across northwest
Mexico. This embedded disturbance should generally continue
northward within a belt of modest south-southwesterly flow
downstream of the parent trough, with related lift overspreading
portions of southeastern AZ by this afternoon. Despite increasing
cloud coverage associated with this feature, ample diurnal
heating/steepening low-level lapse rates amid weak low-level
moisture advection may support very weak surface-based instability
(characterized by an inverted-V profile) across far southeastern AZ
by this afternoon. However, given modest large-scale ascent and the
limited buoyancy, any embedded lightning potential appears too low
for a General Thunderstorm area. 

Farther east, a robust midlevel trough and attendant jet streak will
continue southeastward across the OH and TN Valleys today. While
strong deep-layer lift along a related cold front will favor a swath
of east/southeastward-moving precipitation into the Carolinas, any
pre-frontal elevated buoyancy appears too limited for a substantial
thunderstorm risk. The one exception will be offshore of NC during
the overnight/early morning hours, where heat/moisture fluxes atop
the Gulf Steam will contribute to sufficient instability for
thunderstorms.

1234 PM CST Tue Jan 30 2024

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Latest guidance continues to show
some potential for areas of elevated fire weather conditions across
the TX Panhandle into southeast CO/southwest KS, but recent fuel
guidance continues to suggests fuels are not overly receptive.
Additionally, localized elevated fire weather conditions may
materialize across central to northern Florida as a dry offshore
flow regime continues. RH reductions into the low 30s may coincide
with 10-15 mph winds, but latest fuel guidance indicates fuels are
near to below the 50th percentile. No highlights are introduced for
now, but fuel and RH/wind trends will be monitored for both regions.

..Moore.. 01/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CST Tue Jan 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broadly cyclonic flow aloft will move into the West Coast and parts
of the Great Basin on Wednesday. A lead weak shortwave trough moving
out of the Four Corners will lift northeast into the central High
Plains. A modestly deep lee trough will develop in response in
eastern Colorado/western Kansas. Some enhancement of southerly winds
is possible from the Texas Panhandle into western Kansas. While RH
could fall near 20%, current fuel moisture is too high for fire
weather concerns.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 311200Z - 061200Z

Fire weather potential through the work week remains limited, though
regional concerns may emerge across southwest Texas by next weekend.
Latest long-range ensemble guidance continues to show reasonably
good agreement in the maintenance of an upper ridge over the
Intermountain West and Plains through the middle of the work week.
This pattern will favor dry conditions across the central U.S. while
southwesterly flow along the West Coast and a shortwave trough
across the OH River Valley/Southeast introduce precipitation chances
elsewhere. A persistent west/northwest flow regime is expected to
promote unseasonably warm temperatures across the Plains that may
result in some fuel drying through the week, though winds are
forecast to remain sufficiently light to preclude fire concerns.

Heading into the upcoming weekend, long-range guidance depicts a
subtropical jet extension nosing into northern Mexico/southern TX.
This should support lee troughing/cyclogenesis across the southern
High Plains with breezy westerly winds across southern NM into
southwest TX. Deterministic solutions have come into better
agreement regarding this scenario, and the probability for at least
elevated (to possibly critical) fire weather conditions across
southwest TX has increased in latest ensemble guidance. Fuels across
this region are currently not receptive, but may trend drier prior
to this weekend. Forecast and fuel trends will be monitored in
subsequent outlooks for an increasing fire weather threat.
