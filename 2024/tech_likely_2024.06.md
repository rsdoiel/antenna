## What Your Brain Is Doing When You’re Not Doing Anything

date: 2024-02-05, from: Quanta Magazine

When your mind is wandering, your brain’s “default mode” network is active.

You should assume that some day <i>all</i> these systems will disappear. The web is ephemeral. But -- my guess is <a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> will be around longer. However, honestly, I really have no idea, no one does.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If you're creating something new, definitely create it on feedland.com. If you're already using feedland.org, for now you're welcome to continue, but in the back of your mind think about creating a new account on Com and importing your subscription list. Org is proving useful to have around, so I don't imagine it'll go away, it's much easier for me to work on a DO server than on the big cloud-based server.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Org runs on a small <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new">Digital Ocean server</a>, and Com runs in a data center. The first is a fixed-size relatively small scale server that can't expand, and the latter is designed to scale automatically according to demand. I spent most of 2023 converting the software to run in the scalable environment.

BTW, while we're doing this transition in FeedLand, I also have a small crisis happening on my main static server, which depends on a combination of software that suddenly aren't getting along with each other. Obviously something changed. I'm running it in a somewhat crippled state, I may be figuring how to dig out of this hole. One of the downsides of having fun with server software.

<p>Seeing some of the apple headsets on social media and I'm struggling to decide if my automatic reactions are genuine, fair, and kind. My first thoughts are quite negative. Is it because I have a prejudice against Apple? Or against augmented reality it whatever new term is getting pushed? Does it look ridiculous because I'm judging people against a deep seeded set of cultural norms I should be questioning? I'm really not sure.</p>

## Routines

date: 2024-02-05, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I found the inverse of that to also be true for my life. Doing things differently day after day and expecting the same–positive–outcome.</p>
<p>I’m the product of two terrible traits: I’m a morning person but I also lack self-discipline. And that means keeping a morning routine is incredibly hard for me. And yet, every time I manage to do that I feel really well. My mind is in a much better place when I wake up at 6 am or even 5 am. I feel a lot better when I’m out in nature with the sun rising. I know it. I’m aware of all this. And yet keeping a morning routine is incredibly hard. I’m getting better at it though so I’m pleased with that.</p>
<p>Learning how my mind works is a fun process. You’re tempted to think you just know yourself and yet there’s always a new discovery waiting behind the corner. Thankfully I have my whole life to figure this stuff out.</p>

## Why NetNewsWire Isn’t Available for Vision Pro

date: 2024-02-05, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>I’ve been getting questions about NetNewsWire’s unavailability on Vision Pro. Why isn’t it there? When might it be there?</p>

<p>Here’s the scoop:</p>

<p>I consider it risky to support an app running on a device I don’t own. Imagine writing a Mac or iPhone app and not actually running it on one of those machines — you wouldn’t.</p>

<p>I realize that the app would act as if it were running on an iPad — but the Vision Pro is not really an iPad. It’s a device with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/simple_tricks_and_nonsense">very different interactions</a> from the direct manipulation we’re used to on iPad. And the compatibility mode is a new thing because this device is a new thing — we don’t know how well it works and what the gotchas might be.</p>

<p>I could test it on the simulator, sure, but the simulator is a convenience for developers. It’s no replacement for running it on a real device.</p>

<p>And, yes, the app is open source, which could mean that other developers with a Vision Pro could help support it — but it’s important to remember that I’m the only person who <em>has</em> to support it. The NetNewsWire team is awesome, but I’m the one on the line for this.</p>

<p>So I want to be careful and go slowly, because if I made it available it would be extremely difficult to reverse the decision and take it away, even with an excellent reason.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that a consensus will form among developers that running apps on Vision Pro as iPad apps is fine, that it’s a cakewalk. If that happens, I’d go ahead and do it too. But it’s too soon for us to know that.</p>

<p>PS Why don’t I have a Vision Pro? I’m sure it’s an incredible technical achievement and an amazing experience — and pretty damn wonderful in just about every way — but it’s just not my thing. I like reading and writing mostly, plus making apps for reading and writing. My personal future of computing has been here for all these years — the Mac.</p>

<p>PPS Eventually the price will come down to where I’d consider buying one as a test device and for a little fun — but that may be a few years away. I’m hoping that we’ll find, sooner than that, that running as iPad on Vision Pro is a-okay.</p>

One of the cool things about being a programmer is that you can decide to run code that you know has zero chance of working. "Let all hell break loose," a programmer can be heard to say quietly before clicking the Run button. Very few design professions get to do this, I imagine, unless they're psychotic.

## Resolving 'Temporary failure in name resolution' on Pi OS 12 Bookworm

date: 2024-02-04, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Resolving 'Temporary failure in name resolution' on Pi OS 12 Bookworm</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Raspberry Pi OS version 12 (based on Debian 12 Bookworm) uses NetworkManager instead of dhcpcd for managing network connections, DNS resolution settings, DHCP, etc.</p>

<p>I've already mentioned <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/nmcli-wifi-on-raspberry-pi-os-12-bookworm">using <code>nmcli</code> and <code>nmtui</code> for managing WiFi settings</a>, but I ran into a strange issue after installing Docker on a fresh Raspberry Pi OS installation today. Suddenly DNS stopped working.</p>

<p>Trying to ping anything on the Internet gave me:</p>

<pre><code>$ ping www.google.com
ping: www.google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
</code></pre>

<p>As always, <a href="https://redshirtjeff.com/listing/it-was-dns-shirt?product=211">It was DNS</a>. It was like DNS just gave up the ghost! Trying to change settings via <code>nmtui</code> seemed to not work (I tried DHCP for IPv4 with manual DNS, and that wasn't working).</p>

<p>Luckily, I found <a href="https://serverfault.com/a/810639">this post</a> and followup comments mentioning the proper <code>nmcli</code> incantation to override DNS settings for an interface, so here it is (assuming built-in Ethernet):</p></div>

## Over the edge: the use of design tactics to undermine browser choice

date: 2024-02-04, from: OS News

In order to be able to choose their own browser, people must be free to download it, easily set it to default and to continue using it – all without interference from the operating system. Windows users do not currently enjoy this freedom of choice. To investigate Microsoft’s tactics and the impact on consumers, Mozilla commissioned Harry Brignull and Cennydd Bowles, independent researchers and experts in harmful design. Today, the researchers have published a report detailing how Microsoft prevents effective browser choice on Windows. In the report, they document how Microsoft places its own browser — Edge — at the center of its operating system and weaponizes Windows’ user interface design to undermine people selecting rival browsers. ↫ Mozilla Research We all already know Microsoft does these things, and of course, a study paid for by Mozilla agreeing with Mozilla is not exactly earth-shattering, but stuff like this is important for aiding in convincing regulators to do something about this stuff. It simply shouldn&#8217;t be legal to employ all kinds of nasty tricks and dark patterns to force people to use a certain browser.

## Niri: a scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor.

date: 2024-02-04, from: OS News

Niri is a scrollable, tiling window manager for Wayland. What does it mean for a tiling window manager to be scrollable? Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right. Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize. Every monitor has its own separate window strip. Windows can never &#8220;overflow&#8221; onto an adjacent monitor. Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically. Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#8217;s always one empty workspace present all the way down. ↫ Niri&#8217;s GitHub page Definitely an intriguing idea.
