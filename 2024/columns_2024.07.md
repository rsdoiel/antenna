## With great responsibilities

date: 2024-02-12, from: Paolo Valdemarin's blog

Having just started a company that primarily deals with large language models I&#8217;m occasionally thinking about the responsibilities that we have when we introduce a new AI agent in the digital space.

## ’Fast Car‘

date: 2024-02-11, from: Dan Rather's Steady

While watching the Grammys last Sunday, I was delighted by a duet performed by Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs. They sang &#8220;Fast Car,&#8221; a hit for Chapman in 1988. I was not the only one so moved. As I have discovered, it was one of the most popular performances of the night. I am an old-school country music fan, so I was not aware of Combs&#8217; cover of Chapman&#8217;s hit. It certainly is a reason to smile.
