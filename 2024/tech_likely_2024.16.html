24.04 supports easy installation of OpenZFS root file-system with
encryption</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>So with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is the ability to continue with a standard
EXT4 file-system install, an encrypted file-system using LVM, or using
OpenZFS with/without encryption. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS also has the ability
to enjoy hardware-backed full-disk encryption with TPM as another new
experimental option. Or, of course, the Ubuntu desktop installer
continues supporting manual (custom) partitioning as well. ‚Ü´ Michael
Larabel I just use whatever Btrfs setup Fedora automatically recommends
when I let it take over a disk ‚Äì file systems for desktops seems a bit
like a solved problem to me personally ‚Äì but I‚Äôm still curious what
benefits, for instance, an OpenZFS setup could bring to a desktop user
compared to Btrfs or a basic Ext4 setup. Why should a desktop user use
OpenZFS?</p>

<h2 id="theyre-looting-the-internet">They‚Äôre looting the internet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is the state of the modern internet ‚Äî ultra-profitable platforms
outright abdicating any responsibility toward the customer, offering not
a ‚Äúservice‚Äù or a ‚Äúportal,‚Äù but cramming as many ways to interrupt the
user and push them into doing things that make the company money. The
greatest lie in tech is that Facebook and Instagram are for ‚Äúcatching up
with your friends,‚Äù because that‚Äôs no longer what they do. These
platforms are now pathways for the nebulous concept of ‚Äúcontent
discovery,‚Äù a barely-personalized entertainment network that
occasionally drizzles people or things you choose to see on top of
sponsored content and groups that a relational database has decided are
‚Äúgood for you.‚Äù ‚Ü´ Edward Zitron Corporate social media has gotten so
bad, they‚Äôre basically unusable. The rare times I open Facebook to like
a picture my mother posted or whatever, I‚Äôm just gobsmacked by how
utterly unusable it has become. I‚Äôve never used Instagram, but whenever
I accidentally end up there, I have no idea how to navigate that place.
YouTube is more ads than video if you don‚Äôt pay for Premium (which I do,
because I use YouTube a lot so I get enough value out of it). Twitter is
barely worth a mention ‚Äì it‚Äôs no surprise that a social network bought
and run by a nazi is now even fuller of nazis than it already was. It‚Äôs
not just social networks, either. The web as a whole feels like it‚Äôs
been looted and plundered, and turned into a flyover state strip mall.
Browsing the web is, for me at least, virtually impossible without
autoplay blockers, my Pi-Hole, Consent-O-Matic, and settings to
permanently block requests for location and notification access. The
rise of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù has only made everything even worse, especially now that
the big, wealthy content networks that, yes, own all your favourite
technology news websites are also looking into it. Luckily, there‚Äôs also
a countermovement brewing. I‚Äôve focused OSNews‚Äô entire ‚Äúsocial‚Äù strategy
on Mastodon (and the various other ActivityPub tools), as it‚Äôs the only
social medium that‚Äôs usable and enjoyable. With the nazis remaining on
Twitter, and all the brands and influencers on Facebook (or Threads or
whatever), everyone else interested in technology coalesced around the
Fediverse, and it‚Äôs been a massive boon for a small website like OSNews
trying to steer clear from all the SEO enshittification. There‚Äôs no
spam, only relatively small, approachable brands, no influencers, no
algorithms ‚Äì just real, ordinary people, who also care about a usable,
fair, and equitable web. I hope that OSNews can eventually be run
without any ads at all, but that‚Äôs going to take a lot more consistent
work from me to convince more and more people to support us through
Patreon or Ko-Fi, or for companies to become sponsors. However, I am
convinced it‚Äôs a better route to take than trying to chase the SEO
dragon, because we all know where that leads to.</p>

<h2 id="working-together">Working together</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Each form of online discussion has a <i>grain</i> to it. Doc and I used
to
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/followsthegrain.png">talk</a>
about how something ‚Äúfollows the grain of the web.‚Äù Twitter has its own
grain, formed by its character limit, what information is shared (ie
number of followers in both directions).
</p>
<p>
I made a list of some of the social networks I‚Äôve been on starting in
the mid-70s. The list is very long. And each of them had their own
limits, rules and features, and each led to a certain kinds of
relationships between the participants. Mail lists that gain traction
always flame out. It‚Äôs hard to get people to read your blog. If you make
it easier it changes into something else. Instagram, Youtube, TikTok
form hierarchies of influencers. I think of thos as the networks Taylor
Lorenz covers.
</p>
<p>
But there isn‚Äôt a structure that I‚Äôm aware of that leads to people
working together. It‚Äôs a puzzle I keep trying to figure out.
</p>
<p>
We need ‚Äúworking together‚Äù to survive climate change and fascism. It
would be good to crack this nut.
</p>
<p>
One of the nicest things about ChatGPT is that it‚Äôs always up for
working with together with you. The critics of AI don‚Äôt begin to
understand this. As an example, I‚Äôm going to ask ChatGPT to draw a
picture of people working together.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/peopleWorkingTogether.png">Here
it is</a>.
</p>
<p>
What got me thinking this way this morning is a bit of collaboration I
did <a href="https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun">with
palafo</a> on Threads. It‚Äôs remarkable. We actually did some work
together. It may be hard to read the thread but if you‚Äôre curious about
collaborative systems, here‚Äôs a real example. Serendipitous, unplanned,
but we figured something out by combining our experiences. Fantastic.
</p>
<p>
Later, Ben Werdmuller, a person who I‚Äôve gotten to know a little
recently, is intelligent and asks good questions. He asked one
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@ben.werdmuller/post/C50vyIruTCB">today</a>,
how do they get the live audience on SNL to laugh when they want them to
laugh. I had an idea and
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C50wy5NsYD0">shared</a> it.
</p>
<p>
If you take away one thing from this post it‚Äôs that we can collaborate
with the machines, and maybe that will unlock collaboration between
humans. In fact, in a way they are facilitating the collaboration. If
you want to be part of the collective human intelligence, you may be
thinking about the machines in the wrong way. Maybe they‚Äôre the most
human thing we have, because AI is made up of humans, like

PPS: Yesterday I gave John O‚ÄôNolan what I think is a
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C5y7iVoJP4r">good idea</a>
for getting his Ghost blogs federating with Threads, Mastodon et al.¬†I
didn‚Äôt expect thanks or even a response, but I wonder if he even heard
it. Most of the time, trying to help other people results in not even an
acknowledgment that they saw it. If I were him I‚Äôd look for a painless,
quick way to get maximum interop. Something like
<a href="http://ghost.social/">ghost.social</a>. I‚Äôd give the same
advice to Matt at Automattic (in fact I think I did).
</p>
<p>
PPPS: I think acknowledgment is a key part of ‚Äúworking together‚Äù on the
web. Nothing more than ‚ÄúI wanted you to know I saw it‚Äù is often all
that‚Äôs needed to grease the skids of discourse. I‚Äôve had a friendly
disagreement with Manton at micro.blog about this.

printer hack of Windows 95</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>During my daily web crawl I encountered a very interesting gif that I
haven‚Äôt seen in a long time. It was a hack of an unspecified version of
Windows 95, which showed how to bypass the login screen with the help of
the menu and printing dialog. However, after a brief check, I found a
fair amount of people stating that ‚Äújust hitting the cancel‚Äù button
would do the same. Sharp-eyed viewers would notice that it was the very
first action taken in the picture. In order to find out if the hack is
real at all, I decided to reproduce it and document it for the good of
the internet. ‚Ü´ David Polakovic So this hack is actually a lot more
involved than I thought it was going to be, and yet, it still feels
utterly insane that operating systems were this easy to get into,
passwords were this easy to decrypt, and security settings were this
trivial to disable. Anyway, the gif is sort-of real, in that yes, you
can ‚Äòhack‚Äô Windows 95‚Äôs login security through the printing and help
subsystems. Things were different back then, man. I vaguely remember
that my high school used to lock us out of the desktop, File Explorer,
the Control Panel, and so on, making it impossible for us to access DOS
or the games built into Windows 9x. I don‚Äôt remember the exact things we
used to do, but most of us were aware and used several different methods
of bypassing the school lockdowns just to mess around. We never did
anything malicious ‚Äì this is pre-internet, and we just wanted to play
some Solitaire or Pinball ‚Äì but anybody with malicious intent surely
could‚Äôve.</p>

<p>New TVs that launch with Android TV 14 or later on Linux kernel 5.15
or higher will be required to meet Google‚Äôs Generic Kernel Image (GKI)
requirements in order to pass certification! This means that GKI is now
enforced on all major Android form factors with AArch64 chipsets:
handhelds, watches, automotive, &amp; televisions. ‚Ü´ Mishaal Rahman What
this means is that all the major Android form factors will be running
kernels that adhere to the GKI requirements, which means SoC and board
support is not part of the core kernel, but instead achieved through
loadable modules. This should, in theory, make it easier to provide
long-term support.</p>

<h1>
GHC 9.6.5 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-04-16
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.5.
Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are
available on the <a href="/download_ghc_9_6_5.html">release page</a>.
</p>
<p>
This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing some issues found
in the 9.6 series. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bumping the bundled <code>process</code> library to 1.6.19.0 to avoid a
potential
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/advisories/hackage/process/HSEC-2024-0003.md">command
injection vulnerability</a> on Windows for clients of this library. This
isn‚Äôt known to affect GHC itself, but allows users who depend on the
installed version of the <code>process</code> to avoid the issue.
</li>
<li>
Fixing a bug resulting in the distributed <code>hsc2hs</code> wrapper
using flags from the compiler build environment
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24050">#24050</a>).
</li>
<li>
Disabling the <code>-fasm-shortcutting</code> optimisation with
<code>-O2</code> as it is known to result in unsoundess and incorrect
runtime results in some cases
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24507">#24507</a>).
</li>
<li>
Ensuring we take <code>LDFLAGS</code> into account when configuring a
linker
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24565">#24565</a>).
</li>
<li>
Fixing a bug arising from incorrect parsing of paths containing spaces
in the settings file
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24265">#24265</a>).
</li>
<li>
And many more fixes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.6.5/docs/users_guide/9.6.5-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are
encouraged to upgrade promptly.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake
pool, Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!

intends to fully embrace ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, but doesn‚Äôt address sourcing or its
environmental impact</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>All weekend, I‚Äôve been mulling over a recent blog post by Fedora
Project Leader Matthew Miller, which he wrote and published on behalf of
the Fedora Council. Fedora (the KDE version) is my distribution of
choice, I love using it, and I consider it the best distribution for
desktop use, and not by a close margin either. As such, reading a blog
post in which Fedora is announcing plans to make extensive use of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù
was bound to make me a feel a little uneasy. Miller states ‚Äì correctly ‚Äì
that the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù space as it stands right now is dominated so much by
hyperbole and over-the-top nonsense that it‚Äôs hard to judge the various
technologies underpinning ‚ÄúAI‚Äù on merit alone. He continues that he
believes that stripped of all the hyperbole and techbro bullshit,
there‚Äôs ‚Äúsomething significant, powerful‚Äù, and he wants to make ‚ÄúFedora
Linux the best community platform for AI‚Äù. So, what exactly does that
look like? In addition to the big showy LLM-based tools for chat and
code generation, these advances have brought big jumps for more tailored
tasks: for translation, file search, home automation, and especially for
accessibility (already a key part of our strategy). For example, open
source speech synthesis has long lagged behind proprietary options. Now,
what we have in Fedora is not even close to the realism, nuance, and
flexibility of AI-generated speech. ‚Ü´ Matthew Miller Some of these are
things we can all agree are important and worthwhile, but lacking on the
Linux desktop. If we can make use of technologies labelled as ‚ÄúAI‚Äù to
improve, say, text-to-speech on Linux for those who require it for
accessibility reasons, that‚Äôs universally a great thing. Translation,
too, is, at its core, a form of accessibility, and if we can improve
machine translations so that people who, for instance, don‚Äôt speak
English gain more access to English content, or if we can make the vast
libraries of knowledge locked into foreign languages accessible to more
people, that‚Äôs all good news. However, Fedora aims to take its use of
‚ÄúAI‚Äù even further, and wants to start using it in the process of
developing, making, and distributing Fedora. This is where more and more
red flags are starting to pop up for me, because I don‚Äôt feel like the
processes and tasks they want to inject ‚ÄúAI‚Äù into are the kinds of
processes and tasks where you want humans taken out of the equation. We
can use AI/ML as part of making the Fedora Linux OS. New tools could
help with package automation and bug triage. They could note anomalies
in test results and logs, maybe even help identify potential security
issues. We can also create infrastructure-level features for our users.
For example, package update descriptions aren‚Äôt usually very meaningful.
We could automatically generate concise summaries of what‚Äôs new in each
system update ‚Äî not just for each package, but highlighting what‚Äôs
important in the whole set, including upstream change information as
well. ‚Ü´ Matthew Miller Even the tools built atop billions and billions
of euros of investments by Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Facebook, and
similar juggernauts are not exactly good at what they‚Äôre supposed to do,
and suck at even the most basic of tasks of providing answers to simple
questions. They lie, they make stuff up, they bug out and produce
nonsense, they‚Äôre racist, and so on. I don‚Äôt want any of that garbage
near the process of making and updating the operating system I rely on
every day. Miller laments how ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is currently a closed-source, black
box affair, which obviously doesn‚Äôt align with Fedora‚Äôs values and
goals. He doesn‚Äôt actually explain how Fedora‚Äôs use of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is going to
address this. They‚Äôre going to have to find ethical, open source models
that are also of high quality, and that‚Äôs a lot easier said than done.
Sourcing doesn‚Äôt even get a single mention in this blog post, even
though I‚Äôm fairly sure that‚Äôs one of the two major issues many of us
have with the current crop of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù tools. The blog post also completely
neglects to mention the environmental cost of training these ‚ÄúAI‚Äù tools.
It costs an insane amount of electricity to train these new tools, and
with climate change ever accelerating and the destruction of our
environment visible all around us, not mentioning this problem when
you‚Äôre leading a project like Fedora seems disingenuous at best, and
malicious at worst. While using ‚ÄúAI‚Äù to improve accessibility tools in
Fedora and the wider Linux world is laudable, some of the other intended
targets seem more worrisome, especially when you take into account that
the blog post makes no mention of the two single biggest problems with
‚ÄúAI‚Äù: sourcing, and its environmental impact. If Fedora truly intends to
fully embrace ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, it‚Äôs going to have to address these two problems
first, because otherwise they‚Äôre just trying to latch onto the hype
without really understanding the cost. And that‚Äôs not something I want
to hear from the leaders of my Linux distribution.</p>

software and firmware have been a mess, but it‚Äôs working on them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Framework puts a lot of effort into making its hardware easy to fix
and upgrade and into making sure that hardware can stay useful down the
line when it‚Äôs been replaced by something newer. But supporting that
kind of reuse and recycling works best when paired with long-term
software and firmware support, and on that front, Framework has been
falling short. Framework will need to step up its game, especially if it
wants to sell more laptops to businesses‚Äîa lucrative slice of the PC
industry that Framework is actively courting. By this summer or fall,
we‚Äôll have some idea of whether its efforts are succeeding. ‚Ü´ Andrew
Cunningham at Ars Technica A very painful read, and I‚Äôm disappointed to
learn that the software support from Framework has been so lacklustre ‚Äì
or non-existent, to be more accurate. Leaving severel security
vulnerabilities in firmware unpatched is a disgrace, and puts users at
risk, while promising but not delivering updates that will unlock faster
Thunderbolt speeds is just shitty. They have to do better, especially
since their pitch is all about repairability and longevity. This article
has made me more weary of spending any money on Framework ‚Äì not that I
have the money for a new laptop, because reasons ‚Äì and I feel more
people will feel this way after reading this.</p>

<h2 id="radxa-rock-5-itx-a-first-look">Radxa ROCK 5 ITX: a first
look</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the ROCK 5 ITX coming soon and
since then, samples of the Rockchip RK3588-based Radxa ROCK 5 ITX have
been landing on doorsteps (or service points, screw you, UPS) of a lucky
group of people and somehow I was one of those, so here‚Äôs a first look
at Radxa‚Äôs latest Single Board Computer in a Mini ITX form-factor! It‚Äôs
going to be a photo-heavy post and I make no apologies for that, it‚Äôs a
very nice-looking PCB, with the black and gold colour scheme looking
very stylish. I imagine that was a very conscious decision seeing as, as
expected, they‚Äôre marketing this as a low-power desktop option and you
probably don‚Äôt want a plain Jane motherboard taking pride of place in
your new system, right? ‚Ü´ Bret Weber Now this ‚Äì this, my friends, is
exactly what the doctor ordered. I can‚Äôt wait for standard, ATX
motherboard sporting ARM processors to become more common and readily
available, hopefully standardised better than what we‚Äôre used to from
the ARM world. I want my next (non-gaming) machines to be ARM-powered,
and that means we‚Äôre going to need more of these ATX ARM boards,
spanning wider performance levels.</p>

projection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve read my first post about¬†Spatial Video, the second
about¬†Encoding Spatial Video, or if you‚Äôve used my¬†command-line tool,
you may recall a mention of Apple‚Äôs mysterious ‚Äúfisheye‚Äù projection
format. Mysterious because they‚Äôve documented
a¬†CMProjectionType.fisheye¬†enumeration with no elaboration, they stream
their immersive Apple TV+ videos in this format, yet they‚Äôve provided no
method to produce or playback third-party content using this projection
type. Additionally, the format is undocumented, they haven‚Äôt responded
to an¬†open question on the Apple Discussion Forums¬†asking for more
detail, and they didn‚Äôt cover it in their WWDC23 sessions. As someone
who has experience in this area ‚Äì and a relentless curiosity ‚Äì I‚Äôve
spent time digging-in to Apple‚Äôs fisheye projection format, and this
post shares what I‚Äôve learned. ‚Ü´ Mike Swanson There is just so much cool
technology crammed into the Vision Pro, from the crazy displays down to,
apparently, the encoding format for spatial video. Too bad Apple seems
to have forgotten that a technology is not a product, as even the most
ardent Apple supporterts ‚Äì like John Gruber, or the hosts of ATP ‚Äì have
stated their Vision Pro devices are lying unused, collecting dust, just
months after launch.</p>

external SSDs are faster with Apple¬†silicon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC,
I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously
I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even
though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you‚Äôre
still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But
if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you‚Äôre far
better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC‚Äôs
Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a
compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. ‚Ü´ Howard Oakley If
you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you‚Äôre looking for an external drive
‚Äì this is some good advice to follow.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a>
about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out
opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn‚Äôt
happen, we don‚Äôt even look at each others software. After waiting a
whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short
periods, but it‚Äôs most of the time it‚Äôs been people trying to

that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole

love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans
who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and
everything they (don‚Äôt) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks
(and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won‚Äôt be any of us left,
everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall,
because you can‚Äôt win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal
thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of
us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather
they‚Äôre feeding an addiction.</p>

<li>
<p>
Partial implementation of the
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/281">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>, allowing visible quantification to be
used in the types of terms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/624">Extension</a>
of LinearTypes to allow linear <code>let</code> and <code>where</code>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The implementation of the
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/330">exception
backtrace proposal</a>, allowing the annotation of exceptions with
backtraces, as well as other user-defined context
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Further improvements in the info table provenance mechanism, reducing
code size to allow IPE information to be enabled more widely
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Javascript FFI support in the WebAssembly backend
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements in the fragmentation characteristics of the low-latency

releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
This alpha is the penultimate prerelease leading to 9.10.1. In two weeks
we plan to publish a release candidate, followed, if all things go well,
by the final release a week later.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.

6.10 to merge NTSYNC driver for emulating Windows NT synchronization

<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Going through my usual scanning of all the ‚Äú-next‚Äù Git subsystem
branches of new code set to be introduced for the next Linux kernel
merge window, a very notable addition was just queued up‚Ä¶ Linux 6.10 is
set to merge the NTSYNC driver for emulating the Microsoft Windows NT
synchronization primitives within the kernel for allowing better
performance with Valve‚Äôs Steam Play (Proton) and Wine of Windows games
and other apps on Linux. ‚Ü´ Michael Larabel The improvements to
performance of games running under Proton this new driver will bring are
legitimately insane. We‚Äôre looking at a game-changing addition to the
Linux kernel here, and it‚Äôs no surprise, then, to see this effort being
spearheaded by companies like Valve and CodeWeavers.</p>

Christoph Cullmann, one of the developers of Kate, published a short
