asteroids come in a wide range of sizes. Cataloging asteroids in space

as they zip along their orbits around the Sun. Astronomers recently used

you’re working deep inside a complex project and have an unrelated idea.
How long does it take to switch to writing mode, get the idea down, and
return to what you were doing. The less time it takes the more
<i>fluidity. </i>Twitter totally won there. And we, the bloggers, made a
tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it
was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn’t. So they got
all the causal writing, and over time sucked the life out of blogging. I
think it’s time to put the fluidity back, without compromising on
features and lock-in.</p>

<h2 id="cosmic-continues-march-towards-alpha-release">COSMIC continues
march towards alpha release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>COSMIC, System76’s Rust-based desktop that’s going to replace GNOME
in Pop!_OS, is nearing its alpha release, and the Linux OEM has
published another blog post detailing the latest progress it’s made.
First and foremost, theming support has been further refined by adding
support for theming GTK applications (both GTK3 and 4) and flatpak
applications. If the user has enabled global themes, these themes will
be applied automatically whenever selecting a theme to apply. Support
for custom icon packs has also been added. COSMIC now also has an
application store, much like GNOME Software and KDE’s Discover, which
also takes care of updating installed applications. You can now also
drag windows from anywhere inside the window by holding down the super
key, which is both a nice addition in general as well as a usability
feature. The Settings application has also seen work, and gets a new
keyboard settings panel, as well as various other smaller additions.
COSMIC also now implements on-screen display toasts for things like
changing volume and brightness, and plugging in power. System76 isn’t
the only one working on COSMIC – community members have implemented
things like window snapping, touchpad gestures, thumbnail previews in
the dock, and more. The community is also working on things like an emoi
picker, and a fan control graphical user interface. There’s a lot more
in the blog post, so be sure to give it a read. I’m genuinely excited
for COSMIC to hit the shelves, because I’m dying to try it out.</p>

There is a rash of flavoured teas in British supermarkets since I
returned. Shortbread flavoured tea, for instance. I find them weird and
a bit sickly. So I tried a mixture of ordinary black teabags and
flavoured teabags. This worked rather better and I recommend it. It
takes the edge off.

However if you can get real Indian masala chai tea leaves, use them.
Follow the instructions. You have to boil it. But it’s great and blows
the socks off the feeble so called chai that European grocers sell.

<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/text-mapper/solo/random">Solo
algorithm</a> for <a href="Text_Mapper">Text Mapper</a>.
</p>
<p>
As always, my main issue with maps is river systems. I just can’t help
it! 😅 The solo-gaming constraint makes this an interesting challenge
because you can’t ever go back and redo a hex that’s been discovered.
</p>
<p>
The first problem was that I needed a model of how the map was going to
be explored to simulate the key constraint. What I use is a biased
random walk of ever increasing length that keeps starting in the middle
of the map, where the “safe haven” is imagined to be. The random walk is
biased in as much as it prefers to pick an unexplored hex, if possible.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-17-solo-map-1.jpg" alt="Example explorations on the map." />
</p>
<p>
When debugging, the numbers on the map represent the order in which the
hexes are discovered, the coordinates and the altitude from 0 to 10.
</p>
<p>
Of course my algorithm still runs into impossible situations like rivers
meeting in a local minimum that I can’t fix because there are no
take-backs. In those situations I have decided to place a cave entrance
and would run it as an entrance into the underworld. Who wouldn’t want
rivers to disappear into the underworld‽
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Examples: In the map above, when entering 1008 or 1405, river flow could
turn out to be problematic since all the surrounding hexes have been
explored and can no longer be changed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Every hex has two extra data points:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
altitude from 0 (the deep ocean) to 10 (the highest peaks)
</li>
<li>
optionally, a direction of water flow (where it goes to)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The strange part about this is that you cannot tell which hex is “up
river” without actually going there and seeing whether this is where the
water came from. If the next hex has no river then you followed a small
creek that got smaller and smaller and finally it disappeared. If the
next hex has a river that flows elsewhere, then you crossed a ridge and
now you’re in another valley.
</p>
<p>
When determining a random neighbour, roll a d6: 1 is north, 2 is
north-east, 3 is south-east, 4 is south, 5 is south-west, 6 is
north-west.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how you start the map:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Roll a d6 for the <em>preferred direction</em> of water for this map.
</li>
<li>
Pick a hex in the middle of the map. Assign it the altitude 5.
</li>
<li>
Roll a d6 for the <em>direction of the local river</em>. The starting
hex always has a river.
</li>
<li>
Roll 2d6 and <em>adjust the altitude</em> (see below).
</li>
<li>
Use the same 2d6 result for the check whether the new hex has <em>water
flow</em> (see below).
</li>
<li>
Now that altitude and water flow are known, determine the terrain (see
below).
</li>
<li>
Use the same 2d6 result for the check whether the new hex has a
<em>settlement or ruin</em> (see below). The starting hex always starts
with a village.
</li>
<li>
When entering a new hex, go back to step 4.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adjust-the-altitude">
Adjust the altitude
</h2>
<p>
The provisional altitude of the new hex starts out as the altitude of
where you’re coming from (no sudden changes).
</p>
<p>
The altitude of the new hex is adjusted based on the 2d6 roll made
above.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If all the known hexes around the current hex are at altitudes 0–1, then
the max altitude is 0 (deep ocean). No other factors come into play, so
you can skip the rest of the altitude adjustment.
</li>
<li>
If there are neighbouring hexes with water flowing from there to the
current hex, then their lowest altitude is the current’s hex max
altitude (because rivers don’t flow up).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Take the 2d6 roll made above and look up the altitude change on the
following table:
</p>
<table>

<p>
On a result of 4–9 it depends on the slope:
</p>
<p>
If coming from altitude 7 or higher, then check the direction you’re
moving in. If you’re moving in the direction of the preferred slope or
in the opposite direction, there is no change. If you’re moving in a
different direction, the change is -1.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Example: Assume the slope is “north”. If you’re moving “south” (the
opposite of “north”) from a hex with an altitude of 8, then there is no
change.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If coming from altitude 6 or lower, the check the direction you’re
moving in. If you’re moving in the direction of the preferred slope, the
change is -1.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Example: Assume the slope is “north”. If you’re moving “south” from a
hex with an altitude of 6, then there is no change.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The idea is that mountain chains form along rivers and rivers have a
tendency to run towards the ocean. Whether this actually works as
intended, I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Apply the change to the provisional altitude and adjust for the maximum.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Example: You’re entering a new hex from a hex with altitude 5. You know
is that is has a neighbouring hex with altitude 4 that has a river going
towards the same hex. The max altitude is therefore a 4. Roll 2d6. If
you get a 2, the change is -2 and the new hex has an altitude of 5 - 2 =
3; otherwise it has an altitude of 4 because of the max and you don’t
need to bother with anything else.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

</p>
<h2 id="water-flow">
Water flow
</h2>
<p>
If the altitude of the new hex is 0, there is no water flow (deep
ocean).
</p>
<p>
The new hex has water flow if any of the following is true:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
if there is a river flowing from a neighbouring hex into the new hex;
</li>
<li>
if the altitude of the new hex is 1 (so that lakes can drain);
</li>
<li>
if the altitude is 2–8 and the 2d6 roll for altitude adjustment was a
5–8.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If so, determine the direction of the water, trying one of the
following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
pick at random from the unknown neighbouring hexes and the known
neighbouring hexes at a <em>lower</em> altitude with a river that
doesn’t end up in the new hex you’re looking at (avoid circular rivers);
if there is more than one candidate, prefer a hex in the direction of
the <em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right of the preferred
slope);
</li>
<li>
pick a random, known, neighbouring hex at the <em>same</em> altitude
with a river that doesn’t end up in the new hex you’re looking at (avoid
circular rivers); if there is more than one candidate, prefer a hex in
the direction of the <em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right
of the preferred slope);
</li>
<li>
or – “it’s magic!” – just pick one from the neighbouring hexes (all of
them at a higher altitude, of course) with a river that doesn’t end up
in the new hex you’re looking at (avoid circular rivers); if there is
more than one candidate, prefer a hex in the direction of the
<em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right of the preferred
slope)
</li>
<li>
finally, if all else fails, then it’s an <em>entrance into the
underworld</em> and the river ends right here!
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>
Example: Entering a new hex from the south, with the preferred slope
being “north”. The altitudes and directions of the known neighbours are
as follows: current hex, 5; south (where you came from), 4; north-west,
4; north, 5. Randomly pick between north-west and north-east (an unknown
hex!) since north-west is to the left of the preferred slope and
north-east is to the right of the preferred slope. North is at the same
altitude and south is in the wrong direction.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sadly, this algorithm doesn’t tell you whether a newly discovered hex at
altitude 1 is a sweet water lake or salty coastal waters. As mentioned
above, this algorithm also doesn’t tell you from which neighbouring hex
a river comes from.

id="broadcom-says-many-vmware-perpetual-licenses-got-support-extensions">Broadcom
says “many” VMware perpetual licenses got support extensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Broadcom CEO Hock Tan this week publicized some concessions aimed at
helping customers and partners ease into VMware’s recent business model
changes. Tan reiterated that the controversial changes, like the end of
perpetual licensing, aren’t going away. But amid questioning from
antitrust officials in the European Union (EU), Tan announced that the
company has already given support extensions for some VMware perpetual
license holders. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I’m linking to the
Ars Technica writeup here, because the original blog post from
Broadcom’s CEO is effectively unreadable to me, as steeped in corpospeak
as it is. The basic gist is that the storm of criticism that’s been
hovering around Broadcom ever since the changes it announced to VMware’s
licensing strategy isn’t going away, and even attracted the attention of
the European Union. As such, Broadcom is giving existing perpetual
VMware license holders some breathing room, but not much, and their
plans will be executed as-is regardless. I doubt Broadcom and VMware are
big and crucial enough for the full might of the EU to come down on
them, so I don’t think we’ll see any sudden turnarounds like we did with
Apple and Facebook, for instance, but at least some cracks are clearly
starting to show. If the aforementioned storm keeps up, pressure from
customers might actually force more concessions out of Broadcom.</p>

prefers tabs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds really doesn’t like spaces – as in, tabs vs. spaces –
and got a little annoyed that a commit removed a hidden tab because it
“apparently showed breakage in some third-party kernel config parsing
tool”. So, Torvalds decided to add some hidden tabs to trigger breakages
like this, and is threatening to add more hidden tabs if necessary. It
wasn’t clear what tool it was, but let’s make sure it gets fixed.
Because if you can’t parse tabs as whitespace, you should not be parsing
the kernel Kconfig files. In fact, let’s make such breakage more obvious
than some esoteric ftrace record size option. If you can’t parse tabs,
you can’t have page sizes. ↫ Linus Torvalds I’m not a programmer so I’m
not going to wade into this debate – I have a personal Mastodon account
to state it’s obviously tabs – but I did note that it seems like, at
least in this commit message, Torvalds uses a double space after a
period. Which is objectively the worst thing, right before
Fahrenheit.</p>

completes move to Qt 6</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>LXQt, the lightweight Qt desktop environment, has released a major
new version, which brings with it a whole slew of very important changes
and upgrades, with two main focal point. First and foremost, the desktop
environment is now using Qt 6 across the board, meaning the transition
from Qt 5 to Qt 6 is now complete. To support themes and the LXQt File
Dialog for Qt5-based apps you can install libqtxdg-3.12.0,
lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1, and libfm-qt-1.4.0 alongside the new Qt 6 variants
for backwards compatibility. One exception here is QTerminal, whose Qt 6
port ran into some issues, so a separate Qt 6 release will come later.
The second major upgrade that’s still in progress is support for
Wayland. LXQt 2.0.0 brings Wayland support for PCManFM-Qt, LXQt Runner,
and LXQt Desktop Notifications, and for LXQt 2.1.0 they plan to make
everything else available under Wayland as well. This means that more
popular desktop environment like Cinnamon and Xfce are starting to feel
a little out of step when it comes to Wayland. One of the major
user-facing new features is a new default menu for the panel which
supports favourites, a new and improved search feature, and more.</p>

installs Copilot “AI” app on Windows Servers by accident, it claims</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Do you administer Windows Server machines, and were you surprised to
find a Windows Copilot application on your servers, that neither you nor
your users installed? Well, it turns out that Microsoft installed this
application alongside an update to the Edge browser – but the company
claims this is in error, and the application will be removed in a future
update. Updates to Edge browser version 123.0.2420.65, released on March
28, 2024 and later, might incorrectly install a new package (MSIX)
called ‘Microsoft chat provider for Copilot in Windows’ on Windows
devices. Resulting from this, the Microsoft Copilot app might appear in
the Installed apps in Settings menu. It is important to note that the
Microsoft chat provider for Copilot in Windows does not execute any code
or process, and does not acquire, analyze, or transmit device or
environment data in any capacity. ↫ Windows 11 known issues and
notifications The company claims this was an enablement package to
prepare some Windows devices for the arrival of Copilot, and that it was
unintentionally installed on devices. While it doesn’t mean Copilot was
actually installed on your PC or server, it’s still a chilling reminder
of who really controls your PC or server.</p>

lays out plan to improve its firmware and software development
cycle</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Only two days ago we were talking about the software and firmware
issues at Framework, and today the company’s CEO has announced they’re
taking some pretty big steps to address these problems. When building
products to last, it’s not enough to design the hardware to be
repairable, upgradeable, and customizable. The overall longevity of
devices as complex as modern notebooks also depends on how long the
software and firmware continues to be useful. That includes
compatibility updates to support newer generations hardware modules,
fixes for bugs or compatibility issues found by end users, and
especially patches for security vulnerabilities. We recognize that we
have fallen short of where we need to be on software updates, and we are
making the needed investments to resolve this. We now have a dedicated
team of engineers at our manufacturing partner and a set of internal
stakeholders focused on ongoing software updates for all of our
products, going back to our original Framework Laptop with 11th Gen
Intel Core. In the past, we were reliant on ad-hoc availability of
engineering time from our suppliers (basically borrowing staffing from
whichever new product development we had ongoing). This was inconsistent
and resulted in slow progress. With a dedicated team, there is no longer
resource contention, and we are able deliver shorter turnaround times
from discovering issues to resolving them. ↫ Nirav Patel They’ve also
shared exactly how the development, testing, and release process new
firmware releases will work, from identifying any issues to the final
release to consumers, and they’re hiring new employees focused entirely
on expediting this process. They also promise to support each device for
as long as their upstream silicon vendors will, but they can’t give any
guarantees on how long that will be since those upstream vendors aren’t
sharing details like that. All in all, I think this is about as good a
response as you can get from an OEM, but as they themselves note,
they’ll have to show their customers these aren’t just mere words.
Assuming it pans out the way Framework is promising here, I think it’s a
fair and customer-friendly process.</p>

<h2 id="bike-crash-2023-anniversary">Bike crash 2023 anniversary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-17, from: Liam Proven blog</p>
<p>(Not really update 22.)<br /><br />Huh. Missed the anniversary of the
latest bike crash – it was on Monday. <br /><br />Today, the
ever-helpful Google showed me a selfie I took from my hospital bed a
year ago. (Thanks <em>so</em> much for the reminder,
Googs.)<br /><br />So, a year ago today I had more or less got some kind
of alertness back and was hoping to get transferred over to Liverpool
for my arm to be reassembled. Little did I know it would take another 4
days, because they were hoping to put me in an ordinary airline
seat…<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=lproven&ditemid=309377" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<p>
What maker Micah Tilton lacks in drawing skills, he more than makes up
for in robotics know-how. So rather than spend years learning how to
create a masterpiece of illustration, he automated an Etch A Sketch with
Raspberry Pi.

<h2 id="a-better-more-compact-ui-for-firefox">A better, more compact UI
for Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Proton is Firefox’s new design, starting from Firefox 89. Photon is
the old design of Firefox which was used until version 88. Proton’s
overall feel is good, but there were a few things I didn’t like and
wanted to improve.That’s why this project was born, and Lepton to denote
light theme layer. Lepton’s photon styled is preserve Photon’s feeling
while keep Original Lepton’s strengths. ↫ Firefox UI Fix GitHub page I
do not like the current Firefox user interface, because even with the
‘compact’ layout re-enabled in about:config, I find it just too bulky
and wasteful of my screen real estate. I’ve been using the above Firefox
user interface mod for ages now, and I can’t imagine using Firefox
without it. The GitHub pages and guides are a bit of a mess and
difficult to follow due to the project consisting of several overlapping
different styles, but I just use the script listed here, selecting the
style “2” when running the script. It won’t be for everyone, but for me,
it makes Firefox nice and compact, turning it into a mouse-first
interface without trying to accommodate touch. This is also by far not
the only project with this goal, so if you’re using something else –
feel free to list them.</p>

used to be, prior to plebeian flat-fronts which are to trousers what pug

months’ work. Apart from cleaning up the somewhat messy query parsing
code, a problem I’m trying to address is that the search engine is
currently only good at dealing with fairly focused queries, they don’t
need to be short, but if you try to qualify a search that is too broad
by adding more terms, it often doesn’t produce anything useful.</p>

muscle atrophy caused by microgravity. Atrophy occurs, in part, by way
of an underlying mechanism that regulates calcium uptake. Recent

<p>So with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is the ability to continue with a standard
EXT4 file-system install, an encrypted file-system using LVM, or using
OpenZFS with/without encryption. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS also has the ability
to enjoy hardware-backed full-disk encryption with TPM as another new
experimental option. Or, of course, the Ubuntu desktop installer
continues supporting manual (custom) partitioning as well. ↫ Michael
Larabel I just use whatever Btrfs setup Fedora automatically recommends
when I let it take over a disk – file systems for desktops seems a bit
like a solved problem to me personally – but I’m still curious what
benefits, for instance, an OpenZFS setup could bring to a desktop user
compared to Btrfs or a basic Ext4 setup. Why should a desktop user use
OpenZFS?</p>

<h2 id="theyre-looting-the-internet">They’re looting the internet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is the state of the modern internet — ultra-profitable platforms
outright abdicating any responsibility toward the customer, offering not
a “service” or a “portal,” but cramming as many ways to interrupt the
user and push them into doing things that make the company money. The
greatest lie in tech is that Facebook and Instagram are for “catching up
with your friends,” because that’s no longer what they do. These
platforms are now pathways for the nebulous concept of “content
discovery,” a barely-personalized entertainment network that
occasionally drizzles people or things you choose to see on top of
sponsored content and groups that a relational database has decided are
“good for you.” ↫ Edward Zitron Corporate social media has gotten so
bad, they’re basically unusable. The rare times I open Facebook to like
a picture my mother posted or whatever, I’m just gobsmacked by how
utterly unusable it has become. I’ve never used Instagram, but whenever
I accidentally end up there, I have no idea how to navigate that place.
YouTube is more ads than video if you don’t pay for Premium (which I do,
because I use YouTube a lot so I get enough value out of it). Twitter is
barely worth a mention – it’s no surprise that a social network bought
and run by a nazi is now even fuller of nazis than it already was. It’s
not just social networks, either. The web as a whole feels like it’s
been looted and plundered, and turned into a flyover state strip mall.
Browsing the web is, for me at least, virtually impossible without
autoplay blockers, my Pi-Hole, Consent-O-Matic, and settings to
permanently block requests for location and notification access. The
rise of “AI” has only made everything even worse, especially now that
the big, wealthy content networks that, yes, own all your favourite
technology news websites are also looking into it. Luckily, there’s also
a countermovement brewing. I’ve focused OSNews’ entire “social” strategy
on Mastodon (and the various other ActivityPub tools), as it’s the only
social medium that’s usable and enjoyable. With the nazis remaining on
Twitter, and all the brands and influencers on Facebook (or Threads or
whatever), everyone else interested in technology coalesced around the
Fediverse, and it’s been a massive boon for a small website like OSNews
trying to steer clear from all the SEO enshittification. There’s no
spam, only relatively small, approachable brands, no influencers, no
algorithms – just real, ordinary people, who also care about a usable,
fair, and equitable web. I hope that OSNews can eventually be run
without any ads at all, but that’s going to take a lot more consistent
work from me to convince more and more people to support us through
Patreon or Ko-Fi, or for companies to become sponsors. However, I am
convinced it’s a better route to take than trying to chase the SEO
dragon, because we all know where that leads to.</p>

<p>
Each form of online discussion has a <i>grain</i> to it.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls">Doc</a> and I used to
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/followsthegrain.png">talk</a>
about how something “follows the grain of the web.” Twitter has its own
grain, formed by its character limit, what information is shared (ie
number of followers in both directions).
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/26/baseballScene.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
made a list of some of the social networks I’ve been on starting in the
mid-70s. The list is very long. And each of them had their own limits,
rules and features, and each led to a certain kinds of relationships
between the participants. Mail lists that gain traction always flame
out. It’s hard to get people to read your blog. If you make it easier it
changes into something else. Instagram, Youtube, TikTok form hierarchies
of influencers. I think of those as the networks
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Lorenz">Taylor Lorenz</a>
covers.
</p>
<p>
But there isn’t a structure that I’m aware of that leads to people
working together. It’s a puzzle I keep trying to figure out.
</p>
<p>
We need
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether">working
together</a> to survive climate change and fascism. It would be good to
crack this nut.
</p>
<p>
One of the nicest things about ChatGPT is that it’s always up for
working with you. The critics of AI don’t begin to understand this. As
an example, I’m going to ask ChatGPT to draw a picture of people working
together.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/peopleWorkingTogether.png">Here
it is</a>. I didn’t have to wait. It didn’t look at my follower count,
or my bank statement to decide if it was willing to work with me. I pay
the $20 a month, and I’ve got a persistent always-on collaborator.
</p>
<p>
What got me thinking this way this morning is a bit of collaboration I
did <a href="https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun">with
palafo</a> (a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-laforge">human</a>) on
Threads. It’s remarkable. We actually did some work together. No
sarcasm. It may be hard to read the
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun">thread</a>
but if you’re curious about collaborative systems, here’s a real
example. Serendipitous, unplanned, but we figured something out by
combining our experiences. Fantastic.
</p>
<p>
Later, <a href="https://werd.io/">Ben Werdmuller</a>, a person who I’ve
gotten to know recently, is intelligent and asks good questions. He
asked one
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@ben.werdmuller/post/C50vyIruTCB">today</a>,
how do they get the live audience on SNL to laugh when they want them to
laugh. I had an idea and
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C50wy5NsYD0">shared</a> it.
(This was
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1v5hy6/how_does_the_snl_audience_know_when_to_laugh/">discussed</a>
on Reddit. I also
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/463e08c0-0380-4e65-9e6c-2742ce91f0db">checked</a>
with ChatGPT.)
</p>
<p>
If you take away one thing from this post it’s that we can collaborate
with the machines, and maybe that will unlock collaboration between
humans. In fact, in a way they are facilitating the collaboration. If
you want to be part of the collective human intelligence, you may be
thinking about the machines the wrong way. Maybe they’re the most human
thing we have, because AI is made up of humans, somewhat like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UPDUpjkHg0">Soylent Green</a>.
<span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
PS: I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/cleaningAMess.png">humans
working together</a> to clean up a mess.
</p>
<p>
PPS: Yesterday I gave <a href="https://john.onolan.org/">John
O’Nolan</a> what I think is a
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C5y7iVoJP4r">good idea</a>
for getting his Ghost blogs federating with Threads, Mastodon et al. I
didn’t expect thanks or even a response, but I wonder if he even heard
it. Most of the time, trying to help other people results in not even an
acknowledgment that they saw it. If I were him I’d look for a painless,
quick way to get maximum interop. Something like
<a href="http://ghost.social/">ghost.social</a>. I’d give the same
advice to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> at Automattic (in fact I
think I did).
</p>
<p>
PPPS: I think acknowledgment is a key part of
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether">working
together</a> on the web. Nothing more than “I wanted you to know I saw
it” is often all that’s needed to grease the skids of discourse. I’ve
had a friendly disagreement with Manton at micro.blog about this.

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Someone asked me about my stance on not having comments on my blog. I’m not a fan of comments in general and I think commenting on something should be done in one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
Privately via email or via direct messaging
</li>
<li>
Publicly by posting a reply on your own website
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Setting up your server to send a webmention is an extra bonus point but
I don’t consider that to be necessary. That’s the ideal commenting setup
in my opinion but I’m sure some of you out there disagree.

printer hack of Windows 95</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>During my daily web crawl I encountered a very interesting gif that I
haven’t seen in a long time. It was a hack of an unspecified version of
Windows 95, which showed how to bypass the login screen with the help of
the menu and printing dialog. However, after a brief check, I found a
fair amount of people stating that “just hitting the cancel” button
would do the same. Sharp-eyed viewers would notice that it was the very
first action taken in the picture. In order to find out if the hack is
real at all, I decided to reproduce it and document it for the good of
the internet. ↫ David Polakovic So this hack is actually a lot more
involved than I thought it was going to be, and yet, it still feels
utterly insane that operating systems were this easy to get into,
passwords were this easy to decrypt, and security settings were this
trivial to disable. Anyway, the gif is sort-of real, in that yes, you
can ‘hack’ Windows 95’s login security through the printing and help
subsystems. Things were different back then, man. I vaguely remember
that my high school used to lock us out of the desktop, File Explorer,
the Control Panel, and so on, making it impossible for us to access DOS
or the games built into Windows 9x. I don’t remember the exact things we
used to do, but most of us were aware and used several different methods
of bypassing the school lockdowns just to mess around. We never did
anything malicious – this is pre-internet, and we just wanted to play
some Solitaire or Pinball – but anybody with malicious intent surely
could’ve.</p>

<p>New TVs that launch with Android TV 14 or later on Linux kernel 5.15
or higher will be required to meet Google’s Generic Kernel Image (GKI)
requirements in order to pass certification! This means that GKI is now
enforced on all major Android form factors with AArch64 chipsets:
handhelds, watches, automotive, &amp; televisions. ↫ Mishaal Rahman What
this means is that all the major Android form factors will be running
kernels that adhere to the GKI requirements, which means SoC and board
support is not part of the core kernel, but instead achieved through
loadable modules. This should, in theory, make it easier to provide
long-term support.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler</p>
<h1>
GHC 9.6.5 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-04-16
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.5.
Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are
available on the <a href="/download_ghc_9_6_5.html">release page</a>.
</p>
<p>
This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing some issues found
in the 9.6 series. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bumping the bundled <code>process</code> library to 1.6.19.0 to avoid a
potential
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/advisories/hackage/process/HSEC-2024-0003.md">command
injection vulnerability</a> on Windows for clients of this library. This
isn’t known to affect GHC itself, but allows users who depend on the
installed version of the <code>process</code> to avoid the issue.
</li>
<li>
Fixing a bug resulting in the distributed <code>hsc2hs</code> wrapper
using flags from the compiler build environment
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24050">#24050</a>).
</li>
<li>
Disabling the <code>-fasm-shortcutting</code> optimisation with
<code>-O2</code> as it is known to result in unsoundess and incorrect
runtime results in some cases
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24507">#24507</a>).
</li>
<li>
Ensuring we take <code>LDFLAGS</code> into account when configuring a
linker
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24565">#24565</a>).
</li>
<li>
Fixing a bug arising from incorrect parsing of paths containing spaces
in the settings file
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24265">#24265</a>).
</li>
<li>
And many more fixes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.6.5/docs/users_guide/9.6.5-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are
encouraged to upgrade promptly.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake
pool, Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!

id="fedora-intends-to-fully-embrace-ai-but-doesnt-address-sourcing-or-its-environmental-impact">Fedora
intends to fully embrace “AI”, but doesn’t address sourcing or its
environmental impact</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>All weekend, I’ve been mulling over a recent blog post by Fedora
Project Leader Matthew Miller, which he wrote and published on behalf of
the Fedora Council. Fedora (the KDE version) is my distribution of
choice, I love using it, and I consider it the best distribution for
desktop use, and not by a close margin either. As such, reading a blog
post in which Fedora is announcing plans to make extensive use of “AI”
was bound to make me a feel a little uneasy. Miller states – correctly –
that the “AI” space as it stands right now is dominated so much by
hyperbole and over-the-top nonsense that it’s hard to judge the various
technologies underpinning “AI” on merit alone. He continues that he
believes that stripped of all the hyperbole and techbro bullshit,
there’s “something significant, powerful”, and he wants to make “Fedora
Linux the best community platform for AI”. So, what exactly does that
look like? In addition to the big showy LLM-based tools for chat and
code generation, these advances have brought big jumps for more tailored
tasks: for translation, file search, home automation, and especially for
accessibility (already a key part of our strategy). For example, open
source speech synthesis has long lagged behind proprietary options. Now,
what we have in Fedora is not even close to the realism, nuance, and
flexibility of AI-generated speech. ↫ Matthew Miller Some of these are
things we can all agree are important and worthwhile, but lacking on the
Linux desktop. If we can make use of technologies labelled as “AI” to
improve, say, text-to-speech on Linux for those who require it for
accessibility reasons, that’s universally a great thing. Translation,
too, is, at its core, a form of accessibility, and if we can improve
machine translations so that people who, for instance, don’t speak
English gain more access to English content, or if we can make the vast
libraries of knowledge locked into foreign languages accessible to more
people, that’s all good news. However, Fedora aims to take its use of
“AI” even further, and wants to start using it in the process of
developing, making, and distributing Fedora. This is where more and more
red flags are starting to pop up for me, because I don’t feel like the
processes and tasks they want to inject “AI” into are the kinds of
processes and tasks where you want humans taken out of the equation. We
can use AI/ML as part of making the Fedora Linux OS. New tools could
help with package automation and bug triage. They could note anomalies
in test results and logs, maybe even help identify potential security
issues. We can also create infrastructure-level features for our users.
For example, package update descriptions aren’t usually very meaningful.
We could automatically generate concise summaries of what’s new in each
system update — not just for each package, but highlighting what’s
important in the whole set, including upstream change information as
well. ↫ Matthew Miller Even the tools built atop billions and billions
of euros of investments by Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Facebook, and
similar juggernauts are not exactly good at what they’re supposed to do,
and suck at even the most basic of tasks of providing answers to simple
questions. They lie, they make stuff up, they bug out and produce
nonsense, they’re racist, and so on. I don’t want any of that garbage
near the process of making and updating the operating system I rely on
every day. Miller laments how “AI” is currently a closed-source, black
box affair, which obviously doesn’t align with Fedora’s values and
goals. He doesn’t actually explain how Fedora’s use of “AI” is going to
address this. They’re going to have to find ethical, open source models
that are also of high quality, and that’s a lot easier said than done.
Sourcing doesn’t even get a single mention in this blog post, even
though I’m fairly sure that’s one of the two major issues many of us
have with the current crop of “AI” tools. The blog post also completely
neglects to mention the environmental cost of training these “AI” tools.
It costs an insane amount of electricity to train these new tools, and
with climate change ever accelerating and the destruction of our
environment visible all around us, not mentioning this problem when
you’re leading a project like Fedora seems disingenuous at best, and
malicious at worst. While using “AI” to improve accessibility tools in
Fedora and the wider Linux world is laudable, some of the other intended
targets seem more worrisome, especially when you take into account that
the blog post makes no mention of the two single biggest problems with
“AI”: sourcing, and its environmental impact. If Fedora truly intends to
fully embrace “AI”, it’s going to have to address these two problems
first, because otherwise they’re just trying to latch onto the hype
without really understanding the cost. And that’s not something I want
to hear from the leaders of my Linux distribution.</p>

software and firmware have been a mess, but it’s working on them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Framework puts a lot of effort into making its hardware easy to fix
and upgrade and into making sure that hardware can stay useful down the
line when it’s been replaced by something newer. But supporting that
kind of reuse and recycling works best when paired with long-term
software and firmware support, and on that front, Framework has been
falling short. Framework will need to step up its game, especially if it
wants to sell more laptops to businesses—a lucrative slice of the PC
industry that Framework is actively courting. By this summer or fall,
we’ll have some idea of whether its efforts are succeeding. ↫ Andrew
Cunningham at Ars Technica A very painful read, and I’m disappointed to
learn that the software support from Framework has been so lacklustre –
or non-existent, to be more accurate. Leaving severel security
vulnerabilities in firmware unpatched is a disgrace, and puts users at
risk, while promising but not delivering updates that will unlock faster
Thunderbolt speeds is just shitty. They have to do better, especially
since their pitch is all about repairability and longevity. This article
has made me more weary of spending any money on Framework – not that I
have the money for a new laptop, because reasons – and I feel more
people will feel this way after reading this.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the ROCK 5 ITX coming soon and
since then, samples of the Rockchip RK3588-based Radxa ROCK 5 ITX have
been landing on doorsteps (or service points, screw you, UPS) of a lucky
group of people and somehow I was one of those, so here’s a first look
at Radxa’s latest Single Board Computer in a Mini ITX form-factor! It’s
going to be a photo-heavy post and I make no apologies for that, it’s a
very nice-looking PCB, with the black and gold colour scheme looking
very stylish. I imagine that was a very conscious decision seeing as, as
expected, they’re marketing this as a low-power desktop option and you
probably don’t want a plain Jane motherboard taking pride of place in
your new system, right? ↫ Bret Weber Now this – this, my friends, is
exactly what the doctor ordered. I can’t wait for standard, ATX
motherboard sporting ARM processors to become more common and readily

<h2 id="apples-mysterious-fisheye-projection">Apple’s mysterious fisheye
projection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you’ve read my first post about Spatial Video, the second
about Encoding Spatial Video, or if you’ve used my command-line tool,
you may recall a mention of Apple’s mysterious “fisheye” projection
format. Mysterious because they’ve documented
a CMProjectionType.fisheye enumeration with no elaboration, they stream
their immersive Apple TV+ videos in this format, yet they’ve provided no
method to produce or playback third-party content using this projection
type. Additionally, the format is undocumented, they haven’t responded
to an open question on the Apple Discussion Forums asking for more
detail, and they didn’t cover it in their WWDC23 sessions. As someone
who has experience in this area – and a relentless curiosity – I’ve
spent time digging-in to Apple’s fisheye projection format, and this
post shares what I’ve learned. ↫ Mike Swanson There is just so much cool
technology crammed into the Vision Pro, from the crazy displays down to,
apparently, the encoding format for spatial video. Too bad Apple seems
to have forgotten that a technology is not a product, as even the most
ardent Apple supporterts – like John Gruber, or the hosts of ATP – have
stated their Vision Pro devices are lying unused, collecting dust, just
months after launch.</p>

<li>
You can specify that all the feeds you’re subscribed to are in your
blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in
the blogroll.
</li>
<li>
The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new
post, it goes to the top of the list.
</li>
<li>
You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the
pubdate to go to the full item on the web.
</li>
<li>
It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the
list, Return to expand/collapse.

</ul>
<p>
Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
blogrollUsername – required
</li>
<li>
blogrollServer – optional, if not specified it’s feedland.com

needed a place to figure out how this works, so we know how to set up
and document the WordPress plugin.

external SSDs are faster with Apple silicon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC,
I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously
I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even
though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you’re
still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But
if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you’re far
better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC’s
Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a
compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. ↫ Howard Oakley If
you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you’re looking for an external drive
– this is some good advice to follow.</p>

occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a>
about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out
opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn’t
happen, we don’t even look at each others software. After waiting a
whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short
periods, but it’s most of the time it’s been people trying to
deconstruct and reinvent other people’s work, not build on it. I’m still
open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more
time.</p>

don’t like how betting has invaded sports broadcasting. I don’t like
that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole
lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who
love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans
who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and
everything they (don’t) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks
(and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won’t be any of us left,
everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall,
because you can’t win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal
thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of
us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather
they’re feeding an addiction.</p>

GHC 9.10.1-alpha3 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
bgamari - 2024-04-15
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
third alpha release of GHC 9.10.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.10.1-alpha3">downloads.haskell.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.
</p>
<p>
GHC 9.10 will bring a number of new features and improvements,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The introduction of the <code>GHC2024</code> language edition, building
upon <code>GHC2021</code> with the addition of a number of widely-used
extensions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Partial implementation of the
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/281">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>, allowing visible quantification to be
used in the types of terms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/624">Extension</a>
of LinearTypes to allow linear <code>let</code> and <code>where</code>
bindings
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The implementation of the
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/330">exception
backtrace proposal</a>, allowing the annotation of exceptions with
backtraces, as well as other user-defined context
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Further improvements in the info table provenance mechanism, reducing
code size to allow IPE information to be enabled more widely
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Javascript FFI support in the WebAssembly backend
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements in the fragmentation characteristics of the low-latency
non-moving garbage collector.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
… and many more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.10.1-alpha3/docs/users_guide/9.10.1-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
This alpha is the penultimate prerelease leading to 9.10.1. In two weeks
we plan to publish a release candidate, followed, if all things go well,
by the final release a week later.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.

6.10 to merge NTSYNC driver for emulating Windows NT synchronization
primitives</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Going through my usual scanning of all the “-next” Git subsystem
branches of new code set to be introduced for the next Linux kernel
merge window, a very notable addition was just queued up… Linux 6.10 is
set to merge the NTSYNC driver for emulating the Microsoft Windows NT
synchronization primitives within the kernel for allowing better
performance with Valve’s Steam Play (Proton) and Wine of Windows games
and other apps on Linux. ↫ Michael Larabel The improvements to
performance of games running under Proton this new driver will bring are
legitimately insane. We’re looking at a game-changing addition to the
Linux kernel here, and it’s no surprise, then, to see this effort being
spearheaded by companies like Valve and CodeWeavers.</p>

<p>Kate, KDE’s programming-focused text editor, is, of course, a Qt
application, and is also available on a variety of other platforms.
Christoph Cullmann, one of the developers of Kate, published a short
blog post with screenshots of Kate running on the three biggest
platforms – Linux/BSD, Windows, and macOS. Sadly, while Haiku gets a
mention, there’s no screenshot of the Haiku version of Kate. Still, it’s
interesting to see the family resemblance.</p>
