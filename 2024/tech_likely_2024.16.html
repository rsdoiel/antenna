Embeddable Game Engine
</h1>
<p>
<img

align="right" width=240> Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where
we were building cross-platform libraries for mobile developers, we
wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming capabilities for our users in the
form of adding 2D or 3D content to their mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired
libraries.
</p>
<p>
For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years,
and we contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).
</p>
<p>
Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great
UI support called Urho, and the other one was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>,
which had a great IDE, but did not support being embedded.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be
turned into such engine. While I tend to take copious notes of all my
meetings, those notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft
acquisition, but from what I can remember Juan told me, "Godot is not
what you are looking for" in two dimensions, there were no immediate
plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was not as advanced
as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.
</p>
<p>
We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go
into becoming a
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and
mobile platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR
headsets. Sadly, Microsoft’s management left UrhoSharp to die.
</p>
<p>
Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the
most popular open-source projects in the world.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Faolan-Rad">@Faolan-Rad</span>
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a
patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library that could be embedded into
applications. I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a>
and have been very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed
Godot content into their application.
</p>
<p>
However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one
Godot game as an embedded system and could not do much more. The folks
at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk Software</a> wanted to take this
further. They wanted to host independent Godot scenes in their app and
have more control over those so they could sprinkle Godot content at
their heart’s content on their mobile app
(<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)
</p>
<p>
They funded some initial work to do this and hired
<a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely Kis’s company</a> to do this work.
</p>
<p>
Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year. I came back very excited
from GodotCon and I decided to turn my
<a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype
Godot on iPad</a> into a
<a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete product</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of
Godot in discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to
productize and polish this patch for general consumption.
</p>
<p>
Now, there is a
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch
under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary Godot scenes into
their apps. For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot
scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is
done, I will update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift
users (bindings for other platforms and languages are left as an
exercise to the reader).
</p>
<p>
It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in
Godot land.

<h1 id="maldives-2024">
Maldives 2024
</h1>
<p>
The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the
Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.
</p>
<p>
The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane,
Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like
sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the
<a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible,
too.
</p>
<p>
With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We
went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in
2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to
the Maldives.

<p>
<strong>2024-04-06</strong>. The last leg of the journey – our
water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the
reef begins a few meters in.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an
underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or
the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to
hide in the sand.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it
attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in
Australia or the Galapagos. This purple giant is cool, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There are still plenty of colourful fish.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games. The most popular tropical
island game is Race for the Galaxy.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-9.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Yesterday we also played

<p>
<strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.
</p>
<p>
We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey
moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily
scared and therefore obviously harmless.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when
you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful
fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep
blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.
</p>

<p>
There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either
uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can
stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work
on the tourist islands.
</p>
<p>
The capital city is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one
of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage
problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know
what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a>
book. Check out these stats from the
<a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia
page on the Maldives</a>: In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had
about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much
better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman
has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years
in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement
from the point of view of the locals.
</p>
<p>
From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The
picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don’t know
what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage
incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had
to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in
the the fish. People eat the fish. It’s easy to feel grim about this. I
need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a
generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much,
much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally
summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that
this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look
away.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-12</strong>. Bad luck for Claudia. Yesterday, late at
night, she stuck her small toe in a gap between two planks, took another
step, nearly fell and twisted her foot. There’s a huge dark bruise on
its back and a significant dark bruise below. No more fins, for a while.
😭
</p>
<p>
We had signed up for a snorkel safari when suddenly the buzz was that
the young humpback whale they had seen two days ago was still around and
so the ship picked up some extra passengers and Claudia came along to do
some whale watching.
</p>
<p>
The whale watching did not disappoint.
</p>

<p>
This adolescent
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale">humpback
whale</a> was about 8m long. It’s unusual to find a whales here, now, so
close to the reef, so young, without its family. There was speculation
that it might be waiting for its family to pick it up again, or that
perhaps it was sick.
</p>

<strong>2024-04-13</strong>. To it is raining. Good for Claudia since
she is supposed to rest her foot.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-16.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-21</strong>. After snorkling with the whale, not much
seemed to be worth posting about.
</p>
<p>
Before going on this trip, I bought an older GoPro HERO 10. Now I have a
few gigabytes of reef snorkeling footage. I don’t know what to do with
it. Post it? Unlikely! It takes too much space and nobody would look at
it. Donate it to YouTube? Unlikely! Upload it to some Peertube instance
and thereby offload the cost? Unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the economy of the Maldives and the shock when I learned about
the garbage island and my dismay when I saw the skyline of Malé island –
when we flew back, I got a closer look at Malé from the air as we landed
and while it wasn’t an island nature paradise, it was just a city with
nice, tall buildings and roads and palm trees and construction sites and
glass fronts and cars and motorcycles. In other words, it seemed like a
perfectly normal city and it wasn’t shabby and it didn’t have slums and
so I keep coming back to the main issue: Beating poverty is of ultimate
importance in order to improve people’s lives and giving them options so
that they can work on the problems they care about. When we flew over
Thilafushi, the garbage island didn’t look “apocalyptic” but just like
some industrial zone elsewhere in the world, except it’s an island in
the middle of the ocean.
