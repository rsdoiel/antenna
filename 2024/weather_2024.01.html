Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1129 AM CST Fri Jan 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS MUCH OF
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact parts of the Florida Peninsula
Saturday, with a threat for isolated damaging wind gusts and a
tornado or two.

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level shortwave trough will move quickly northeastward
from parts of the Southeast/TN Valley toward the Mid Atlantic by
mid/late afternoon, and off of the southern New England coast by
early Sunday morning. An attendant surface low will move from south
GA toward the VA Tidewater by Saturday evening, as a trailing cold
front moves through parts of the Carolinas/GA into the FL Peninsula.

...Florida...
In conjunction with the ejecting shortwave trough, rather widespread
and organized convection is expected over the Gulf of Mexico late
Friday night into the beginning of the D2 forecast period Saturday
morning, within a moderately unstable and favorably sheared
environment. This convection will begin to affect portions of the FL
Gulf Coast during the morning, though some weakening trend is
expected as storms encounter a less unstable environment over the
peninsula. While there will be some potential for pre-convective
heating and moistening across south and east FL during the day,
storms may struggle to maintain intensity across the peninsula due
to weak midlevel lapse rates and the tendency for stronger
large-scale ascent to depart the region in association with the
ejecting shortwave trough.  

Favorable low-level and deep-layer shear will support the threat of
a tornado or two and locally damaging gusts with any organized storm
structures that can be sustained over coastal regions into the
peninsula. With favorable wind profiles expected, but also concerns
regarding instability and storm maintenance over the peninsula, a
broad Marginal Risk has been maintained over much of the FL
Peninsula.

...Eastern Carolinas...
With the surface low expected to track northeastward toward the
Tidewater vicinity, the effective warm sector will likely advance
into eastern portions of the Carolinas. However, with antecedent
cool/dry conditions over the region, increasing boundary-layer
moisture will be accompanied by substantial cloudiness and limited
potential for destabilization. At this time, potential for robust
surface-based convection appears too limited for severe
probabilities across the eastern Carolinas, but this potential will
continue to be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0002
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0947 AM CST Fri Jan 05 2024

Areas affected...Central Kansas

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 051547Z - 051845Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snow with rates up to 1 inch per hour are expected
through early afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A band of heavy snow is lifting north across central
Kansas this morning to the north of a surface low currently across
northwest Oklahoma. This snow band is primarily triggered by
warm-air advection centered around 850mb. A 25 to 30 knot low-level
jet is currently present across northern Oklahoma and southeast
Kansas, per RAP mesoanalysis. However, these winds are expected to
weaken by mid afternoon as the 850mb height gradient relaxes across
Oklahoma due to a deepening cyclone near the Gulf Coast. Therefore,
expect a few more hours of moderate to heavy intensity snow before
this band begins to weaken by early afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1026 AM CST Fri Jan 05 2024

Valid 051630Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TODAY AND
TONIGHT ALONG THE IMMEDIATE GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms may occur along the Gulf Coast today
through tonight, including coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.

...Gulf Coast Region...
Morning water vapory imagery shows a strong upper trough progressing
eastward across TX/OK, with a 70-80 knot mid-level jet extending
across south TX into the western Gulf of Mexico.  A surface low
associated with this upper trough and jet is positioned just south
of the Upper Texas coast, where a line of strong storms extends from
the coast southward into the Gulf.  Low-level trajectories have been
slow to back to southerly, resulting in a limited northward
transport of rich moisture/instability.  Onshore thunderstorm
activity is in an environment of surface dewpoints only in the 50s,
and should remain elevated in nature through much of the afternoon.

Visible satellite imagery shows multiple small cellular convective 
elements well offshore, tracking northeastward.  With continued
daytime heating, a few of these cells may organized/intensify and
drift toward southern LA late this afternoon and evening.  Shear
profiles would pose a risk of supercells, but it remains unclear how
far inland the risk of surface-based convection will spread.  Any
storms in this regime that are surface-based would represent a risk
of gusty/damaging wind gusts or a tornado.  A similar threat will
persist overnight as the convective cluster moves eastward along the
MS/AL/FL coast.

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 01/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CST Fri Jan 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
Across the CONUS, fire-weather concerns appear limited. An active
southern stream shortwave trough will deepen over the southern
Plains as it moves eastward. At the surface, cold high pressure will
persist across the northern half of the country as a Gulf low and
trailing cold front move eastward accompanying the deepening
mid-level trough. Gusty winds are possible across parts of the
southern High Plains and West Texas as the surface low deepens.
However, widespread precipitation is expected from the southern
Plains to the lower MS valley, along with cold temperatures across
the northern half of the CONUS. With widespread precipitation and
cooler temperatures expected to limit the availability of dry fuels
over much of the country, fire-weather concerns are low.

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE GULF
COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms may occur along the Gulf Coast today
through tonight, including coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.

...Synopsis...
An upper trough over the southern Plains this morning will move
toward the lower to middle Mississippi Valley during the day, and
will lose amplitude as it reaches the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by
Saturday morning. Moderate to strong southwest winds aloft will
precede this trough, and overspread much of the Gulf of Mexico and
Southeast.

At the surface, a cold front will move across the western Gulf of
Mexico during the day, with a surface low developing toward southern
Louisiana and Mississippi by early evening. Cool conditions will
exist over land ahead of this trough due to a strong surface high
over the Mid-Atlantic, and this will likely inhibit destabilization
aside from portions of the immediate Gulf Coast.

...Coastal Southeast TX/LA/MS/AL/FL Panhandle...
A corridor of scattered thunderstorms have steadily developed in the
predawn hours across the far western Gulf of Mexico toward the
middle/upper Texas Coast, including some near-shore supercellular
development. A very narrow zone of lower 60s F surface dewpoints
have reached the upper Texas coast early this morning coincident
with some of the stronger convection, but even so, this degree of
moisture is not overly conducive to surface-based/more intense
convection. A more unstable/moisture-rich air mass will generally
continue to remain focused offshore, especially this morning,
although a continued low-level moisture influx will continue to
occur through the afternoon and tonight across far southern
Louisiana and coastal portions of Mississippi/Alabama and the
Florida Panhandle, aided by modest frontal wave development.

Deep-layer/low-level shear will be quite strong, accentuated by
60-75 kt southwesterly winds around 1-2 km AGL. This will support
fast-moving well-organized/rotating storms where weak
destabilization does occur, which will mainly be in coastal areas of
the region. A tornado and isolated damaging wind risk will exist and
generally regionally transition eastward in these near-coastal areas
through tonight.

0652 PM CST Thu Jan 04 2024

Valid 050100Z - 051200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered non-severe thunderstorms are possible late tonight over
parts of southeast Texas including the Texas Coast.

...Discussion...
Sporadic lightning is noted this evening over southeast NM, where
cold temperatures aloft exist in proximity to the upper low. The
loss of diabatic heating is expected to further reduce thunderstorm
chances as the trough moves into western TX, though isolated flashes
cannot be ruled out with weak elevated instability present.

A greater probability of thunderstorms will develop late tonight
into Friday morning over southeast TX and much of the TX Coast.
Here, more robust theta-e advection will develop atop the cool
boundary layer, and as 850-mb winds increase to 40 kt out of the
south. Despite strong shear, little to no severe threat is forecast,
due to only weak elevated instability, and cool surface air over
land.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CST Thu Jan 04 2024

Valid 061200Z - 121200Z

Fire weather concerns are expected to remain low through the
extended period. Enhanced flow across the southern US will bring
localized windy/dry conditions D3 - Saturday and D4 - Sunday.
Potential for widespread rainfall across already moist fuels on D2
Friday will further limit the potential for fire spread. 

A potent surface low is expected to develop across the southern
Plains on D5 - Monday tracking eastward before moving into the Upper
Ohio River Valley by D7 - Wednesday. This will bring the potential
for very strong surface winds but also additional precipitation
chances. The driest conditions are expected to be across portions of
southwestern and far western Texas on D5 - Monday through D7 -
Wednesday, where less precipitation is likely with multiple periods
of windy/dry conditions. Locally Elevated conditions may be
possible, particularly across far western Texas south into the Rio
Grande Valley. Given the seasonably moist conditions of fuels and
potential for multiple rounds of precipitation keeping the threat
localized, confidence remains too low to include any areas at this
time.
