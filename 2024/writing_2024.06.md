<p>Federal judge Stephen Locher has filed a preliminary injunction against the state of Iowa’s book-banning law, calling the measure “incredibly broad.” The measure was meant to go into effect January 1, 2024, and would restrict books about sexuality or gender, or with descrip­tions or depictions of sex, from school libraries and classrooms.

Chris Priest is dead. We've known each other since 1984. He was a famous author and I was a 23 year old nobody and he sat next to me in a pub and chatted and was lovely. He wrote some amazing books. www.ninaallan.co.uk?p=6855
