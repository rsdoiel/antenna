you’re working deep inside a complex project and have an unrelated idea.
How long does it take to switch to writing mode, get the idea down, and
return to what you were doing. The less time it takes the more
<i>fluidity. </i>Twitter totally won there. And we, the bloggers, made a
tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it
was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn’t. So they got
all the causal writing, and over time sucked the life out of blogging. I
think it’s time to put the fluidity back, without compromising on
features and lock-in.</p>

<p>
After the XZ Utils discovery, people have been
<a href="https://openjsf.org/blog/openssf-openjs-alert-social-engineering-takeovers">examining</a>
other open-source projects. Surprising no one, the incident is not
unique:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council received a suspicious series
of emails with similar messages, bearing different names and overlapping
GitHub-associated emails. These emails implored OpenJS to take action to
update one of its popular JavaScript projects to “address any critical
vulnerabilities,” yet cited no specifics. The email author(s) wanted
OpenJS to designate them as a new maintainer of the project despite
having little prior involvement. This approach bears strong resemblance
to the manner in which “Jia Tan” positioned themselves in the XZ/liblzma
backdoor…

<h1 id="2024-04-17-a-map-generator-for-solo-play">
2024-04-17 A map generator for solo play
</h1>
<p>
Inspired by
<a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="enfors">@enfors</span></a> quest for a
random map generator that would work for solo-gaming, where the
exploration roll happens as you enter a new hex and no overall map is
known beforehand, I’ve been thinking of a
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/text-mapper/solo/random">Solo
algorithm</a> for <a href="Text_Mapper">Text Mapper</a>.
</p>
<p>
As always, my main issue with maps is river systems. I just can’t help
it! 😅 The solo-gaming constraint makes this an interesting challenge
because you can’t ever go back and redo a hex that’s been discovered.
</p>
<p>
The first problem was that I needed a model of how the map was going to
be explored to simulate the key constraint. What I use is a biased
random walk of ever increasing length that keeps starting in the middle
of the map, where the “safe haven” is imagined to be. The random walk is
biased in as much as it prefers to pick an unexplored hex, if possible.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-17-solo-map-1.jpg" alt="Example explorations on the map." />
</p>
<p>
When debugging, the numbers on the map represent the order in which the
hexes are discovered, the coordinates and the altitude from 0 to 10.
</p>
<p>
Of course my algorithm still runs into impossible situations like rivers
meeting in a local minimum that I can’t fix because there are no
take-backs. In those situations I have decided to place a cave entrance
and would run it as an entrance into the underworld. Who wouldn’t want
rivers to disappear into the underworld‽
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Examples: In the map above, when entering 1008 or 1405, river flow could
turn out to be problematic since all the surrounding hexes have been
explored and can no longer be changed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Every hex has two extra data points:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
altitude from 0 (the deep ocean) to 10 (the highest peaks)
</li>
<li>
optionally, a direction of water flow (where it goes to)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The strange part about this is that you cannot tell which hex is “up
river” without actually going there and seeing whether this is where the
water came from. If the next hex has no river then you followed a small
creek that got smaller and smaller and finally it disappeared. If the
next hex has a river that flows elsewhere, then you crossed a ridge and
now you’re in another valley.
</p>
<p>
When determining a random neighbour, roll a d6: 1 is north, 2 is
north-east, 3 is south-east, 4 is south, 5 is south-west, 6 is
north-west.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how you start the map:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Roll a d6 for the <em>preferred direction</em> of water for this map.
</li>
<li>
Pick a hex in the middle of the map. Assign it the altitude 5.
</li>
<li>
Roll a d6 for the <em>direction of the local river</em>. The starting
hex always has a river.
</li>
<li>
Roll 2d6 and <em>adjust the altitude</em> (see below).
</li>
<li>
Use the same 2d6 result for the check whether the new hex has <em>water
flow</em> (see below).
</li>
<li>
Now that altitude and water flow are known, determine the terrain (see
below).
</li>
<li>
Use the same 2d6 result for the check whether the new hex has a
<em>settlement or ruin</em> (see below). The starting hex always starts
with a village.
</li>
<li>
When entering a new hex, go back to step 4.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adjust-the-altitude">
Adjust the altitude
</h2>
<p>
The provisional altitude of the new hex starts out as the altitude of
where you’re coming from (no sudden changes).
</p>
<p>
The altitude of the new hex is adjusted based on the 2d6 roll made
above.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If all the known hexes around the current hex are at altitudes 0–1, then
the max altitude is 0 (deep ocean). No other factors come into play, so
you can skip the rest of the altitude adjustment.
</li>
<li>
If there are neighbouring hexes with water flowing from there to the
current hex, then their lowest altitude is the current’s hex max
altitude (because rivers don’t flow up).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Take the 2d6 roll made above and look up the altitude change on the
following table:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">
2d6
</th>
<th align="center">
Change

</table>
<p>
On a result of 4–9 it depends on the slope:
</p>
<p>
If coming from altitude 7 or higher, then check the direction you’re
moving in. If you’re moving in the direction of the preferred slope or
in the opposite direction, there is no change. If you’re moving in a
different direction, the change is -1.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Example: Assume the slope is “north”. If you’re moving “south” (the
opposite of “north”) from a hex with an altitude of 8, then there is no
change.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If coming from altitude 6 or lower, the check the direction you’re
moving in. If you’re moving in the direction of the preferred slope, the
change is -1.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Example: Assume the slope is “north”. If you’re moving “south” from a
hex with an altitude of 6, then there is no change.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The idea is that mountain chains form along rivers and rivers have a
tendency to run towards the ocean. Whether this actually works as
intended, I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Apply the change to the provisional altitude and adjust for the maximum.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Example: You’re entering a new hex from a hex with altitude 5. You know
is that is has a neighbouring hex with altitude 4 that has a river going
towards the same hex. The max altitude is therefore a 4. Roll 2d6. If
you get a 2, the change is -2 and the new hex has an altitude of 5 - 2 =
3; otherwise it has an altitude of 4 because of the max and you don’t
need to bother with anything else.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-17-solo-map-2.jpg" alt="A height map without the effects of water flow" />
</p>
<h2 id="water-flow">
Water flow
</h2>
<p>
If the altitude of the new hex is 0, there is no water flow (deep
ocean).
</p>
<p>
The new hex has water flow if any of the following is true:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
if there is a river flowing from a neighbouring hex into the new hex;
</li>
<li>
if the altitude of the new hex is 1 (so that lakes can drain);
</li>
<li>
if the altitude is 2–8 and the 2d6 roll for altitude adjustment was a
5–8.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If so, determine the direction of the water, trying one of the
following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
pick at random from the unknown neighbouring hexes and the known
neighbouring hexes at a <em>lower</em> altitude with a river that
doesn’t end up in the new hex you’re looking at (avoid circular rivers);
if there is more than one candidate, prefer a hex in the direction of
the <em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right of the preferred
slope);
</li>
<li>
pick a random, known, neighbouring hex at the <em>same</em> altitude
with a river that doesn’t end up in the new hex you’re looking at (avoid
circular rivers); if there is more than one candidate, prefer a hex in
the direction of the <em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right
of the preferred slope);
</li>
<li>
or – “it’s magic!” – just pick one from the neighbouring hexes (all of
them at a higher altitude, of course) with a river that doesn’t end up
in the new hex you’re looking at (avoid circular rivers); if there is
more than one candidate, prefer a hex in the direction of the
<em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right of the preferred
slope)
</li>
<li>
finally, if all else fails, then it’s an <em>entrance into the
underworld</em> and the river ends right here!
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>
Example: Entering a new hex from the south, with the preferred slope
being “north”. The altitudes and directions of the known neighbours are
as follows: current hex, 5; south (where you came from), 4; north-west,
4; north, 5. Randomly pick between north-west and north-east (an unknown
hex!) since north-west is to the left of the preferred slope and
north-east is to the right of the preferred slope. North is at the same
altitude and south is in the wrong direction.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sadly, this algorithm doesn’t tell you whether a newly discovered hex at
altitude 1 is a sweet water lake or salty coastal waters. As mentioned
above, this algorithm also doesn’t tell you from which neighbouring hex
a river comes from.

In this context, a swamp is a forested wetland; rough are stony
badlands, unfit for agriculture but possibly suited for goat nomads.
Green hills are suitable for sheep farming and cattle grazing.

How does one get a single coherent signal out of an eight-tower array?
Enter the <em>phasor</em>:

That’s <em>phasor</em> with an <em>o</em>, not <em>phaser</em> with an

<p>date: 2024-04-17, from: mrusme blog</p>
<p>While Git is decentralized by design, in many cases it still depends
on a classical server-client architecture. Many projects rely on GitHub,
GitLab, or another centralized platform to host their repositories and
thereby make them available to everyone. What if we could have Git, but
without depending on <em>any</em> centralized servers at all, and
instead use it peer-to-peer?</p>

The article is based upon depositions in a
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">trial
about to start</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The case involves a fatal crash in March 2018, when a Tesla in Autopilot
careened into a highway barrier near Mountain View, Calif., after
getting confused by what the company’s lawyers described in court
documents as a “faded and nearly obliterated” lane line.<br /> <br />
The driver, Walter Huang, 38, was killed. An investigation by the
National Transportation Safety Board later cited Tesla’s failure to
limit the use of Autopilot in such conditions as a contributing factor:
The company has acknowledged to National Transportation Safety Board
that Autopilot is designed for areas with “clear lane markings.”
</blockquote>
Musk’s and Tesla’s marketing hype conflict with the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">deposition</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Under oath, however, Tesla engineer Akshay Phatak last year described
the software as fairly basic in at least one respect: the way it steers
on its own.<br /> <br /> “If there are clearly marked lane lines, the
system will follow the lane lines,” Phatak said under questioning in
July 2023. Tesla’s groundbreaking system, he said, was simply “designed”
to follow painted lane lines.<br /> …<br /> In his deposition, Phatak
said Autopilot will work wherever the car’s cameras detect lines on the
road: “As long as there are painted lane lines, the system will follow
them,” he said.

In this case,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">it
did</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Huang, an engineer at Apple, bought his Tesla Model X in fall 2017 and
drove it regularly to work along U.S. Highway 101, a crowded multilane
freeway that connects San Francisco to the tech hubs of Silicon Valley.
On the day of the crash, his car began to drift as a lane line faded. It
then picked up a clearer line to the left — putting the car between
lanes and on a direct trajectory for a safety barrier separating the
highway from an exit onto State Route 85.<br /> <br /> Huang’s car hit
the barrier at 71 mph, pulverizing its front end, twisting it into
unrecognizable heap. Huang was pronounced dead hours later, according to
court documents.<br /> …<br /> In the months preceding the crash,
Huang’s vehicle swerved in a similar location eleven times, according to
internal Tesla data discussed by Huang’s lawyers during a court hearing
last month. According to the data, the car corrected itself seven times.
Four other times, it required Huang’s intervention. Huang was allegedly
playing a game on his phone when the crash occurred.
</blockquote>
It has been evident for a long time that just following the lines
doesn’t
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">live
up to the hype</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For years, Tesla and federal regulators have been aware of problems with
Autopilot following lane lines, including cars being guided in the wrong
direction of travel and placed in the path of cross-traffic — with
sometimes fatal results. Unlike vehicles that are designed to be
completely autonomous, like cars from Waymo or Cruise, Teslas do not
currently use sensors such as radar or lidar to detect obstacles.
Instead, Teslas rely on cameras.
</blockquote>
As usual, Tesla’s response to the crash was to
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">do
as little as possible</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
After the crash that killed Huang, Tesla told officials that it updated
its software to better recognize “poor and faded” lane markings and to
audibly alert drivers when vehicles might lose track of a fading lane.
The updates stopped short of forcing the feature to disengage on its own
in those situations, however. About two years after Huang died, federal
investigators said they could not determine whether those updates would
have been sufficient to “accurately and consistently detect unusual or
worn lane markings” and therefore prevent Huang’s crash.
</blockquote>
The most important thing for Tesla is never to remind the driver of the
limitations of their software because doing so would exacerbate the fall
in the stock price, currently down 57% from its peak. As I wrote in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/01/autonomous-vehicles-trough-of.html"><i>Autonomous
Vehicles: Trough of Disillusionment</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Elon Musk famously claimed that
<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-worth-zero-without-fsd-why-he-is-completely-wrong-191416.html">Tesla
is worth zero without Full Self Driving</a>. But although this is
typical Musk BS, … unlike some other utterances it contains a kernel of
truth. Tesla is valued as a <i>technology</i> company not a <i>car</i>
company. Thus it is critical for Telsa that its technology be viewed as
better than those of other car companies; anything that suggests it is
limited or inadequate is a big problem not just for the company but also
for Musk’s personal wealth.
</blockquote>
Liam Denning describes the problem for Musk if
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-16/musk-s-many-billions-and-tesla-s-are-made-of-ai-dreams">doubts
emerge about the AIs driving Teslas</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla is, overwhelmingly, a maker of electric vehicles, combining high
growth with high margins — until recently anyway. Deliveries increased
by 38% in 2023 — below the company’s long-term target of 50% per year —
and the consensus for 2024 implies just 21%. Trailing 12-month net
profit as of the third-quarter was actually down, year over year.<br />
<br /> Yet in the most starry-eyed Wall Street financial models, the
making and selling of vehicles — generating 92% of Tesla’s current gross
profit — accounts for only a fraction of Tesla’s purported valuation.
The rest relates to whatever Tesla’s next big thing might turn out to
be, usually something related to artificial intelligence, be it
robotaxis, licensed self-driving systems, the Optimus humanoid robot or
just something else that might spring from the company’s Dojo
supercomputing project.<br /> <br /> Amorphous as the narrative may be,
remove it and the tenuous tether between Tesla’s valuation and something
approximating a potential future reality evaporates entirely.
</blockquote>
In
<a href="https://aisupremacy.substack.com/p/the-biggest-ai-hype-fraud-of-all"><i>The
Biggest AI Hype Fraud of All Time</i></a> Michael Spencer writes:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla’s FSD costs have tripled since 2019, costing more than $15,000 in
the United States. This pumped up, fraudulently, Tesla’s margins on
selling vehicles, however Elon Musk’s promises did not come to fruition
after many deadlines have passed.<br />
</blockquote>
Spencer notes that
“<a href="https://aisupremacy.substack.com/p/the-biggest-ai-hype-fraud-of-all">desperation
at Tesla is very noticeable in 2024</a>”:<br />
<blockquote>
In a push for end-of-quarter sales, Musk recently mandated that all
sales and service staff install and demo FSD for customers before
handing over the keys.<br /> …<br /> In a recent April 5th Tweet on X,
Elon Musk says full level 5 FSD is coming in August, 2024. Tesla’s stock
so far in 2024 is down 33%.<br />
</blockquote>
He focuses on Musk’s
<a href="https://aisupremacy.substack.com/p/the-biggest-ai-hype-fraud-of-all">pivot
to x.AI</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The myth that Tesla is a technology or AI company has been very crucial
in the false promise marketing around the brand. Elon Musk’s weird
response to this failure in 2024 is to poach AI talent from his Tesla to
his own x.AI company.<br /> <br /> This is because x.AI plans to do a
huge $3 Billion funding round that would value the AI startup at $18
Billion. This is all more or less breaking news.<br /> <br /> The
problem is AI frauds have a habit of big declines. Elon Musk may have to
make his SpaceX company, valued at around $180 billion as of early 2024,
go public with an IPO to raise the funds needed to support his X Corp
empire.
</blockquote>
Maintaining the illusion of superior technology requires
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">leaps
of logic</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Since 2017, officials with NTSB have urged Tesla to limit Autopilot use
to highways without cross traffic, the areas for which the company’s
user manuals specify Autopilot is intended. Asked by an attorney for
Huang’s family if Tesla “has decided it’s not going to do anything” on
that recommendation, Phatak argued that Tesla was already following the
NTSB’s guidance by limiting Autopilot use to roads that have lane lines.
</blockquote>
Note how, in Tesla’s world, any “roads that have lane lines” are
“highways without cross traffic”, and that Tesla is <i>not</i> limiting
Autopilot’s use but <i>asking their customers to limit its use</i>. A
significant difference. And Musk’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">reality
distortion field</a> is in
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">full
effect</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
When asked whether Autopilot would use GPS or other mapping systems to
ensure a road was suitable for the technology, Phatak said it would not.
“It’s not map based,” he said — an answer that diverged from Musk’s
statement in a 2016 conference call with reporters that Tesla could turn
to GPS as a backup “when the road markings may disappear.” In an audio
recording of the call cited by Huang family attorneys, Musk said the
cars could rely on satellite navigation “for a few seconds” while
searching for lane lines.
</blockquote>
This casual attitude to operating in the real world is
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">typical
of Tesla</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Phatak’s testimony also shed light on other driver-assist design
choices, such as Tesla’s decision to monitor driver attention through
sensors that gauge pressure on the steering wheel. Asked repeatedly by
the Huang family’s lawyer what tests or studies Tesla performed to
ensure the effectiveness of this method, Phatak said it simply tested it
with employees.
</blockquote>
Given Musk’s notorious hair-trigger
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/business/spacex-elon-musk-nlrb-workers.html">firings
in response to disagreement</a>, testing with employees is pretty much
guaranteed to discover that the system performs almost perfectly.<br />
<br /> The <i>Washington Post</i> team points out that this poor
engineering of life-critical systems has
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">real-world
impacts</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla’s heavy reliance on lane lines reflects the broader lack of
redundancy within its systems when compared to rivals. The Post has
previously reported that Tesla’s decision to omit radar from newer
models, at Musk’s behest, culminated in an uptick in crashes.
</blockquote>
Whereas other companies
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial/">behave
responsibly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Other Tesla design decisions have differed from competitors pursuing
autonomous vehicles. For one thing, Tesla sells its systems to
consumers, while other companies tend to deploy their own fleets as
taxis. It also employs a unique, camera-based system and places fewer
limits on where the software can be engaged. For example, a spokesperson
for Waymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving car company, said its
vehicles operate only in areas that have been rigorously mapped and
where the cars have been tested in conditions including fog and rain, a
process known as “geo-fencing.”<br /> <br /> “We’ve designed our system
knowing that lanes and their markings can change, be temporarily
occluded, move, and sometimes, disappear completely,” Waymo spokeswoman
Katherine Barna said.
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s all there is to Autopilot. No radar, no lidar, no GPS, no
map, no geofencing, no proper driver monitoring. It just uses the camera
to follow the lines. It doesn’t disengage if it can’t see the lines, it
just keeps going. So much for Tesla’s vaunted AI capabilities! I wonder
how much more you get for the $15K extra you pay for Fake Self
Driving?<br /> <br /></p>

Each form of online discussion has a <i>grain</i> to it.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls">Doc</a> and I used to
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/followsthegrain.png">talk</a>
about how something “follows the grain of the web.” Twitter has its own
grain, formed by its character limit, what information is shared (ie
number of followers in both directions).

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/26/baseballScene.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
made a list of some of the social networks I’ve been on starting in the
mid-70s. The list is very long. And each of them had their own limits,
rules and features, and each led to a certain kinds of relationships
between the participants. Mail lists that gain traction always flame
out. It’s hard to get people to read your blog. If you make it easier it
changes into something else. Instagram, Youtube, TikTok form hierarchies
of influencers. I think of those as the networks
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Lorenz">Taylor Lorenz</a>
covers.
</p>
<p>
But there isn’t a structure that I’m aware of that leads to people
working together. It’s a puzzle I keep trying to figure out.
</p>
<p>
We need
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether">working

One of the nicest things about ChatGPT is that it’s always up for
working with you. The critics of AI don’t begin to understand this. As
an example, I’m going to ask ChatGPT to draw a picture of people working
together.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/peopleWorkingTogether.png">Here
it is</a>. I didn’t have to wait. It didn’t look at my follower count,
or my bank statement to decide if it was willing to work with me. I pay
the $20 a month, and I’ve got a persistent always-on collaborator.
</p>
<p>
What got me thinking this way this morning is a bit of collaboration I
did <a href="https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun">with
palafo</a> (a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-laforge">human</a>) on

sarcasm. It may be hard to read the
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun">thread</a>
but if you’re curious about collaborative systems, here’s a real
example. Serendipitous, unplanned, but we figured something out by
combining our experiences. Fantastic.
</p>
<p>
Later, <a href="https://werd.io/">Ben Werdmuller</a>, a person who I’ve
gotten to know recently, is intelligent and asks good questions. He
asked one
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@ben.werdmuller/post/C50vyIruTCB">today</a>,
how do they get the live audience on SNL to laugh when they want them to
laugh. I had an idea and
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C50wy5NsYD0">shared</a> it.
(This was
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1v5hy6/how_does_the_snl_audience_know_when_to_laugh/">discussed</a>

If you take away one thing from this post it’s that we can collaborate
with the machines, and maybe that will unlock collaboration between
humans. In fact, in a way they are facilitating the collaboration. If
you want to be part of the collective human intelligence, you may be
thinking about the machines the wrong way. Maybe they’re the most human
thing we have, because AI is made up of humans, somewhat like

PPS: Yesterday I gave <a href="https://john.onolan.org/">John
O’Nolan</a> what I think is a
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C5y7iVoJP4r">good idea</a>
for getting his Ghost blogs federating with Threads, Mastodon et al. I
didn’t expect thanks or even a response, but I wonder if he even heard
it. Most of the time, trying to help other people results in not even an
acknowledgment that they saw it. If I were him I’d look for a painless,
quick way to get maximum interop. Something like
<a href="http://ghost.social/">ghost.social</a>. I’d give the same
advice to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> at Automattic (in fact I
think I did).
</p>
<p>
PPPS: I think acknowledgment is a key part of
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether">working
together</a> on the web. Nothing more than “I wanted you to know I saw
it” is often all that’s needed to grease the skids of discourse. I’ve
had a friendly disagreement with Manton at micro.blog about this.

<p>
Brian Krebs
<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/twitters-clumsy-pivot-to-x-com-is-a-gift-to-phishers/">reported</a>
that X (formerly known as Twitter) started automatically changing
twitter.com links to x.com links. The problem is: (1) it changed
<i>any</i> domain name that ended with “twitter.com,” and (2) it only
changed the link’s appearance (anchortext), not the underlying URL. So
if you were a clever phisher and registered fedetwitter.com, people
would see the link as fedex.com, but it would send people to
fedetwitter.com.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, the problem has been fixed.

How to add a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">FeedLand blogroll</a> to
a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">Drummer
blog</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You must have a Drummer blog and a FeedLand account.
</li>
<li>
You can specify that all the feeds you’re subscribed to are in your
blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in
the blogroll.
</li>
<li>
The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new
post, it goes to the top of the list.
</li>
<li>
You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the
pubdate to go to the full item on the web.
</li>
<li>
It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the
list, Return to expand/collapse.
</li>
<li>
We’re working on WordPress plugin.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
blogrollUsername – required
</li>
<li>
blogrollServer – optional, if not specified it’s feedland.com
</li>
<li>
blogrollCategory – optional
</li>
<li>
blogrollTitle – optional, but you really should provide a title,
otherwise we invent a silly one for you. <span

to ask questions offer kudos, etc. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

<p>
PS: I’m not trying to sell you on using Drummer to run a blog. Rather I
needed a place to figure out how this works, so we know how to set up
and document the WordPress plugin.

<h2 id="new-lattice-cryptanalytic-technique">New Lattice Cryptanalytic
Technique</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, updated: 2024-04-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">new paper</a> presents a
polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving certain hard lattice
problems. This could be a big deal for post-quantum cryptographic
algorithms, since many of them base their security on hard lattice
problems.
</p>
<p>
A few things to note. One, this paper has not yet been peer reviewed. As
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/111385/polynomial-time-quantum-algorithms-for-lattice-problems">this
comment</a> points out: “We had already some cases where efficient
quantum algorithms for lattice problems were discovered, but they turned
out
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41731/new-quantum-attack-on-lattices-or-shor-strikes-again?rq=1">not
being correct</a> or only worked for
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/95187/what-does-the-work-an-efficient-quantum-algorithm-for-lattice-problems-achievin">simple
special cases</a>.”
</p>
<p>
Two, this is a quantum algorithm, which means that it has not been
tested. There is a wide gulf between quantum algorithms in theory and in
practice. And until we can actually code and test these algorithms, we
should be suspicious of their speed and complexity claims…

about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out
opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn’t
happen, we don’t even look at each others software. After waiting a
whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short
periods, but it’s most of the time it’s been people trying to
deconstruct and reinvent other people’s work, not build on it. I’m still
open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more
time.</p>

don’t like how betting has invaded sports broadcasting. I don’t like
that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole
lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who
love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans
who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and
everything they (don’t) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks
(and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won’t be any of us left,
everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall,
because you can’t win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal
thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of
us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather
they’re feeding an addiction.</p>
