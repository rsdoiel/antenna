## Ian Mond Reviews Again and Again by Jonathan Evison

date: 2024-02-27, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Again and Again</strong>, Jonathan Evison (Dutton 978-0-59318-415-8, $28.00, 336pp, hc) November 2023.</p>
<p>I’ve been a massive fan of Jonathan Evison’s fiction since encountering his 2012 novel <strong>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</strong>. Not only does Evison have a cracking sense of humour, but he can see beauty and humanity in the darkest and most challenging of situations. I never thought, though, that I’d be reviewing one of Evison’s books  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/ian-mond-reviews-again-and-again-by-jonathan-evison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

I've been a fan of @levi_pinfold's art for a long time now, and was thrilled when he agreed to create an illustrated version of my book Norse Mythology. It's out US & UK on Nov 12th. Here's a linktree, or just tell your local bookshop you want a copy. (You DO want a copy. Trust me.)

## Alexandra Pierce Reviews 2022 Best of Utopian Speculative Fiction edited by Justine Norton-Kertson

<p>In their follow-up to <strong>Bioluminescent: A Lu­narpunk Anthology</strong>, Justine Norton-Kertson has assembled a range of stories that suggest different ways of thinking about “utopia.” Going into this anthology I had clear expectations of what “utopia” meant and what these stories would probably look like: societies would be shown as having figured  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/alexandra-pierce-reviews-2022-best-of-utopian-speculative-fiction-edited-by-justine-norton-kertson/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Year in Review 2023 by Russell Letson

date: 2024-02-26, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Long Games, Nightmares, and Retrospectives </strong><strong>by Russell Letson</strong></p>
<p>I look into the tea leaves – well, the coffee grounds – at the bottom of the year’s cup and find no wisdom or insight into either the state of the field or even my own reading patterns. As usual.

<p>Eliza Chan has racked up several short fiction pub­lications in recent years, but <strong>Fathomfolk </strong>represents her debut novel. And it is an interesting debut, albeit one that, on the whole, didn’t come together as I might have hoped.</p>
<p><strong>Fathomfolk </strong>takes place in a world dominated by water, apparently in the aftermath of a process  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/liz-bourke-reviews-fathomfolk-by-eliza-chan/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
