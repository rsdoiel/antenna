of the use of drones on a modern battlefield—that is, Ukraine—and the
inability of the US Air Force to react to this change.

<blockquote>
<p>
The F-35A certainly remains an important platform for high-intensity
conventional warfare. But the Air Force is planning to buy 1,763 of the
aircraft, which will remain in service through the year 2070. These
jets, which are wholly unsuited for countering proliferated low-cost
enemy drones in the air littoral, present <i>enormous</i> opportunity
costs for the service as a whole. In a set of comments

<p>VS Code now has port forwarding. If you want to share what you are
working on with the world, open folder in terminal, run your server and
forward the port. Set it to public and Bob’s your uncle! This is great
for some testing and showing people what you do, but of course should

<p>A few days ago, Vinod Khosla got into a war of words with Marc
Andreessen. Or was it Elon? It was an argument over OpenAI and “open”
AI. It might have felt like a bunch of capitalist leviathans butting
their big heads, but for me, this was classic Vinod. Always speaking his
mind, and batting …</p>
