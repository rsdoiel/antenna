## Rules for 2023 IFDB Awards

date: 2024-02-01, from: IF Database News

The IFDB Awards is an annual competition designed to award excellence in creating interactive fiction.It is held from February 1st to the first weekend after February 15th each year on the Interactive Fiction Database, and take the form of polls.</P>

Votes are public but anonymized. Every IFDB member is eligible to vote, except for one special poll, the Authors Choice Poll. Eligibility to vote in the Authors Choice competition is determined by having a game linked to your IFDB profile (this can be found by editing a game page and use the Link to Authors Profile feature. Authors added incorrectly to a game will not be permitted to vote (for instance, if someone associates a random game they didnt make to their account).</P>

Rules for discussion and voting
<br>
-Voting must be in good faith and be based on personal experience with the games involved.<br>

-Campaigning or organizing voting is not allowed if it breaks the above rule.<br>

-Discussion of games on merit is allowed and encouraged.<br>

-There is no hard limit on how many votes a person can cast in each poll for different games. A player voting for so many games that it makes voting difficult for others (such as voting for every game from the whole year) may have their votes removed, but only after warning.<br>

-Author cannot vote for their own games. Such votes will be removed so that the running tallies are correct. Authors can post about their own games (for instance on intfiction) as long as doesnt encourage people to break the rules (such as telling people to vote for your game even if they havent played it).

Code of conduct
</P>
-Voters must abide by the <A HREF="https://ifdb.org/code-of-conduct">IFDB Code of Conduct</A>. Harassment of other voters (including on other platforms) and creating multiple accounts for one person are prohibited.
</P>
Moderation
-Votes that are cast incorrectly (for instance, voting for a Twine game in a Choicescript poll) or fraudulently (for instance, using sockpuppet accounts) may be removed.
</P>
Eligibility
<br>
-For most polls, games are eligible if they are listed on IFDB and have a publication date during 2023.<br>

-For system-specific polls, games additionally must have the appropriate system or genre listed on their IFDB page under the specified field.<br>

-Each poll will have a link to an IFDB search listing suggested games. Outside of system-based polls, users can vote for any game they feel fits the criteria.<br>

-Any IFDB user can edit game pages to confirm eligibility. However, malicious editing (such as adding every genre to a game or adding incorrect systems to a game) will be reverted or removed.<br>

-Any game author can opt out of the competition. Adding a note to the game page during the competition may be helpful to let others know not to vote for it, but opting out should be officially done by messaging the organizer (me, for now).<br>

</P>
Results
<br>
-Results will be clearly visible throughout the poll. However, there will be a grace period of up to 3 days at the end to allow checking of votes before the official announcements, which will be made on Intfiction and IFDB.<br>

-Polls with very low traffic will not have a winner awarded. This is left up to organizer discretion, but low traffic may include less than 5 votes for the winning game or less than ten votes total cast.</P>


Future of Awards
</P>
One of the main purposes of these new awards is to be community-owned and regular. They need to keep working even if I dont keep working.</P>


The awards begin on February 1st of each year. If Feb 1st passes without the current organizer having created the polls, anyone can create the polls themselves.</P>

The community can propose new changes to awards or new organizers via public discussion. A public yes/no poll on intfiction with more than 50% voting yes can be used to add new organizers. Current organizers can also add in other organizers or successors, subject to a public veto.

## How to Add Custom Metadata to the Scrivener Inspector

date: 2024-01-31, from: Literature & a Latte blog


    
        
            
                <p>The Scrivener Inspector shows you information about the files and folders in your Scrivener projects and lets you add information about them as well. The Inspector has five sections: Synopsis &amp; Notes, Bookmarks, Metadata, Snapshots, and Comments &amp; Footnotes. See <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/get-to-know-the-scrivener-inspector" target="_blank">Get to Know the Scrivener Inspector</a> to learn more about these.</p>

<p>The Metadata pane of the Scrivener Inspector is especially useful: it includes information such as the date a file was created and modified, whether it&#39;s included in Compile, and its section type for compiling. But you can also add custom metadata to this section of the Inspector, which can be helpful as you write and edit your projects. Here&#39;s how.</p>

What is custom metadata?

<p>Custom metadata is additional fields of information that you can add to items in your Scrivener project. Custom metadata applies to the project where you set it up, not to all your projects.</p>

<p>To see the custom metadata that you can use, display the Inspector if it&#39;s not visible (View &gt; Show Inspector, or click the blue Inspector icon in the toolbar), then click the tag icon above the Inspector.</p>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <figure class="article__image">
                    
                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/metadata1.png" alt="" width="289" />
                    
                                    </figure>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <p>Click the disclosure triangle to the left of Custom Metadata to see any metadata that has already been created, or to create new metadata.</p>

<p>Click the ... icon to edit custom metadata. Click + at the top right of the dialogue to create a new metadata item. Type a title for your metadata, then click the Type menu. There are four options: Text, Checkbox, List, and Date.</p>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <figure class="article__image">
                    
                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/metadata3.png" alt="" width="864" />
                    
                                    </figure>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                The four types of custom metadata in Scrivener

<p>There are four types of custom metadata that you can use in Scrivener. Here are your options.</p>

<p><strong>Text</strong></p>

<p>Text metadata could contain anything you want. If you set up text metadata, then double-click below that section in the Inspector, you can enter any text you want. For example, if you want to enter the name of a reviewer, you can do so by double-clicking the text field in its section of the Inspector.</p>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <figure class="article__image">
                    
                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/metadata4.png" alt="" width="150" />
                    
                                    </figure>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <p><strong>Checkbox</strong></p>

<p>Checkboxes are what you expect. You can use checkboxes to mark when you&#39;ve finished writing or revising individual chapters, or for any other time you wish to mark something as completed.</p>

<p><strong>List</strong></p>

<p>You can create a list, and then choose an item from that list in the Inspector. For example, you could choose point of view characters, locations, or any other repeating element that you wish to mark as you progress in your project. You could use a list for revision status, such as Draft 1, Draft 2, etc., for edit status, or to mark files in your project as reviewed by an external reviewer. <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/5-tips-for-using-labels-in-scrivener" target="_blank">You can also use labels for these purposes</a>, but some people prefer using custom metadata because you can display it in different ways, such as in the Outliner (see below).</p>

<p>To set up list metadata options, use the bottom section of the Custom Metadata dialogue. Click + to add items to the list. You can also enter an item name when to use when nothing is chosen in the list if you want.</p>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <figure class="article__image">

                                    </figure>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <p>When you want to apply an item from this list to one or more items selected in the Binder, just click the list and select it.</p>

<p><strong>Date</strong></p>

<p>You can use custom metadata to indicate dates, which could be the date that you begin a file or complete it or when you send it to someone for review. You can also use this metadata to indicate dates in the timeline of your project; see Two Ways of Creating a Timeline for Your Scrivener Project to learn how to create a timeline with custom metadata. Note that the Date custom metadata gives you many formatting options for dates, including with times, and <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns" target="_blank">you can customize date and time formats that comply with Unicode standards</a>.</p>

<p>To apply date metadata, click the calendar icon in the metadata section and choose a date, a time, or a date and time, depending on what you chose when setting up the metadata.</p>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <figure class="article__image">

                <p>Here&#39;s how the Inspector looks with all four types of custom metadata:</p>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <figure class="article__image">
                    
                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/metadata7.png" alt="" width="289" />
                    
                                    </figure>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <p>Custom metadata displays in the order you create it, but you can change this order by dragging items in the custom metadata dialogue. If you want to re-order or edit your custom metadata, click the ... icon at the right of the Custom Metadata header to return to that dialogue.</p>

How to use custom metadata in the Outliner

<p>While custom metadata always displays in the Inspector, you can also choose to display it in the Outliner. If you select the top-level folder in the Binder or any folder containing files, then choose View &gt; Outline, you&#39;ll see these files in Outliner view. (See<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/plan-your-project-with-scriveners-outliner" target="_blank"> Plan Your Project with Scrivener&rsquo;s Outliner</a> for more on using the Outliner.) If you right-click in the Outliner header, a menu lets you choose which items get displayed in this view. Along with the standard items, such as Title, Label, Status, Keywords, etc., all your custom metadata displays at the bottom of this menu. For example, if you set up a list with your POV characters, and want to see that metadata in the Outliner, choose it when you right-click.</p>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <figure class="article__image">
                    
                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/metadata8.png" alt="" width="864" />
                    
                                    </figure>
            
        
    


    
        
            
                <p>Custom metadata is a great way to get additional information about the elements of your Scrivener project, and tag items so you can see the metadata in the Outliner. Check this feature out; you may find that it&#39;s especially useful as you progress in a project and start looking at the bigger picture.</p>

I get fascinated by the videos that purport to reveal the secret story behind something that isn't hard to follow. (Coraline's plot is not tortuous or complex. It doesn't make it a better story to claim all the adults in it are dead or whatever.)

<p>Readers of K.J. Parker are by now familiar with his affable scoundrels – by turns digressive, philo­sophical, deeply cynical, petulant, and somehow both self-loathing and self-justifying in the same breath.

**@Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky** (date: 2024-01-28, from: Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky)

Since August I've been watching Doctor Who with an obsessed 8 year old. So far we have dived deeply into Doctors 9, 10 and 11, but he's skipped 12 (don't know why) and we are deep in 13 (which I had skipped much of).
