I get fascinated by the videos that purport to reveal the secret story behind something that isn't hard to follow. (Coraline's plot is not tortuous or complex. It doesn't make it a better story to claim all the adults in it are dead or whatever.)

## Gary K. Wolfe Reviews Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead by K.J. Parker

date: 2024-01-28, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead</strong>, K.J. Parker (Orbit 978-0316668903, $18.99, 359pp, tp) Oc­tober 2023.</p>

<p>Readers of K.J. Parker are by now familiar with his affable scoundrels – by turns digressive, philo­sophical, deeply cynical, petulant, and somehow both self-loathing and self-justifying in the same breath. Saevus Corax, the playwright-turned-battlefield-scavenger who is the protagonist of  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/01/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-saevus-corax-deals-with-the-dead-by-k-j-parker/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

**@Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky** (date: 2024-01-28, from: Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky)

Since August I've been watching Doctor Who with an obsessed 8 year old. So far we have dived deeply into Doctors 9, 10 and 11, but he's skipped 12 (don't know why) and we are deep in 13 (which I had skipped much of).
