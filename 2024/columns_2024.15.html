<p>Friends, I’m the father of two young men of whom I couldn’t be

loving grandparents, great teachers and mentors, and supportive friends.
And they were fortunate to grow up with most of the resources they

Below the fold is the story of how I got a full-time Internet connection
at my apartment 32 years ago next month, and the incredible success of
my first ISP.<br /> <br /> The reason I’m now able to tell this story is
that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jennings">Tom
Jennings</a>, the moving spirit behind the ISP has
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">two</a>
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/">posts</a>
describing the history of The Little Garden, which was the name the ISP
had adopted (from a Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto) when I joined it in
May 1993. Tom’s perspective from the ISP’s point of view contrasts with
my perspective — that of a fairly early customer enhanced by information
via e-mail from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)">John
Gilmore</a> and Tim Pozar, who were both involved far earlier than
I.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Jennings
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">starts
his story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Once upon a time, three little businesses wanted a connection to the
ARPAnet/internet. The year was 1990 or 1991. John Gilmore, John
Romke[y], and Trusted Information Systems (TIS) split the $15K or so it
took to get a leased-line and 3COM Brouters to Alternet, with what today
you’d call fractional T1. An additional 56K leased line and Brouter
brought the ’net up to Gilmore’s house, Toad Hall, in San Francisco.
</blockquote>
The three little businesses were Cygnus Support (John Gilmore), Epilogue
Technology (John Romkey) and Trusted Information Systems (Steve
Crocker). AlterNet was run by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Adams_(Internet_pioneer)">Rick
Adams</a>, whom Wikipedia justly describes as an “Internet pioneer”. He
founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUNET">UUNET
Technologies</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the mid-1990s, UUNET was the fastest-growing ISP, outpacing MCI and
Sprint. At its peak, Internet traffic was briefly doubling every few
months, which translates to 10x growth each year.
</blockquote>
John Gilmore, a truly wonderful person, had many friends. So
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">what
happened was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As time went on, friends of theirs wanted in on this rare and exciting
’net connection, resulting in Tim Pozar putting an old PC running Phil
Karn’s KA9Q/NOS program, an amateur radio router capable of TCP/IP, onto
Toad Hall’s ethernet. Tim installed a pair of modems, then dialed in
once and stayed connected 24 hrs/day (Pacific Bell never said you
couldn’t do that…)
</blockquote>
Once Tim showed that it was possible, this
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">idea
took off</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Eventually the NOS box was full, and more friends wanted in, but
everyone was too busy to deal with the hassle.<br /> <br /> Somehow, in
September 1992, Pozar and Gilmore and I worked out a deal where, I would
maintain the thing, collect money to build more NOS boxes and contribute
to the monthly Alternet bill, install more people, and get (1) a free
connection to the internet and (2) a slice off the top after it exceeded
N connections.<br /> <br /> By that December, there were enough
connections in place that I was pocketing $420/month. By March 1993
there were 11 modem-connected members (as we fancied ourselves).
</blockquote>
In 1989 Gilmore had co-founded
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Solutions">Cygnus
Support</a>, whose tagline was “Making free software affordable”. TLG
got started in August 1990 with the three businesses’ nodes on a 56K
leased line. One was at Cygnus first office in an apartment complex on
University Avenue in Palo Alto. Gilmore and other Cygnus employees had
apartments there, so they used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2">10BASE2</a> coaxial
cable Ethernet to distribute the Internet around the complex. Gilmore
notes that they used “nonstandard thin 50-ohm coax in the expansion
joints across the driveways when needed”. Pozar notes that they paved
over the coax!<br /> <br /> Gilmore was paying more than $300/mo for
modem phone lines supporting the Alt Usenet groups, and realized that
for less than that he could have a 56K line from Cygnus to his basement
in SF. That led to Pozar and Rich Morin’s Canta Forda Computer
installing the old PC and becoming the first to use the permanent local
call idea.<br /> <br /> I knew Gilmore from the early days of Sun
Microsystems (he was employee #5), so I first found out about the Point
of Presence (PoP) in his basement in late 1992 and <i>really</i> wanted
to join in. Alas, there was a snag — the reason the idea worked was that
local phone calls were free. From my home in Palo Alto to Toad Hall was
a toll call, making it impossibly expensive. But in May 1993 I found out
about the PoP on University, 8 blocks from my apartment.<br /> <br /> I
purchased:<br />
<ul>
<li>
A phone line from Pacific Bell at the PoP.
</li>
<li>
A second phone line at my apartment.
</li>
<li>
A pair of Zyxel 9.6Kb modems, one for the PoP and one for my apartment.
</li>
</ul>

If memory serves, it cost $250 installation fee and $70/month, and Tom
Jennings helped me plug in one of the modems at the University PoP. I
already had two SparcStations, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation#Integrated_monitor/portable_systems">SparcStation
SLC</a> with an external SCSI hard disk I bought on Sun’s employee
purchase program, and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_1">SparcStation
1+</a>, the prizes Steve Kleiman and I won in an internal “Vision Quest”
at Sun. My apartment was open-plan and the 1+’s fans were too noisy to
let me sleep, but the SLC was fanless and could be on-line continuously.
The SLC, the hard disk and the modem sat on a conveniently large window
ledge. There was a wired Ethernet connection from the window ledge to
the desk. When I say “wired” I mean that it ran on the apartments
internal phone wires, but the distance was short enough that it
worked.<br /> <br />

This setup was remarkably reliable. If the call dropped, the SunOS
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1055">SLIP</a>
software automatically re-dialled it. I have no memory of problems with
it; I think the only times it was down were when I upgraded the modems
as faster ones became available, or when I put the whole system on an
Uninterruptible Power Supply. It may have been then that I noticed it
had been up over 500 days. I didn’t really need the UPS, Palo Alto’s
municipal utilities are also very reliable.<br /> <br /> As I recall it
ran happily until I passed the apartment on to my step-daughter’s family
in summer 2000. Seven years of impeccable service. By that time I was
working on the LOCKSS program at Stanford, and we had DSL service from
Stanford IT. So I went from an ISP with great tech support to an ISP
with great support. Then as I relate in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/01/isp-monopolies.html"><i>ISP
Monopolies</i></a> in September 2001
<a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/morgue/2001/2001_09_28.ftth28.html">Palo
Alto’s Fiber-to-the-Home trial</a> went live and I had 10Mbit
bi-directional fiber with great support from Palo Alto Utilities. Since
the trial ended our ISP has been
<a href="https://www.sonic.com/">Sonic</a>, first over 3/1Mbit DSL and
now over
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/01/isp-monopolies.html">gigabit
fiber</a>. So we are really used to having great support from our
ISP.<br /> <br /> TLG was an astonishing success. From something like
$2000/month in December 1992 it grew
“<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">an
average of 12% per month from Jan94 through July96</a>” when it had
“<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">a
monthly gross of about $125,000.00</a> until:<br />
<blockquote>
Luckily we were bought by Best Internet Communications, Mountain View;
they had money, marketing, and a non-burned-out management; we had a
solid locked-in customer base and positive cash flow.
</blockquote>
Best turned out to be a pretty good ISP too.<br /> <br /> Jennings’
explanations for TLG’s success are interesting. First,
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">technical
competence</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Edgar Nielsen almost single-handedly built the technical infrastructure
that TLGnet ran on. He designed much of the network and routing
structure, all of the security (with some help from Stu Grossman), wrote
a complete, queryable, shared and remotely-accessible database (included
every single modem, router, wire, cable, customer, IP (domain names and
IP address allocations), and logical link) in standard and portable
tools, installed equipment, built and maintained our unix boxes, put
SNMP on every single node (hundreds) and automated the entire ISP
technical infrastructure from one end to the other. I doubt many small
to mid-size ISPs today have the things Edgar wrote by 1995.
</blockquote>
Second,
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">good
HR</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Another thing of crucial importance to me, and to Deke, Edgar and a
lesser extent Gilmore, was hiring from our local communities; we hired
principled people, punk and queer writers and organizers, and trained
and paid them – pay in scale with effort. Total staff turn-over in three
years was probably 20; peak staff was 12. Some 10 of them started out at
$8.00/hr, unskilled, ended up with $30,000 salary a year later
[1994-1996], and stayed in the industry (at prevailing pay). (And we
provided health insurance too. Deke being damned Wobbly may have had
some small effect.)<br /> …<br /> we treated our staff well, gave them
credit for work done, paid them actual money, gave raises and bonuses
(upon sale of the business, even some fired employees got small bonus
checks). TLGnet wouldn’t have existed without its talented staff!
</blockquote>
Third, an innovative business model starting with their
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">terms
and conditions</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
TLGnet exercises no control whatsoever over the content of the
information passing through TLGnet. You are free to communicate
commercial, noncommercial, personal, questionable, obnoxious, annoying,
or any other kind of information, misinformation, or disinformation
through our service. You are fully responsible for the privacy of,
content of, and liability for your own communications.
</blockquote>
Jennings explains the
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/">business
model</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Concentrate on bulk, fulltime internet access (leased-line and Frame
Relay)
</li>
<li>

Essentially, other ISPs restricted use and resale of their connections,
in a sort of zero-sum approach. By concentrating on bulk connectivity we
at once created a market for our customers to provide the vertical
services we didn’t want or couldn’t afford to provide, and built a
hard-to-beat solid rep that for a long while locked out direct
competitors to our core business; having our prices online and breaking
down the leased-line costs and equipment gave us a major one-up
economically, technically, and in credible reputation over nearly all
other ISPs, big or small.

was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Some thought us insane; but in fact our customers didn’t “compete” with
us, they provided vertical services we couldn’t or wouldn’t (I guess we
did have a business plan). And in fact we set further standards of
behavior and policies that other ISPs, including MCI and SprintLink,
were obliged to match. Though some, like Alternet and PSI, never did;
they skimmed the high-end deep-pockets customers, and we got all the new
growth.

I would add to the “Busines Model” discussion, that communication costs
per-bit dropped dramatically with volume. When you upgraded from 56k
bit/sec leased lines to T1 (1,500k bit/sec), you got 24x the bandwidth
but it only cost about 4x as much. An upgrade to T3 (45 megabit)
provided 30x the bandwidth of a T1, and didn’t cost anything near to 30x
as much. So, as your traffic volume grew because you were adding more
and more customers, the cost of your basic connection to the rest of the
Internet got significantly cheaper (per bit). That economy of scale
meant that ISPs who grew could keep affording to upgrade their backbones
to handle the traffic growth. Every ISP knew, or figured out, this
economics, and they all depended on it. Remember, this was back when
there were 2000 ISP’s in the US, mostly local ones. (About 30 of them
were getting their Internet service from TLG when we sold it to Best.)

There is a fascinating October 29 1996 interview entitled
<a href="https://archive.org/details/BrewsterKahleOnWAISAndTheStartOfTheInternetArchive1996"><i>Tim
Pozar and Brewster Kahle CHM Interview</i></a> by Marc Weber. The first
part of the interview is all about TLG. In it Brewster Kahle sums up the
story (I cleaned up his stream of conciousness a bit):<br />
<blockquote>
it took six months of a full-time person to get us on the DARPA net in
1985 … but The Little Garden basically made it so that any old person
[could connect] and more than that not just themselves but … enabling
other people to create their own ISPs and I don’t know there are 400
ISPs now in the Bay Area in large part because of The Little Garden.

Cyber Safety Review Board on the 2023 Microsoft Exchange Hack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, updated: 2024-04-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
US Cyber Safety Review Board released a
<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">report</a>
on the summer 2023 hack of Microsoft Exchange by China. It was a serious
attack by the Chinese government that accessed the emails of senior U.S.
government officials.
</p>
<p>
From the executive summary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Board finds that this intrusion was preventable and should never
have occurred. The Board also concludes that Microsoft’s security
culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul, particularly in light
of the company’s centrality in the technology ecosystem and the level of
trust customers place in the company to protect their data and
operations. The Board reaches this conclusion based on:…

HTML Emails</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, updated: 2024-04-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This is a
<a href="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/">newly
discovered</a> email vulnerability:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The email your manager received and forwarded to you was something
completely innocent, such as a potential customer asking a few
questions. All that email was supposed to achieve was being forwarded to
you. However, the moment the email appeared in your inbox, it changed.
The innocent pretext disappeared and the real phishing email became
visible. A phishing email you <i>had</i> to trust because you knew the
sender and they even confirmed that they had forwarded it to you.
</p>
<p>
This attack is possible because most email clients allow CSS to be used
to style HTML emails. When an email is forwarded, the position of the
original email in the DOM usually changes, allowing for CSS rules to be
selectively applied only when an email has been forwarded…
