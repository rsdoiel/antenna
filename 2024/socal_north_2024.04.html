<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>As Chae Campbell landed her double tuck dismount on floor, scraps of
paper resembling confetti were thrown in the air. The senior’s 9.95 on
floor – tying a team high as a part of the Bruins’ 49.625 event score –
closed out Saturday night’s home opener at Pauley Pavilion.</p>

men’s basketball’s 22-4 run in the first half powers it past USC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated Jan. 28 at 3:05 a.m. </em> The Bruins were
facing a deficit when two players entered the game and caused the tide
to turn.  Freshmen forward Devin Williams and center Aday Mara, who
average 3.2 and 11.7 minutes per game, respectively, spurred UCLA’s
guards to accelerate onto a 22-4 run thanks to their height in the
paint.  “Aday and Devin really changed the rhythm of the game,” said
coach Mick Cronin.</p>

Kindness Institute’s Contagious Kindness Project, contagiousness is
something to embrace – maybe in the form of a literal hug.</p>
