launch hunger strike, pressure UC Regents to hire undocumented
students</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated Jan. 23 at 11:50 p.m. </em> Over a dozen
student activists from across the UC system launched a hunger strike
Tuesday, hoping to pressure the UC Board of Regents to follow through on
its promises to open on-campus employment opportunities for the
University’s nearly 4,000 students without legal status.  The escalation
is the latest development in the “Opportunity for All” campaign backed
by progressive legal scholars and undocumented student organizers, which
was launched in October 2022 at UCLA.</p>
