NVMe systems from RISCOSbits at Wakefield</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-26, from: RiscOS Story</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-25, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Following the update to Hexen, released by R-Comp just in time for
Southwest 2024, there is now an updated version of Heretic available,
just in time for Wakefield! The 2024 edition of Heretic follows in
Hexen’s footsteps, gaining compatibility with modern RISC OS systems –
yet remains compatible with machines as far back as the RiscPC. It also
gains much improved graphics, with a new lighting model, and is playable
at higher resolutions than before, and it can also use high quality
soundtrack recordings to enhance the atmosphere when playing.…</p>
