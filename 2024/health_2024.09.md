## Whole genome sequencing identifies novel mutations in malaria parasites resistant to artesunate (ATN) and to ATN + mefloquine combination

date: 2024-03-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The global evolution of resistance to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) by malaria parasites, will severely undermine our ability to control this devastating disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here, we have used whole genome sequencing to characterize the genetic variation in the experimentally evolved Plasmodium chabaudi parasite clone AS-ATNMF1, which is resistant to artesunate + mefloquine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Five novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, one of which was a previously undescribed E738K mutation in a 26S proteasome subunit that was selected for under artesunate pressure (in AS-ATN) and retained in AS-ATNMF1. The wild type and mutated three-dimensional (3D) structure models and molecular dynamics simulations of the P. falciparum 26S proteasome subunit Rpn2 suggested that the E738K mutation could change the toroidal proteasome/cyclosome domain organization and change the recognition of ubiquitinated proteins. The mutation in the 26S proteasome subunit may therefore contribute to altering oxidation-dependent ubiquitination of the MDR-1 and/or K13 proteins and/or other targets, resulting in changes in protein turnover. In light of the alarming increase in resistance to artemisin derivatives and ACT partner drugs in natural parasite populations, our results shed new light on the biology of resistance and provide information on novel molecular markers of resistance that may be tested (and potentially validated) in the field.</p></sec>

## Cytokine IL-5 and HGF: combined prediction of non-/low immune response to hepatitis B vaccination at birth in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers

date: 2024-03-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>The immune response to hepatitis B vaccine may be influenced by numerous factors, and patients with non/low response re-exposed to hepatitis B virus remain susceptible. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of non/low immune response in infants born to Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers is essential.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>100 infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers from 2015 to 2020 were enrolled in the study, further divided into the non/low response group (n=13) and the moderate strong response group (n=87) based on the quantification of hepatitis B surface antibody at 12 months of age. The differential expression of 48 immune-related cytokines in the two groups was compared and analyzed in detail. The key cytokines were further identified and clinically predictive models were developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that 13 cytokines were lowly expressed and one cytokine was highly expressed in the non/low response group, compared with the moderate strong response group at birth. In addition, 9 cytokines were lowly expressed and one cytokine was highly expressed in the non/low response group at 12 months of age. Furthermore, we found that IL-5 and HGF were promising predictors for predicting the immunization response to hepatitis B vaccine in infants, and the combination of the two cytokines showed the best predictive efficiency, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.844.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study provides a theoretical basis on cytokines for developing and implementing effective immunotherapies against non/low immune response in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.</p></sec>

## The role of sialidases in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis and their use as a promising pharmacological target in bacterial vaginosis

date: 2024-03-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection of the genital tract characterized by disturbance of the normally <italic>Lactobacilli-</italic>dominated vaginal flora due to the overgrowth of <italic>Gardnerella</italic> and other anaerobic bacteria. <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, an anaerobic pathogen and the major pathogen of BV, produces sialidases that cleave terminal sialic acid residues off of human glycans. By desialylation, sialidases not only alter the function of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates but also play a vital role in the attachment, colonization and spread of many other vaginal pathogens. With known pathogenic effects, excellent performance of sialidase-based diagnostic tests, and promising therapeutic potentials of sialidase inhibitors, sialidases could be used as a biomarker of BV. This review explores the sources of sialidases and their role in vaginal dysbiosis, in aims to better understand their participation in the pathogenesis of BV and their value in the diagnosis and treatment of BV.</p>

## Design of a multi-epitope vaccine against goatpox virus using an immunoinformatics approach

date: 2024-02-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Goatpox, a severe infectious disease caused by goatpox virus (GTPV), leads to enormous economic losses in the livestock industry. Traditional live attenuated vaccines cause serious side effects and exist a risk of dispersal. Therefore, it is urgent to develop efficient and safer vaccines to prevent and control of GTPV.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In the present study, we are aimed to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against GTPV using an immunoinformatics approach. Various immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, helper T lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes, and B-cell epitopes from P32, L1R, and 095 proteins of GTPV were screened and liked by the AAY, GPGPG, and KK connectors, respectively. Furthermore, an adjuvant β-defensin was attached to the vaccine’s N-terminal using the EAAAK linker to enhance immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The constructed vaccine was soluble, non-allergenic and non-toxic and exhibited high levels of antigenicity and immunogenicity. The vaccine’s 3D structure was subsequently predicted, refined and validated, resulting in an optimized model with a Z-value of -3.4. Molecular docking results demonstrated that the vaccine had strong binding affinity with TLR2(-27.25 kcal/mol), TLR3(-39.84 kcal/mol), and TLR4(-59.42 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that docked vaccine-TLR complexes were stable. Immune simulation analysis suggested that the vaccine can induce remarkable increase in antibody titers of IgG and IgM, higher levels of IFN-γ and IL-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The designed GTPV multi-epitope vaccine is structurally stable and can induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses, which may be a promising vaccine candidate against GTPV.</p></sec>

## An overview of anti-Hepatitis B virus flavonoids and their mechanisms of action

date: 2024-02-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Flavonoids, a diverse group of polyphenolic compounds found in various plant-based foods, have garnered attention for their potential in combating Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection. Flavonoids have demonstrated promising anti-HBV activities by interfering with multiple stages of the HBV life cycle, making them promising candidates for novel antiviral agents. Certain plant families, such as <italic>Theaceae</italic>, <italic>Asteraceae</italic>, <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>, and <italic>Gentianaceae</italic>, are of particular interest for their flavonoid-rich members with anti-HBV activities. Evidences, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, supports the anti-HBV potential of flavonoids. These subsets of compound exert their anti-HBV effects through various mechanisms, including inhibiting viral entry, disrupting viral replication, modulating transcription factors, enhancing the immune response, and inducing autophagy. The antioxidant properties of flavonoids play a crucial role in modulating oxidative stress associated with HBV infection. Several flavonoids like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), proanthocyanidin (PAC), hexamethoxyflavone, wogonin, and baicalin have shown significant anti-HBV potential, holding promise as therapeutic agents. Synergistic effects between flavonoids and existing antiviral therapies offer a promising approach to enhance antiviral efficacy and reduce drug resistance. Challenges, including limited bioavailability, translation from preclinical studies to clinical practice, and understanding precise targets, need to be addressed. Future research should focus on clinical trials, combination therapies, and the development of flavonoid derivatives with improved bioavailability, and optimizing their effectiveness in managing chronic HBV infections.</p>

## O-Antigen decorations in Salmonella enterica play a key role in eliciting functional immune responses against heterologous serovars in animal models

date: 2024-02-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Different serovars of Salmonella enterica cause systemic diseases in humans including enteric fever, caused by S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, and invasive nontyphoidal salmonellosis (iNTS), caused mainly by S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. No vaccines are yet available against paratyphoid fever and iNTS but different strategies, based on the immunodominant O-Antigen component of the lipopolysaccharide, are currently being tested. The O-Antigens of S. enterica serovars share structural features including the backbone comprising mannose, rhamnose and galactose as well as further modifications such as O-acetylation and glucosylation. The importance of these O-Antigen decorations for the induced immunogenicity and cross-reactivity has been poorly characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>These immunological aspects were investigated in this study using Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA) as delivery systems for the different O-Antigen variants. This platform allowed the rapid generation and in vivo testing of defined and controlled polysaccharide structures through genetic manipulation of the O-Antigen biosynthetic genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results from mice and rabbit immunization experiments highlighted the important role played by secondary O-Antigen decorations in the induced immunogenicity. Moreover, molecular modeling of O-Antigen conformations corroborated the likelihood of cross-protection between S. enterica serovars.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Such results, if confirmed in humans, could have a great impact on the design of a simplified vaccine composition able to maximize functional immune responses against clinically relevant Salmonella enterica serovars.</p></sec>

## Defining a metagenomic threshold for detecting low abundances of Providencia alcalifaciens in canine faecal samples

date: 2024-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS) in dogs is a condition of unknown aetiology. <italic>Providencia alcalifaciens</italic> is suspected to play a role in the disease as it was commonly found in dogs suffering from AHDS during a Norwegian outbreak in 2019. The role of this bacterium as a constituent of the canine gut microbiota is unknown, hence this study set out to investigate its occurrence in healthy dogs using metagenomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>To decrease the likelihood of false detection, we established a metagenomic threshold for <italic>P. alcalifaciens</italic> by spiking culture-negative stool samples with a range of bacterial dilutions and analysing these by qPCR and shotgun metagenomics. The detection limit for <italic>P. alcalifaciens</italic> was determined and used to establish a metagenomic threshold. The threshold was validated on naturally contaminated faecal samples with known cultivation status for <italic>P. alcalifaciens</italic>. Finally, the metagenomic threshold was used to determine the occurrence of <italic>P. alcalifaciens</italic> in shotgun metagenomic datasets from canine faecal samples (n=362) collected in the HUNT One Health project.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The metagenomic assay and qPCR had a detection limit of 1.1x10<sup>3</sup> CFU <italic>P. alcalifaciens</italic> per faecal sample, which corresponded to a Cq value of 31.4 and 569 unique <italic>k-</italic>mer counts by shotgun metagenomics. Applying this metagenomic threshold to 362 faecal metagenomic datasets from healthy dogs, <italic>P. alcalifaciens</italic> was found in only 1.1% (95% CI [0.0, 6.8]) of the samples, and then in low relative abundances (median: 0.04%; range: 0.00 to 0.81%). The sensitivity of the qPCR and shotgun metagenomics assay was low, as only 40% of culture-positive samples were also positive by qPCR and metagenomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Using our detection limit, the occurrence of <italic>P. alcalifaciens</italic> in faecal samples from healthy dogs was low. Given the low sensitivity of the metagenomic assay, these results do not rule out a significantly higher occurrence of this bacterium at a lower abundance.</p></sec>

## Molecular epidemiology of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli outbreak among neonates in Tembisa hospital, South Africa

date: 2024-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>An outbreak of multidrug-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae</italic> infections in a neonatal ward within a tertiary hospital in South Africa resulted in the mortality of 10 patients within six months. In this work, the genomic epidemiology of and the molecular factors mediating this outbreak were investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Bacterial cultures obtained from clinical samples collected from the infected neonates underwent phenotypic and molecular analyses to determine their species, sensitivity to antibiotics, production of carbapenemases, complete resistance genes profile, clonality, epidemiology, and evolutionary relationships. Mobile genetic elements flanking the resistance genes and facilitating their spread were also characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The outbreak was centered in two major wards and affected mainly neonates between September 2019 and March 2020. Most isolates (n = 27 isolates) were <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> while both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. cloacae</italic> had three isolates each. Notably, 33/34 isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), with 30 being resistant to at least four drug classes. All the isolates were carbapenemase-positive, but four <italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-48</sub> isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. <italic>Bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> (n = 13) and <italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-48/181</sub> (n = 15) were respectively found on <italic>IS</italic>91 and <italic>IS</italic>6-like <italic>IS</italic>26 composite transposons in the isolates alongside several other resistance genes. The repertoire of resistance and virulence genes, insertion sequences, and plasmid replicon types in the strains explains their virulence, resistance, and quick dissemination among the neonates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The outbreak of fatal MDR infections in the neonatal wards were mediated by clonal (vertical) and horizontal (plasmid-mediated) spread of resistant and virulent strains (and genes) that have been also circulating locally and globally.</p></sec>

## Vaccination with parasite-specific TcTASV proteins combined with recombinant baculovirus as a delivery platform protects against acute and chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection

date: 2024-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Chagas’ is a neglected disease caused by the eukaryotic kinetoplastid parasite, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi.</italic> Currently, approximately 8 million people are infected worldwide, most of whom are in the chronic phase of the disease, which involves cardiac, digestive, or neurologic manifestations. There is an urgent need for a vaccine because treatments are only effective in the initial phase of infection, which is generally underdiagnosed. The selection and combination of antigens, adjuvants, and delivery platforms for vaccine formulations should be designed to trigger mixed humoral and cellular immune responses, considering that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> has a complex life cycle with both intracellular and bloodstream circulating parasite stages in vertebrate hosts. Here, we report the effectiveness of vaccination with a <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-specific protein family (TcTASV), employing both recombinant proteins with aluminum hydroxide and a recombinant baculovirus displaying a TcTASV antigen at the capsid. Vaccination stimulated immunological responses by producing lytic antibodies and antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ IFNɣ secreting lymphocytes. More than 90% of vaccinated animals survived after lethal challenges with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, whereas all control mice died before 30 days post-infection. Vaccination also induced a strong decrease in chronic tissue parasitism and generated immunological memory that allowed vaccinated and infected animals to control both the reactivation of the infection after immunosuppression and a second challenge with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Interestingly, inoculation with <italic>wild-type</italic> baculovirus partially protected the mice against <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. In brief, we demonstrated for the first time that the combination of the baculovirus platform and the TcTASV family provides effective protection against <italic>Trypanosoma cruz</italic>i, which is a promising vaccine for Chagas disease.</p>

## Anti-cancer management of head and neck cancers and oral microbiome—what can we clinically obtain?

date: 2024-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits significant genetic heterogeneity and primarily concerns the oral cavity and oropharynx. These cancers occur more frequently in men with a 5-year survival rate below 50%. Major risk factors include human papilloma virus (HPV) (notably type 16), Epstein–Barr virus, tobacco, alcohol, and poor oral hygiene with approximately 4.5% of global cancers linked to HPV. Notably, differences in the microbiome between healthy individuals and patients with head and neck cancers (HNCs) have been identified. Recent studies highlight the significance of certain oral microbes in risk assessment and the potential of the microbiome as a biomarker for HNCs. Additionally, role of the microbiome in metastasis has been acknowledged. Treatment for HNCs includes local methods, such as surgery and radiotherapy, and systemic approaches, such as immunotherapy. Numerous side effects accompany these treatments. Emerging research suggests the beneficial role of preoperative immunonutrition and probiotics in patient outcomes, emphasizing the influence of the microbiome on treatment efficacy. This review explores the reciprocal effects of HNC treatment and the gut microbiome using radiotherapy, brachytherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy.</p>

## Portable, and ultrasensitive HR-HPV tests based on nucleic acid biosensors

date: 2024-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer threatening women’s health globally, and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is the main cause of cervical cancer worldwide. Given the recurrent nature of HR-HPV infection, accurate screening is essential for its control. Since the commonly used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is limited by professional equipment and personnel, convenient and ultrasensitive detection methods for HR-HPV are still highly needed. As new molecular detection methods, nucleic acid amplification-based biosensors have the advantages of high sensitivity, rapid operation, and portability, which are helpful for point-of-care testing in rural and remote areas. This review summarized nucleic acid biosensors for HR-HPV screening based on a variety of nucleic acid amplification strategies involved in improved PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, hybridization chain reaction, catalyzed hairpin assembly, and CRISPR/Cas systems. In combination with microfluidic technology, lateral flow assays, electrochemical analysis and other sensing technologies, HR-HPV nucleic acid biosensors have the advantages of high throughput, short response time, high sensitivity and easy operation in the field. Although there are still shortcomings, such as high cost and poor reproducibility, this approach will be suitable for on-site screening of HR-HPV infection or cervical cancer and for auxiliary clinical diagnosis in complex environments and poor areas in the future.</p>

## Deciphering the impact of endoparasitic infection on immune response and gut microbial composition of Channa punctata

date: 2024-02-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Intestinal parasitic infections caused by helminths are globally distributed and are a major cause of morbidity worldwide. Parasites may modulate the virulence, gut microbiota diversity and host responses during infection. Despite numerous works, little is known about the complex interaction between parasites and the gut microbiota. In the present study, the complex interplay between parasites and the gut microbiota was investigated. A total of 12 bacterial strains across four major families, including Enterobacteriaceae, Morganellaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae, were isolated from <italic>Channa punctata</italic>, infected with the nematode species <italic>Aporcella</italic> sp., <italic>Axonchium</italic> sp., <italic>Tylencholaimus mirabilis</italic>, and <italic>Dioctophyme renale</italic>. The findings revealed that nematode infection shaped the fish gut bacterial microbiota and significantly affected their virulence levels. Nematode-infected fish bacterial isolates are more likely to be pathogenic, with elevated hemolytic activity and biofilm formation, causing high fish mortality. In contrast, isolates recovered further from non-parasitised <italic>C. punctata</italic> were observed to be non-pathogenic and had negligible hemolytic activity and biofilm formation. Antibiogram analysis of the bacterial isolates revealed a disproportionately high percentage of bacteria that were either marginally or multidrug resistant, suggesting that parasitic infection-induced stress modulates the gut microenvironment and enables colonization by antibiotic-resistant strains. This isolation-based study provides an avenue to unravel the influence of parasitic infection on gut bacterial characteristics, which is valuable for understanding the infection mechanism and designing further studies aimed at optimizing treatment strategies. In addition, the cultured isolates can supplement future gut microbiome studies by providing wet lab specimens to compare (meta)genomic information discovered within the gut microenvironment of fish.</p>

## Mechanisms of mesothelial cell response to viral infections: HDAC1-3 inhibition blocks poly(I:C)-induced type I interferon response and modulates the mesenchymal/inflammatory phenotype

<p>Infectious peritonitis is a leading cause of peritoneal functional impairment and a primary factor for therapy discontinuation in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Although bacterial infections are a common cause of peritonitis episodes, emerging evidence suggests a role for viral pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) specifically recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from bacteria, viruses, and fungi, thereby orchestrating the ensuing inflammatory/immune responses. Among TLRs, TLR3 recognizes viral dsRNA and triggers antiviral response cascades upon activation. Epigenetic regulation, mediated by histone deacetylase (HDAC), has been demonstrated to control several cellular functions in response to various extracellular stimuli. Employing epigenetic target modulators, such as epidrugs, is a current therapeutic option in several cancers and holds promise in treating viral diseases. This study aims to elucidate the impact of TLR3 stimulation on the plasticity of human mesothelial cells (MCs) in PD patients and to investigate the effects of HDAC1-3 inhibition. Treatment of MCs from PD patients with the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), led to the acquisition of a bona fide mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) characterized by the upregulation of mesenchymal genes and loss of epithelial-like features. Moreover, Poly(I:C) modulated the expression of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A quantitative proteomic analysis of MCs treated with MS-275, an HDAC1-3 inhibitor, unveiled altered expression of several proteins, including inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Treatment with MS-275 facilitated MMT reversal and inhibited the interferon signature, which was associated with reduced STAT1 phosphorylation. However, the modulation of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production was not univocal, as IL-6 and CXCL8 were augmented while TNF-α and CXCL10 were decreased. Collectively, our findings underline the significance of viral infections in acquiring a mesenchymal-like phenotype by MCs and the potential consequences of virus-associated peritonitis episodes for PD patients. The observed promotion of MMT reversal and interferon response inhibition by an HDAC1-3 inhibitor, albeit without a general impact on inflammatory cytokine production, has translational implications deserving further analysis.</p>

## Odorant binding protein 18 increases the pathogen resistance of the imported willow leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora

date: 2024-02-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Insect odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are a class of small molecular weight soluble proteins. In the past few years, OBPs had been found to work as carriers of ligands and play a crucial role in olfaction and various other physiological processes, like immunity. A subset of insect OBPs had been found to be expressed differently and play a function in immunity of fungal infection. However, there are few studies on the role of OBPs in immunity of bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To identify the immune-related OBPs of <italic>Plagiodera versicolora</italic> after infected by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, we determined the mortality of <italic>P. versicolora</italic> to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and selected the time point of 50% mortality of larvae to collect samples for RNA-seq. RNAi technology was used to investigate the function of immune-related OBPs after <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RNA-seq data shows that <italic>PverOBP18</italic> gene significantly up-regulated by 1.8-fold and further RT-qPCR affirmed its expression. Developmental expression profile showed that the expression of <italic>PverOBP18</italic> was highest in the pupae, followed by the female adults, and lower in the 1st-3rd larvae and male adults with lowest in eggs. Tissue expression profiling showed that <italic>PverOBP18</italic> was dominantly expressed in the epidermis.

## Fluoroquinolone resistance in complicated urinary tract infections: association with the increased occurrence and diversity of Escherichia coli of clonal complex 131, together with ST1193

date: 2024-02-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are on3e of the leading causes of multidrug-resistance (MDR) spread and infection-related deaths. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is by far the main causative agent. We conducted a prospective study on complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) i) to monitor the high-risk clones that could be compromising the therapeutic management and ii) to compare the cUTI etiology with uncomplicated infections (uUTIs) occurring in the same period and health area.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>154 non-duplicated <italic>E. coli</italic> recovered from cUTIs in 2020 at the Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (Spain) constituted the study collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Most cUTI isolates belonged to phylogroup B2 (72.1%) and met the uropathogenic (UPEC) status (69.5%) (≥3 of <italic>chuA</italic>, <italic>fyuA</italic>, <italic>vat</italic>, and <italic>yfcV</italic> genes). MDR was exhibited by 35.7% of the isolates, similarly to data observed in the uUTI collection. A significant difference observed in cUTI was the higher level of fluoroquinolone resistance (FQR) (47.4%), where the pandemic clonal groups B2-CC131 and B2-ST1193 (CH14-64) comprised 28% of the 154 <italic>E. coli</italic>, representing 52.1% of the FQR isolates. Other prevalent FQR clones were D-ST69 (CH35-27), D-ST405 (CH37-27), and B2-ST429 (CH40-20) (three isolates each). We uncovered an increased genetic and genomic diversity of the CC131: 10 different virotypes, 8 clonotypes (CH), and 2 STs. The presence of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub> was determined in 12 (7.8%) isolates (all CC131), which showed 10 different core genome (cg)STs and 2 <italic>fim</italic>H types (<italic>fim</italic>H30 and <italic>fim</italic>H602) but the same set of chromosomal mutations conferring FQR (<italic>gyrA</italic> p.S83L, <italic>gyrA</italic> p.D87N, <italic>parC</italic> p.S80I, <italic>parC</italic> p.E84V, and <italic>parE</italic> p.I529L). In addition, the plasmidome analysis revealed 10 different IncF formulae in CC131 genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We proved here that non-lactose fermenting screening, together with the detection of O25b (<italic>rfb</italic>O25b), H4 (<italic>fliC<sub>H4</sub></italic>), and H5 (<italic>fliC<sub>H5</sub></italic>) genes, and phylogroup and clonotyping assignation, is a reasonable approach that can be easily implemented for the surveillance of emerging high-risk clones associated with FQR spread in cUTIs, such as the uncommonly reported O25b:H4-B2-ST9126-CC131 (CH1267-30). Since <italic>E. coli</italic> CC131 and ST1193 are also involved in the community uUTIs of this health area, interventions to eradicate these MDR clones, along with surveillance for other emerging ones, are essential for antibiotic use optimization programs.</p></sec>

## Solid organ transplantation and gut microbiota: a review of the potential immunomodulatory properties of short-chain fatty acids in graft maintenance

date: 2024-02-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Transplantation is the treatment of choice for several end-stage organ defects: it considerably improves patient survival and quality of life. However, post-transplant recipients may experience episodes of rejection that can favor or ultimately lead to graft loss. Graft maintenance requires a complex and life-long immunosuppressive treatment. Different immunosuppressive drugs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, calcineurin inhibitors, glucocorticoids, biological immunosuppressive agents, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and antiproliferative or antimetabolic agents) are used in combination to mitigate the immune response against the allograft. Unfortunately, the use of these antirejection agents may lead to opportunistic infections, metabolic (<italic>e.g.</italic>, post-transplant diabetes mellitus) or cardiovascular (<italic>e.g.</italic>, arterial hypertension) disorders, cancer (<italic>e.g.</italic>, non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and other adverse effects. Lately, immunosuppressive drugs have also been associated with gut microbiome alterations, known as dysbiosis, and were shown to affect gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production. SCFA play a key immunomodulatory role in physiological conditions, and their impairment in transplant patients could partly counterbalance the effect of immunosuppressive drugs leading to the activation of deleterious pathways and graft rejection. In this review, we will first present an overview of the mechanisms of graft rejection that are prevented by the immunosuppressive protocol. Next, we will explain the dynamic changes of the gut microbiota during transplantation, focusing on SCFA. Finally, we will describe the known functions of SCFA in regulating immune-inflammatory reactions and discuss the impact of SCFA impairment in immunosuppressive drug treated patients.</p>

## PqsA mutation-mediated enhancement of phage-mediated combat against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

date: 2024-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Phage therapy is a potential approach in the biocontrol of foodborne pathogens. However, the emergence of phage resistance and the narrow host range of most phage isolates continue to limit the antimicrobial efficacy of phages. Here, we investigated the potential of the <italic>pqsA</italic> gene, encoding the anthranilate-CoA ligase enzyme, as an adjuvant for phage therapy. The knockout of the <italic>pqsA</italic> gene significantly enhanced the bactericidal effect of phages vB_Pae_QDWS and vB_Pae_S1 against <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Under phage infection pressure, the growth of the PaΔ<italic>pqsA</italic> was significantly inhibited within 8 h compared to the wild-type PAO1. Furthermore, we found that altering phage adsorption is not how PaΔ<italic>pqsA</italic> responds to phage infection. Although <italic>pqsA</italic> represents a promising target for enhancing phage killing, it may not be applicable to all phages, such as types vB_Pae_W3 and vB_Pae_TR. Our findings provide new material reserves for the future design of novel phage-based therapeutic strategies.</p>

## Plasmid-encoded gene duplications of extended-spectrum β-lactamases in clinical bacterial isolates

date: 2024-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is an urgent and alarming One Health problem. This study aimed to investigate duplications of plasmid-encoded ESBL genes and their impact on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes in clinical and screening isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Multi-drug-resistant bacteria from hospitalized patients were collected during routine clinical surveillance from January 2022 to June 2023, and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined. Genotypes were extracted from long-read whole-genome sequencing data. Furthermore, plasmids and other mobile genetic elements associated with ESBL genes were characterized, and the ESBL genes were correlated to ceftazidime minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, we identified four cases of plasmid-encoded ESBL gene duplications that match four genetically similar plasmids during the 18-month surveillance period: five <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and three <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> isolates. As the ESBL genes were part of transposable elements, the surrounding sequence regions were duplicated as well. In-depth analysis revealed insertion sequence (IS)-mediated transposition mechanisms. Isolates with duplicated ESBL genes exhibited a higher MIC for ceftazidime in comparison to isolates with a single gene copy (3–256 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.5–32 mg/L, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ESBL gene duplications led to an increased phenotypic resistance against ceftazidime. Our data suggest that ESBL gene duplications by an IS-mediated transposition are a relevant mechanism for how AMR develops in the clinical setting and is part of the microevolution of plasmids.</p></sec>

## Distinct fungal microbiomes of two Thai commercial stingless bee species, Lepidotrigona terminata and Tetragonula pagdeni suggest a possible niche separation in a shared habitat

date: 2024-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Stingless bees, a social corbiculate bee member, play a crucial role in providing pollination services. Despite their importance, the structure of their microbiome, particularly the fungal communities, remains poorly understood. This study presents an initial characterization of the fungal community associated with two Thai commercial stingless bee species, <italic>Lepidotrigona terminata</italic> (Smith) and <italic>Tetragonula pagdeni</italic> (Schwarz) from Chiang Mai, Thailand. Utilizing ITS amplicon sequencing, we identified distinct fungal microbiomes in these two species. Notably, fungi from the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mucoromycota, Mortierellomycota, and Rozellomycota were present. The most dominant genera, which varied significantly between species, included <italic>Candida</italic> and <italic>Starmerella</italic>. Additionally, several key enzymes associated with energy metabolism, structural strength, and host defense reactions, such as adenosine triphosphatase, alcohol dehydrogenase, <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase, chitinase, and peptidylprolyl isomerase, were predicted. Our findings not only augment the limited knowledge of the fungal microbiome in Thai commercial stingless bees but also provide insights for their sustainable management through understanding their microbiome.</p>

## Droplet digital PCR as alternative to microbiological culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex detection in bovine lymph node tissue samples

date: 2024-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTC) remains a significant concern for public health. Direct real-time PCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) are proposed as alternative tools to enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency. This study aims to assess the diagnostic performance of a ddPCR assay targeting IS<italic>6110</italic> for the detection of MTC DNA in both microbiological culture and fresh lymph node (LN) tissue samples obtained from cattle, in comparison with the established reference standard, the microbiological culture followed by real-time PCR. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The fresh LNs (N=100) were collected each from a different cattle carcass at the slaughterhouse. The limit of detection of ddPCR-IS<italic>6110</italic> was set to 101 copies per 20 μl reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>DdPCR-IS<italic>6110</italic> detected 44 out of 49 reference-standard positive samples and yielded negative results in 47 out of 51 reference-standard negative samples, resulting in adjusted sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of 90.76% [95% confidence interval (CI): 82.58 - 98.96%)], and 100% (95% CI: 100%) respectively. The estimated adjusted false negative rate (FNR) was 9.23% (95% CI: 1.04 - 17.42%) and the false positive rate (FPR) was 0% (95% CI: 0%). When directly applied from fresh bovine LN tissues, ddPCR-IS6110 identified 47 out of 49 reference-standard positive samples as ddPCR-IS6110-positive and 42 out of 51 reference-standard negative samples as ddPCR-IS<italic>6110</italic>-negative, resulting in adjusted Se and Sp values of 94.80% [95% (CI): 88.52 - 100%] and 100% (95% CI: 100%), respectively. The adjusted FNR was 5.20% (95% CI: 0 - 11.50%) and the FPR was 0% (95% CI: 0%).

## Strategies of Helicobacter pylori in evading host innate and adaptive immunity: insights and prospects for therapeutic targeting

date: 2024-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>) is the predominant pathogen causing chronic gastric mucosal infections globally. During the period from 2011 to 2022, the global prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was estimated at 43.1%, while in China, it was slightly higher at approximately 44.2%. Persistent colonization by <italic>H. pylori</italic> can lead to gastritis, peptic ulcers, and malignancies such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas and gastric adenocarcinomas. Despite eliciting robust immune responses from the host, <italic>H. pylori</italic> thrives in the gastric mucosa by modulating host immunity, particularly by altering the functions of innate and adaptive immune cells, and dampening inflammatory responses adverse to its survival, posing challenges to clinical management. The interaction between <italic>H. pylori</italic> and host immune defenses is intricate, involving evasion of host recognition by modifying surface molecules, manipulating macrophage functionality, and modulating T cell responses to evade immune surveillance. This review analyzes the immunopathogenic and immune evasion mechanisms of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, underscoring the importance of identifying new therapeutic targets and developing effective treatment strategies, and discusses how the development of vaccines against <italic>H. pylori</italic> offers new hope for eradicating such infections.</p>

## A dynamic nomogram to predict invasive fungal super-infection during healthcare-associated bacterial infection in intensive care unit patients: an ambispective cohort study in China

date: 2024-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Invasive fungal super-infection (IFSI) is an added diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. We aimed to develop and assess a nomogram of IFSI in patients with healthcare-associated bacterial infection (HABI).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An ambispective cohort study was conducted in ICU patients with HABI from a tertiary hospital of China. Predictors of IFSI were selected by both the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and the two-way stepwise method. The predictive performance of two models built by logistic regression was internal-validated and compared. Then external validity was assessed and a web-based nomogram was deployed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between Jan 1, 2019 and June 30, 2023, 12,305 patients with HABI were screened in 14 ICUs, of whom 372 (3.0%) developed IFSI. Among the fungal strains causing IFSI, the most common was C.albicans (34.7%) with a decreasing proportion, followed by C.tropicalis (30.9%), A.fumigatus (13.9%) and C.glabrata (10.1%) with increasing proportions year by year. Compared with LASSO-model that included five predictors (combination of priority antimicrobials, immunosuppressant, MDRO, aCCI and S.aureus), the discriminability of stepwise-model was improved by 6.8% after adding two more predictors of COVID-19 and microbiological test before antibiotics use (P&lt;0.01).And the stepwise-model showed similar discriminability in the derivation (the area under curve, AUC=0.87) and external validation cohorts (AUC=0.84, P=0.46). No significant gaps existed between the proportion of actual diagnosed IFSI and the frequency of IFSI predicted by both two models in derivation cohort and by stepwise-model in external validation cohort (P=0.16, 0.30 and 0.35, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The incidence of IFSI in ICU patients with HABI appeared to be a temporal rising, and our externally validated nomogram will facilitate the development of targeted and timely prevention and control measures based on specific risks of IFSI.</p></sec>

## The Mla system and its role in maintaining outer membrane barrier function in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia

date: 2024-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> are ubiquitous Gram-negative bacteria found in both natural and clinical environments. It is a remarkably adaptable species capable of thriving in various environments, thanks to the plasticity of its genome and a diverse array of genes that encode a wide range of functions. Among these functions, one notable trait is its remarkable ability to resist various antimicrobial agents, primarily through mechanisms that regulate the diffusion across cell membranes. We have investigated the Mla ABC transport system of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>, which in other Gram-negative bacteria is known to transport phospholipids across the periplasm and is involved in maintaining outer membrane homeostasis. First, we structurally and functionally characterized the periplasmic substrate-binding protein MlaC, which determines the specificity of this system. The predicted structure of the <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> MlaC protein revealed a hydrophobic cavity of sufficient size to accommodate the phospholipids commonly found in this species. Moreover, recombinant MlaC produced heterologously demonstrated the ability to bind phospholipids. Gene knockout experiments in <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> K279a revealed that the Mla system is involved in baseline resistance to antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents, especially those with divalent-cation chelating activity. Co-culture experiments with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> also showed a significant contribution of this system to the cooperation between both species in the formation of polymicrobial biofilms. As suggested for other Gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms, this system emerges as an appealing target for potential combined antimicrobial therapies.</p>
