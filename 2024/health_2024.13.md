## Influenza A virus replicates productively in primary human kidney cells and induces factors and mechanisms related to regulated cell death and renal pathology observed in virus-infected patients

date: 2024-03-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can cause the often-lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of the lung. Concomitantly, acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequently noticed during IAV infection, correlating with an increased mortality. The aim of this study was to elucidate the interaction of IAV with human kidney cells and, thereby, to assess the mechanisms underlying IAV-mediated AKI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To investigate IAV effects on nephron cells we performed infectivity assays with human IAV, as well as with human isolates of either low or highly pathogenic avian IAV. Also, transcriptome and proteome analysis of IAV-infected primary human distal tubular kidney cells (DTC) was performed. Furthermore, the DTC transcriptome was compared to existing transcriptomic data from IAV-infected lung and trachea cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We demonstrate productive replication of all tested IAV strains on primary and immortalized nephron cells. Comparison of our transcriptome and proteome analysis of H1N1-type IAV-infected human primary distal tubular cells (DTC) with existing data from H1N1-type IAV-infected lung and primary trachea cells revealed enrichment of specific factors responsible for regulated cell death in primary DTC, which could be targeted by specific inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>IAV not only infects, but also productively replicates on different human nephron cells. Importantly, multi-omics analysis revealed regulated cell death as potential contributing factor for the clinically observed kidney pathology in influenza.</p></sec>

## Inhibition of macrophage infectivity potentiator in Burkholderia pseudomallei suppresses pro-inflammatory responses in murine macrophages

date: 2024-03-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>, is a disease endemic in many tropical countries globally. Clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal septicemia, and thus the outcome of infection can depend on the host immune responses. The aims of this study were to firstly, characterize the macrophage immune response to <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and secondly, to determine whether the immune response was modified in the presence of novel inhibitors targeting the virulence factor, the macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip) protein. We hypothesized that inhibition of Mip in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> would disarm the bacteria and result in a host beneficial immune response.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Murine macrophage J774A.1 cells were infected with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> K96243 in the presence of small-molecule inhibitors targeting the Mip protein. RNA-sequencing was performed on infected cells four hours post-infection. Secreted cytokines and lactose dehydrogenase were measured in cell culture supernatants 24 hours post-infection. Viable, intracellular <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in macrophages were also enumerated 24 hours post-infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Global transcriptional profiling of macrophages infected with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> by RNA-seq demonstrated upregulation of immune-associated genes, in particular a significant enrichment of genes in the TNF signaling pathway. Treatment of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>-infected macrophages with the Mip inhibitor, AN_CH_37 resulted in a 5.3-fold reduction of <italic>il1b</italic> when compared to cells treated with DMSO, which the inhibitors were solubilized in. A statistically significant reduction in IL-1β levels in culture supernatants was seen 24 hours post-infection with AN_CH_37, as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-6 and TNF-α. Treatment with AN_CH_37 also reduced the survival of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in macrophages after 24 hours which was accompanied by a significant reduction in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>-induced cytotoxicity as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These data highlight the potential to utilize Mip inhibitors in reducing potentially harmful pro-inflammatory responses resulting from <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infection in macrophages. This could be of significance since overstimulation of pro-inflammatory responses can result in immunopathology, tissue damage and septic shock.</p></sec>

## Clinical performance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing for diagnosis of invasive fungal disease after hematopoietic cell transplant

date: 2024-03-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Timely diagnosis and appropriate antifungal therapy are critical for improving the prognosis of patients with invasive fungal disease (IFD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We evaluated the performance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and conventional microbiological testing (CMT), as well as the diagnosis, therapeutic management, and outcomes of IFD after HSCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively studied 189 patients who underwent HSCT and were considered at risk for IFD. In total, 46 patients with IFD were enrolled in this study. The IFD consensus was followed for classifying IFD incidents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty-six patients were diagnosed with proven/probable (n = 12), possible (n = 27), and undefined (n = 7) IFD. <italic>Aspergillus</italic> was the most commonly detected fungal genus. <italic>Mucormycosis</italic> was found in 15 patients; two had <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, and one had <italic>Candida</italic> infections. Compared to CMT, mNGS significantly reduced the time required to identify pathogens (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0016). mNGS had a much higher sensitivity than CMT (84.78% vs. 36.96%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). A total of 76.09% of patients received antifungal prophylaxis during fungal infections. All <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infections occurred later than 100 days after transplantation. Among patients with <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection, 71.43% occurred following sulfonamide withdrawal, and subsequent treatment with sulfonamide alone or in combination with other drugs was effective. Based on the empirical antifungal treatment, the dosages, modes of administration, frequency of administration, or antifungal of 55.26% of the patients were changed according to the mNGS results. The 4-year overall survival rate of patients diagnosed with IFD after transplantation was 71.55% (95% CI, 55.18%–85.82%). Hypoproteinemia and corticosteroid use are independent risk factors for IFD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>mNGS, which has a high sensitivity and a short detection time, aids in the diagnosis and prognosis of pathogenic fungi. As a powerful technology, mNGS can influence treatment decisions in patients with IFD following HSCT.</p></sec>

## Identification of kinase modulators as host-directed therapeutics against intracellular methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

date: 2024-03-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains, especially methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), poses a threat to successful antibiotic treatment. Unsuccessful attempts to develop a vaccine and rising resistance to last-resort antibiotics urge the need for alternative treatments. Host-directed therapy (HDT) targeting critical intracellular stages of <italic>S. aureus</italic> emerges as a promising alternative, potentially acting synergistically with antibiotics and reducing the risk of <italic>de novo</italic> drug resistance. We assessed 201 ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors from Published Kinase Inhibitor Sets (PKIS1 and PKIS2) against intracellular MRSA. Seventeen hit compounds were identified, of which the two most effective and well-tolerated hit compounds (i.e., GW633459A and GW296115X) were selected for further analysis. The compounds did not affect planktonic bacterial cultures, while they were active in a range of human cell lines of cervical, skin, lung, breast and monocyte origin, confirming their host-directed mechanisms. GW633459A, structurally related to lapatinib, exhibited an HDT effect on intracellular MRSA independently of its known human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/(HER) kinase family targets. GW296115X activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thereby enhancing bacterial degradation via autophagy. Finally, GW296115X not only reduced MRSA growth in human cells but also improved the survival rates of MRSA-infected zebrafish embryos, highlighting its potential as HDT.</p>

## Minor envelope proteins from GP2a to GP4 contribute to the spread pattern and yield of type 2 PRRSV in MARC-145 cells

date: 2024-03-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>In China, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccines are widely used. These vaccines, which contain inactivated and live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), are produced by MARC-145 cells derived from the monkey kidney cell line. However, some PRRSV strains in MARC-145 cells have a low yield. Here, we used two type 2 PRRSV strains (CH-1R and HuN4) to identify the genes responsible for virus yield in MARC-145 cells. Our findings indicate that the two viruses have different spread patterns, which ultimately determine their yield. By replacing the viral envelope genes with a reverse genetics system, we discovered that the minor envelope proteins, from GP2a to GP4, play a crucial role in determining the spread pattern and yield of type 2 PRRSV in MARC-145 cells. The cell-free transmission pattern of type 2 PRRSV appears to be more efficient than the cell-to-cell transmission pattern. Overall, these findings suggest that GP2a to GP4 contributes to the spread pattern and yield of type 2 PRRSV.</p>
