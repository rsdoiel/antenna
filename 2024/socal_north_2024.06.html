<p><em>This post was updated Feb. 4 at 10:58 p.m.</em> Painted in rose
gold, the Grammys were a night for the vibrance of women.  Dangling from
a cube and in a sultry mesh ensemble, Dua Lipa ushered in the 66th
annual Grammy Awards ceremony with a reflective disco-pop mashup
including “Training Season,” “Houdini” and “Dance the Night.” Quipping
that the economy surrounding Taylor Swift’s tables has blossomed, Trevor
Noah warmed up the crowd with feel-good comedy, while also highlighting
notable achievements in terms of diversity, including the majority of
female nominees for the Album Of The Year category.  Trilling that all
nominees for the category are women, Mariah Carey presented Miley Cyrus
with the Best Pop Solo Performance award for “Flowers.” After Luke
Combs’ duet of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car,” Karol G won her first Grammy
Award, Best Música Urbana Album, for “Mañana Será Bonito.” Also winning
her first Grammy, Lainey Wilson won Best Country Album for “Bell Bottom
Country.” SZA then set the stage aflame for the second performance of
the night with “Snooze” and a gritty rendition of “Kill Bill,”
accentuated with sword-fighting.   Afterward, Billie Eilish serenaded
the Crypto.com Arena with an airy, orchestral rendition of “What Was I
Made For?” Performing “Flowers” live on television for the first time,
Miley Cyrus relished the milestone with a fierce stage presence and her
infamous adlibs.</p>
